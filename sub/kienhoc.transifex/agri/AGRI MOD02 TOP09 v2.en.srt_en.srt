2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,889
We have seen in previous topics
that although the

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,850
production and consumption of
animal products for food is

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,750
considerably less than that of
plant products, nevertheless,

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,540
the rate of production
of animal products

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,799
is increasing rapidly.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,160
There's a wide variety of
different types of animals

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,750
found around the world, and an
equally wide variety in the

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,380
management systems that operate
on those farms.

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,560
But there are a few fundamental
principles that

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,380
are common to most of those
systems, and I just want to

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,090
talk about three of those
basic principles.

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,890
Now the first of these
principles is that most

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,410
livestock production systems
involve the reproduction of

15
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,800
the animals and the production
of young stock.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,239
There might be two
reasons for this.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,180
The first is that we might be
going to use the young stock

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,440
or rear them, as we see here
with these lambs, to fatten

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,450
them up and slaughter
them for meat.

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,960
Another reason for reproduction
might be that

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,389
it's a necessary first step to
the production of milk in

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,270
animals such as dairy cows.

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,729
Now, whatever the reason, in
order to produce young stock,

24
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,920
the mothers have to get
pregnant, and that can happen

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,230
in, surprisingly, in a variety
of ways on farms.

26
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,590
So some farms, many farms
perhaps, this occurs through

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,540
the natural mating of male
and female animals.

28
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,520
But in other farms, this may
occur through artificial

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,250
insemination.

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,030
The choice of which of those
methods is used depends on the

31
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,760
type of animals and the farming
operation, as we'll

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,940
see later on in the course.

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,520
Now the second sort of
fundamental principle is that

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,320
the efficiencies of conversion
of plant protein to animal

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,500
protein varies between different
classes of animals.

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,630
Now, we've already seen this in
previous topics, and we've

37
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,940
demonstrated that for beef
cattle, such as these we see

38
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,300
here, the conversion
efficiency is

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,860
about seven to one.

40
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,550
In other words, what that means
is we've got to feed

41
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,970
those beef cattle seven
kilogrammes of plant protein

42
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,930
to produce one kilogramme
of animal protein.

43
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,690
But not all animals are
that inefficient.

44
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,390
And so, for example, the pigs
that we see here have a much

45
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,899
better conversion rate.

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,350
So they only need to be fed
about four kilogrammes of

47
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:57,450
plant matter to produce one
kilogramme of animal protein.

48
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,049
Other classes are even
more efficient.

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,385
So poultry, for example, have
a conversion efficiency of a

50
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:04,299
bit over two.

51
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,780
So you only need to feed a bit
more than two kilogrammes of

52
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,940
plant protein to get the
kilogramme of animal protein.

53
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,690
And interestingly, freshwater
fish like carp are even more

54
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,040
efficient, and you need to feed
slightly less than two

55
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,400
kilogrammes of plant material
to those sorts of animals in

56
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,530
order to get your kilogramme
of animal protein.

57
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,580
But whatever the conversion
efficiency is, the success to

58
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,370
all livestock production
is good nutrition.

59
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,630
It's often said in the real
estate world that the three

60
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,920
rules of real estate
are location,

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,149
location, and location.

62
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,550
And in farming, or animal
farming anyway, the three

63
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,480
rules are nutrition, nutrition,
and nutrition.

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,119
The third point I want to
discuss in this topic is the

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,930
way we feed and house animals,
because there is a range of

66
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,410
options for that.

67
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,090
Basically it comes down
to two choices--

68
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,170
do we take the animal to the
feed, as we see here with this

69
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,260
dairy cow grazing the pasture,
or do we take the feed to the

70
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,620
animal, which we see here, where
we've got very similar

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,370
dairy cows, but these are now
being fed in a feedlot.

72
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,900
And so we are harvesting
the food and

73
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,080
taking it to the animals.

74
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,099
Now, there are advantages and
disadvantages for both of

75
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,160
those systems.

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,860
So for the animals in the
feedlot, the advantage is that

77
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,620
we have very, very close control
over exactly what the

78
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,560
animals are eating and how
much they're eating.

79
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,780
And so as a consequence of that,
we can achieve very high

80
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,650
production levels.

81
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,359
The downside of that sort of
system is that there's a whole

82
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,100
lot of cost involved in it,
because we have to grow the

83
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,040
feed, but then not only that,
we have to harvest it, store

84
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,340
it, transport it, and then have
all the infrastructure of

85
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,729
the feedlot to feed it out.

86
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,100
So that adds cost
and uses energy.

87
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,000
The advantage of the pasture
feed system, where we are

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,090
taking the animals to the
pasture, is that the animal

89
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,840
does all the harvesting for
us, which is great.

90
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,140
The disadvantage is that it's a
bit less flexible, and it's

91
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,380
a bit more difficult to control
exactly what the

92
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,610
animal is going to eat.

93
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,470
In systems like this, we have
to be very careful that we

94
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,920
match what the animal needs with
what is actually in the

95
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,620
pasture, and that takes a lot
of skill, which we'll talk

96
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,180
about in later topics.

97
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,540
But at this stage, in summary,
what we'd say is that there

98
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,650
are a few fundamental principles
that underline all

99
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,724
animal production systems, and
I think the most important of

100
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:53,510
those is that nutrition,
nutrition, nutrition.

101
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,990
In the next topic, we're going
to go on and look at a

102
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,450
specific type of an
animal farm--

103
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,700
a dairy farm.

104
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,625
