00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,160
Welcome to this first topic
of this new module.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,980
In this topic, we're going to
be looking at what makes

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,690
plants grow.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,500
Now, you've seen this
diagram before.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,470
What it shows is the
contribution that different

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,770
food groups make to the average

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,939
global food energy intake.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,730
And I put it up again just to
reinforce that this energy

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,040
intake in the average global
diet is absolutely dominated

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,970
by plants--

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,120
plant products.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,440
And even the energy that comes
from meat comes from animals

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,580
that have been fed on plants.

15
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,410
So the take-home message is that
plants are at the heart

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,730
of agriculture.

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,500
And if we're going to understand
have farms work,

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,040
and agriculture, in the 21st
century, we have to understand

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,060
how plants grow.

20
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,810
Now, this is a picture
of a cow.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,170
It's a very nice cow.

22
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,970
But in this topic, I'm not
really interested in the cow.

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,440
But I certainly am interested
in the pasture.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,970


25
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,679
I'm interested in how quickly
this pasture is growing, how

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,050
it grew before the cow arrived,
and, equally, how

27
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,759
quickly is it going to grow
again when she leaves.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,300
Because she's going to come back
here in about three weeks

29
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,179
time, and I hope that she's
going to have enough to eat.

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,440
Now, to understand how plants
grow, we look at what factors

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,860
affect their growth.

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,010
And we find that there are four
essential requirements

33
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,010
for growing plants.

34
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,610
They are energy from the
sunlight, carbon dioxide from

35
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,740
the atmosphere, water from
the soil, and nutrients.

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,660
Now, what we're going to do is
just focus, to start with, on

37
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,889
the top three.

38
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,830
And what we see is that
plants take up water

39
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,100
through their roots.

40
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,720
They take carbon dioxide in
through their leaves.

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,990
And using the energy of the sun,
through a process that's

42
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,300
called photosynthesis, they
convert that into

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,330
carbohydrates, which are the
building blocks of all plants.

44
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,480
This miraculous process is the
basis of all life on Earth.

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,679
It's the way that nature
captures the energy of the

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,910
sun, so that we can use
it at a later date.

47
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,270
And we use it in a myriad of
different ways that range from

48
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,140
the petrol in our car to the
food that we eat that gives us

49
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,940
the energy to run
or play sport.

50
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,890
Now, I'm going to come back to
nutrients in just a second.

51
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,160
But I just want to assume, for
the moment, that we've got

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,770
enough nutrients to
growth plants.

53
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,150
And if that is the case, then we
can look at the top three.

54
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,510
And what we find is that if
we've got all three of those

55
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,649
present in good quantities,
then plants tend to grow

56
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,930
really, really well.

57
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,950
If we look at carbon dioxide, we
find that the concentration

58
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,549
of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere doesn't change, in

59
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,860
the short term, very much from
place to place around the

60
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,640
world or from season
to season.

61
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,720
So the concentration of carbon
dioxide doesn't have a huge

62
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,960
impact on plant growth.

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,230
But the other two, the energy
from the sun and the water

64
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,829
from the soil, do have
huge impacts.

65
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,450
The availability of sunlight
explains the differences in

66
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,690
growth that we see from
season to season.

67
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,859
And it also explains the
differences that we see as we

68
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,670
move from polar regions up
towards the tropics.

69
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,899
Incidentally, it also explains
why it's so difficult to grow

70
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,440
a good lawn under the tree
in your backyard.

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,030
And I'm sure we all are aware
of the huge importance of

72
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,390
water in determining
plant growth.

73
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,279
That is so important that it's
going to be the subject of two

74
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,650
complete topics later
on in this course.

75
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,530
So now let's come and have a
look at those nutrients.

76
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,909
And let's first of all
just go back to

77
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,930
our cow and her pasture.

78
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,770
If we were look at this pasture
in detail for a whole

79
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,979
year and measure how much it had
grown and analyse all that

80
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,710
growth for the chemical elements
that it contains,

81
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,489
this is what we would find.

82
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,430
Now, this is a really important
table, and we're

83
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,450
going to see it several times
during this module.

84
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,330
What it shows is the amount
of several essential plant

85
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,130
nutrients, critical for plant
growth, the amounts that would

86
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,010
be taken up by that pasture if
it was producing about 15,000

87
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,890
kilogrammes of dry matter
per hectare per year.

88
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,169
Now, that's about the amount
that a pasture that looks like

89
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,990
that in New Zealand
would be growing.

90
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,510
And I want you to take two
points away from this table at

91
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,900
this stage.

92
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,020
The first is that there's a huge
range in the quantities

93
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,310
of different nutrients.

94
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,600
So from nitrogen, we need
712 kilogrammes.

95
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,340
That's almost a tonne.

96
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,265
But for molybdenum, we only
need 0.005 kilogrammes.

97
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:37,770
Now, that is 5 grammes--

98
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,719
very, very small.

99
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,305
So there's this huge range in
the quantities of nutrients

100
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:46,480
that are taken up.

101
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,800
And we really have to understand
that, because

102
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,260
understanding it will enable us
to provide fertilisers and

103
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,730
manage the postures in a way
that will produce as much as

104
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,910
they possibly can.

105
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,300
And the final point I want to
make is that although we've

106
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:08,380
got this huge difference of 700
down 0.005, all of those

107
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,659
elements are essential
for plant growth.

108
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,960
If we don't have any one of
them, the plants aren't going

109
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,440
to grow very well at all.

110
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,406
It's the same as us.

111
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:23,870
We need protein and we need
vitamin C. We need to eat

112
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,890
quite a lot of protein, and we
need the very little vitamin

113
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,659
C. But no matter how much
protein we eat, if we don't

114
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,700
need that vitamin C, we
are going to get sick.

115
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,719
So in summary, I think we can
say that plants are at the

116
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,390
heart of agriculture.

117
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,180
And we have to understand how
plants grow if we're going to

118
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,810
understand why farmers farm
the way that they do.

119
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,000
Now, in the next topic, we're
going to have a look at how

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,670
climate can affect the
agricultural systems that

121
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,920
exist in different regions.

122
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,184
