00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,299
As agriculture's become more
industrialised over the years,

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,680
chemists have managed to invent
and then manufacture

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,920
chemicals that previously either
existed in nature in

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,400
very tiny amounts or didn't
exist in nature at all.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,290
Now, many of these chemicals
have apparently beneficial

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,919
effects for agriculture.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,210
Some good examples are
fertilisers or pesticides.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,560
Now, by using these chemicals
we have managed to alleviate

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,440
the hunger of perhaps hundreds
of millions of people.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,360
So that's all good.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,620
But at the same time we're
starting to realise now that

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,004
using these chemicals may have
some unintended consequences.

14
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:55,610


15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:04,230
Now, I've put here a photo of a
famous person who pioneered

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,380
our awareness of these
unintended consequences.

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,839
Her name is Rachel Carson and
in 1962 she published a book

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,900
called The Silent Spring.

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,140
This is probably the most famous
or the most notorious

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,990
environmental book
ever written.

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,009
It highlighted the unintended
consequences of agricultural

22
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,320
chemicals, most commonly DDT,
on the wider environment.

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,929
And particularly on native
animals and then particularly

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,800
again on native birds.

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:48,550
Now, the legacy of The Silent
Spring is hotly debated.

26
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,520
Many people regard Rachel Carson
as a pioneer of the

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,110
environmental movement.

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,590
And The Silent Spring was
a major catalyst in the

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,800
development of environmental
groups all around the

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,220
developed world in the
1970s, '80s and '90s.

31
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,609
But some people have a slightly
different view.

32
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,100
They point out that one of the
main roles of DDT was to

33
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,200
control the mosquito that
carries malaria.

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,660
And so they argue that the
effect of The Silent Spring

35
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,260
and the subsequent very tight
regulations that governments

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,070
put on the use of chemicals like
DDT may have caused the

37
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,090
death of perhaps tens of
millions of people through

38
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,860
malaria that might not
otherwise have died.

39
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,700
Now wherever the truth lies in
that debate, it's a really,

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,070
really good example of the
tensions that exist between

41
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,690
agriculture and the wider

42
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,460
environment in the 21st century.

43
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,940
Now, when we were talking about
chemicals like DDT, we

44
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,070
were talking about chemicals
that either don't exist in

45
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,590
nature at all or only exist
in tiny quantities.

46
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,710
But we realise now that because
of our agricultural

47
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,630
activities, some chemicals which
are always common in

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,329
agriculture can cause
problems.

49
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,380
And they cause problems when
we get too much of them.

50
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,570
So we've got an example here
of a situation where that

51
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,010
might have occurred.

52
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,859
It's a picture of an enormous
dairy farm feedlot in Arizona

53
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,380
in the United States.

54
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,010
Now, this feedlot will have a
huge number of dairy cows.

55
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,429
And they will all be excreting
dung and urine.

56
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,380
Now, in the early days feedlots,
all this excrement

57
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,519
caused huge problems.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,450
And it would be stock piled in
huge heaps and then had to be

59
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,769
disposed of.

60
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,560
These days in modern feedlots
like we see here there are

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,220
very sophisticated processes
for collecting, processing,

62
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,609
and distributing all of that
excrement so that it has a

63
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,480
minimal impact on
the environment.

64
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,700
But during the early days of
feedlots it was often thought

65
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,529
that this collection of dung and
urine was a major downside

66
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,659
to the whole concept
of a feedlot.

67
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,580
It was often felt that if cows
and sheep grazed naturally in

68
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,580
open pastures we wouldn't
have these problems.

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,310
But these days we are starting
to realise that that's not

70
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,210
necessarily the case.

71
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,060
Particularly when we've got
large numbers of animals

72
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,300
grazing outside in paddocks.

73
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,800
Because as we know, cows
tend to do this.

74
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,840
And they tend to create that.

75
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,650
And if we get large quantities
of that dung and urine being

76
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,919
deposited in paddocks, that
can cause problems.

77
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,000
So in summary, we recognise that
agricultural chemicals

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,650
have the potential to and
actually are conferring huge

79
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,260
benefits on the human population
and alleviating

80
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,840
hunger in millions if not
billions of people.

81
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,450
But at the same time we have to
recognise that there may be

82
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,140
unintended consequences.

83
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,820
We have to be aware of these and
we have to manage them in

84
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,080
a very responsible way.

85
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,130
Now, in the next topic we're
going to move on and explore

86
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,085
this in a little more detail.

87
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,810
And in particular focus
on water quality.

88
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,624
