00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,360
In this topic, we're going to be
looking at how climate can

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,869
affect farming systems and
the way they're managed.

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,160
Now does it seem to you that
farmers are always complaining

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,760
about the weather?

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,560
They're never happy.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,979
You know what it's like.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,170
It's been a hot, dry summer, and
the kids are finally out

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,140
of school, and you've gone away
on a camping holiday.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,720
On the very first night, you
get an inch of rain, and

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,220
everything gets wet.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,900
And while you're trying to dry
everything out, you turn on

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,949
the news, and they've got the
local farmer's rep on.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,600
And he's saying, &quot;Well, it was
a useful rain, but we need a

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,870
lot more before the drought
has broken.&quot; It certainly

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,680
occurred to me a few times.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,450
Well, there is a reason for
that, and this is that climate

18
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:05,090
is hugely important to farmers
and the way they're operating.

19
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,680
Now you've enrolled in this
course, and so I presume you

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,980
are interested in agriculture.

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,552
So how much do you know about
the climate where you live?

22
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:22,360
Have a think about what is the
average annual rainfall in

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,930
millimetres in the location
where you live.

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,980
And if you can do that, have a
think about what are the two

25
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,470
wettest months in that location
on average over a

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,050
number of years.

27
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,190
And what are the two
driest months?

28
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,360


29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,000
And then when we look at those
driest months, how consistent

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,540
is that from year to year?

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,690
Are those months always dry,
or in some years do you get

32
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,770
quite a lot or rain
in those months?

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,460
Now all of those factors are
going to have a huge effect on

34
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,829
the types of farm that you see
in your region when you go out

35
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,560
for a drive and the way that
those farms are managed.

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,380
So let me give you an example.

37
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,519
I've got here a graph of the
monthly rainfall for two

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,730
locations in New Zealand.

39
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:28,840
They are Hamilton, which is in
the pink colours, and Napier,

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,130
which are in the blue colours.

41
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,829
Now Hamilton is in the centre
of the North Island of New

42
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,730
Zealand, and Napier is on the
east coast of the North Island

43
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,390
of New Zealand.

44
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,839
They're only perhaps 150
kilometres apart.

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,100
We can see clearly that the
annual rainfall in Napier is

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,799
much lower than the annual
rainfall in Hamilton, but in

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,840
winter there isn't
much difference.

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,700
The main difference occurs
in the spring and

49
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,310
early summer period.

50
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,020
Now those two contrasting
rainfall patterns have a huge

51
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,550
impact on the farms
in those areas and

52
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,040
the way they're managed.

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,570
So Hamilton in the pink is a
centre of dairying in New

54
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,670
Zealand, highly productive dairy
farms that do not need

55
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,510
irrigation.

56
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,644
And they don't eat irrigation
because we can see that all

57
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:25,550
the way across here, we get
reasonably consistent rainfall

58
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,430
which will keep the pastures we
saw in the previous topic

59
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,500
growing actively all
through the year.

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,270
In contrast, you'll drive a long
way around the area of

61
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,650
Napier to see a dairy farm that
doesn't have irrigation

62
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,420
because you simply cannot grow
enough grass through that

63
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,109
crucial spring, summer period
without irrigation because

64
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,540
there just isn't enough water.

65
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,140
But on the other hand, there are
some wonderful vineyards

66
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,980
in Napier and producing
fantastic wines.

67
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,079
And the reason for that
is the hot, dry

68
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,850
summers with little rain.

69
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,940
Now let's consider temperature,
and once again I

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,030
want you to think about
your region.

71
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,589
Have a think about whether you
live in a climate that we

72
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,990
would normally describe as being
hot or perhaps one that

73
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:28,220
is cool, and then during the
year, the big differences

74
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,490
between your hottest months
and your coldest months.

75
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,560
Or is the temperature reasonably
uniform all the

76
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,770
year round?

77
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,370
And perhaps if you
have really cold

78
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,650
winters, do you have frosts?

79
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,880
And if you do have frosts, when
would usually be the last

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,590
one that you had?

81
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,390
Now all of these issues around
temperature do affect the

82
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,349
types of farms, and
more particularly

83
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,240
the way they're managed.

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,640
And I just have one example
of that here.

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,930
This is a picture
of a vineyard in

86
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,430
Marlborough in New Zealand.

87
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,340
And if you look closely, you can
see a whole range of white

88
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,719
posts that are in
fact windmills.

89
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,260
Now these are the opposite
of normal windmills.

90
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,420
Most windmills use the
wind to pump water.

91
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,250
But in this case, we're
not doing that.

92
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,290
We are turning the windmills
to stir the air around in

93
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,340
situations or under conditions
when it looks like there's

94
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,080
going to be a frost at the
crucial time of the year.

95
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,270
Just another example of how
management of these systems is

96
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,770
affected by the climate.

97
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:49,000
So in summary, we can say that
climate has a huge impact on

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,300
farming systems.

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,460
And if we go back to what we
talked about earlier in this

100
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,940
topic, have a think about
what the climate is

101
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,270
like in your region.

102
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,890
See if you can answer the
questions that I posed, and

103
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,219
then go on and have a look, and
see whether that explains

104
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,710
the sort of farms you see in
your area and perhaps even the

105
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,900
way they're managed.

106
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,820
Now in the next topic, we're
going on to study soils and

107
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,920
the role they play in
farming systems.

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,919
