https://youtu.be/xvCrNZ3QmFs

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,170
So how do nutrients like
nitrogen and phosphorus get

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,850
from the land into the waterways
and cause all the

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,220
problems we talked about
in the last topic?

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,340
Well, the most obvious way of
them getting there is for us

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,650
to put them there, and the way
we put them it would be if we

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,650
put them there when we're
applying fertiliser.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,070
Now, when we're applying
fertiliser on land, such as we

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,320
see here, it's relatively easy
for us to avoid putting them

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,060
in rivers and streams as long
as we are aware that we

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,570
shouldn't be doing it.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,420
But sometimes when we're
applying fertiliser by plane,

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,570
as it's flying across the
countryside, it's more

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,730
difficult to avoid that
fertiliser sometimes landing

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,400
in rivers and streams.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,560
Now, the other major source of
these nutrients is in the dung

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,380
and urine from grazing
animals.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,940
And the easiest way that that
nitrogen and phosphorus can

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,230
end up in waterways is by the
animals actually standing in

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,480
the water, perhaps
having a drink.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,780
Now, if we're going to try to
control the loss of these

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,580
nutrients, it's really important
that as much as is

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,539
possible, we keep the animals
out of the rivers and streams.

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,250
We have to fence them so that
the animals can't get access,

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,250
and we provide the water to the
animals in some other way.

26
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,890
But even if we keep the animals
out of the stream, we

27
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,590
are starting to release these
days that the nutrients that

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,500
were contained in the dung and
the urine of these grazing

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,110
animals can end up in streams.

30
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,950
And so how does that happen?

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,550
How does the urine coming from
the cow or the dung that's

32
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,580
landed on the pasture--

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,470
how does that end up
in our waterways?

34
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,350
Well, to understand that, we've
got to look at this

35
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,410
diagram again, which is the
diagram of the nitrogen cycle,

36
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,900
which you've seen a couple of
times earlier in this course.

37
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,570
And what it shows is the way
that nitrogen cycles around

38
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,930
the system through the plant,
up through the animal, and

39
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,990
back down to the ground again.

40
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,900
So it's constantly going
around in that circle.

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,545
And in this particular topic, I
want us to focus on this bit

42
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,089
of it here--

43
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,660
the dung and the urine.

44
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,310
Now, as we pointed out many
times in this course, animals

45
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,020
are reasonably poor converters
of plant

46
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,300
protein into animal protein.

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,310
So they eat lots of protein,
which contains nitrogen, and

48
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,130
they only use some of
that to form or

49
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,390
grow their own protein.

50
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,470
The rest of it they excrete, and
most of that nitrogen is

51
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,240
in the urine, and some
of it is in the dung.

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,620
Now, imagine a dairy cow eating
grass from over a large

53
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,870
area of the paddock.

54
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,860
And that grass has got lots of
nitrogen in it, and the cow

55
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,800
doesn't need all of it,
so she's going to

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,530
excrete it in urine.

57
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,490
And if you've ever seen a dairy
cow excreting, as we

58
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,630
showed in the previous photo,
it's an awesome sight.

59
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,600
Woosh, it comes out, the water,
all over a little area.

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,440
And so all that nitrogen, which
earlier in the day was

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,840
spread evenly across the soil in
the paddock, now has ended

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,790
up in a little area perhaps less
than one square metre.

63
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,750
And that is the cause of problem
for nitrogen metering.

64
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,210
The plants try as hard as they
can to take that nitrogen up

65
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,180
from the soil.

66
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,100
And often, if you look
at pastures--

67
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,750
particularly dairy pastures in
spring and autumn-- you will

68
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,675
see that the grass looks
very patchy.

69
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:57,540
There's some quite tall bits
and some quite short bits.

70
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,000
Those tall bits are where the
plants are growing really

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,170
quickly and taking
up that nitrogen.

72
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,839
But no matter how fast
they grow, they

73
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,260
can't take it all up.

74
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,179
And so there's quite large
amounts of available nitrogen

75
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,380
in the soil in that area that
was affected by the urine.

76
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,670
And if it rains heavily,
that will get

77
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,839
leeched out of the soil.

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,720
Now, there are ways we can
minimise that, but it is very

79
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,510
difficult to eliminate
it completely.

80
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,730
So we can see that this
nutrients can get from our

81
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,930
farming systems into our
waterways in a number of ways.

82
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,360
We can do quite a lot to
minimise the effect, and we

83
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,240
are working on ways and doing
research to try to improve our

84
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,220
performance even better.

85
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,940
In the next topic, we're going
to move on to something

86
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,320
completely different, which
is greenhouse gases.

87
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,637
