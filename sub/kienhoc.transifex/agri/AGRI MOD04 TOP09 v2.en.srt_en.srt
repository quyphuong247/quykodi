2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,750
In this topic, we're going to
be looking at the possible

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,920
impacts of climate change on
agriculture, and climate

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,470
change is likely to impact
on agriculture in several

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,160
different ways.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,450
For example, the areas where we
grow certain crops may no

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,200
longer be quite so suitable
for those crops, and the

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,170
converse will be the case--
some areas we currently we

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,960
can't grow certain things, in
the future, we may be able to.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,310
So we may be able to grow
subtropical crops in areas

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,520
where currently it's too cold.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,790
And the converse might be the
case, because some crops which

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,740
require winter chilling may not
be able to grow in those

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,280
same areas in the future
if it's getting warmer.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,950


16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,920
Another possible consequence is
that pests and diseases may

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,530
move their geographical range in
response to climate change.

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,580
So areas at the moment which
don't have certain pests and

19
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,270
diseases because they're too
cold may be infested with

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,490
those diseases if the
climate warms.

21
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,470
And another effect that I'd
never even thought of would be

22
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,400
that possibly we may end up with
a greater incidence of

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,670
wildfires if winds increase and
if areas get a bit drier

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,080
than they are now.

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,030
But the most significant impact
of climate change on

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,100
agriculture is likely to
be the climate itself.

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,679
And one of the things that's
predicted to be an outcome of

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,510
climate change is that the
climate will become more

29
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:58,160
variable and there is going
to be more extreme events.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,690
Now, in the last couple of
years, there's been quite a

31
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,580
large number of extreme climatic
events around the

32
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,060
world, and there's a debate
raging every time one of them

33
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,020
occurs as to whether or not
this actually is climate

34
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,132
change or it's just something
that might

35
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,990
have happened anyway.

36
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,840
But either way, extreme climatic
events can have a big

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,590
impact on agriculture.

38
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,330
I've just got a couple of
examples for you here.

39
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,750
This first one is from the area
where I live where we had

40
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,370
a huge flood a couple
of years ago.

41
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,440
And this picture shows fertile
farming planes totally

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,560
inundated with silt, this grey
material here, that was

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,660
deposited when a river
overflowed its banks and cover

44
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,720
these flats.

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,470
Now, it's going to be many years
before these areas here

46
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,120
that are deep in silt are going
to be as fertile as they

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,970
were before the flood
occurred.

48
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,970
So that's one impact of an
extreme climatic event.

49
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,990
At the other end of the scale,
it's predicted that we'll have

50
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,480
more droughts, and so we will
end up with more images on our

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,420
TVs of soils cracking like this,
and the associated death

52
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,609
of plants and hunger
in the population.

53
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,470
And we'll just expand that a
little more, because what

54
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,460
we've talked a bit here are
extreme events, but it does

55
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,420
envisage that there will be
ongoing, long term, systematic

56
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,739
events or changes around the
world, and that'll impact on

57
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,810
crop yield.

58
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,300
And we've already seen this map
of the world which shows

59
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,480
the predicted changes in cereal
yield, or the amount we

60
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,369
can produce in a given area as
climate change progresses.

61
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,390
And the green colours at this
end of the scale indicate

62
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,000
areas where we expect that
yields will actually increase

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,630
as a result of climate change.

64
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,180
And on these northern latitudes
here, that increase

65
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,880
is going to be because those
areas are warmer

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,560
than they are now.

67
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,540
But once again, at the other
end of the scale, these

68
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,530
colours down here indicate areas
where we think cereal

69
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,040
yields are going to decrease
mainly because it's going to

70
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,150
be a bit drier.

71
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,579
And unfortunately, we get many
of these areas in the Middle

72
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,480
East and Africa unfortunately
coincide, as we've seen in the

73
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,990
past, with the areas
of hunger.

74
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,920
Remember, this is the map of
hunger in the world, with the

75
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,370
areas where currently there
is the greatest hunger.

76
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,340
So in areas where we are
currently short of food, we're

77
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,049
likely to get even more short.

78
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,450
And this is going to pose big
challenges for the economic

79
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,810
and the political structures
that we can put in place,

80
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,430
because the total amount of
cereals growing around the

81
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,640
world isn't going to decrease.

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,289
It may even increase.

83
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,700
But somehow we need to work out
ways of getting that to

84
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,349
the people who need it most.

85
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,280
Now the next topic is going to
be the final topic in this

86
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,919
course, and in that, I'm just
going to sum up some of the

87
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,130
points we've covered and give
a bit of an idea about what

88
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,630
might happen in the future.

89
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,189
