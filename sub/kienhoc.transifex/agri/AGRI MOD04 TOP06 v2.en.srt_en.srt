00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,380
Unfortunately, it's all too true
that the quality of water

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,760
is deteriorating in many places
around the globe.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,360
We can see it in many of
our rivers and lakes.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,410
But it's also occurring
in our oceans.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,740
Off the mouths of rivers, major
rivers in developed

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,389
countries, large dead zones are
developing in the ocean at

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,116
some times of the year.

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:38,450
These zones are what we call
anoxic or lacking in oxygen.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,190
And even more concerning, or
just as concerning perhaps, is

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,230
that in the deep underground
waters, in our aquifers, we

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,480
are starting to detect
contamination with chemicals.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,489
So what's causing this decrease
in water quality?

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,660
Well, not least of the problems
of course is the 7.1

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,370
billion people in the world.

16
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,910
And there are many other
contributing factors as well.

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,190
But unfortunately, agriculture
is in the gun to

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,880
quite a large extent.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,500
So how does agriculture impact
on water quality?

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Well, there are three
main ways, I guess.

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,740
The first one is through
sediment moving

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,059
from land into water.

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,200
Now, we've already seen in an
earlier topic what causes

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,590
erosion and the movement of
water and soil across the soil

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,500
surface into rivers and lakes.

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,200
So we know what causes it.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,480
What happens in the rivers and
lakes is that the sediment can

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,540
fill up dams.

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,140
It makes the water appear very
unsightly and unsuitable for a

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,530
lot of recreational
activities.

31
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,980
Another impact of agriculture
is microbiological

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,810
contamination, or as I like to
call it, obviously, bad bugs.

33
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,070
Now, these are the sorts of
microorganisms in water that

34
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,120
will cause us to get some
diseases, and if they come

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,130
from animals, they often arise
in the water in the dung or

36
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,150
urine that comes from
those animals.

37
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,140
Now, that might arise because
the animals themselves are in

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,390
the water or because the dung
and urine that they put on

39
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,880
land is washed off
in heavy rain.

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,920
Now, the third, and I think
probably the most important

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,450
way that agricultural impacts
on water quality, is through

42
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,119
the discharge of plant nutrients
like nitrogen or

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,390
phosphorus, into waterways.

44
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,010
Now, it's not immediately
obvious why that's a problem,

45
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,035
because nitrogen and phosphorus

46
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,290
aren't inherently toxic.

47
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,690
I mean we deliberately are
putting them on our farmland

48
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,750
to enable us to grow more
plant material, but that

49
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,560
actually is the problem.

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,870
On land, they grow more
plant material.

51
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,690
And if they get washed off the
land into our waterways,

52
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,700
unfortunately, they still grow
more plant material.

53
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,799
So in our waterways, which
previously perhaps didn't have

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,300
very much biological growth at
all, if the quantities of

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,200
nutrients like nitrogen and
phosphorus increase, then the

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,519
amounts of plant growth such as
water weeds or algal growth

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,850
will also increase.

58
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,109
And that has a major impact
on the water.

59
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,580
For example, we've got a
spectacular example here of

60
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,320
water that's basically
bright green.

61
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,299
Now, that's not because
of a dye.

62
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,450
It's because in that water
there are millions and

63
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,489
billions of algae, green
coloured algae.

64
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,780
On a more spectacular scale,
we've got a satellite photo

65
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,280
here of the Caspian Sea, and we
can see once again, that in

66
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,050
some parts of the Caspian Sea,
up here and down the edges of

67
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,490
the sea here, close to the
shore, we are getting enormous

68
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,280
growths of algae and water
weed that we can

69
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,070
pick up from space.

70
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,579
Now the growth of these algae
detract from water quality in

71
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,779
several ways.

72
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,190
First of all, it looks awful.

73
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,920
Secondly, if we get strong wind
and all those algae and

74
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,180
water weeds get blown up in
the wave action onto the

75
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,180
shores of the rivers and lakes,
then you get these huge

76
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,960
piles of sort of rotting
biological

77
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,159
material that smell awful.

78
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,890
If we want to take our kids
fishing in those waters, every

79
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,729
time we throw the line the water
and pull it in, it's all

80
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,896
covered with weed.

81
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:49,320
If we want to use the water for
irrigation, then when we

82
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,190
try to pump it, all those weeds

83
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,400
clog up all the philtres.

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,179
But there's another even more
serious implication or

85
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,200
consequence of growing all
this weed and algae in

86
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,849
waterways, and that is that when
this biological material

87
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,740
dies, it then starts
to decompose.

88
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,410
And it's decomposed by other
bacteria, and those other

89
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,380
bacteria, just like us, they eat
food, take in oxygen, and

90
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,770
breath out CO2 to get
their energy.

91
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,010
And that's what happens with
these bacteria in water.

92
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,670
They are eating the food, which
is this dead algae.

93
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,390
But they take their oxygen,
not from the air,

94
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,719
but from the water.

95
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,370
And so very quickly indeed, the
water runs out of oxygen.

96
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,425
And of course, that impacts on
all the other life that was in

97
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,280
that lake, or river, or
ocean, such as fish.

98
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,929
And so that is the cause of
these enormous dead zones off

99
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,150
the mouths of major rivers.

100
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,640
It's all the nitrogen
and phosphorus.

101
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,060
Not all of it coming from
agriculture, we must be clear

102
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,900
about that.

103
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,289
But that is moving down the
river and out into the ocean

104
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,590
and stimulating all of this
biological growth, which when

105
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,909
it decays, sucks all the oxygen
out of the water.

106
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,120
Now, in our next topic, we're
going to look in a little bit

107
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,960
more detail at how those
nutrients like nitrogen and

108
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,870
phosphorus move from the land
into the waterways.

109
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,244
