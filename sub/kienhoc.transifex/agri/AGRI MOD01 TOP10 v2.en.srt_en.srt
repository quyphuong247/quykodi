00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,920
Welcome to this final topic
in this module.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,759
In this topic, we're going to
summarise some of the points

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,800
that we have learned, as we've
worked our way through the

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,960
previous topics.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,480
And then we're going look
forward over the next 25 years

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,740
and identify a couple of
challenges that may cause

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,919
problems in agriculture.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,995
So first of all, just reviewing
where we've been.

10
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:35,989
We've learned that agricultural
production in the

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,900
world is driven both by how many
people are living in the

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,500
world and also their
average wealth.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,290
Together, these determine how
much we produce and what sort

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,060
of food we produce.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,180
The next thing we learned is
that despite dire predictions

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,750
over the last 200 years, by
and large agricultural

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,690
production has managed
to keep pace with

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,780
global population growth.

19
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,370
And we are cautiously optimistic
that that might

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,140
continue into the future.

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,520
The final point is that despite
this increase in food

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,210
production, it has not been
enough to prevent

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,860
hunger in the world.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,160
We know that there are about
870 million people in the

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,140
world at the moment that don't
have enough to eat.

26
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,640
And we know that most of those
people are located in Africa.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,760
Now as I said a little earlier
in this topic, we are

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,010
reasonably optimistic that we
can continue to increase food

29
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,500
production fast enough to keep
pace with population growth.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,820
But there are a couple of
challenges that you loom on

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,410
the horizon that
may affect us.

32
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,850
The first of these is global
climate change.

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,830
If the climate changes in
different parts of the world,

34
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,450
this is clearly going to have
an effect on agriculture.

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,870
And to demonstrate this, in this
next graph, what we've

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,750
done is colour the various
countries, and depending on

37
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,350
whether we think that the cereal
yield or the amount of

38
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,910
cereal that we can grow for
a given area is likely to

39
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,920
increase or decrease when the
global climate changes, as we

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,030
think it might.

41
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:32,240
So the greeny-bluey colours
indicate countries we think

42
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,910
the yield production per area
is likely to increase.

43
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,340
This yellow-y colours indicate
where we don't think there's

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,880
going to be very much change.

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,250
And then down this end of the
scale, the dark browns and the

46
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,600
oranges indicate countries where
we think the yield is

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,410
likely to decrease.

48
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,850
Now overall, the effect of
climate change on global

49
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,760
production of cereals isn't
quite possibly not going to be

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,454
very great at all, because some
countries will grow more

51
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,400
and other countries
will grow less.

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,740
But quite clearly, the fact that
Africa is the area where

53
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,610
it looks like the greatest
decreases in yield will occur,

54
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,960
and bearing in mind that that
is also the continent where

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,260
the greatest hunger is
currently, and it's also the

56
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,609
continent where it's expected
that the greatest population

57
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,710
growth will occur, we can see
that we potentially have a

58
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,300
huge challenge.

59
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,670
And the second challenge
that is

60
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,959
looming is that of biofuels.

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,960
What we find is that plant
materials, like maise or

62
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,640
sugarcane, can be used
to manufacture fuel.

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,299
We call it biofuel.

64
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,520
And this has already
been done.

65
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,570
In this photograph, we see the
harvesting of sugarcane, which

66
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,640
is going to be used to
create biofuels.

67
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,709
Now at the moment, the cost of
manufacturing these biofuels

68
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,000
is higher than the cost
associated with our normal

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,990
fossil fuel that we
use in our cars.

70
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,769
And so, biofuels can't really
compete unless they're

71
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,529
subsidised by governments.

72
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,060
And this has happened and is
happening in some countries

73
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,640
around the world
at the moment.

74
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,510
But one of the certainties in
life seems to be that our fuel

75
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,310
costs are going to increase
ever higher.

76
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,190
And so we can see the
possibility that at some

77
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,810
stage, perhaps in the near
future, the cost of biofuels

78
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,650
will become competitive
with fossil fuels.

79
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,030
And if and what that
day arrives,

80
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,640
farmers will have a choice.

81
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,090
They could grow their crops for
human consumption, or they

82
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,080
could grow them to manufacture
biofuel.

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,919
And they will choose the one
that provides them with the

84
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,580
greatest profit.

85
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,039
Now if this occurs on a large
scale, we can see that it will

86
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,470
have huge implications
for food supply

87
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,080
in the coming years.

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,120
So that's the end of this
module where we've been

89
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,960
looking at global issues
affecting agriculture.

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,989
In the next module, we're going
to drop down and look at

91
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,290
issues that affect
the management

92
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,540
of individual farmers.

93
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,349
