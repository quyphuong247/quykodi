00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,959
Welcome to this topic, in
which we're going to be

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,980
talking about the international
trade that

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,670
occurs in agricultural
products.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,730
Now on a global scale, most of
the food that is grown in

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,620
various countries around the
world is consumed in those

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,590
same countries.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,049
There are exceptions, of course,
and New Zealand is a

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,990
good example where over 90% of
the dairy products that are

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,140
produced in New Zealand
are exported.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,180
But that's not the norm.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,019
But despite the fact that most
of the food produced in the

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,890
country is eaten in that
country, there is a rapidly

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,040
expanding trade in
food products.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,580
And we can see that in
this diagram that we

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,030
have up here now.

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,600
What it shows is the
international trade in

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,480
billions of dollars over
a 10-year period

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,140
from 2000 up to 2010.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,360
And the key, first key point to
take away from that is that

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,410
this trade has increased
dramatically, virtually

22
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,759
doubled from $400 billion
dollars up to approximately

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,250
$800 billion over that
10-year period.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,650
Now there are several
reasons for this.

25
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,470
One of them is that in
developed and wealthy

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,690
countries, consumers are
expecting a greater choice in

27
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,940
the food that they buy.

28
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,880
It's been estimated that in the
United Kingdom, consumers

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,560
have a choice between 450
different types of fruit and

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
vegetables.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,940
And not only do they want to
have their big choice, they

32
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,070
also want to be able to access
that choice right

33
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,630
throughout the year.

34
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,410
And inevitably, for things like
fruit and vegetables,

35
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,280
that must mean out of season
access, compared to what could

36
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,509
be produced in their
own country.

37
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:14,131
And clearly this then leads
to international trade.

38
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:17,680
A second contribution is that
in both developed and

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,290
developing countries, food
manufacturing industries are

40
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,840
making increasingly
sophisticated food products.

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,100
For example, a chocolate-coated
biscuits bar,

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,310
made in the United Kingdom,
would probably have over 10

43
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,060
ingredients in it, things like
cocoa or whey or sugar that

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,175
would all be sourced from
different countries around the

45
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:46,880
globe, once again contributing
to international trade.

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,810
And the final important point is
that as we've already seen,

47
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,770
the population in some areas
of the world is increasing

48
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,670
very rapidly indeed.

49
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,920
It's increasing much quicker
than the food production can

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,859
keep up with.

51
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,390
And so once again, this is
requiring that large

52
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,540
quantities of food are traded
around the world.

53
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,370
If we take the information in
this diagram and replot it as

54
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,300
a pie diagram, we can see more
clearly the contribution that

55
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,890
the difference sectors
make to this total

56
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,299
international trade.

57
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,560
And when I did this, it was
quite surprising to me that in

58
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,830
actual fact, in terms of dollar
value, the largest

59
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,490
component is fruit
and vegetables.

60
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:46,180
And then this is followed by
cereals, with fish and meat

61
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,330
following on behind.

62
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,450
But this very large in and fruit
and vegetables reflects

63
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,429
what were talking about earlier
in the topic, where

64
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,940
consumers around the world, and
particularly in wealthy

65
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,010
countries, are demanding
more choice in the

66
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,420
products that they buy.

67
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,709
The second component, the
contribution of cereals to

68
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,150
international trade reflects as
we talked about earlier on

69
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,070
the topic, the need to ship
large quantities of basic

70
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,200
foodstuffs to meet rapidly
increasing population growth

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,270
in some parts of the world.

72
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:31,340
So in summary, in this topic,
we can take away a couple of

73
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,500
important points.

74
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,270
The first is that the
International Trade in Food

75
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,450
products is increasing
very quickly.

76
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,099
And this is just another
manifestation or example of

77
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,120
the increased globalisation that
is occurring in all sorts

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,410
of commodities all
around the world.

79
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,250
It also incidentally is why
agriculture is such an

80
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,220
exciting place to work
for young people

81
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,090
moving into the workforce.

82
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,849
The second point we can take
away is that there are lots of

83
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,370
drivers for this increase
in trade.

84
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,920
And one of the most important
is the demand for increased

85
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,250
choice amongst consumers.

86
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,090
Now in the next topic, we're
going to take a look at how

87
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,119
all these products that are
traded around the world end up

88
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,590
being available to individual
consumers.

89
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,027
