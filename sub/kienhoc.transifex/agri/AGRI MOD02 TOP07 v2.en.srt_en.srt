2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,910
In the last topic, we listed
all the operations that we

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,410
have to go through if we're
going to grow a crop.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,170
And in this topic what I want
to do is focus in on one of

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,730
those operations in particular,
and that is the

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,810
cultivation or tillage
of the soil before

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,540
we plant the seeds.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,919
And in doing that, I really
want to emphasise a new

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,010
concept to do with soils and
cropping called the concept of

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,360
soil structure.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,970
Now, many of you have got your
own vegetable gardens, or

12
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,070
perhaps your parents had
vegetable gardens, and they

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,970
coerced or bribed you into
digging it up for them before

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,269
they planted their
crops in spring.

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,680
And when you were doing that,
you may have observed that in

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,440
some soils in some gardens,
usually very, very good

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,849
gardens, as soon as you dug up
the soil with the spade, the

18
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,710
soil basically almost fell off
it into beautiful, fine

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,750
material made up of little
aggregates perhaps half the

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,120
size of a pea, and all you
needed to do was just rake it

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,710
over, and you had this
wonderful seed bed.

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,309
Some of you, of course, may have
had a more unfortunate

23
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,050
experience where the garden that
you were trying to dig

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,130
appeared to have a really,
really gluggy, solid

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,729
appearance.

26
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,350
And when you dug it up and
levered it up with the spade,

27
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,899
it came up in great big
clods and lumps.

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,230
And of course, you couldn't
use that as a seed bed.

29
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,170
So you had to try to smash those
lumps down and cut them

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,870
up with the spade, and
it took forever and

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,120
used lots of energy.

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,150
And even then when you ended
up with the seed bed, it

33
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,990
probably wasn't as good
as the first one.

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,100
So the difference between those
two types of soil is the

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,000
soil structure.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,720
Now in order to explain what we
mean by soil structure, I'm

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,250
going to put up again the
picture of this wonderful soil

38
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,150
that we showed you in a couple
of earlier topics.

39
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,919
In particular, I'm going to
focus on this top layer of the

40
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,970
soil which has got all sorts of
organic matter in it that's

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,490
come from the growing plants
on the top, and the earth

42
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,060
worms, and the microbes,
and things that

43
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,960
we've already discussed.

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,830
In the earlier topic, I also
talked to you about the

45
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,700
concept of soil texture, which
is the makeup of the soil in

46
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,170
terms of the little grains of
sand and silt and clay that

47
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,739
are the fundamental building
blocks of the soil.

48
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,570
Now when we look at the top
soil here, or in your very

49
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,900
good vegetable garden soil, we
find that the little lumps--

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,530
as I said, they're about half
the size of peas or a little

51
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,950
bit smaller than that--

52
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,429
they are clearly quite a lot
bigger than the sand and the

53
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,310
silt and the clay particles.

54
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,440
What they are is those particles
joined together in

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,240
some way to form these little
aggregates or lumps.

56
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,360
Now if we squeeze those lumps
between our fingers, they

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,890
break down.

58
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,720
They're not really,
really hard.

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,460
But nonetheless, they do hold
together reasonably well.

60
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,370
So what is causing those sand
and silt and clay particles to

61
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,090
be glued together?

62
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,120
Well, it's all down to this
organic matter, and in

63
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,460
particular, the plant roots that
are growing through the

64
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,830
soil, and the actions of the
earth worms and microbes.

65
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,860
Because what they do if they're
breaking down that

66
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,810
organic matter, is that they
excrete chemical substances

67
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,630
which act as a sort of glue to
hold those particles together.

68
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,650
So a really important key
to maintaining good soil

69
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,900
structure, like we see in that
good garden soil, is trying to

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,160
keep as much organic matter
in the soil as possible.

71
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,420
So for example, under this
soil here, which has been

72
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,839
under pasture by the look of it
for quite a long time, we'd

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,030
expect if we dug that up
that it would have

74
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,550
really good soil structure.

75
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,810
So that's what encourages
soil structure.

76
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,120
What would cause soil structure
to get worse?

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,200
Well, there are two things.

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,649
First of all, the opposite
to what we had here.

79
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,815
If through our cropping
operations or management of

80
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:23,100
the soil we cause the organic
matter in the soil to

81
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,590
decrease, then the amount of
glue in the soil holding those

82
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,810
particles together decreases,
and it's more easy for them to

83
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,190
break down.

84
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,000
And the second way that we can
destroy those particles is by

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,840
basically squeezing them too
hard, and especially when the

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
soil is wet.

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,780
Because what we find is that
when the soil's wet, those

88
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,950
particles get a bit weaker.

89
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,000
They're easier to squeeze
together.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,610
And so if when the soil's wet
we start to try to cultivate

91
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,040
it, you know, plough it or
whatever, or drive heavy

92
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,650
tractors over it, or perhaps
graze it with heavy animals

93
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,750
like dairy cows, then what we
find is that that tends to

94
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,630
squeeze the soil down.

95
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,390
And it breaks down those little
lumps or aggregates,

96
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,560
and we end up with a soil that's
much more like that

97
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,390
terrible vegetable garden soil
what we started at the

98
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,140
beginning of this topic.

99
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:23,400
So the take home message from
this topic is that soil

100
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,349
structure is really important.

101
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,450
If we can maintain soil
structure, cropping becomes so

102
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,760
much easier.

103
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,670
And so we have to think of ways
and try to practise ways

104
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,090
which will maintain the
structure as good

105
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,760
as we can keep it.

106
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,230
Now in the next topic, we're
going to move on to another

107
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,440
aspect of cropping and that is
the idea of crop rotations.

108
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,323
