2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,830
During many of the topics that
we've been discussing, I've

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,520
been stressing the increasing
industrialisation and

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,680
globalisation of agriculture.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,950
And that's been a
very good thing.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,020
And I want us to feed the
ever-growing world population.

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,230
And we hope that in the future
it will continue to enable us

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,060
to do that.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,850
But there is some push-back
against this ongoing

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,990
industrialisation and
globalisation.

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,860
And we see it in a number
of different ways.

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,550
Interestingly, it's
not even new.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,480
In 1924, Rudolf Steiner, a
famous philosopher, introduced

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,360
a new concept of farming that
has worked its way into the

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,430
bio-dynamic system which is now
used in many places around

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,190
the world as one of the organic
farming systems.

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,580
Interestingly once again, when
we watch TV, many of the

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,640
celebrity chefs will stress
that their ingredients are

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,290
usually organic or often
organic and seasonal.

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,030
In other words, people are
trying to, at least in

21
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,340
developed countries, people
are trying to move back

22
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,910
towards nature in at least some
aspects of their eating.

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,860


24
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,430
Now around the world, this trend
is reasonably general.

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,140
And so different countries
have developed different

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,080
certifications schemes so that
consumers can have some

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,310
assurance that their organic
food is produced according to

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,180
certain standards.

29
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,600
What we've got here is
the German eco-label.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,190
And New Zealand has an
equivalent one called BioGro.

31
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,009
So around the world, there's a
range of these organic labels

32
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,610
that are providing consumers
with some choice about the

33
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,460
products that they might
choose to buy.

34
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,460
Now there's a lot of different
forms of organic farming, as

35
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,090
we've alluded to, but they do
have some things in common.

36
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,430
Generally, they try to
avoid-- in fact,

37
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,990
they probably prohibit--

38
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,090
the use of chemically
manufactured fertilisers.

39
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,440
Instead of that, they prefer to
use organic minerals, such

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,520
as reactive rock phosphate or
organic fertiliser such as

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,610
compost and seaweeds.

42
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,570
They try to avoid and usually
prohibit the use of many

43
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,799
animal remedies, especially
for synthetic ones.

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,660
And so what they prefer to do
instead is to use other

45
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,720
approaches to controlling
animal diseases.

46
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,340
And we will talk a little
bit about that as well.

47
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,620
Another feature of organic farms
is they're not usually

48
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,850
monocultures, like so many of
the conventional firms are.

49
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,019
I got reminded of this rather
rudely once, several years

50
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,170
ago, when I took a group of
students to a local organic

51
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,880
farmer, who had successfully
developed a brand of yoghurt,

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,510
based on the organic milk
produced on his farm.

53
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,510
And I took the students
out to this farm.

54
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,890
And I introduced the farmer
and said he was an organic

55
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,420
dairy farmer.

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,530
And he explained to me that
there was, Russ, no such thing

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,600
as an organic dairy farmer.

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,019
What there was was an
organic farmer.

59
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,530
But any bona fide organic
farmers would have a range of

60
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,590
different animals on their farm,
and they would grow a

61
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,710
range of different crops.

62
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,590
And that was indeed the case.

63
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,860
So this farm had dairy cows on
his farm, but he also had a

64
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,440
number of other animals.

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,170
And similarly, he grew
a number of crops.

66
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,149
And he used that range of
animals and that range of

67
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,790
crops in ways that we've already
talked about when we

68
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,440
were talking about crop
technicians, to reduce his

69
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,579
need and dependence on chemicals
and chemical

70
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,860
pesticides.

71
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,730
So the different sorts of
animals would follow each

72
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,170
other round the paddocks.

73
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,000
And in that way, by having
different sorts of animals

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,020
moving into a paddock,
it would break

75
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,919
the parasite cycle.

76
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,630
Similarly by having different
crops and different paddocks

77
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,880
in different years, he would
avoid the buildup of disease.

78
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,770
Now even in vegetable gardens,
as we see here, we can achieve

79
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,719
much the same thing.

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,430
This is an organic
vegetable garden.

81
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,730
And what you see when you look
at it is you see there's

82
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,050
actually a range of crops in it,
not just one monoculture

83
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,280
such as we saw in the previous
topic on horticulture.

84
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,390
Now, the advocates for organic
agriculture are keen to try to

85
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,740
promote it as much as possible
and say that even it should

86
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,640
take over from many of our
conventional practises.

87
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,060
There are some issues with it.

88
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,730
The first one is that the
yields on organic farms

89
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,280
sometimes at less than they
are on conventional farms.

90
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,890
And when we've got this huge
pressure to feed an

91
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,940
ever-increasing population, we
really need to take here

92
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,110
before we whole-sale move into
an organic farming system.

93
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,960
The other issue is--

94
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,630
and here, I gave credit to
organic farmers-- is that to

95
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,469
be a successful organic farmer,
you really do need to

96
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,040
be a very good farmer.

97
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,260
You need to have a very good
understanding of your soil and

98
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,099
your system and the
crops and the

99
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,970
animals that you're farming.

100
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,640
So, in summary, there is a
growing development of organic

101
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,860
farming as part of their
agricultural industry.

102
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,740
It provides a valuable niche
opportunity for people seeking

103
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,540
high value crops.

104
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,360
And there are many lessons that
conventional farmers can

105
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,660
learn from their organic
farming colleagues.

106
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,700
As I say, organic farmers
are very good farmers.

107
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,430
And some of the lessons,
particularly those that relate

108
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,760
to maintaining organic matter
in the solo and the benefits

109
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,200
of crop rotations, are sort of
advantages and lessons that

110
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,180
conventional farmers would
do very well to learn.

111
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,540
Now, in our next topic, we're
going to move on to and look

112
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,800
at the businesses that are
associated with farming but

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,050
are not farming itself.

114
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,396
