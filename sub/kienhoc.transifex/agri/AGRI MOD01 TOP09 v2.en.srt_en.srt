2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,080
I'm sure that many of you will
have found yourself in this

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,680
situation or in one of the
situations that are

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,480
displayed behind me.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,040
I know I have.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,090
I always have trouble getting
through customs, particularly

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,680
when I'm coming home to my
country, which is New Zealand.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,500
It's not, I don't think, because
I particularly look

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,370
like I might have terrorist
affiliations or that I'm

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,175
carrying drugs.

11
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:40,420
At least, I don't think so.

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,760
But my problem is that
I'm an aggie.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,730
I work in agriculture.

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,190
And so as soon as the customs
officer finds out about that,

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,580
they immediately want to know
if I've been on farms in the

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,030
days preceding my flight.

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,310
And if I say yes, then they want
to inspect my shoes and

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,790
my clothes to make sure that I'm
not bringing back any soil

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,450
or bits of plants or
animals from the

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,400
countries I've visited.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,490
So if it's not drugs or
terrorist activities that

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,500
these customs officers are
concerned about, what is their

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,590
major concern?

24
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,712
Well, what they're trying to
prevent is the importation of

25
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:27,720
a pest or a disease into
this country that

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,140
wasn't there before.

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,840
For an agricultural exporting
country like New Zealand, the

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,120
accidental importation of a
disease, such as foot and

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,710
mouth, which is not in New
Zealand at present, would have

30
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,580
economic and social consequences
infinitely worse

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,800
than likely terrorist action
or the horrible

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,230
effects of drug use.

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,520
Now, when we come through
customs, we are always asked

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,720
to declare whether or
not we've got any

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,810
food items with us.

36
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,530
And if we say yes, then, in all
probability, the customs

37
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,690
officer will ask
to inspect it.

38
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,730
And in some situations, they
may say, look, we're sorry.

39
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,299
You are not allowed to bring
this into the country.

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,910
And they will confiscate it.

41
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,650
Now, if that is the trouble
they go to for individuals

42
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,630
bringing food into the country,
imagine the concerns

43
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,700
that they have for the
importation of large

44
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,459
quantities of food and
agricultural trade.

45
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,120
And the policies and the
processes and the

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,800
documentation that exporters of
food have to go through in

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,570
order to satisfy these
biosecurity arrangements can

48
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,040
be very complex.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,209
And they can impose significant
costs on these

50
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,330
exporting businesses.

51
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,370
Now, most of the biosecurity
precautions that are enforced

52
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,020
by the customs officers are
imposed by governments.

53
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,550
But increasingly, exporters of
food products are finding that

54
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,600
not only do they have to
satisfy the biosecurity

55
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,230
regulations of different
governments around the world,

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,160
but they also have to satisfy
a whole series of different

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,720
criteria that are being imposed
by the supermarkets

58
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,760
who are their major customers.

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,870
And these additional criteria
that are being imposed by the

60
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,960
supermarkets may go much wider
than the traditional

61
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,670
biosecurity concerns that we've
just been talking about.

62
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,820
They may be concerned with the
human rights' issues in the

63
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,480
country where the food
is being produced.

64
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,750
They may be concerned about
environmental problems in

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,360
those countries.

66
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,970
Or they may be trying to
instigate a real what we call

67
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,260
a player-to-plate traceability,
whereby the

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,600
consumers of products bought
from the supermarket can trace

69
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,260
back and understand
exactly where

70
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,399
and when it was produced.

71
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,160
Now, why are supermarkets trying
to impose these new

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,880
additional criteria?

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,590
Well, there's lots of reasons.

74
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,799
First of all, they may be
wanting to differentiate

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,100
themselves from their
competitors.

76
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,490
And quite often, they want to
differentiate themselves from

77
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,610
other food retailers
in their area.

78
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,900
A good example is
farmer's market.

79
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,900
So supermarkets may be trying to
demonstrate that their food

80
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,731
security, food safety measures
are very high indeed.

81
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:57,740
They may be wishing to impose
uniform standards across all

82
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,350
their suppliers.

83
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,960
And as well as that, they may
be trying to substitute for

84
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,380
inadequate or missing standards
existing in the

85
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,180
country from which the
food is coming.

86
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,840
Now, all of this is an example
of what happens as the wealth

87
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,489
of the customers increases.

88
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,680
As customers have more choice,
they stop worrying so much

89
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,080
about getting enough to eat and
start being more concerned

90
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,710
about what sort of food
they're going to eat.

91
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,190
And then finally, as we've just
been talking about, they

92
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,670
start worrying or are concerned
about how the food

93
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,020
that they're eating and buying
is being produced.

94
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,109
So in summary, we can say that
although there are wonderful

95
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,600
opportunities out there for
producers to sell to a global

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,480
market, there are strict
processes and protocols that

97
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,360
may be imposed by the
governments of countries to

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,080
which they're exporting or
increasingly by the customers

99
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,490
themselves, such
a supermarkets.

100
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,470
And the producers need to master
these processes and the

101
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,230
documentation associated with
them if they're going to take

102
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,770
advantage of the
opportunities.

103
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,530
This may, sometimes, impose
considerable costs.

104
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,260
Now, in the final topic in this
module, we are going to

105
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,650
summarise what we've covered in
the previous topics about

106
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,219
the global agriculture and
the global context.

107
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,730
And finally, we are then going
to look at a couple of

108
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,560
challenges that may be
ahead for agriculture

109
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,830
in the next 25 years.

110
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,365
