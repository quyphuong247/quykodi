2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,720
The whole purpose of farming
is to produce agricultural

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,560
products that we sell
off the farm.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,650
Now these agricultural products
all contain plant

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,570
nutrients, and the most obvious
examples that we can

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,310
think of are when the tanker
goes out the gate on a dairy

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,000
farm filled up with milk from
the farm, or when we ship off

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,880
crates of cabbages or lettuces
of to a market.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,600
Those products have got these
nutrients, and those nutrients

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,880
originally came from the
soil on the farm.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,170
And if we don't replace them,
then those eventually, the

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,580
nutrients in soil, are going
to run out, and the farming

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,500
system isn't really
sustainable.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,830
Now the loss of nutrients in
products like milk and

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,330
cabbages and lettuces and things
is very easy for us to

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,030
understand, but in actual fact,
nutrients can be lost

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,480
from farms in other ways that
are a lot less obvious to us.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,490
And to help us understand this
for the example one of those

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,490
nutrients, nitrogen, I'm going
to put up the diagram we

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,679
looked at in the last topic.

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,310
It's a diagram of the nitrogen
cycle on a dairy farm, and we

22
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,820
highlighted that it shows how
nitrogen moves through the

23
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,949
system, through the soil, back
up through the plants, back

24
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,110
into the animal, and then
back out again,

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,300
going around in a loop.

26
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,690
And in the last topic, we really
focused on this part of

27
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,770
the cycle here, the fixation
of the nitrogen from the

28
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,660
atmosphere in legumes
like clovers.

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,660
But in this topic, what I really
want us to focus on

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:04,240
instead is the arrows that
point out of the cycle.

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,880
And what we see is that nitrogen
can actually be lost

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,440
from a farming system in a
variety of different ways.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,760
One of those ways is by
what we call leeching.

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,950
Now leeching is movement in
water, and so when we get a

35
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,609
lot of rain on a farm, the water
moves down through the

36
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,540
soil, and as it moves down
through the soil, it takes

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,970
nutrients with it.

38
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,109
And so quite large amounts of
nitrogen can often be lost

39
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,750
from farming systems in
this leeching water.

40
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,410
Now obviously, we're concerned
about it here because it's a

41
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,579
loss of nutrient
from the farm.

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,870
Later on in the course, we're
going to see that it's also of

43
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,520
concern because it's one of the
causes of water pollution.

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,080
Nitrogen can also be lost up
into the atmosphere through

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
the actions of bacteria
that are in the soil.

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,269
Now once again, in this topic
we're concerned because it's a

47
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,430
loss from the farm that we
have to replace, but in

48
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,190
subsequent topics we're going to
be concerned about exactly

49
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,700
the same loss because some of
those gases are what we call

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,149
greenhouse gases, and
they contribute to

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,350
global climate change.

52
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,540
So if we accept that we have
to replace these losses if

53
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,480
we're going to be sustainable
in our farming, the question

54
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,130
is, well, what nutrients
and how much?

55
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,549
And to help us look at that,
I'm going to put up a table

56
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,950
that you've also seen before.

57
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,875
And this table gives a list of
some of the essential-- not

58
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:40,310
all of them, but some of the
essential plant nutrients,

59
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,690
such as we've got listed here.

60
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,630
And it also has the quantities
of those plant nutrients that

61
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,070
will be taken up in a year by a
pasture on a dairy farm that

62
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,440
was producing about 15 tonnes
of dry matter in that year.

63
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,730
Now there's a couple of key
points that we really want to

64
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,160
take out of that.

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,310
Clearly, there's a huge range
in these quantities.

66
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,340
Now I really do need to stress
that these quantities that

67
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,490
we've got here and not the
actual amounts that would be

68
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,790
lost from the farm, because
remember, a lot of those

69
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,160
nutrients go around the nutrient
cycle and back to the

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,510
soil again.

71
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,690
But the huge differences in the
quantities here give us a

72
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,290
pretty good idea about the
relative amounts of these

73
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,070
nutrients that we're going
to have to apply.

74
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,060
For example, we're obviously
going to have to put more

75
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,650
potassium than zinc because
there's a huge difference in

76
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,940
the amount that we're
likely to lose

77
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,370
from the farming system.

78
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,780
And the final key point I really
want us to take from

79
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,150
this table is that these
quantities that we've got

80
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,489
here, what would be taken up by
the pasture if we produced

81
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,540
15 tonnes of dry matter?

82
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,780
I think we can easily see that
if we only produced 10 tonnes

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,619
of dry matter, then these
quantities would be much less.

84
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,180
And correspondingly, the losses
from the system would

85
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,690
also [INAUDIBLE] much less.

86
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,410
So the next take home message,
I guess, is not only do we

87
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,040
need nutrients, but the
quantities we need depend on

88
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,720
how intensive our farming
system is.

89
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,420
If we have a very intensive,
productive farming system, we

90
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,820
need to replace more nutrients
than if our farming system is

91
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,430
less intense.

92
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,430
So in summary, I guess we can
take two key points out of

93
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,560
this topic.

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,720
The first is that if we are
going to farm sustainably for

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,080
long periods of time, we have to
replace the nutrients that

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,090
we lose from the
farming system.

97
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,390
The second key point is the
quantities of those nutrients

98
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,400
will depend on the intensity of
the system, so really high

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,299
producing farms need large
quantities of fertilisers.

100
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,730
I guess the take home message
that I often use is if you

101
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,240
can't afford to fertilise,
you can't afford to farm.

102
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,580
So that brings us to the end of
these sections where we've

103
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,200
been talking mainly about soils,
and now we're in the

104
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,880
coming topics going to move on
and actually look at real

105
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,860
farming systems, and we're going
to start by looking at

106
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,110
cropping farms.

107
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,303
