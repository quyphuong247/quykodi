00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,910
We have seen in previous topics
that when we consider

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,509
it on a global basis, the
contribution of sheep and goat

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,200
meat to the global diet is quite
small compared to most

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,570
other meats.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,090
But in some countries of the
world, that is not the case.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,750
And sheep and goat meat
are very important

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,880
components of the diet.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,890
Now, when we're talking about
sheep farming, nearly always

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,750
we are talking about
pasture-based sheep farming,

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,880
as we see on the slide, here.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,320
There's very little option,
really, for feedlot based

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,170
sheep farming.

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,190
And sheep farming is unusual in
another respect in as much

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,839
as it produces multiple
products.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,760
It produces wool and meat.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,820
Now, if we went back 50 or 60
years, on most sheep farms or

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,960
many sheep farms in countries
like Australia and New

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,869
Zealand, most of the income
to the farm would have

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,670
come from the wool.

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,400
Now, there are still some farms
where that would be the

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,460
case, and those would be farms
that are producing very, very

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,339
fine, high quality wool that is
used in the production of

24
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,400
very high quality fabrics that
are then used, in turn, to

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,280
produce things like suits,
very expensive suits.

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,900
And sometimes, especially if you
do live in Australia, you

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,930
see an article on the news about
a huge amount of money

28
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,310
that's been paid for a bale of
this very, very fine, high

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,390
quality wool that's then going
to go on to provide very high

30
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,590
quality garments in the
capitols of the world.

31
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,080
But that's very much
an exception.

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,230
And these days, the wool of most
farms, the value of that

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,740
wool has been declining
for many years.

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,168
And the main reason is because
that wool is competing with

35
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,210
synthetics.

36
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:16,010
So now, 50 or 60 years on, most
of the money coming into

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,970
sheep farms is for the meat.

38
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,880
And that meat comes from the
lambs that are born on the

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,960
farm and then raised through
to an appropriate size and

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,720
sent off for slaughter.

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,190
So because we're getting all our
money from the lambs, it's

42
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,750
very important to know how
many lambs we're going to

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,930
produce and what the quality of
the meat from those lambs

44
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,240
is going to be.

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,700
Because both of those two things
are going to effect the

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,709
amount of money we get.

47
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,330
Now, if we look at a flock of
ewes, we will find that some

48
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,320
of them will produce one lamb.

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,519
Some of them will produce
two lambs.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,730
Some of them might even
produce three lambs.

51
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,000
Now we might think that the
more lambs a ewe produces,

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,790
that would be all to the good,
and by and large, it is.

53
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,549
If we can get more of our ewes
producing two lambs than one

54
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,730
lamb, we're going to have
more lambs to sell.

55
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,709
When a ewe starts to go from
two to three lambs, then it

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,550
becomes more difficult for that
ewe to raise those lambs

57
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,780
quickly and produce good sized
animals with really good meat.

58
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,615
So we might have to treat those
ewes preferring and give

59
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:34,180
them really, really good feed.

60
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,870
And in general, that's what
we're trying to do.

61
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,200
There are ways, on farms, for
identifying which ewes, for

62
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,100
example, are going to have
two lambs or three and

63
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,329
preferentially feeding them
before they lamb, so that then

64
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,270
they can raise those multiple
lambs up to very good weights

65
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,630
very quickly.

66
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,500
Now, in contrast to beef
breeding systems that we've

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,000
just been talking about, when a
ewe lambs, we leave the ewe

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,250
on the lamb , but we don't leave
her there for six or

69
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,820
seven months like we do
with a beef calf.

70
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,940
Instead, after three or four
months, usually before

71
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,400
Christmas, we can wean the
lamb from the ewe.

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,539
Now, at that stage, we may sell
it if it's in really good

73
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,400
condition for slaughter, or we
may carry it on or sell it to

74
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,419
someone else to raise it and
get it a bit bigger and in

75
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,280
better condition before
it's slaughtered.

76
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,299
But this getting rid of the
lambs early on in the season

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,310
really helps us in climates
where we get dry summers.

78
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,550
Because then, the pasture is
going to stop growing.

79
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,570
So it's a very flexible
system.

80
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,430
We can make use of all the feed
that's growing in the

81
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,330
early spring, feed up the lambs,
then when things start

82
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,330
to dry out, we get
rid of them.

83
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,490
And this is really important
for sheep farming.

84
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,850
Because sheep farming, in just
the same way as it is for

85
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,790
dairy farming, in sheep
farming, it is really

86
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,390
important that we lamb at
the same time, early

87
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,770
spring, every year.

88
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,770
Now, just as with dairy farming,
the gestation period

89
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,919
of a cow is nine months
plus nine days.

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,070
The gestation period of a ewe is
five months less five days.

91
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:38,360
So that means that we are going
to be breeding that ewe

92
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,410
in about the start of March, in
order for her to have her

93
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,610
lamb round about August.

94
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:53,340
Now, in sheep farming, almost
universally, this mating takes

95
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,450
place naturally with
rams and ewes.

96
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,349
So there isn't artificial
insemination.

97
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,480
But in exactly the same way as
was the case with dairying, in

98
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,370
order for that ewe to get
pregnant and particularly for

99
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,760
that ewe to have multiple lambs,
twins or even triplets,

100
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,570
it's really important that she
is in good condition when

101
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,170
she's mated.

102
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,530
And so normally, we are trying
to feed her really well for,

103
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,200
perhaps, the three or
four weeks before we

104
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,979
put the rams out.

105
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,940
In dry conditions, this
is quite a challenge.

106
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,270
And we often observe that the
lambing percentage varies

107
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,919
quite a lot from year to year.

108
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,270
And when that does, the reason
usually is the conditions of

109
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,750
the ewes when they were mated.

110
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,830
So that's a real brief look at
sheep farming systems and how

111
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,849
they compare with some of the
other systems we've been

112
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,030
looking at.

113
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,559
What we're going to do in the
next topic is completely

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,240
change the type of farming and
look the production of pigs

115
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,740
and poultry.
