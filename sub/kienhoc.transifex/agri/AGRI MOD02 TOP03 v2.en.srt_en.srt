00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,330
Now you may think that all
soils are the same, that

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,410
they're all dirt.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,310
But I need to warn you that I
used to be a social scientist,

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,880
and us soil scientists get
mighty grumpy when people call

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,770
soils &quot;dirt.&quot; Soils are
wonderful things.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,439
Now in this introduction to this
topic, I want to make two

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,360
important points.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,390
The first one is that
as we walk across a

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,780
landscape, soils vary.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,240
And the next point is
that the scale of

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,810
that variability changes.

13
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,410
For example, there are many
regions of the world where the

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,370
soils are reasonably uniform for
kilometres or even tens o

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,050
kilometres in any direction.

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,760
But at the other end of the
scale, soils can vary

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,370
dramatically within a single
farmer's paddock, and

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,060
sometimes even over distances
of a few metres.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,030
Now what the properties of the
soil are and how they change

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,870
has a huge impact on how
the property is farmed.

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,830
So after this introductory
section, I'm now going to go

22
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,370
into a little more detail
about two key aspects of

23
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,340
soils, and I'm going to
introduce you to two terms.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,070
The first one is the concept
of a soil profile, and the

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,839
second one is the concept
of soil texture.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,420
So let's look first
at a soil profile.

27
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,670
I have here a picture of a soil
from the top all the way

28
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,290
down to the bottom, and that
represents what we call a

29
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,420
social profile.

30
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,725
And within that profile
we can see that

31
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:55,679
there are some layers.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,500
Here, and down here.

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,560
And those layers are called
horizons, and soil horizons

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,630
are usually labelled by letters
of the alphabet

35
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,940
starting from the top.

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,870
So up here, we would
have A horizon.

37
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,950
And then as we move down through
the profile, we would

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,640
move through the B horizon.

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,380
And then all the way down to the
bottom here, we would end

40
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,560
up at the C horizon.

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,650
Now soils are formed in what
we term parent material.

42
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,040
This is the material that was
present in the landscape

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,540
before the soil started
to form.

44
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,679
And normally in a soil horizon
like this we find the parent

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,140
material down near the bottom
of the profile.

46
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,079
Now parents materials can
come from all sorts

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,920
of different sources.

48
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,380
They can come from the sill
and sand and clay that's

49
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,000
deposited by rivers when they
overflow their banks.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,920
They can come from material
that's been wind blown, and

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,010
the most common examples
of that are sand

52
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,600
dunes near the beach.

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,109
Or they can come from the
ash or lava that is

54
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,960
blown out of volcanoes.

55
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,990
But no matter what the parent
material is, once it's been

56
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:14,370
deposited in the landscape,
then soils start to form.

57
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,070
And during that formation
process, the soils get

58
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,430
colonised by plant material, as
we see here, and that plant

59
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,290
material produces roots and dead
litter that isn't eaten

60
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,400
by animals, and those can be
dropped on the soil surface.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,800
And at the same time, if there's
animals around, there

62
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,590
may be dung or animal urine also
dropped there onto the

63
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,570
soil surface.

64
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,799
And all this organic matter
dropped on the soil acts as

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,100
food for organisms that live in
the soil, things like earth

66
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,010
worms and bacteria and fungi.

67
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,049
And it's this organic matter
that gradually builds up in

68
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,260
the top layer of the soil that
we can see here that gives us

69
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,730
that dark coloured layer,
the A horizon.

70
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,369
And it's in this A horizon
that nearly all of the

71
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,530
fertility of the soil exists.

72
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,530
The size of the particles
that make up the

73
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,650
soil is very important.

74
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,320
The most obvious differences
in the size of particles we

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,589
can see in a stony soil.

76
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,330
There we have obviously stones
and sometimes large rocks, and

77
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,780
in between all those rocks and
stones there are pockets of

78
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,270
much finer material.

79
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,320
And this combination or fine
material and perhaps coarser

80
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,890
material is called soil texture,
which is the second

81
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,159
name that I want you
to remember.

82
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,880
Now the different sized
particles that make up the

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,520
soil have different names.

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,740
So if we go from the smallest
particles to the coarsest,

85
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,760
then we go through clay,
silt, sand, and stones.

86
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,250
So clay, the finest particles,
and stones are the coarsest.

87
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,390
In soils where we have a mixture
of different particle

88
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,650
sizes, which is very common,
so a mixture of clay, silt,

89
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,340
and sand, where those
combinations are reasonably

90
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,255
uniform, then we call
the soil a loam.

91
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,490
So a loam is a soil which has
got a mixture roughly even of

92
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,960
sand and silt and clay.

93
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,909
Now soil texture, as I've said
a couple of times, is really

94
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,220
important in determining soil
properties, and it's so

95
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,960
important that it's often
included in the name.

96
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,210
And the name of a soil can tell
us a lot about that soil.

97
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,799
For example, the soil on the
number four dairy farm at

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,010
Massey University is the
Tokomaru silt loam, and that

99
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,150
tells us first of all that
the soil is in a

100
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,840
region called Tokomaru.

101
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,679
The second thing is that it's a
loam, so it's got a mixture

102
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,920
of clay and silt and sand, but
of those three, silt is the

103
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,360
most dominant.

104
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,650
So to sum up this part of the
topic, soil texture is really

105
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,179
important to determining the
properties of the soil.

106
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,010
And the final thing I want to
talk about just in this

107
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,480
particular topic is the effect
that the slope of the land has

108
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,430
on farming operations.

109
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,970
The most versatile land or the
best land is usually the flat

110
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,470
land such as we see here,
a nice, flat plain.

111
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,500
That land can be used for a
wide variety of farming

112
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,855
operations.

113
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:41,490
As the land gets steeper, the
options we have for farming

114
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,720
become more restricted.

115
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,650
And until we get to really,
really steep hill country,

116
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,039
such as we see here, where the
options to the farmer for the

117
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,170
farming systems they operate
are very restricted indeed.

118
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,080
But it is interesting to see
that in some cultures, human

119
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,740
ingenuity has taken very
unpromising landscapes like

120
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,850
this and converted them into
highly fertile cropping land,

121
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:17,490
such as we see in this picture
of rice terraces in China.

122
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,575
So in summary, soils are
different, they vary across

123
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,520
the landscape, and they
are very important.

124
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,570
In the next topic, we're going
to explore soils in a little

125
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,920
bit more detail, and in
particular we're going to

126
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,960
focus on the biological life
that exists in soils.

127
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,361
