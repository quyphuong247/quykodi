00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,990
In the previous topic, we showed
the spectacular effects

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,090
of adding water to soils that
would otherwise be dry and

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,160
brown and the enormous increase
in plant growth that

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,460
can result from the addition
of that water.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,980
And when we add water to the
soil on purpose like that, we

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,700
call it irrigation, and
irrigation is very widespread

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,295
all around the world
in dry areas.

9
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:38,540
There are a huge range of
different technologies and

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,290
techniques for applying that
water, and we've got an

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,700
example of one on this slide
that is called a center-pivot

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,980
irrigator, and we can see that
it's applying water all the

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:55,760
way along this line here, and at
the same time these wheels

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,320
are moving in this direction.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,300
And so it sweeps round in a
big circle and applies to

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,700
water to a large area, and it
creates those spectacular crop

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,430
circles that we saw in
the previous topic.

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,330
When we irrigate, where do
we get the water from?

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,679
And there are two
main sources.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,600
The first one are rivers, and
the second one is what we call

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,630
aquifers, which are big,
underground reservoirs far

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,920
below the soil surface that
have built up over

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,220
thousands of years.

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,360
Now there are problems with
these sources of water.

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,710
Already we are taking as much
water as we really can out of

26
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,110
our river systems, and in many
areas of the world we are

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,580
really taking too much out.

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,120
If anything, we need
to cut back.

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,000
And more alarming still is
that in some areas of the

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,620
world, the levels in these huge,
underground aquifers is

31
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,030
dropping quite alarmingly.

32
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,060
So there is a prospect that at
some stage in the future,

33
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,610
we're going to actually run out
of a lot of the water that

34
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,730
we currently use
for irrigation.

35
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,500
And if we did do that, there
would be huge consequences for

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,610
food production all
around the world.

37
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,320
Well, what do we do about it?

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,390
It's going to be very difficult
to stop irrigation

39
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,820
without having widespread
food shortage.

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,989
But we can do one thing.

41
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,000
We can try to improve
the efficiency with

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,970
which we use the water.

43
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,300
We've got to make sure
we don't waste any.

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,040
And at the moment, we do
waste quite a lot.

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,739
And I want to give you an
example of how we can improve

46
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,670
that efficiency through a
process or a technology called

47
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,850
precision irrigation, and it
makes use of technologies that

48
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:49,609
we talked about in a topic
in the previous module.

49
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,520
Now to understand how that
technology works, I've just

50
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,190
got to explain to you a very
simple concept which is

51
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,190
fundamental to the growing of
plants and soils, and that's

52
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,700
the concept of soil water
holding capacity.

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,820
And to explain it, I want you to
imagine that we've got two

54
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,880
pot plants, with plants growing
in them, and both pot

55
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,079
plants have got the same area,
they've got the same diameter,

56
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,530
but one of them is twice as
high as the other one.

57
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,730
Now I think we can probably
understand that if we start to

58
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,149
water those two pots and slowly
put water in to both of

59
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,800
them at the same rate, it's
highly likely that the water

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,990
will start running out of the
little, shallow pot much

61
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,530
earlier than out of
the big, deep pot.

62
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,670
Now by that simple, little
experiment, we've demonstrated

63
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,890
what I mean by water
holding capacity.

64
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,510
The big pot can hold more water
than the little pot.

65
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,829
And there's another application
for that, because

66
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,470
if we let the plants grow and
didn't put any more water in,

67
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,770
we'd probably find that the
plant in the little pot or the

68
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,910
shallow pot would start
to wilt before the

69
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,160
plant in the big pot.

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,299


71
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,630
If we're going to put the right
amount of water on both

72
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,940
pots to start with, then we'd
have to come back to the

73
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,670
little pot twice as quickly
to irrigate again.

74
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,680
Now those concepts of water
holding capacity apply exactly

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,490
to irrigation in real
farm situations.

76
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,760
For example, in the field that
we've got here, the soil

77
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,580
underneath those plants
may be very variable.

78
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,740
There might be areas that are
stony and sandy, and other

79
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,890
areas that a silty.

80
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,840
Now the stony and sandy areas
would be like our little,

81
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,030
shallow pot.

82
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,760
They would have low water
holding capacity.

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,960
The silty areas would
have much higher

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,810
water holding capacity.

85
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,970
And so we can see that as our
irrigator moves around here,

86
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,510
if it applies the same amount
of water all the way along

87
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,630
that line, there will probably
be areas that are getting too

88
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,080
much water, and that water is
leeching out the bottom and

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,880
totally wasted, and perhaps
other areas that aren't

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,940
getting enough water.

91
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,080
Well, can we do anything
about that?

92
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,419
As it turns out, we can.

93
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,140
In the last module, we talked
about a new technology called

94
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,490
electromagnetic surveying, which
is a way basically of

95
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,580
determining the soil texture,
which is a mixture of sand and

96
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,669
silt and clay.

97
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,440
And using that technology,
we can draw maps that

98
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,865
look a bit like this.

99
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:35,880
This is an EM survey of a park,
but we could equally

100
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,909
well do it for the paddock under
the irrigation system.

101
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:45,390
And these colours basically
register different soil

102
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,710
textures, and by analogy,
different soil water holding

103
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,489
capacities.

104
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,600
So the red areas will have
very low water holding

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,595
capacities, and the blue areas
here will have high water

106
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:57,800
holding capacity.

107
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,380
Now when we did this survey, we
know the GPS coordinates of

108
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,180
all those points.

109
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,050
And so now we can go to our
irrigation system with new

110
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,410
technology on, and we could put
the same GPS recorders up

111
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,080
here, and now all the way along
this ridge, we could

112
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,909
identify exactly where it is
in the landscape, and by

113
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,870
reference back to that maybe we
could say whether the soil

114
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,840
underneath that spot was a sandy
soil or a silty soil.

115
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,294
And then, once we've decided
that, we could change the rate

116
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:35,680
at which water's coming out of
all of these sprinklers so

117
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,280
that we make sure that we're
applying exactly the right

118
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,799
amount of water all
over the paddock.

119
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,990
Now that's an example of a new
technology that will help us

120
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,416
make agriculture much
more sustainable.

121
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,160
Now in our next topic, we're
going to go and look at

122
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,320
something completely different,
and that's the

123
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,360
impact that agricultural
chemicals have on the wider

124
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,610
environment.

125
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,000
