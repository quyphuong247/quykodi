00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,700
Around the world,
dairy production

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,770
is increasing rapidly.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,630
The largest producer of dairy
products in the world is the

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,869
United States of America.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,540
Second comes India, and
third is China.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,830
As with all farming types,
there's a big range of dairy

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,409
farming systems around the
world, but they all have a few

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,090
essential features in common,
and that's what I want to

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,070
cover in this topic.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,640
So let's start.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,450
Now, the first obvious effect,
although sometimes it doesn't

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,270
seem to occur to people, is
that a dairy cow must get

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,090
pregnant and then have a calf
before she starts to produce

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,720
milk that we can use.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,589
We're going to consider how she
got pregnant in the first

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,010
place a little bit later on.

18
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,620
But at the moment, I just want
to focus on what happens to

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,128
the calves and the cow after
she's had her calf.

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,870
Now, the calves are usually
removed from the mother cow

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,790
one or two days after calving.

22
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,540
And what happens to them then
depends on their sex.

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,270
Being a male calf on a dairy
farm is, to be honest, not a

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,560
good career choice.

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,290
The prospects are
fairly limited.

26
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,700
But if you're a female calf, and
you come from a cow that

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,850
has got a really good record of
production, then probably

28
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,449
you will be fed and raised so
that eventually, you can take

29
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,640
place in the herd.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,740
But you won't be feed alongside
your mother.

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,759
You'll be taken away and
fed with a whole

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,770
lot of other calves.

33
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,310
So after calving, the cow
starts to produce milk.

34
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,360
And she will normally be milked
usually twice a day in

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,300
a specially designed
milking shed.

36
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,550
The question is, how much
milk would she produce?

37
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,320
Well, the answer is 20 litres a
day on average, although we

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,489
must remember that in the United
States, they might have

39
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,370
very high producing dairy
cows that would produce

40
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,820
much more than that.

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,489
But even if we stay with
the 20 litres, that's

42
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,750
quite a lot of milk.

43
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,130
I suggest that next time you go
to the supermarket, take 10

44
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,230
2 litre containers of milk and
put them on the floor all in a

45
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,130
heap and have a look at it.

46
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,200
If someone asks you what you're
doing, you can explain

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,329
it, and they can be as amazed as
you are about how much milk

48
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,020
one single cow can produce
every day.

49
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,530
Now, the actual amount of milk
that a cow produces depends a

50
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,500
lot on her nutrition.

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,460
The better she's fed, the more
milk she's likely to produce.

52
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,060
So obviously, it's in our
interest to feed the cow as

53
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,660
well as we possibly can.

54
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,170
But there's another reason why
we would want to feed the cow

55
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,440
very well, and that is because
not too long after she's had

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
her calf, we're going to want
her to get in calf again.

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,070
We're going to want her
to be pregnant.

58
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,739
The gestation period for a cow
is about nine months and nine

59
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:18,590
days, and usually, in systems in
Australia and New Zealand,

60
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,690
we want our cows to calf
more or less about the

61
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,770
same time each year.

62
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,230
And there's a very good
reason for that.

63
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,570
We want that time to be in early
spring, and by doing

64
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,320
that, it means that we coincide
the feed demand by

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,940
the cows with the rate at which
pastures are growing.

66
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,670
So as a consequence of that,
what it means is that a little

67
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,030
less than three months after
Daisy has had her calf, she's

68
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,030
going to be made
pregnant again.

69
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,360
And in most of our highly
developed dairy systems, that

70
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,390
process occurs through
artificial insemination.

71
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,790
And as part of those highly
developed dairy systems, there

72
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,420
are very rigorous and
sophisticated selection

73
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,959
programmes for raising bulls
that have really good genetic

74
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,060
attributes that produce
very, very high

75
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,180
producing dairy cows.

76
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,690
And the semen from those
favoured bulls is used to

77
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,170
inseminate hundreds if not
thousands of cows.

78
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,700
So the cow keeps on being milked
all the way through the

79
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,289
summer, but eventually, at some
time, we have to decide

80
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,150
when to stop milking.

81
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,109
And usually, that decision
depends on a couple of things.

82
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,910
First of all, during the
lactation, as we move from

83
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,120
calving on, the quantity of milk
that a cow produces does

84
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,160
tend to decrease.

85
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,850
Secondly, we may, in the autumn,
be running a little

86
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,360
short of feed.

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,900
So at some stage, we make the
decision that perhaps we'll

88
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,359
stop milking now, give the cow a
rest and let her recover and

89
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,000
get into really good condition
so that she can have her calf

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,770
in the early spring the next
year, and then the cycle will

91
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,859
continue on again.

92
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,890
So that's a summary of
what happens on a

93
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,270
dairy farm over a year.

94
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,090
And that brings us to the
end of this module.

95
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,450
In the next module, we're going
to look at a whole range

96
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,979
of different farming enterprises
that operate

97
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,750
around the world, and we're
going to start that by looking

98
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,450
at a couple of contrasting
types of dairy farms.

99
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,635
