00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,050
Welcome to this subject, which
is about agriculture and how

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,550
to fix the world that
we live in.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,010
My name's Russ Tillman, and I'm
a professor emeritus at

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,290
Massey University
in New Zealand.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,430
And for the last 40 years,
I've been working in and

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,050
around agriculture.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,670
And in this course, I hope to
share with you some of my

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,010
enthusiasm and passion for what
is a fantastic subject.

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,470
Now, agriculture can be defined
very simply as the

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:49,260
production of food and fibre
that we use to feed and clothe

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,269
the people of the world.

13
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,220
Now clearly, this
is a huge topic.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,360
And it is impossible to cover it
in depth in the four hours

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,720
that we have in this course.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,130
So instead of trying to do
that, I will give you an

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:13,070
overview of the subject and then
identify and discuss in

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,970
more depth some of the subjects
that I think are very

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,990
important today, or are likely
to be so in the future.

20
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,080
So let's get started.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,900
If we look at agriculture in the
21st century, we see that

22
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,680
it's changing rapidly.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,770
And that change is driven almost
entirely by population.

24
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,750
Now we all know that global
population is increasing, and

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,460
this is what we've demonstrated
or portrayed on

26
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,360
this graph.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,170
What it shows is the global
population from 1950 all the

28
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,110
way through to what
it's projected to

29
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,540
be in the year 2050.

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,310
In 1950, we can see that the
total was around about 2

31
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,010
billion people.

32
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,840
And in 2050, we project that
it's going to be about 9.1

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,290
billion people.

34
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:20,920
We are in 2013, which is halfway
between 2000 and 2025.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,269
And if we look up here, it comes
to a total of about 7.1

36
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,670
billion people.

37
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,790
So between now and 2050, it's
projected that there will be

38
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,459
about 2 billion more people
in the world.

39
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,890
Now those are huge numbers.

40
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,420
It's really hard to comprehend
what a billion

41
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,239
people looks like.

42
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,340
So if we looked at it another
way, we can see that the

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,710
world's population is increasing
by about 150 people

44
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,142
every minute.

45
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:54,190
Now, this topic is about
six minutes long.

46
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,970
So from the time that I started
speaking to the time

47
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,920
that I finish, there's going
to be about another 1,000

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,929
people in the world.

49
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,770
And by this time tomorrow,
there's going to be about

50
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,375
another 215,000 people
in the world.

51
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,360
Now, to put that in perspective,
that's about the

52
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,980
population of Hobart
in Australia, or

53
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,859
Hamilton in New Zealand.

54
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,890
Now imagine how much food
all the people in Hobart

55
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,480
would eat in a day.

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,820
Now that's the amount of extra
food that we're going to have

57
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,820
to grow tomorrow than
we did today.

58
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,000
And then the day after that,
we're going to have to grow

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,810
that much extra again.

60
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,340
And that is the challenge
that agriculture

61
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,190
faces in the 21st century.

62
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,910
Now in the next topic, we're
going to look at where this

63
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,930
increasing population is living
around the world.

64
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,759
