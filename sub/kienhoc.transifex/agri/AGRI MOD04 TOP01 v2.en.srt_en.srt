00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,980
Welcome to Module 4.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,220
In this module, we're going to
be looking at some of the

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,760
sustainability issues that are
impacting on agriculture all

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,510
around the world.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,890
And the first of those
sustainability issues that

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,270
we're going to be looking
at is the land itself.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,970
Is the land that we've got
available for cropping

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,070
increasing or is
it decreasing?

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,230
And are we going
to have enough?

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,430
So I've put up this diagram, and
it's one that you've seen

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,280
before, and it shows the
annual increase in crop

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,740
production for the world, and
for a couple of continents--

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,940
Africa and Europe.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,930
Now, in this topic,
I just want you to

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,840
focus on the red bars.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,860
And those bars represent the
area of land that is being

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,180
used for arable cropping.

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,400
And we see that in the world,
that area is increasing

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,230
slightly every year.

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,500
But then when we look at the
continents, we see hugely

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,750
different trends.

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,120
So that for Africa, that area
is increasing quite quickly.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,270
Whereas in Europe, the area
is actually decreasing.

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,009
So what on earth is causing
this to happen?

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,990
It seems that there's more than
one process going on,

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,890
some of them perhaps are
increasingly land areas, some

28
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,040
of them decreasing.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,940
And the balance of those
processes changes, depending

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,420
on whether we were in
Africa or Europe.

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,540
So let's have a look at what
those processes are.

32
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,900
And we'll start by looking at
the processes that will

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,690
increase land area.

34
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,429
And really, there's only one,
and it's a big one.

35
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,050
And that occurs almost
exclusively in the tropics,

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,270
and it's the result of cutting
down and then burning forest,

37
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,679
which is normally rainforest.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,720
And so this is converting land
that was originally in the

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,288
forest into land that we can now
use for arable cropping.

40
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:10,280
And that's a good thing
because we can

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,150
produce more food.

42
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,110
But around the world, there's
a lot of concern about this

43
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,030
process for a variety
of reasons.

44
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,290
And those reasons include the
effect on global climate

45
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,920
change, because doing this
process releases a lot of

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,559
greenhouse gases into
the atmosphere.

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,530
Another concern is that by
cutting down these forests, we

48
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,380
are reducing the area of land
or the habitat for earth's

49
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,640
amazing biodiversity.

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,190
And a third concern that
people have is that by

51
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,230
converting land in this way,
we're having a huge impact on

52
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,929
the indigenous people who used
to live in that area.

53
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,870
So let's look now at the
processes that might be

54
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,820
leading to a decrease in the
area of land that we've got

55
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,060
available for cropping.

56
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,770
And there are three of them.

57
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,250
One of them much bigger
than the others.

58
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,640
Those three are urbanisation,
something that I'll call

59
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,170
reservation, and I'll explain
in just a minute.

60
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,059
And the biggie, erosion
and desertification.

61
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,270
So let's go back and look at
the first one of those,

62
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,660
urbanisation.

63
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,890
And that takes us all the way
back to the very first module,

64
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,320
when we talked about the very
significant movement of people

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,829
from rural areas into cities.

66
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,470
And as those people move into
cities, they obviously want a

67
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,820
place to live.

68
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,290
And then when they get a bit
more wealth, they want a

69
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,864
better place to live,
a bit more space.

70
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:42,010
And so as a result of this,
these big cities around the

71
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,220
world are constantly expanding
on the edges, out into the

72
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,570
countryside where crops
used to be grown.

73
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,630
This is a good example of the
tensions we talked about in

74
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,390
Module 1, between the
requirements of urban dwellers

75
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,739
and those in the rural
countryside.

76
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,020
Another phenomenon that occurs
in developed countries is that

77
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,170
people start to become aware of
the values of land, other

78
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,140
than just what we can use
it to grow crops on.

79
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,919
So they might be very aware
of how land looks, the

80
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,399
aesthetics of it.

81
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,040
They might be aware of
conservation issues.

82
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,020
And so as a result of these
concerns, areas of land in

83
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,840
developed countries are being
set aside from agriculture and

84
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,989
conserved for other purposes.

85
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,550
Now, this is not a huge
movement, but it does result

86
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,710
in the decrease in land
available for cropping.

87
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,340
And now we come to the third
and the largest effect.

88
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,890
And that's a process--

89
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,530
processes really-- that
we call erosion and

90
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,059
desertification.

91
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,190
And I've got a map here which
shows where this is occurring

92
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,340
in the world.

93
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,760
Now, desertification's a
funny name, very long.

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,480
But what it actually means is
just creating a desert or

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,180
turning into a desert.

96
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,080
And so on this map, the areas
that are outlined in red are

97
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,940
the areas where there's the
greatest risk of deserts

98
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,820
expanding over existing
cropland, and so reducing the

99
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,300
availability of land
for cropping.

100
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,530
We can see around the world that
those margins or those

101
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,369
areas are already on the edge
of existing deserts.

102
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,970
And what happens is that as the
wind blows, it blows the

103
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,580
sand over the edge of the desert
where it is now, into

104
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,780
the surrounding land, and
gradually smothers whatever

105
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,380
plant material is there.

106
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,730
And so the desert constantly
expands.

107
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,770
And as this happens bit by bit,
the are of land that we

108
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,770
have available to us for
cropping is being decreased.

109
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,830
The major driver of this is lack
of plant cover, and that

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,789
lack of plant cover in turn is
driven by lack of water.

111
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,470
And so when we consider that
most of the areas that we're

112
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,340
looking at here are the very
same areas that we've already

113
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,950
identified as being the ones
where we're most likely to end

114
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,820
up with even less rainfall, and
therefore, even less plant

115
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,719
cover, we can see that this is a
process which is going to be

116
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,380
difficult to overcome.

117
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,469
So in summary, when we're
looking at the area of land

118
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,690
that we have available around
the world to grow crops on, we

119
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,570
can see that there's a number
of processes in place.

120
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,030
Some of those are leading to
an increase in area, others

121
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,750
are leading to a decrease.

122
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,940
And we need to be careful that
we keep those in balance so

123
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,650
that we ensure that we have
enough land to grow enough

124
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,359
food to feed our ever-increasing
population.

125
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,780
Now, in our next topic, we're
going to move on to a very

126
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,330
closely-related subject,
that of erosion.

127
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,079
