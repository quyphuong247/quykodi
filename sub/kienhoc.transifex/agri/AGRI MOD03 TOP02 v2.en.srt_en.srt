00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,950
As we have seen in previous
topics, beef production on a

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,625
global scale is smaller than
either chicken or pig meat.

4
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:25,680
But in some continents such as
the Americas, beef is more

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,070
important and comes in second
behind chicken.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,560
And even in continents like
Asia which normally don't

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,480
produce too much beef, in those
continents as wealth

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,319
increases, beef becomes a highly
prized meat and very

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,530
highly valued.

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,470
So beef production is a valued
product, and it is increasing

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,170
quite quickly through
the world.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,910
When we compare different
farming systems to produce

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,400
beef in America and in other
parts of the world, we see a

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,349
very similar division to what we
talked about with dairying.

15
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:10,720
In other words, the division
between production on feedlots

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,789
where the feed is brought to the
animal and production on

17
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,450
pasture-based systems where the
animal goes to the feed.

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,100
Now these two production
systems do produce some

19
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,570
differences in the meat, and
there's a huge debate as to

20
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,369
which is better.

21
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,495
That debate is unresolved.

22
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:35,590
Some restaurants you to go to,
I'm sure you will find them

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:41,900
extolling the virtues of their
tasty grass-fed beef, and

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,450
other restaurants will try
to sell you their tender

25
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,900
grain-fed beef.

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,450
In other words, both of them
seem to be able to make the

27
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,180
best out of the product.

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,040
We're not going to resolve
that debate.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,930
Now beef farming can be divided
into two parts.

30
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,250
The first part is breeding.

31
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,800
In other words, the production
of the calves that are

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,698
eventually going to grow up
to mature animals and be

33
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,720
slaughtered for our beef.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,220
So the first part is the
production of those animals,

35
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,600
the breeding.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,660
And the second part is what we
call the finishing or the

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,280
preparation and fattening
of the animal in

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,920
preparation for slaughter.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,589
Now those two operations are
often quite distinct, and

40
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,910
they're carried out by
different people

41
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,670
on different farms.

42
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,679
But in some parts of the world,
and particularly in

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,810
pasture-based systems,
there may be farmers

44
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,980
that do both of those.

45
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,030
In other words, they have a
breeding herd that produces

46
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,910
calves, and they keep
those calves until

47
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,440
they're ready for slaughter.

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,120
But you can go either way.

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,800
In most beef farming systems
around the world, the breeding

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,790
cycle, especially on
pasture-based systems, has to

51
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,030
be in tune with the pasture
growth cycle.

52
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,900
In other words, what we're
saying is that we want to be

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,210
able to give the cow as much
feed as possible after she's

54
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,290
calved, and the best time for
that to happen is in spring.

55
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,215
So we are going to try to make
sure that our beef cows calve

56
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,410
in early spring.

57
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,060
Now the difference between beef
farming operations and

58
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,670
dairy farming operations is what
then happens to the calf.

59
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,510
In the dairy farming operations,
remember, we took

60
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,329
the calf of the mother after
one or two days, but that

61
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,590
doesn't happen in beef
breeding operations.

62
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,050
Instead we leave the calf
on the mother for

63
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,580
quite a long time.

64
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,400
The reason, of course, is that
in dairy farming systems, we

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,230
want the milk.

66
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,060
But in beef farming systems, we
want the calf, and we want

67
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,070
the calf to grow as
fast as possible.

68
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,840
So we leave the calf on the
mother, and it drinks the

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,630
mother's milk for sometimes
many months.

70
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,410
So in New Zealand, for example,
we often calve in

71
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,190
early spring, which might
perhaps be August.

72
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,769
And then we won't wean or take
the calf of the cow until

73
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,560
perhaps the end of February.

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,000
And at that stage, when we do
take the calf off the cow, we

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,020
have a choice.

76
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,830
We might sell it to somebody
else who will fatten it for

77
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,750
slaughter, or we could possibly
do that ourselves.

78
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,470
Either way, usually the calf
is fattened up-- but of

79
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,520
course, by now it's
quite big--

80
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,120
and sold either at 18 months of
age or 12 months later at

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,630
about 30 months of age.

82
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,520
Now farmers have a choice as to
which of those options they

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,299
want to exercise.

84
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,220
The difference is really that
obviously the animal's much

85
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,140
bigger at 13 months, so you'll
get more money for it.

86
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,710
But in the meantime, of
course, you've had

87
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,599
feed it for 12 months.

88
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,840
Now once again, very similar to
a dairy farming system, the

89
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,119
different breeds of cows are
better adapted to different

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,170
environments.

91
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,260
So beef cows in the United
States will be different than

92
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,360
beef cows in the other
environments such as perhaps

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,940
in Scotland or New Zealand
or Australia.

94
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,540
Once again, the reasons
are very similar.

95
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,050
In countries such as Scotland or
New Zealand, the terrain or

96
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,920
countryside where beef farming
occurs can sometimes be quite

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,120
steep, and the climate sometimes
can be quite harsh.

98
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,330
So our cows have to be very
resilient because, once again,

99
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,430
exactly the same as in dairying,
we are dependent on

100
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,750
that cow not only having a calf
and raising that, but at

101
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,550
the same time we want her to get
pregnant again in time to

102
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,620
have another calf at exactly
the same time

103
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,450
the following year.

104
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,990
So she has to be a very
resilient animal.

105
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,070
That breeding to produce the
second calf, once again in

106
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,130
contrast to dairying, doesn't
usually occur through

107
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,030
artificial insemination.

108
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,859
Instead, that breeding will
occur by natural mating

109
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,420
between a bull and a cow.

110
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,000
So there are some big
differences, but there are

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,920
also some marked similarities
as we compare different

112
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,290
systems from different countries
around the world.

113
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,140
The same thing factors are
affecting them, but because

114
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,719
we're dealing with a slightly
different farming system, they

115
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,710
affect them in different ways.

116
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,349
Now what we're going to do in
the next topic is go down and

117
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,140
look at a much smaller animal,
and we're going to look at the

118
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,909
farming of sheep around
the world.

119
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,391
