00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,980
As we noted in a previous
topic, you might find it

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,420
surprising when we look at it
the fact that fruit and

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,910
vegetables make up the single
largest component of the value

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,470
of international trade.

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,259
The value of fruits and
vegetables is almost twice the

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,820
value of meat that is being
traded around the world.

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,900
So quite clearly, fruit and
vegetables are a very

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,210
important component of the
agricultural industry.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,520
Now, there's a huge variety
of fruit and vegetables.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,750
As we noted in a previous topic,
the average British

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,120
consumer might be able to have
access at various times of the

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,800
year to up to 450 varieties
of fruits and vegetables.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,199
So not only is there a huge
way or a huge variety of

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,470
different types of fruit and
vegetables, but there's also a

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,010
big variety in the way that
they're managed and grown.

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,170
So the management practises
involved in growing a crop

18
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,390
like the apples we see here will
be completely different

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,710
than the management practises
that are involved in growing a

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,970
crop of cabbages like these.

21
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,080
And of course, if we were to
grow different crops under

22
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,710
glasshouse conditions, the
management practises would be

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,919
different again.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,920
So instead of focusing the rest
of this topic on looking

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,040
at all these different
management practises, what I

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,940
want to look at is a slightly
different aspect of

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,880
horticulture.

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,649
Now, many, many years ago, as
we've noted before, most

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,480
people lived in country areas.

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,780
And perhaps, they either grew
vegetables and fruit

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,980
themselves, or they lived in a
community that grew its own

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,870
vegetables and fruit.

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,230
Either way, they would have
had access to fruit and

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,700
vegetables only really in the
season which it was growing,

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,660
and because they were very close
to where it was being

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,040
grown, they probably were
able to access it almost

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,359
immediately after it
was harvested.

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,950
Now, as we've noticed, or noted
in earlier topics, the

39
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,239
urbanisation of the population
is resulting in large numbers

40
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,560
of these previously rural
people moving

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,630
into towns and cities.

42
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,510
So now they're some distance
away from where those fruits

43
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,000
and vegetables are growing.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And so it's become increasingly
necessary to

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,660
transport and store those fruits
and vegetables, and

46
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,570
then move them to where
the consumers are.

47
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,239
And as I said, they may be in
a city that's reasonably

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,290
nearby, or as we've seen from
the international trade, they

49
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,620
may be on the other
side of the world.

50
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,410
Now, this has introduced new
requirements for those fruits

51
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,760
and vegetables.

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,010
And I just want to give you a
little anecdote to show you

53
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,399
how things have changed
over time.

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,960
When I was growing up, my
mother used to preserve

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,430
apricots, and those apricots
were grown about 300

56
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,690
kilometres from where
we lived.

57
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,060
And I remember every year in the
middle of summer, we'd all

58
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,350
be called to action stations,
because the

59
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,930
apricots had arrived.

60
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,060
And they'd be sitting on the
bench in these wooden crates,

61
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,560
and I remember that they always
tasted fantastic.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,810
But even by the time they'd
arrived at our place after

63
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,190
having been transported in a hot
truck up 300 kilometres of

64
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,020
highway, they were starting
to go a little bit

65
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,870
brown in some places.

66
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,010
And we had to work really hard
to get them all bottled that

67
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,350
very afternoon, or at latest the
next morning, because we

68
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,120
knew if we stored them for any
longer, they were going to be

69
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,996
way past their best and all
those brown patches would have

70
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:00,370
spread out.

71
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,790
So those varieties, they tasted
fantastic, but they

72
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,750
didn't store very well at all.

73
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,680
Now, the modern requirements
of being able to transport

74
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,650
these fruits possibly halfway
around the world mean that we

75
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,570
can't put up with
each situation.

76
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,115
And so we've had to develop new
varieties that are better

77
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:22,300
suited to the demands of
the global marketplace.

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,940
These varieties have to
be able to be stored.

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,400
They have to be able to be
handled, and they have be able

80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,310
to be presented after all of
that in perfect condition in

81
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,760
the marketplace.

82
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,969
Now, remember that's not only
happening for apricots.

83
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,060
That's happening for a
lot of these species.

84
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,280
And so, new technologies have
had to be developed to help

85
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,309
that to occur.

86
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,750
I've already talked about
the new varieties.

87
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,160
But as well as that, new
technologies for the transport

88
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,470
and storage of fruit have
had to be developed.

89
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,530
And people have developed ways
of controlling the atmosphere,

90
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,580
the gases in the atmosphere in
which at least some of these

91
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,990
fruit are transported
and stored.

92
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,400
And that composition of the
atmosphere retards, if you

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,299
like, the ripening of the fruit
until such time as we

94
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,380
can change the atmosphere and
all of a sudden the fruit will

95
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,650
start to ripen again just in
time for presentation in the

96
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,130
supermarket.

97
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,190
Now, we take a lot of
this for granted.

98
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,240
But I think sometimes we should
reflect back to all the

99
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,730
structures and systems that
are in place behind us.

100
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,170
In my country, I like to
think about bananas.

101
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,970
I live in New Zealand, and we
don't grow any bananas.

102
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,560
I'm not sure exactly where all
our bananas come from, but

103
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,540
it's a fair way away, I'm
pretty certain of that.

104
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,790
And yet, every day I walk into
my supermarket, I can always

105
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,360
buy bananas.

106
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,430
And they're always
very close to the

107
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,900
perfect stage of ripeness.

108
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,520
But I know that when I get them
home, if I don't eat them

109
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,469
for two or three days, they
start to get a little bit

110
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,510
black or darker colour, and
the flesh is a bit softer.

111
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,840
And if I leave them for another
two or three days, we

112
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,510
can only really make banana
cake out of it,

113
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,940
which is not all bad.

114
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,719
But it always strikes me as
amazing that how is it that

115
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,140
that supermarket can always have
bananas at the perfect

116
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,870
stage of ripeness for me to
walk in and get them.

117
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,490
And I think of the amazing
supply chain that must be

118
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,120
operating from the other side
of the world to harvest the

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,810
fruit, store it, transport it,
get it to New Zealand,

120
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,690
distribute it within New
Zealand, change the atmosphere

121
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,070
so its starting to come right,
and get it on the supermarket

122
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,370
shelves at the right time.

123
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,540
And remember, that's just not
happening for bananas.

124
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,570
That's happening for a whole
range of vegetables.

125
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,110
So sometimes, I think we need
to step back, and instead of

126
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,130
taking things for granted,
just look at the huge

127
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,030
organisation and the systems
that are in behind some of the

128
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,919
choice we have in the
21st century.

129
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,080
So that's a real quick
look at horticulture.

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,640
In the next topic, we're going
to move on and have a look at

131
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,000
viticulture and wine-making.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,724
