00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:08,990
[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,490
Now, in this topic, we're going
to take a look at some

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,550
of the new technologies
that are

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,900
transforming the way we farm.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,150
And by far the most important
of these new technologies is

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,640
the development of the global
positioning system, or GPS, as

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,830
we commonly call it.

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,169
Now, many of you will have got
experience on GPSes, probably

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,510
in your car and when you use
them to help you navigate

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,540
around a city, particularly if
you're not exactly sure where

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,460
you're going.

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,140
But we can use GPSes for many
other purposes as well,

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,370
particularly in agriculture.

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,900
And I'm going to just illustrate
three of those in

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,670
the rest of this topic.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,210
So we see the first
of them here.

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,850
And we've got a number of
components to this slide.

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,910
First of all, obviously,
we've got a quad bike

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,419
that is towing a sled.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,400
And on that sled, we have a very
sophisticated piece of

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,780
equipment called an EM survey
metre, or an electromagnetic

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,860
survey metre.

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,800
And basically, what that metre
is doing is it's measuring the

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,860
soil properties underneath
the sled at the moment.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,480
And the main soil property it's
measuring is related to

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,710
the conductivity of the soil--

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,949
how the soil conducts
electricity, or could conduct

29
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,220
electricity.

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,570
And the degree to which a soil
can conduct electricity

31
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,380
depends on two main
things, really.

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,750
It depends on how much water
is in the soil-- the more

33
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,640
water, the more electricity it
will conduct, and also how

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,010
salty that water is.

35
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,980
Now, in many countries--

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,930
although not Australia-- but in
many countries, how salty

37
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,840
the water is doesn't vary very
much, because we have lots of

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,000
rainfall that washes
it all out.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,610
And so the differences that this
EM survey metre will pick

40
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,920
up on many soils in many
countries is just mainly

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,530
differences to do with
water content--

42
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,500
how much water's in the soil.

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,330
And as we've seen in previous
topics, this depends on some

44
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,330
soil properties, and mainly the
soil texture-- how stony

45
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,250
the soil is, or how sandy
or how sooty.

46
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,900
So indirectly, what this metre
is measuring, in many cases,

47
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,890
is the soil properties
associated with soil texture.

48
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,079
So what else is in this
diagram here?

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,620
Well, on the quad, we've got a
very sophisticated and very

50
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,640
accurate GPSes.

51
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,209
And on the front of the bike
we've got a computer.

52
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,510
Now, what we do is we just drive
this quad backwards and

53
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,149
forwards across the paddock--

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,060
backwards and forwards--

55
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,800
faster than we can walk.

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,730
And many times a second, we are
taking a measurement with

57
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,769
the GPS to tell us
where we are.

58
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,350
And we are taking a measurement
with the EM metre

59
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,640
to tell us what's
underneath it.

60
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,859
And we're putting all that data
into a computer on the

61
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,640
front of the bike.

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,239
When we get to the gate at the
end, we stop the bike, we push

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,980
the button, and lo and behold,
we produce a matrix-looking

64
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,345
map like this.

65
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:14,460
This is actually a map of a park
in Palmerston North, but

66
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,960
exactly the same thing applies
to the paddock.

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,260
And we see there's a whole
lot of colours there.

68
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,390
And those colours tell us a lot
about the soil texture and

69
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,570
some other properties
of the soil.

70
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,519
So the blue bits here we know
are areas where the soil is

71
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,870
probably silty.

72
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,290
And the redder areas are areas
where we know it's sandy.

73
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,109
And we can use that information
in many ways to

74
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,570
help us with the precision
of our farming.

75
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,970
So that's the first application
of a GPS.

76
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,140
We have an example of
the second one here.

77
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,179
Now, this is a colleague of mine
who you might think is

78
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,440
just flying his little
model helicopter.

79
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,310
And I guess he's enjoying
what he's doing.

80
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,650
But actually, he is doing some
research, believe it or not.

81
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,890
Because that's just not an
ordinary helicopter.

82
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,790
On that helicopter, we've
got a GPS again.

83
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,160
And on the bottom of it, we've
got a very sophisticated

84
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,630
camera that's taking photos,
if you like, of the ground

85
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,579
underneath it, or in this case,
the pasture underneath

86
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,190
where this person is standing.

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,920
Now, it's not just
a normal camera.

88
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,200
Many of you will have seen
satellite images that have

89
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,670
been taken in different spectral
bands that make

90
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,330
forests look different
colours, for

91
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,219
example, from deserts.

92
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,280
Now, this is the same
principle that

93
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,010
we are using here.

94
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,010
So we can use the information
from the camera on the bottom

95
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,150
of that little helicopter
to tell us

96
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,620
information about the pasture.

97
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,610
We might be able to identify
areas where it's getting dry,

98
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,380
or perhaps where there's less
nitrogen in the grass in some

99
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,420
parts of the paddock
than others.

100
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,720
We might be able to identify
areas where a disease is

101
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,660
starting to set in.

102
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,520
So we could nip it in the bud
by treating that area very

103
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,530
quickly before it spread
over the whole paddock.

104
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,020
We can even do amazing things
like tell how nutritious the

105
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,280
grass is, how much digestible
matter it would have in it,

106
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,830
how useful it would be, or how
much value it would be, to the

107
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,190
grazing animals.

108
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,030
So once again, this is an
example of using GPS

109
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,599
technology, along with other
sophisticated technologies, to

110
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,230
enable us to be more precise in
how we treat our pastures.

111
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,980
Now, the third example that
I've got here is one that

112
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,265
we're just using for research.

113
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,990


114
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,550
Once again, we've got
a cow grazing grass.

115
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,840
But if you look around the neck
of this cow, you'll see a

116
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,090
whole lot of stuff hanging off,
a bit like necklaces.

117
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,719
Now, some of that equipment is
really just a sophisticated

118
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,060
name plate that we have.

119
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,740
But instead of saying Daisy,
it's got a whole lot of other

120
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,000
information about that cow.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,830
And it's electronic.

122
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,280
And so we know, for example, the
cow goes into the milking

123
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,219
shed, a sensor as she
walks will pick her

124
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,350
up, identify her.

125
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,570
When she goes into the milking
bale, it will identify which

126
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,469
cow is there.

127
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,610
And that enables us to measure
how much milk she produces,

128
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,740
and so we can keep very
accurate records.

129
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,320
Many cows, or virtually all cows
these days, have similar

130
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,180
sorts of identification
systems.

131
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,080
But on this one, we've got
something special--

132
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,320
that little box there.

133
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,370
And once again, that's a GPS.

134
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,120
And we're using this in research
to identify where the

135
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,760
cow walks in the day, for how
much the day is she standing

136
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,440
up, walking around eating, for
how much of the day is she is

137
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,240
sitting and resting.

138
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,690
And we can use that information
for all sorts of

139
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,870
other purposes to improve the
efficiency of our farming.

140
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,010
So these are just three
examples of using new

141
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,400
technologies to help us produce
more, but equally

142
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,229
importantly, reduce our impact
on the wider environment.

143
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,840
Now, on the next topic, we're
going to look at some more

144
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,570
technologies.

145
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,219
But these are not going to be
electronic technologies.

146
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,240
These are going to be biological
technologies.

147
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,704
