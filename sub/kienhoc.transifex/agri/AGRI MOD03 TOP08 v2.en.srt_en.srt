https://youtu.be/qQKqR42qTqg

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,820
Up to now, we've been
mainly focusing on

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,040
what happens on farms.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,860
But there's a whole range of
industries that don't actually

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,540
work on the farms themselves,
but are crucial to the success

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,900
of agriculture.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,299
And we're going to look at two
types of those industries.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,940
Now when we produce agricultural
products, we

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,180
either need to store them or
we need to process them

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,450
further before they're sold
on to the final consumer.

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,040
And there's a whole range of
industries that are in the

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,810
business of doing just that.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,870
They range from things like the
storage of cereal that we

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,780
see here in an example
from South Australia.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,430
Perhaps the processing of milk
into a whole range of

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,700
sophisticated dairy products,
as we see here in

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,260
a factory in Holland.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,210
Or it might involve the
slaughter and further

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,970
processing all animals.

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,750
An example here from France.

21
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,880
But whatever these industries
are, they are crucial to the

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,899
success of agriculture.

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,340
Interestingly, there's a range
of different ownership

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,560
structures for some of
these industries.

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,830
Some of them, in some countries,
are actually wholly

26
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,920
or partly cooperative
organisations that are owned

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,050
by the farmers who are producing
the products.

28
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,560
A really good example of that
is in New Zealand with

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,080
Fonterra which is a very large
cooperative dairy company.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,380
Others are private companies
or public companies.

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,449
But increasingly, no matter what
the ownership structure

32
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,820
is, they are becoming very
large, often multinational

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,940
corporations.

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,960
They operate around the globe
and have global supply chains.

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,579
Now as we've seen in the past,
globalisation offers the

36
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,460
opportunity to sell to more
customers and more countries.

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,950
But equally, on the other
hand, it does open us to

38
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,709
competition.

39
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,320
So we have to compete against
other multinational corporates

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,290
for selling our products
to these

41
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,840
increasingly discerning customers.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,750
And so these major
companies are

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,400
constantly having to innovate.

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,260
They're having to produce very
high quality, high value

45
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,230
products that are going to
satisfy the needs of our

46
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,310
increasingly discerning
customers, and at the same

47
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,910
time, meet the increasing
regulatory requirements to do

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,060
with biosecurity and food safety
that are being imposed

49
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,290
by the countries to which
we are exporting.

50
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,760
As a consequence, these
companies are constantly

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,200
having to adapt.

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,429
And those that don't adapt
in the end, fail.

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,660
And they're replaced by
entrepreneurial new companies

54
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,590
coming in to fill the space.

55
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,030
For example, in my lifetime,
the meat industry in New

56
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,060
Zealand has changed beyond
recognition.

57
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,790
When I was growing up, virtually
all of our meat,

58
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,730
particularly our sheep meat, was
sold overseas, mainly to

59
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,510
Great Britain, as deep-frozen
whole carcasses.

60
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,935
These days, the companies
that are exporting

61
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:36,660
are completely different.

62
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,790
And also the products that we
are exporting now are often

63
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,890
very high value cuts of lamb,
for example, like the rack of

64
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,390
a lamb, produced to very tight
specifications, chilled not

65
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,140
frozen, and sent to the
supermarkets of Great Britain

66
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,679
and Europe.

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,420
And then there is a second whole
class of industries and

68
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,790
businesses involved
in agriculture.

69
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,989
And these are the industries
and businesses that support

70
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,360
the agricultural production.

71
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,140
And they are very important,
particularly in rural

72
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:17,190
communities, and they often
employ a lot of people.

73
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,899
Now there's a big range
of these industries.

74
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,790
One of the most important,
interestingly, is banking.

75
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,670
Banking is crucial to farming.

76
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,730
In our developed countries,
really high producing farms

77
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,480
are very expensive, so clearly,
we need banks'

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,580
assistance if we're going
to buy those farms.

79
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,710
But also, during the year, many
farmers' incomes is very,

80
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,989
very lumpy.

81
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,280
They may only get two or three
paychecks a year when they

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,590
sell their crops.

83
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,869
Now those paychecks might be
pretty hefty, but nonetheless

84
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,080
we have to manage the
finances throughout

85
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,250
the rest of the year.

86
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,430
And there are often a lot
of upfront costs--

87
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,410
the cost of fertiliser, the
cost of seed, the cost of

88
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,770
running machinery.

89
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,190
And so our banks and the
facilities they offer are

90
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,980
crucial to the successful
operation of farming.

91
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,080
Interestingly, if we look in
developing countries, there

92
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,550
are a whole lot of innovations
happening in the banking

93
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,200
industry which potentially will
have a huge impact on

94
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,780
improving the productivity from

95
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,609
these developing countries.

96
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,150
As we've noticed in previous
parts of this course,

97
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,849
developing countries could
improve their yield hugely if

98
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,820
only they could apply a bit more
fertiliser or perhaps use

99
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,360
a bit better seed.

100
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,220
So banks are developing in
some of these developing

101
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,080
countries to provide what
we call microfinance--

102
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,390
small loans to farmers---

103
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,510
so that they can buy a little
bit of extra fertiliser to put

104
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,780
on their crops and then pay it
back later on when they get

105
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,690
their increased yield.

106
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,170
Now, in addition to banking,
there's a whole range of other

107
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,420
industries in these
rural areas.

108
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,150
And there are consultants to
provide advice to farmers.

109
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,370
There are veterinary
services for those

110
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,210
who are farming animals.

111
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:14,320
There are farm supplies to sell
anything from gum boots

112
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,670
to tractors to seed to
fencing materials.

113
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,780
And finally, the final class I
just want to talk about today,

114
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,669
are contractors.

115
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,390
Often in farming operations, we
need to use very expensive

116
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,789
equipment, perhaps to cultivate

117
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,424
or perhaps to harvest.

118
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,299
Now, that equipment's only used
once or twice a year.

119
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,570
And although some farmers will
own that equipment themselves,

120
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,870
many of them are reluctant to
have the huge capital tied up

121
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,745
in the equipment sitting in
the barn for basically 300

122
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:48,890
days or 360 days a year.

123
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,570
And instead of buying the
machines, they will employ

124
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,880
contractors to do a whole range
of different activities

125
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
on the farm.

126
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,020
And we see just some
examples here.

127
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,490
Perhaps they may hire a local
contractor to do the

128
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,990
cultivation of the soil.

129
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,270
They may hire a contractor to
harvest some or all of their

130
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,020
crops, as we see here.

131
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,890
And almost certainly, if they
have a need to fly on either a

132
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,610
pesticide or a fertiliser, they
will use an agricultural

133
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,830
contractor to do that
job for them.

134
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,740
So in summary, we can say that
not only does agriculture

135
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,970
involve what we produce on the
farm, but there's a whole

136
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,120
range of industries and a huge
number of people working to

137
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,110
support that production and to
process it and send it on to

138
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,910
the consumer.

139
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,270
Now in the next topic, we're
going to take a look into the

140
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,500
future and see some of the new
technologies that are being

141
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,850
used and will be used in the
future in agriculture in the

142
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,100
21st century.

143
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,545
