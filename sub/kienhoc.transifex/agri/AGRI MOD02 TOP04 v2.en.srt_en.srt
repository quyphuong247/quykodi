2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,090
Many people think that soils
are just lifeless lumps.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,820
But in fact, a soil is
teeming with life.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,100
It is almost a living
entity on its own.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,700
Now, obvious examples of the
sorts of life in soil are

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,090
earthworms.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,155
And we can see two of them
in these slides.

8
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:32,049


9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,920
It's often said that on a highly
producing dairy farm,

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,615
there's a great weight of
livestock under the soil than

11
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:43,680
there is on top.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,370
So when we realise that on such
a highly producing dairy

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,610
farm there are probably at least
three Friesian dairy

14
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,890
cows, and each of them weighs
probably at least 500

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,310
kilogrammes, we can see that
there's about 1 and 1/2 tonnes

16
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,570
of life live weight
above the soil.

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,355
And that surely translates into
an awful lot of organisms

18
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:03,330
under the soil.

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,350
Now, those organisms, obviously,
include earthworms,

20
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,770
as we've shown here.

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,300
But they also include many
other organisms--

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,890
millions and billions of
bacteria and fungi and a whole

23
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,140
range of other types of
organisms as well.

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,720
Now, in the soil, these
organisms feed on the organic

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,890
matter that comes from dead
roots, from fallen leaves from

26
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,310
plants, and perhaps
from the bodies of

27
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,360
already dead organisms.

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,340
And they take the
organic matter.

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,630
And they burn it and give off
CO2 in order to get energy.

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,869
And in doing that, they release

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,300
nutrients into the soil.

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, this process is
no different to us.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,020
When we got home tonight,
we're going to eat food.

34
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,280
Perhaps we might eat a steak.

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,250
Now, hopefully, tomorrow we
aren't any heavier than we

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,250
were today.

37
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:01,940
So what's happened?

38
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,720
We've eaten this steak,
which has got a lot

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,880
of protein in it.

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,869
And that protein has got
a lot of nitrogen.

41
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,669
And yet it's no longer
in our bodies.

42
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,980
Well, the obvious answer is
that we've excreted it.

43
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,380
And most of that nitrogen
will be in our urine

44
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,299
in the form of urea.

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,800
And if that urea was to land
on the soil, almost

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,620
immediately it would be
converted into a form that

47
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,480
could be taken up by plants.

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,470
So in that respect, we are no
different than earthworms.

49
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,100
And those nutrients, once they
hit the soil, are released

50
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,579
into the soil and can then be
taken up by plants again.

51
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,100
And so the cycle begins.

52
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,829
And this cycling of nutrients
is a common feature of many

53
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,400
agricultural systems.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,140
Now, soil organisms have lots of
other vital roles in soils.

55
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,549
And in some future topics,
we're going to talk

56
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,620
about some of them.

57
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,400
But in this topic, I just want
to finish off with probably

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,770
one of the most crucial roles of
soil biology as it affects

59
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,690
agriculture and, indeed, even
natural ecosystems.

60
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,079
I have put up here a diagram
that we're going to see

61
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,150
several times through
the next few topics.

62
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,470
It looks very complicated.

63
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,580
But what it is it's a diagram
of the cycling of nitrogen

64
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,440
through a dairy farming
system.

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,040
And the key concept I want you
to get from this is this

66
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,130
concept of a cycle.

67
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,870
So we can see all the arrows
moving around through the

68
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,305
soil, up into the plant, up into
the cow, through the cow,

69
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:38,177
back in dung and urine, and then
down into the soil, and

70
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,590
then cycling round and round.

71
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,810
So that's the concept
of a nutrient cycle.

72
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,430
But in this topic, I want to
focus on one particular aspect

73
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,990
of that nutrient cycle.

74
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,000
And this is what on earth
is happening here.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,390
Now, what we see there
are clover plants.

76
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,000
And underneath those clover
plants and the roots, we see a

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,500
whole lot of red-colored
lumps.

78
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,780
Or we call them modules.

79
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,480
So what are they doing?

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,950
And why are they here?

81
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,839
Now, I want you to cast your
mind back, perhaps, to a

82
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,990
couple of topics ago when we
presented a table of the

83
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,060
quantities of nutrients that
would be taken up by a dairy

84
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,760
pasture such as this
cow might eat on.

85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,190
And the key thing I just want
you to remember from that was

86
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,830
the nutrient which was taken
up in the largest amount.

87
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,229
And that nutrient
was nitrogen.

88
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,650
And over 700 kilogrammes, almost
3/4 of a tonne, of

89
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,900
nitrogen is taken up by that
pasture every year.

90
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,690
Now, if instead of pasture we
were growing a maise crop, I

91
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,250
bet the same thing
would apply.

92
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,490
Huge quantities of nitrogen
would be taken up.

93
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,770
And if we were growing that
maise crop, for example, in

94
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,620
the United States of America,
virtually all of that nitrogen

95
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,550
would be supplied to the crop
out of a fertiliser bag.

96
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,700
It would be supplied by an
artificial fertiliser that had

97
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,590
to be manufactured.

98
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,060
But in a dairy pasture like
this, we don't have to apply

99
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,870
very much nitrogen at all.

100
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,840
So what is going on?

101
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,770
Well, the secret is
that we've got

102
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,490
another source of nitrogen.

103
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,080
Now, nitrogen is very common
in our systems.

104
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,310
Our atmosphere is made
up 80% nitrogen.

105
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,070
Every time we breathe
in or out, we are

106
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,830
breathing 80% nitrogen.

107
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,659
But we can't use that nitrogen
and neither can most plants.

108
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,620
But there are some special
bacteria that can make use of

109
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,780
that nitrogen.

110
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,840
The only problem from the
bacteria's point of view is

111
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,440
that it needs energy to do it.

112
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,250
And so in the roots of those
clover plants, we've got a

113
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,400
deal going on.

114
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,060
The bacteria say to the clover
plant, if you let me live in

115
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,610
your roots and you give me some
of the carbohydrate that

116
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,170
you're producing in your leaves
so that I can have

117
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,450
energy, I will convert some of
the nitrogen in the air into a

118
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,039
form that both you and I can
use to make proteins.

119
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,820
And so that's the deal
that's being done.

120
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,450
I don't think they
sign a contract.

121
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,780
But it's just as important.

122
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,270
And so that's what these
red nodules are.

123
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,780
Next time you see a clover plant
or a healthy-looking

124
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,429
clover plant, perhaps you might
be tempted to dig it up.

125
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,200
And if you dig it up and very
carefully take the soil off

126
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,830
the roots, you will see these
little whitish or

127
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,640
reddish-colored nodules.

128
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,390
And they are the colonies of
these bacteria that are fixing

129
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,270
nitrogen from the atmosphere
and supplying it

130
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,599
to the plant roots.

131
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,140


132
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,349
So that is a fundamental
cornerstone of many

133
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,930
agricultural systems around
the world and also many

134
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,060
natural ecosystems, because, of
course, natural ecosystems

135
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,340
don't have nitrogen
fertilisers.

136
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,080
So in summary, the organisms
that live in soil have a

137
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,919
critical role in agriculture
and in natural ecosystems.

138
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,890
In our next topic, we're going
to move on and look at the

139
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,440
other way that we can
get plant nutrients.

140
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,830
And that's through fertilisers.

141
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,755
