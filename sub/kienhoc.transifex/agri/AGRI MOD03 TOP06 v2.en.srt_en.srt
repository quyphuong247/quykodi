00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,770
Historically, the best known
regions for the production of

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,790
wine have been the countries
of Europe.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,270
But increasingly in recent
decades, other countries in

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,439
other parts of the world
have become a major

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,460
producers of wine.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,950
Many of these countries are in
the southern hemisphere, and

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,919
we can think of countries such
as South Africa, Australia and

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,310
New Zealand, Chile as
examples of these.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,370
So the production of wine
is diversifying

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,930
right around the world.

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,540
And not only is the production
diversifying, but also the

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,500
consumption, and in recent years
major new markets have

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,730
opened up, particularly in Asia,
and China stands out as

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,379
an outstanding example.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,780
Now when we are trying to grow
vines that will produce really

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,220
good wine, the requirements for
the soil are almost the

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,820
opposite that they are
for most other crops.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,630
The first requirement is
that we have a really

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,310
free-draining soil.

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,760
It doesn't matter
if it's stony.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,190
In face, many of very high
quality wines are produced

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,750
from starting stony soils.

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,370
But we really do want it
free-draining so that it

25
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,860
doesn't get water logged
in winter.

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,440
The next thing that we really
do want is, paradoxically

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,780
really, we don't want the
soil to be too fertile.

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,120
We don't want those grape
vines to be growing huge

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,430
amounts of foliage.

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,020
Instead, what we are really
wanting those grape vines to

31
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,490
do is to put all their energy
into the ripening grapes that

32
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,330
will produce really
great wine.

33
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,860
And the next requirement is
that we have a suitable

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,930
climate, and the climate
ideally during the late

35
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,810
summer, early autumn ripening
period, it will have large

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,830
numbers of warm, cloudless,
sunny days which will enable

37
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,900
grapes to ripen, and we don't
want too much rain.

38
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,430
Eventually as the grapes get
riper and riper, we can then

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,910
pick the time, harvest them, and
start to create the wine

40
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,420
in the vineyard.

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,549
Now this rapid expansion of
grape growing in some of the

42
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,940
southern hemisphere countries
has meant major changes in

43
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,170
land use, and I've got an
interesting example from close

44
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,570
to where I live.

45
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,670
I live in Palmerston North in
the north island of New

46
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,410
Zealand, which is about 200
kilometres from Napier on the

47
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,760
east coast.

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,250
Now we've talked about Napier
before in an earlier topic

49
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,250
when were talking
about climate.

50
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,740
And we pointed out that Napier
has a climate which is not

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,060
very well-suited to dairy
farming, but it is very

52
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,300
well-suited to grape growing.

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,610
And the last 40 years as I've
driven between Palmerston

54
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,970
North and Napier, I've
seen some major

55
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,300
changes in land use.

56
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,940
As we get close to Napier, there
was an area of land that

57
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,579
for the first 20 years of my
travelling was stony, barren

58
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:23,090
land that at the most supported
a few straggly ewes.

59
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,140
I doubt whether anyone could
have actually sold that land

60
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,730
because I'm sure rates were more
than could ever have been

61
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,549
produced of it from
agriculture.

62
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,760
Now in the last 20 years as I
drive on exactly the same

63
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,079
road, I pass the area
and now it is

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,540
covered with grape vines.

65
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,489
And that area actually has got
a name, and it's called the

66
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,710
Gimmlett Gravels.

67
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:50,750
And those Gravels, that area,
is famous in New Zealand now

68
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,430
for the production a very
high quality red wines.

69
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,340
So that's an example of changing
land use, changing

70
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,020
land value.

71
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,320
Goodness knows how much that
land is worth now.

72
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,250
Now these individual
attributes of

73
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,890
a particular site--

74
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,119
its soils, its climate, its
aspect, where it is in the

75
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,540
landscape--

76
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,000
all have a big impact on the
production of the wine and the

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,790
way the wine tastes
afterwards.

78
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,110
The French have given
it a special name.

79
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,310
They call it the &quot;terroir.&quot;
Well, at least that's my

80
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,930
pronunciation of it.

81
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,360
But there's no doubt that it
is an integral part of the

82
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,250
mystique of making wines.

83
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,430
So the production of wine and
the grapes that are going to

84
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,470
make that wine are very
different from most

85
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,580
horticulture.

86
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,890
In making wine, there's a real
trade off to be had.

87
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:53,169
The vineyard really has to
decide between the quality of

88
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,860
the grape and the quantity,
because they are often almost

89
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,910
mutually exclusive.

90
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,150
As you go for more quantity,
you compromise quality.

91
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,130
And so the judgement has to be
made that if you're going to

92
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,440
go for small quantities of very
high quality grapes, then

93
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,420
of course you have to get a very
high price for your wine.

94
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,560
So that's a really quick look
at viticulture and wine

95
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,510
production.

96
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,880
We're going to move on
in the next topic to

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,400
look at organic farming.

98
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,145
