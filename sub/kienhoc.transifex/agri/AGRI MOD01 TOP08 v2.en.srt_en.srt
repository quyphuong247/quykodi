00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,220
Welcome to this topic where
we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,920
how the food that's traded
around the world reaches the

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,310
eventual consumer.

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,119
Now I'm sure you all recognise
what this is on the

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,290
screen behind me.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,619
And if you live in a major
metropolitan area or even a

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,250
small town, you've probably
got a choice of which

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,450
supermarket you want to buy
your products from.

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,980
Supermarkets dominate the
selling of food in Australia

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,050
or in New Zealand and
in many other

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,029
countries around the world.

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,700
But interestingly, not
all countries.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,500
And it hasn't always
been this way.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,140
When I was growing up, which
admittedly is quite a long

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,670
time ago, my mother used to ring
up the local grocer and

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,519
the local butcher and order
her groceries and meat.

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,840
And they would package it up and
deliver it to us, either

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,570
that afternoon or
the next day.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,339
Of course, the cost structures
involved in doing

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,180
that were very high.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,870
And as supermarkets were
established, the little local

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,450
grocers and butchers couldn't
compete on price.

24
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,110
And so eventually, they
went out of business.

25
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,380
But to me, it's a little bit
ironical when my kids, for

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,070
example, start to order from
supermarkets online the

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,490
products that they need.

28
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,410
So they're all packaged up and
ready to be picked up on the

29
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,630
way home from work or perhaps
even delivered to their door.

30
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,520
Now, at the start of the topic,
I said that if you

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,160
lived in a metropolitan area,
you probably had a choice of

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,030
supermarkets where you
could buy your food.

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,470
But interestingly, the
choice of supermarket

34
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,640
chains is not so great.

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,690
What we've observed over the
years that intense competition

36
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,100
between supermarkets has
forced mergers and

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,870
acquisitions, so that the number
of supermarket chains

38
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,180
has decreased quite
dramatically.

39
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,430
And I was reading an article
the other day where it was

40
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,170
predicted that in the future,
on a global scale, the

41
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,010
retailing of food might be
dominated by four or five

42
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,459
international supermarket
chains.

43
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,110
And the manufacture of food
might be carried out by

44
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,110
perhaps up to 10 huge
multinational companies.

45
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:49,790
But supplying those companies
would be a myriad of producers

46
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,429
from all around the world.

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,410
Now you may well ask why, in a
course on agriculture, we are

48
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,140
talking about supermarkets.

49
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,619
But this is just another example
of the phenomena of

50
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,290
globalisation that I was
talking about in

51
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,150
the previous topic.

52
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,650


53
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,000
What we have found is that over
the years, the reduction

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
in tariffs, the reduction in
transport costs, improved

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,520
communication, have made it
possible for supermarkets to

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,430
purchase and access products
from all around the world.

57
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,780
Now this has created
opportunities for growers and

58
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,410
producers in many developing
countries.

59
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,170
Because of the low cost
structures in those companies,

60
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,820
it enables them to compete very
effectively on price for

61
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,519
these major supermarket
chains.

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:59,760
Of course, this intense
competition from competitors

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,730
with lower cost structures
isn't appreciated by the

64
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,440
traditional producers
in the home country.

65
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,380
And governments react to
this in different ways.

66
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,430
In many developed countries,
governments have reacted by

67
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,990
subsidising the production of
at least some food stuffs in

68
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,860
their own country.

69
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,640
Quite clearly, this process
of subsidisation is not

70
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,950
appreciated by the producers in
the developing countries.

71
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,520
And the questions of subsidies
has been debated endlessly in

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,919
international meetings for as
long as I can remember, and I

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,550
suspect into the
future as well.

74
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,280
At the moment, there really
isn't a solution in sight.

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,020
Now, it isn't only in the
developing countries that this

76
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,900
globalisation of agriculture
can create issues or

77
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,419
difficulties.

78
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,350
I was in a country a couple
of years ago that had very

79
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,130
successfully completed a whole
series of free trade deals

80
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,010
with other large developed
countries.

81
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,909
And this had enabled the
producers of fruits and

82
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:16,010
vegetables in this country to
develop enormous markets.

83
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,039
The economy of the country as a
whole was doing really well

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,720
out of this.

85
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,580
But free trade deals
work both ways.

86
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,990
And while these deals enabled
the horticultural producers in

87
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,470
the country to access much
larger market, it also exposed

88
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,020
the dairy farming in that
country, which had had a

89
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,890
highly protected and secure
domestic market. , It exposed

90
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,000
that dairy industry to the chill
winds of competition

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,230
from other producers around
the world that were more

92
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,780
efficient and had lower
cost structures.

93
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,090
Clearly they were not
happy with this.

94
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,969
So in summary, we can see that
the development of powerful

95
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,890
supermarket chains and the
globalisation of food

96
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,250
production and purchase is
providing opportunities for

97
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,430
producers in many developing
countries.

98
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,170
However, to take advantage of
those opportunities, the

99
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,540
growers and producers in those
countries are likely to have

100
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,820
to develop new skills and
quality control procedures, so

101
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,020
that they can meet the
requirements of the

102
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,990
supermarket chains.

103
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,710
It is these new skills and
quality control procedures

104
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,940
that we'll be talking about
in the next topic.

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,356
