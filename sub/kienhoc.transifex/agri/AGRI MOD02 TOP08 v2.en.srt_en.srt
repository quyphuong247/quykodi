00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,870
In the last topic, we introduced
the idea of soil

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,160
structure and how a
well-structured soil makes it

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,200
very easy to cultivate
and prepare a

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,570
really good seed bed.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,730
Whereas if the soil structure
has deteriorated, it's much

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,210
more difficult to do.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,810
Of course, there are
ways around it.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,200
I mean it's often said as a bit
of a joke I think that the

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,920
only difference between men and
boys is the size of their

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,220
toys, and it is possible to
always go out and buy an ever

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,110
more powerful tractor that we
can use to smash up the soil,

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,910
no matter how bad the structure,
and in the end, end

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,519
up with some sort of seed bed.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,810
But that uses heaps of energy,
and probably, the final

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,780
outcome isn't all that
good anyway.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,420
So there are other ways that we
can approach this problem.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,310
And the first of those
ways is to look

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,730
at alternative machinery.

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,300
And what we're trying to avoid
is this situation that we've

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,460
showed you in early slides.

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,270
And that is the cultivation of
the soil or the turning it

23
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,330
over by the action
of ploughing.

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,280
Over the last 25 years, new
technologies have developed,

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,650
which enable us to plant crops,
the seeds of crops

26
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,730
right into the soil without
turning it over.

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,220
And those processes are called
minimum tillage.

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,510
There's many different
technologies there, and

29
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,250
they're gradually evolving
as we go on.

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,670
But increasingly larger areas
of the world's crop land are

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,270
using minimum tillage techniques
to reduce or

32
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,820
maintain the soil structure
and have other good

33
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,600
environmental benefits.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,380
So that's one way that
we can overcome or

35
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,360
maintain good soil structure.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,180
Another way is to introduce the
concept of crop rotations.

37
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,130
Now, in many what we would call
cropping farms around the

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,869
world, if we were to look at
them at any one point in time,

39
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,320
we'd say that not all of the
farm was actually being used

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,739
for cropping.

41
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,180
Probably, a significant
proportion of it, perhaps up

42
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,980
to half, would actually be under
pasture and being grazed

43
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,720
by animals, and the other half
of the farm, there would be a

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,540
range of crops.

45
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,239
So if we look at a particular
paddock, we might find that

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,070
one spring, the farmer would
plough it up, and it had been

47
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,290
in pasture, so the farmer
would plow it up.

48
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,890
And because it had been in
pasture, it would have really,

49
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,920
really high levels of organic
matter, and it would be very

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,959
easy to prepare a really
good seed bed.

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,150
And so the farmer would plough,
and then might plant a

52
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,620
crop, perhaps potatoes
for example.

53
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,780
And the next year, in that
paddock, the farmer would

54
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,450
plant a different crop,
perhaps wheat.

55
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,049
And then the next year,
perhaps maise or corn.

56
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,930
And then in the fourth or fifth
year, perhaps back in a

57
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,430
second crop of potatoes.

58
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,760
And then what the farmer would
do is put it back into

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,380
pasture, and it would stay in
pasture for five years before

60
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,930
the cycle would begin again.

61
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,670
And so what we would see if we
looked at that farmer over a

62
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,730
series of years is a mixture
of different enterprises

63
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,890
gradually marching their
way around the farm.

64
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,029
And we can see how they would
have a really beneficial

65
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,510
effect on the soil structure,
because when it's under

66
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,929
pasture the soil would be

67
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,390
building up its soil structure.

68
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,260
And then for the next four
years, it would be really easy

69
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,200
to cultivate and create
a good seed bed.

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,140
And then just when it's getting
a bit tired, it would

71
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,959
be back into pasture again.

72
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,430
So that's a clear advantage
for crop rotations.

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,280
But there are some other
ones as well.

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,110
For example, as many people
observe in their vegetable

75
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,020
garden, it's not a very good
idea to plant exactly the same

76
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,640
crops in exactly the same
part of the vegetable

77
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,299
garden every year.

78
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,000
And the reason is because
diseases and pests seem to

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,900
build up in the soil
from year to year.

80
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,860
So we can break that cycle if we
move the crop from paddock

81
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,450
to paddock as the years go by.

82
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,600
So that's another advantage
for crop rotations.

83
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,360
There are a couple of other
advantages, which are of a

84
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,220
more practical nature.

85
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,520
For example, crop rotations,
if we have a range of

86
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,210
different enterprises on the
farm, like different crops and

87
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,960
pasture, it will spread the
cash flow for the farmer.

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,120
If a cropping farmer only has
one crop, then they only get

89
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,850
one pay check a year.

90
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,490
It may be a very big
paycheck, but it

91
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,750
makes budgeting difficult.

92
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,930
Whereas if we've got a range of
crops, then we get a range

93
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,750
of income streams.

94
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,830
And that reduces risk, and
it reduces risk in

95
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,409
another way as well.

96
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,390
Because if we only have one type
of crop on a farm, then

97
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,710
probably we need to plant the
whole farm over a very short

98
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,349
time frame.

99
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,750
And probably we need to harvest
it over a similarly

100
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,870
short time frame.

101
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,630
So if we get terrible weather
during that critical period,

102
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,969
then that poses a huge risk.

103
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,870
So we can see in summary that
there are a range of things we

104
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,920
can do to protect the structure
of our soils and

105
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,330
enable us to farm more
sustainably.

106
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,539
Now, in the next topic we're
going to move on and start

107
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,850
looking at farms that
farm animals.

108
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,349
