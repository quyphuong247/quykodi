00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,410
Welcome to Module 3.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,820
In this module, we're going to
start by looking at a range of

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,370
different farming types
around the world.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,830
And then we're going to take a
look into the future and see

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,659
the possible application
of the new information

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,870
technologies to agriculture.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,200
But first of all, we're going to
move on from where we were

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,480
in the last topic, which was
looking at the calendar of

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,419
events that occurs
on dairy farms.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,270
And we made the point that these
are things which are

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,810
reasonably common to
all dairy farms.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,540
In this topic, we're going
to focus instead on some

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,890
differences between contrasting

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,880
dairy farming systems.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,420
And those systems are, firstly,
a feedlot-based dairy

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,380
farming system, such as might
occur in very industrialised

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,170
countries, like the
United States.

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,250
And the other farming system
is a pasture-based system,

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,460
which occurs in many places
around the world, including

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,080
New Zealand and Australia.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,470
But let's start first of
all looking at the

23
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,660
feedlot-based system.

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,390
Now, we have a picture
here of a feedlot

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,460
in the United States.

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,520
It's the largest dairy
feedlot in Arizona.

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,250
And in that feedlot, there
are going to be a

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,060
huge number of cows.

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,630
Now, the advantages of feedlot
systems are firstly, as we can

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,880
see here, it is a very
controlled environment.

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,759
The next thing is that because
in a feedlot we bring the feed

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,240
to the cows, we have a
lot of control over

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,449
what we give them.

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,830
We can control how much
we give them.

35
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,940
And because we're bringing the
feed in, we can make up the

36
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,360
menu so that we are absolutely
sure it's going to produce the

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,330
greatest amount of milk.

38
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,130
We can combine foods from
different farms into the

39
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,540
optimum mixture.

40
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,600
Now, because we can control the
nutrition so precisely, it

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,410
means that we are able to
achieve very high per cow

42
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,890
production of milk.

43
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,350
Now, sometimes when we are
producing such huge amounts of

44
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,340
milk from cows, it's very
difficult to get them in calf

45
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,840
again in time for them to have
their calf at exactly the same

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,960
time the next year.

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,830
But in a feedlot production
system, that isn't too much of

48
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,730
a problem, because the feed or
the feed supply is really

49
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,760
independent of the season,
because we are buying it in

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,989
and feeding it out as
and when we need it.

51
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,950
So in some feedlot systems, we
may find the cows don't have

52
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,940
to calf every year.

53
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,020
It much stretch out to 13
or 14 months sometimes.

54
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,230
But the key point is that
because the feed supply is

55
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,929
independent of the season, that
doesn't matter too much.

56
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,180
So there's some real advantages

57
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,820
with feedlot systems.

58
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,510
But there are some downsides
too, of course.

59
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,910
And one of those is cost.

60
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,350
It does cost more to harvest
all that feed, process it,

61
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,799
transport it to the feedlot, mix
it up, and then distribute

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,080
it to the cows.

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,250
Another possible disadvantage is
that that cost is probably

64
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,140
also reflected in energy

65
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,589
requirements to run the system.

66
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,020
So that's a feedlot system.

67
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,230
The big contrast is with a
pasture-based system, such as

68
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,280
we see here.

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,540
And the difference is that this
whole system is based

70
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,700
around seasons.

71
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,950
And to understand this, we just
have to understand that

72
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,049
the amount of feed that a dairy
cow, such as we see

73
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,230
here, requires varies
throughout the year.

74
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,470
Sometimes in the year,
they need more feed.

75
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,380
And other times they
need less.

76
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,680
The times they need more feed is
when they're being milked.

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,420
And then when they're dried off
and are not being milked,

78
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,910
they don't need as much feed.

79
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,870
They may need only about perhaps
60% of the feed.

80
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,700
Now, in the same way as the
amount of feed that a dairy

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,969
cow requires varies through the
year, the rate at which

82
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,510
the pasture is growing also
varies through the year.

83
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,560
So it's usually highest in
spring, might drop down a bit

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,560
in summer, because, perhaps,
we're running out of water,

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,970
perhaps go up again in autumn,
but certainly, it'll drop down

86
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,090
again in winter.

87
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,450
So we have a varying pattern
of animal demand.

88
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,979
And we have a varying pattern
of pasture growth.

89
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,750
And the huge skill in managing
pasture-based systems is to

90
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,980
match those two patterns as
closely as possible together.

91
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:23,140
So we are wanting the demand by
the cow to match as closely

92
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,349
as possible the supply
by the pasture.

93
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,030
And it's for that reason that
it's so important for us to be

94
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,090
able to calve at the same
time each year.

95
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,549
If we can't calve in early
spring, what it does mean is

96
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,010
that when we do eventually
calve, we might be

97
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,420
running out of feed.

98
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,870
And that will cost us hugely
in milk production.

99
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,330
So that is why in pasture-based
systems it's so

100
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,340
important that we provide very
good nutrition to the cow in

101
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,799
order that we can get her back
in calf again in time so that

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,410
she can calf a calf in early
spring the following year.

103
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,340
Now, in order for that to
happen, the cows that we farm

104
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,229
in New Zealand have to have
slightly different attributes

105
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,230
than the cows that are in
feedlots in the United States.

106
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,180
I like to contrast it
with athletics.

107
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,480
If we look at 100-metre runners
and 1,500-metre

108
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,120
runners, they look like
very different people.

109
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
But in actual fact, they're
both people.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,990
And they're both athletes.

111
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,340
And in terms of their events,
they both want to get from A

112
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,669
to B as fast as possible.

113
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,020
It's just that A and B are a bit
different or are further

114
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,240
apart in the case of a
1,500-metre runner.

115
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
But the implications of that are
that when we look at them,

116
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,300
we see the build of
those runners

117
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,870
as very, very different.

118
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,190
They have to have different
attributes.

119
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,980
And it's exactly the same with
this dairy farming contrast.

120
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,690
In both the feedlot and the
pasture-based system, we are

121
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,200
dealing with dairy cows.

122
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,750
And the aim in both
is to produce as

123
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,390
much milk as possible.

124
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,200
But the conditions are
very different.

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,700
And because of that, the
attributes of the cows also

126
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,560
have to be different.

127
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,000
In general, we find that dairy
cows on pasture-based systems

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,950
produce less milk than
feedlot systems.

129
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,289
But the cows are
more adaptable.

130
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,280
They are resilient in the
face of more challenging

131
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,919
environments, because they often
have to be outside when

132
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,000
it's wet and cold.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,370
And they have to walk quite long
distances to get milk.

134
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,947
And we still want them to get
pregnant at the right time of

135
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:42,130
the year every year.

136
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,630
Now, of course, it
isn't strictly

137
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,780
an either or situation.

138
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,799
In pasture-based systems like we
see here, it is possible if

139
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,770
we are short of pasture to buy
in supplementary feeds and

140
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,510
feed them to these cows
instead of or

141
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,960
as well as the pasture.

142
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,960
But there are some costs
associated with that.

143
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,780
As we've pointed out, it costs
money to harvest feed,

144
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,250
transport it, and then
feed it out again.

145
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,900
Whereas growing the pasture in
the paddock like this is quite

146
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,330
a bit cheaper.

147
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,280
So once again, another
fundamental skill of pasture

148
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,119
management is that if we are
buying in supplementary feed,

149
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,240
we want to make sure that the
cows eat all of the grass

150
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,760
that's available
to them first.

151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,179
And then we'll top it up
with the supplements.

152
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,089
We don't want to give the cows
a whole lot of supplements

153
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,520
first and then find that they've
left a whole lot of

154
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,780
this nice, cheap feed
in the pasture.

155
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,500
It's a bit like when
we're children.

156
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,280
Our parents tell us that we've
got to eat all our greens

157
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,689
before we get our pudding.

158
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,450
So that's the end of this
topic on dairy farming.

159
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,190
And in the next topic, we're
going to move on and have a

160
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,440
look at beef farms.

161
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,002
