2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,129
I'm sure in whatever country
you live, there are images

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,560
that are typically associated
with agriculture.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,830
For example, in New Zealand we
might think of our farmers as

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,959
being rugged individuals
with their dogs

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,520
riding on a quad bike.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,260
And these images are real, but
they're not the only images

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,019
associated with agriculture.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,220
And I hope through doing this
course that you become aware

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,089
that there's a wide range of
careers and opportunities in

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,940
the agricultural area.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,839
Because if we look forward into
the future, we can see,

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,960
or have a think about, what
agriculture will be like.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,370
The first thing is that
it's going to be even

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,279
bigger than it is now.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,150
Remember we discussed how the
quantities of food we're going

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:08,470
to produce by 2050 will be 60%
more than they are now.

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,890
It's going to be integrated
globally.

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,010
Supply chains are going to
stretch right around the world

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,590
to bring products from all
different countries into our

21
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,400
supermarkets.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,460
It's going to be increasingly
corporatised.

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,479
There will still be room in many
countries for the small

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,400
family owned farm, but
increasingly, our farming

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,770
activities are going to be
carried out by businesses--

26
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,110
some of them international
businesses.

27
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,840
It's going to be increasingly
high tech.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,880
It's going to be increasingly
environmentally

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,050
and ethically aware.

30
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,170
And the people that are involved
in agriculture

31
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,970
increasingly are going to have
to be better educated.

32
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,070
But from my point of view, above
all, agriculture in the

33
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,160
future is going to be even more
exciting than it is now.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,149
So it doesn't matter what
your interests are.

35
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,490
Whether you like working
outdoors and like working with

36
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,220
animals, whether you like
working 50 stories up in a

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,430
high rise, wearing a three-piece
suit, being

38
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,410
involved in international
business, or whether your real

39
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,540
interest is IT.

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,359
In any of those opportunities,
or any of those fields,

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,010
agriculture has huge
opportunities.

42
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,140
And I hope that by doing this
course you will have come a

43
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,519
little bit more aware of the
possibilities that exist, and

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,740
perhaps even have identified a
couple of areas where you'd

45
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,650
like to do further study.

46
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,550
Now finally, I'd like to
make a general point.

47
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,730
The first thing is that we've
seen that agriculture is

48
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,329
absolutely vital to the
feeding of the world's

49
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,860
population.

50
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,370
And in this course, we've also
raised a couple of issues--

51
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,450
sometimes controversial
issues.

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,040
They're issues to do with the
environment, and they're

53
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,510
issues to do with the ethical
treatment of animals.

54
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,760
Now, it's often said that
countries get the governments

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,390
they deserve.

56
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,119
And I often extend that to say
that the world is going to get

57
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,920
the agricultural that
it deserves.

58
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,880
Often when we go into a
supermarket, we are confronted

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,732
with a choice of which
product we will buy.

60
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:27,890
Those products may differ in
price, or they may differ in

61
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,809
the way they were produced.

62
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,010
Now when we choose which product
we will buy, we are

63
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,649
sending a signal
to the market.

64
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,910
And that is what I mean when I
say that we're going to end up

65
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,930
with the agriculture
we deserve.

66
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,830
Now before we make that choice,
we really do need to

67
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,230
be aware of what is involved.

68
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,500
And I hope that by doing this
course you will be more aware

69
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,260
perhaps than when you started of
some of the issues that are

70
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,440
facing agriculture in
the 21st century.

71
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,609
So that brings us to the
end of this course.

72
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,990
Thanks for staying with me,
and I'll see you again.

73
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,674
