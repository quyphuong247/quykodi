2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,830
Now you've seen this
diagram before.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,540
What it shows is the
contribution of different

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,320
foods to global energy intake,
and I've put it up again just

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,310
to stress once more the real
importance of plant products,

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,549
crops, to the nutrition of
the world's population.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,380
And we can see from this diagram
that there are quite a

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,940
range, a large range, of
different crops that are grown

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,669
around the world.

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,800
And not only are there a wide
range of different crops,

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,269
they're grown in many different
ways depending on

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,630
the climate and other

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,570
constraints that may be applied.

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,260
But although there's this wide
range in the types of crops

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,670
grown and the way they're grown,
there are some common

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,710
principles, and those are what
I want to run through just

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,060
during this topic.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,780
Now the first principle, if you
like, is that most crops

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,980
are grown on fairly flat
land, and there's a

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,462
good reason for that.

21
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:16,130
For many of the operations that
are involved in cropping,

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,470
such as ploughing the land, or
&quot;tillage&quot; as we sometimes call

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,910
it, or harvesting, in many
systems that involves quite

24
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,590
big machinery, and it's very
difficult to operate that on

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,510
sloping land.

26
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:34,650
However, as we've seen in a
previous topic, some cultures

27
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,120
and countries have shown very
considerable ingenuity in

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,030
creating areas of flat land
out of what was originally

29
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,240
very unpromising, steep
hill country.

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,300
And here, once again, we show
you the pictures of the rice

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,390
terraces in a part of China
where little areas of flat

32
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,900
land have been created all the
way up the hillsides so that

33
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,150
they can be used for
growing the crops.

34
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,940
So once we're starting to grow
crops on flat land, then we go

35
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,410
through a whole series
of steps.

36
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,680
And the first thing we have to
do is we have to prepare the

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,620
land for planting the crop,
and then we have

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,420
to plant the crop.

39
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,010
And once again, this occurs in
a wide variety of different

40
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,269
ways depending on the crop and
where we are in the world.

41
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:27,330
As an example, I've got here a
photograph of planting rice

42
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,190
plants in a paddy field which is
a way of growing rice which

43
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,510
is common through many
parts of Asia.

44
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,390
It is clearly quite
labor-intensive.

45
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,149
At the other end of the scale,
I've got a picture of a

46
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,360
tractor ploughing a field.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,090
And this ploughing operation is
turning the soil over, and

48
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,720
it's the first step in the
preparation of a seed bed.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,770
Clearly it is much more
mechanised than we saw in the

50
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,840
previous slide.

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,770
Then once we planted the crop,
it starts to grow.

52
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,560
And here we've got a picture of
some maise plants growing,

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,640
and as those plants grow, we may
need to do things to them

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,170
to ensure that they grow as well
as they possibly could.

55
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,859
We may need to put fertiliser
on the crop, and here we've

56
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,800
got a picture of nitrogen
fertiliser being applied to a

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,390
winter wheat crop somewhere
in England.

58
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,899
We may need to irrigate the crop
of it's a dry climate.

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,110
And we've just got a picture
here of a center-pivot

60
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,640
irrigator, a sophisticated,
modern irrigation system

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,350
applying water to a
developing crop.

62
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,960
Perhaps we need to protect the
crop against plants and

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:49,030
diseases, and often we do this
by spraying chemicals on the

64
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,470
crop from the air.

65
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,690
And we've got a picture here
of an airplane which is

66
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,230
specifically designed for
agricultural work, and it can

67
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,350
be used to spray insecticides
or pesticides or even liquid

68
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,769
fertilisers on crops to
make sure that they're

69
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,180
growing very quickly.

70
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,560
If you ever get a chance to
watch a plane like this one

71
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,800
here operate, it's a
fantastic sight.

72
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,120
Finally, of course, once the
crop is grown, we need to

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,640
harvest it.

74
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,250
And just as when we're planting,
there's a wide

75
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,780
variety of different ways that
this is done, so the same

76
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,049
holds true for harvesting.

77
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,580
So we've got a picture here of
a small scale harvesting

78
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,740
operation in Indonesia
where this woman here

79
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,900
is harvesting maise.

80
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,739
And once again, at the total
other end of the scale, we've

81
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,930
got a picture here are of a
huge mechanical harvester

82
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,590
harvesting a cereal
crop in Europe.

83
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,900
Once again, this huge
range of scales.

84
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,102
And finally, once we've
harvested the crop, we then

85
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:53,990
need to store it in a way that
will keep it safe, keep it

86
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,970
very high quality, and protect
it from losses due to perhaps

87
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,780
diseases or pests like vermin.

88
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,650
So in summary, we can see that
there's a range of different

89
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,460
operations that we have
to apply to crops.

90
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,520
And although the crops vary
and the way they're grown

91
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,210
vary, those operations
are reasonably common

92
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,969
right across the globe.

93
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,470
Now each of these operations by
themselves does have quite

94
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,580
a big effect on the final
outcome of the cropping

95
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,469
operation, and so if we could
improve some of them, or even

96
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,240
all of them, it would make a
huge difference to the final

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,350
quantity of crop that
we could grow.

98
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,990
And just to give you one
example of that, we'll

99
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,930
consider fertilisers.

100
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,200
We know that in developing
countries, the quantities of

101
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,560
fertilisers that are applied to
a crop are much, much less

102
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
than are applied to exactly
the same sort of crop in a

103
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,669
developed country.

104
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,890
And those differences in
fertilisers, or fertiliser

105
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,810
rates, are reflected
in the yield.

106
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,270
The yield in the develop country
is much higher than it

107
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,560
is in the developing country.

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,760
So if we could find a way to
enable farmers in developing

109
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,860
countries to increase even
slightly the amounts of

110
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,670
fertiliser that they apply to
their crops, that would be one

111
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:26,110
step towards reducing this huge
issue of global hunger.

112
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,720
Now that's the end
of this topic.

113
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,575
In the next topic, we're going
to move on in just looking in

114
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:33,880
a little bit more detail at a
couple of the operations I've

115
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,130
talked about here.

116
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,640
