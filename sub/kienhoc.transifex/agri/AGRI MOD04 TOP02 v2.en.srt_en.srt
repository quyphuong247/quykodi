2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,260
Erosion can be defined as the
loss of soil by wind or water.

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,210
And on a global scale it's
regarded as a really, really

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,560
serious issue, that possibly
even threatens the

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,840
sustainability of a lot of
our food production.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,340
So what causes erosion?

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,300
Well, it's caused, as we
said at the start, by

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,320
either wind or water.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,370
And the first of those we're
going to look at it is wind.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,150
And we have here a spectacular
example of a

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,040
dust storm in Texas.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,089
The photo was taken a long time
ago in 1935, but it's a

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,050
really good example of wind
erosion in practise.

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,849
Now, wind erosion can occur in
many places around the world.

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,050
Sometimes in New Zealand, when
I'm driving down a country

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,995
road, and I will see what looks
like a fire in front of

17
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:06,520
me, or at least the
smoke of a fire.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,380
But when I get closer, I
see that it's not smoke

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,949
at all, it's dust.

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,040
And it's drifting across from
a paddock, perhaps upwind of

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,350
the road, where the farmer's
cultivating his or her soil,

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,250
and that dust is blowing
across the road.

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,140
Now that is wind erosion.

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,150
And I'm not sure whether the
farmer realises it or not, but

25
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,160
all of that valuable topsoil
is now being deposited on

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,759
their neighbor's property.

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,680
So what causes wind erosion?

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,320
Well, the first obvious cause is
wind, and we can't do much

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,539
about that.

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,430
But there are other contributing
factors as well.

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,210
So dry soil is a big issue.

32
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,750
And similarly, as I've just
demonstrated, if we cultivate

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,500
dry soil, then we are at risk
if the wind is blowing.

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,020
So we can do some things about
trying to reduce that risk.

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,160
And we, obviously, as I've said,
we can't do anything

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,720
about the wind.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,730
But if we take here, when we're
cultivating our soils,

38
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,500
to choose the time carefully and
to try to keep vegetation

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,790
on the soil for as long as
possible before we cultivate,

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,600
then that will minimise the
risk of wind erosion.

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,100
The second cause of soil
erosion is water.

42
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,940
And water can cause erosion
in two ways.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,790
The first way is when
it runs across the

44
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,220
top of the soil surface.

45
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,600
And this occurs when we have
very, very heavy rain--

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,359
rain that is so heavy that the
water can't percolate into the

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,130
soil fast enough.

48
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,670
And if that happens, it pounds
on the soil surface.

49
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,619
And if the soil is on any sort
of slope at all, the water

50
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,250
then, obviously, just
runs downhill.

51
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,360
And as it runs downhill
it gets faster

52
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,920
and faster and faster.

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,575
And it gains energy, and that
energy enables it to pick up

54
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:59,179
soil particles and carry them
down the slope, and create the

55
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,100
sort of myth that we see here.

56
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,310
Now, the conditions that make
that worse is if we don't have

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,310
any plant cover, or if the
soil has been recently

58
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,350
cultivated.

59
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,370
And that's the situation here.

60
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,240
We can see that the land
is sloping, it's

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,010
sloping towards us.

62
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,170
We can see that it's got very
sparse plant cover.

63
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,989
So what has happened here is
that the rainfall has been

64
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,150
heavy, the water started
the pond.

65
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,530
It's running down towards us,
and it's carrying these soil

66
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,380
particles and creating
these gullies and

67
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,410
rows that we see here.

68
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,760
And with all this bare ground
that's so obvious here,

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,810
obviously, the crop yield is
going to be badly affected.

70
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,700
The other way that
water can cause

71
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,220
erosion is more indirect.

72
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,390
When soils become wet,
they become heavy.

73
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,190
And when we were talking about
soil structure, we also

74
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,900
acknowledged that when
soils become wet they

75
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,980
become quite weak.

76
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,340
So if we have heavy rain, soils
are both heavy and weak.

77
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,970
And sometimes on steep slopes,
the combination of heavy, weak

78
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,560
soils and a steep slope means
that gravity takes over, and

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,490
all of a sudden the soil
will give way and

80
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,670
rush down the hillside.

81
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,090
And we sort of create
spectacular events,

82
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,900
such as we see here.

83
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,280
So what's happened here is at
the top of this hill slope

84
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,609
here, the soil has been very
heavy, very wet, very weak.

85
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,190
And under gravity it's suddenly
given way and it's

86
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,700
come down the hillside, down
to the bottom of the gully

87
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,539
where it's totally covered
this fence.

88
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,400
Now, this is an example of what
happened in one paddock.

89
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,799
On a regional scale, we see that
this happens on a much

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,240
larger scale and creates the
devastation that we see here.

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,140
Now, how could we reduce that?

92
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,860
Well, obviously, we can't do
anything about the rain.

93
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,860
But we do observe that this sort
of erosion is very rare

94
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,030
if the landscape's covered
with trees.

95
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,190
And so perhaps one way of
reducing this sort of erosion

96
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,810
is to identify our steepest
slopes, like this one here,

97
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,830
where probably we're not
producing very much grass

98
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,490
anyway, and replant it
back into trees.

99
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,690
And if we did that we would
reduce erosion quite a lot.

100
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,985
So let's sum up.

101
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:31,210
First of all, erosion is
a really big problem.

102
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,880
It occurs around the world,
and many people think it's

103
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,460
actually threatening the
sustainability of our

104
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,919
agriculture.

105
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,530
But it's not a problem that we
can't do anything about.

106
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,059
There are some things
we can do.

107
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,546
And we've just talked
about one of them.

108
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,460
We could plant trees on slopes
like this, and probably the

109
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,859
impact on our productivity
would be very low.

110
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,360
The other thing that we notice
is that a common feature for

111
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,580
all erosion seems to be the
absence of plant cover.

112
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,510
So, if in our farming practises
we can keep plant

113
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,219
cover on the land for as long
as possible and as much as

114
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,380
possible, that'll go a long
way to reducing erosion.

115
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,730
And if we think back to a couple
of topics ago when we

116
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,830
were talking about cropping,
we might have a technology

117
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,680
that would help us do that.

118
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,580
And that was when we were
talking about minimum tillage.

119
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,590
Because minimum tillage is a
technology that enables us to

120
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,770
plant seeds in the ground
without really disturbing the

121
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,260
soil surface.

122
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,270
And that would be one
contributing factor to

123
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,409
reducing soil erosion.

124
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,150
Now, in our next topic, we're
going to move on to the

125
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,739
importance of water and growing
plants, and the

126
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,240
technology of irrigation.
