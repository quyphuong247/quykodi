2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,880
We have seen this table
before in the course.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,960
It shows the essential
requirements for growing

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,680
plants, and these were energy
from the sun, carbon dioxide

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,990
from the atmosphere, water from
the soil, and nutrients

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,740
that usually come from
the soil as well.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,560
Now in this topic, we're going
to focus on just one of these,

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,230
the water from the soil.

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,419
Plants use water for
two purposes.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,450
The first one we've already
talked about.

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,490
They use water and they combine
it with carbon dioxide

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,130
in photosynthesis to form the
carbohydrates which are the

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,860
building blocks of
their structures.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,150
But plants need water for
another reason as well, and

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,460
it's a reason very
similar to us.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,640
Plants use water to keep cool.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,250
So on hot, sunny days, plants
are sucking water through

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,489
their roots up into their leaves
and evaporating it off

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,410
the surface of their leaves,
which keeps them cool, just

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:13,020
the same as when we perspire,
it cools down as well.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,369
But the question I want to ask
in this topic is how much

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,720
water do plants need?

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,890
And to do that, I want to
ask you a question.

24
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,510
Imagine a situation where we had
a swimming pool that was

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,510
absolutely full of water, right
up level to the top so

26
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,840
you couldn't get any
more in, at about 6

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,350
o'clock in the morning.

28
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,190
And imagine it's in a climate,
a nice, warm, sunny day, not

29
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,460
very much wind but no cloud,
and the temperature around

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,890
about 25 degrees.

31
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,550
Now we'd expect some of the
water in the swimming pool to

32
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,179
evaporate during the day.

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,240
How far do you think the
level of the water in

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,570
the pool would drop?

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,779
1 millimetre?

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,010
10 millimetres?

37
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,960
Perhaps even more?

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,479
Well, the answer to that
question would be about 5 or 6

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,180
millimetres.

40
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,770
That's how far the water would
drop, and that occurs because

41
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,640
of the sun's energy coming in
and evaporating that water.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,869
Now exactly the same thing
happens with plants.

43
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,060
So what would this mean
for an actual plant?

44
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,400
And let's use, for example,
something like a kiwi fruit

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,860
vine which has one central
stem and then a canopy of

46
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,210
leaves, and in the end, fruit.

47
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,820
And that canopy for a single
stem might cover an area of

48
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,190
ground perhaps about 10 square
metres, roughly 3 metres long

49
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,350
by 3 metres wide, perhaps a
little bit more than that.

50
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,299
So 10 square metres.

51
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,570
And if we imagine that that
kiwi fruit vine is

52
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,450
evaporating, just as in the
swimming pool, about 5 or 6

53
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,390
millimetres of water,
what does that mean?

54
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,019
Well, it actually means that
in a day, about 45 or 50

55
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,180
litres of water are going to
come from the soil, through

56
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,790
the roots, up the stem,
and out the leaves.

57
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,730
Now 50 litres is
a lot of water.

58
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,840
And remember, most of that's
happening in the

59
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,070
warm part of the day.

60
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,190
So in the warm part of the day,
there's a real stream of

61
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,300
water which we don't ever see
come up the trunk and then out

62
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,990
through the leaves.

63
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,460
That explains another
thing, too.

64
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,300
Remember earlier in the course,
we talked about how

65
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,240
farmers never seem to be happy
even when it's raining.

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,430
And I recounted the situation
that's all too common for me

67
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,460
of going camping in the summer
and getting rained on.

68
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,860
And perhaps we might get an inch
of rain in the night, and

69
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,870
it wets all our bedding,
et cetera.

70
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,430
And when we wake up in the
morning, the farmer's saying,

71
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,590
&quot;Oh, well, it was helpful, but
we'll need a lot more pretty

72
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,716
soon.&quot;

73
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:56,060
Well, now we can understand
why the farmers are saying

74
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,710
those things.

75
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,480
Because if we get, say, an
inch of rain, in the old

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,250
language that's about 25
millimetres, and we're losing

77
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,340
it at about 5 or 6 millimetres
a day, we can see that we're

78
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,360
going to run out of that water
within about 5 or 6 days.

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,660
So perhaps the farmers aren't
being quite so unreasonable as

80
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,959
we might have thought.

81
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,450
So we've established that plants
need water, and they

82
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,219
need quite a lot of water.

83
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,570
If they don't have that water,
then they die, as we sometimes

84
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,530
see, unfortunately, when we get
to water the tomatoes or

85
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,780
the pot plants.

86
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,010


87
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,730
But if plants are given water,
then the results can be quite

88
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,170
spectacular, and I've
just got a couple of

89
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,640
examples of that here.

90
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,310
The first is a photograph that
I took in Marlborough, which

91
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,140
is in the northern part of the
South Island of New Zealand.

92
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,409
It's a very dry area where
grapes are grown on the flats.

93
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,640
And we can see that on this hill
slope that normally in

94
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,830
summer they're just
parched and brown.

95
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,930
And what we have at the top of
that slope is a water trough,

96
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,820
and that water trough is
leaking or overflowing.

97
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,490
And we can see the spectacular
effect of that water on the

98
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,260
colour of the vegetation, and
we can see what those hills

99
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,650
would actually be like if only
they had sufficient water.

100
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,560
Another example on a much bitter
scale comes from the

101
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,350
United States, from the Columbia
Valley in Washington.

102
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,430
And these circles, although they
don't look too big on the

103
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,170
screen, are actually very large
indeed, and they're the

104
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,620
circles that have been created
by what we call center-pivot

105
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,190
irrigators that go around
in a big circle

106
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,830
irrigating the land.

107
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,250
And so we can see the huge
effect that these irrigators

108
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:51,610
have had on the colour and the
energy of the vegetation.

109
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,830
And if we look between those
circles, we can see what the

110
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,979
land would look like if
we didn't have water.

111
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,140
So in summary, in this
topic we can decide

112
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,099
that plants need water.

113
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,380
They need quite a
lot of water.

114
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,490
If they don't have the water,
they're going to die.

115
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,750
But if we can feed them water,
the results can be

116
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,260
spectacular.

117
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,400
And in the next topic, we're
going to move on to that whole

118
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,549
issue of feeding water.

119
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,040
We're going to look irrigation.

120
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,543
