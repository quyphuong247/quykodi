00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,739
As I'm sure you're all aware,
there's increasing concern all

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,210
around the world that the
activities of humans might be

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,520
increasing the concentration
of some gases in the

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,610
atmosphere.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,250
And these increasing
concentrations are having the

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,030
effect of the atmosphere
warming up.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,480
And that, in turn, may cause
a change in climate

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,490
all around the world.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,160
Now, these gases, we call
greenhouse gases.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,769
And in this topic, we're going
to have a look at how they

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,940
impact on agriculture.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,839
And the particular aspect we're
going to be looking at

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,590
here is how agriculture
contributes to the increases

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,300
in concentration
of these gases.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,980
Now, there's a range
of different gases.

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,550
The three most important ones
from our point of view are

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,589
carbon dioxide, methane,
and nitrous oxide.

19
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,880
We're going to talk about
them in a little

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,860
bit more detail now.

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,340
We have here a pie diagram which
shows the contribution

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,920
of each of these gases to the
global greenhouse gas profile.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,520
We can see that that pie diagram
is dominated by the

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,550
segment here.

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:26,580
And then is CO2 that
it is generated we

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,100
use it to get energy.

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,229
And that comes when we
burn fossil fuels.

28
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,260
So the oil in our cars, the coal
in our power stations, is

29
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,570
what we are measuring here.

30
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,669
We can see that's over half
of all the greenhouse

31
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,260
gases that we emit.

32
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,860
The pink, here, the 14% is the
contribution from methane.

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,100
And that comes, as far as we're
concerned, mainly from

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,970
agriculture.

35
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,390
We have a green area here, which
is also carbon dioxide.

36
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,010
But it's not related
to energy.

37
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,500
This is the carbon dioxide
that's emitted from other

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,110
activities.

39
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,510
And a really good example
of it that we've already

40
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,340
discussed is the carbon dioxide
or greenhouse gases

41
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,160
that are emitted when we burn
rainforests, for example.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,780
And we have discussed this,
as I said, earlier.

43
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,410
The next one, this 8% here,
is nitrous oxide.

44
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,260
And once again, that comes
mainly from agricultural

45
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,850
activities.

46
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,489
There are a few other gases, but
we're not going to worry

47
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,990
about them here.

48
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,260
Now, that's the profile
for the globe.

49
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,070
For individual countries, it
varies quite dramatically.

50
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,239
So if we look here at the
profile for the United States

51
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,270
of America, we can see that
the energy or the energy

52
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,140
related carbon dioxide, the
carbon dioxide that's emitted

53
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,079
from burning fuels, totally
dominates the profile for the

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,460
United States.

55
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,770
And the contributions
of the others--

56
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,590
relatively small.

57
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,890
At the other end of the spectrum
is a country like New

58
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,320
Zealand which has a very large
agricultural industry.

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,630
And that's the pie diagram
for New Zealand.

60
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,100
Once again, of course, there's
a significant contribution

61
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,220
from the fuel that's burnt
in the cars and the power

62
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,200
stations, et cetera.

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,010
But it's less than half
in New Zealand.

64
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,750
And this contribution here
is very big, indeed.

65
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,250
That's the methane.

66
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,660
And similarly, there's a large
contribution of nitrous oxide.

67
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,859
Now these are the gases that
are coming mainly from

68
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,460
agricultural activities.

69
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,980
Now, what are those agricultural
activities that

70
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,450
are causing these emissions
of gases?

71
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,929
Well, I'm afraid to say that,
once again, one of the major

72
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,710
culprits is here.

73
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,540
But this time, instead of
worrying about the dung and

74
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,230
urine coming out the back, we're
going to be worrying

75
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,560
about what comes
out the front.

76
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,805
Because what happens is that
when the cow is eating the

77
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:58,750
pasture as we see here, when she
ingests it, it starts to

78
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,380
be digested in her rumen,
or stomach.

79
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,870
And when that happens, as it
breaks down the cellulose in

80
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,870
that plant material, one of the
greenhouse gases, methane,

81
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,120
is generated.

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,460


83
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,230
Now, I'm sure there's a real
scientific word for this.

84
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,810
But I don't know what it is.

85
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,920
But when that gas is generated
in the cow's stomach, she gets

86
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,172
rid of it by burping.

87
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:26,380
[INAUDIBLE].

88
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,450
So at regular intervals, this
cow is burping away.

89
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,820
And every time she burps,
some methane comes out.

90
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,920
So that is the contribution from
agriculture to methane.

91
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,440
And we saw, in New Zealand, that
that's a huge segment.

92
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,930
So where does nitrous
oxide come from?

93
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,220
Well, once again, it comes from
agricultural activities.

94
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,910
And mainly, the nitrous oxide
is emitted from the soil.

95
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,680
The amounts that are emitted
depend quite a lot on how much

96
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,050
nitrogen is in the system.

97
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,260
So the more intensive our
farming system, the more

98
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,810
nitrogen fertiliser we're using,
it's highly probable

99
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,850
that the more nitrous
oxide we will lose.

100
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,430
Now, there are no quick fixes
for either of those sources of

101
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,490
greenhouse gases
in agriculture.

102
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,330
But there are some
things we can do.

103
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,780
And enormous amounts of money
are being spent at the moment

104
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,340
trying to investigate whether
there are new technologies

105
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,909
that we can use to minimise
those emissions.

106
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,970
Now, in the next topic, we're
going to look at the other

107
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,620
side of greenhouse gases.

108
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,260
And that is the effect that
climate change might have on

109
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,560
agriculture.

110
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,560
