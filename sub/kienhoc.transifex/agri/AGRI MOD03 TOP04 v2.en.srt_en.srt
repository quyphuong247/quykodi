00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,360
As we've seen in previous
topics, pig meat and poultry

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,860
meat are the two biggest
components of the global meat

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,270
production and the global
meat consumption.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,420
And in addition to that, poultry
are also used to

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,030
produce eggs.

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,380
Now there's a main reason, an
obvious reason, why these two

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,310
meats make up the largest
component of the meat

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,040
production, and that is because
they are very, very

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,420
cost effective.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,620
And they're cost effective
for a number of reasons.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,769
The first one is something
that we've

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,950
already talked about.

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,740
They are very efficient
converters of plant protein to

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,880
animal protein.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,130
The conversion efficiency for
pigs is about four to one and

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,060
that for poultry, a bit
over two to one.

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,940
So we don't have to supply
so much feed to produce a

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,240
kilogramme of animal protein.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,899
The next contributor to their
cost effectiveness, if you

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,280
like, is that farmers have
developed ways of housing

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,000
large quantities of these
two different animals in

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,180
relatively small spaces.

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,070
And of course this brings in
economies of scale, if we want

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,009
to use that word.

26
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,260
And then the third reason why
these systems are so cost

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,380
effective is that because they
are under such close control,

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,300
we are able to feed the animals
precise amounts are

29
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,100
feed, which we can formulate
very carefully to ensure that

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,500
they grow at the absolute
maximum rates.

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,980
So it's for these three reasons
that the production of

32
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,640
pigs and poultry is so cost
effective, and that is the

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,290
reason that they dominate the
world production of meat.

34
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,730
But there are downsides
to the production of

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,350
meat in this way.

36
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,340
And perhaps the first
one is disease.

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,060
Clearly, if you've got as many
animals as these all in a very

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,490
limited area, if a disease
outbreak occurs, it will

39
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,440
spread very rapidly and have
very dire consequences.

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,840
So most of these facilities
are managed very, very

41
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,840
carefully indeed in ways to try
to prevent or minimise at

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,560
least the outbreak of
any disease at all.

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,790
And the second potential
drawback to systems like this

44
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,429
is quite obviously concerns
about animal welfare.

45
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,360
To many people, seeing animals
in facilities such as this or

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,330
like this in the crate are, at
the very best, unnatural and

47
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,540
perhaps, at the worst,
needlessly cruel.

48
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,970
And there are many people around
the world who feel

49
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,970
passionately that these
practises are wrong.

50
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,170
Now many farmers will argue that
there are lots of reasons

51
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,019
why they farm animals
in this way.

52
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,940
And many of those reasons
are not to do with cost.

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,220
There are other arguments
as well.

54
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,210
For example, in a recent debate
on the farming of pigs

55
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,920
in New Zealand, the farmers
pointed out that, although

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,100
their farming practises may be
being criticised, in actual

57
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,950
fact, their practises compared
very, very favourably with

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,019
many countries overseas.

59
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,190
And they pointed it out that
if you looked at it on a

60
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,770
global scale, if the political
pressure in New Zealand forced

61
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,470
farmers to change their
practises and thereby make

62
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,980
their pig meat much, much more
expensive than it would

63
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,100
otherwise be, then overseas
competitors would simply move

64
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,440
in and sell New Zealanders
cheaper pig meat.

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,140
And in actual fact, the net
impact on animal welfare would

66
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,600
have been negative.

67
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,170
But regardless of these
arguments, there is ongoing

68
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,330
political and public pressure
in many countries on farmers

69
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,580
of pigs and poultry to change
their practises in quite

70
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,080
significant ways.

71
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,240
And for example, in New Zealand,
there is a programme

72
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,650
in place by which pig farmers
will gradually move to

73
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,580
different farming systems.

74
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,380
However, in my own personal
view, I think a lot of the

75
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,219
answer rests with
the consumer.

76
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,050
Producers will produce what
consumers will buy.

77
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,220
Next time you go into the
supermarket, why don't you go

78
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,400
along to the egg shelves and
have a look at all the

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,979
different sorts of eggs you
could buy and read the labels

80
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,940
pretty carefully to see exactly
what they mean.

81
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,920
And probably what you'll find
is that there's a range of

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,760
different eggs, and they've
been produced

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,150
in different ways.

84
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,200
And probably they cost a
little bit different.

85
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,860
Now when we are faced with that
choice, how do we make

86
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,450
the decision?

87
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,420
Because whatever decision we
make will be sending a signal

88
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,470
back to the market.

89
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,130
And in the end, the consumers
can have a big say.

90
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,130
And in the next topic, we're
going to move away from animal

91
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,650
farming completely and have
a look at horticulture.
