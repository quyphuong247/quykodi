00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,640
Over the years, the plans that
we grow on our farms and the

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,270
animals that we produce have
changed quite dramatically.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,080
They ewes and the lambs we see
in this diagram are very

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,849
different than they were
20 or 30 years ago.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,690
And the apples that
we see in this

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,950
diagram are also different.

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,270
They will probably store better,
be easier transported

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,299
around the world,
and still arrive

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,880
in really good condition.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,630
Now these improvements and
advances have occurred by

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,130
natural breeding, by the
selection of individuals that

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,920
had really desirable traits, and
then breeding on from them

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,460
to improve these new
plants and animals.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,100
But as we're all aware, these
days there's been a new

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,330
technology developed which can
speed up this change or

17
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,000
improvement in plants
and animals.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,430
And that technology is called
genetic modification, and it

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,970
involves the transfer of genetic
material from one

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,300
species of plant or
animal to another

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,690
species of plant or animal.

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,880
Now there are big advantages
that can arise by this, and

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,860
I'm going to give you
one in particular.

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,300
When we grow a crop of maise,
we often have problems with

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,899
weeds growing in between the
rows, and we need to get rid

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,930
of those weeks because they
interfere with the

27
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,590
growth of the plant.

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,380
Now we could hoe them out, but
on a huge area that's not

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,080
really practical, so most
farmers spray a chemical which

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,450
will kill the weeds and
leave the maise.

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,010
Now, these selective herbicides
are available and

32
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,630
widely-used, but unfortunately
they're quite damaging to the

33
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,449
environment.

34
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,340
They are slow to break down in
the soil, and they can be

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,840
toxic to other parts
of the ecosystem.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,960
Now there are other herbicides
which will kill the weeds and

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,470
are much more environmentally
friendly, but unfortunately

38
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,780
they will also damage
the maise.

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,010
But when we or test these
environmentally friendly

40
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,329
herbicides on a whole range of
different plants, we find that

41
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,160
some of them are in
fact resistant.

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,440
So wouldn't it be a really neat
trick if we could take

43
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,070
the genetic material that
confers that resistance and

44
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,590
insert it into the
maise plant?

45
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,990
Because then we could use the
environmentally friendly

46
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,480
herbicide, spray it on the crop,
the weeds would die, and

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,060
the maise would stay healthy.

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,850
Now that's not fantasy.

49
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,780
That's actually happening.

50
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,185
And it's happening commercially,
so they are

51
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:50,570
large areas of crops around
the world that have that

52
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,720
genetic material in
them now, and it's

53
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,970
producing bit benefits.

54
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,220
Genetic modification can
do other things.

55
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,300
It can help in insect
resistance.

56
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,130
It can make crops look better
or store better.

57
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,460
It could confer greater
tolerance to drought.

58
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,680
And as we've seen many times,
if some of our crops could

59
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,400
tolerate drought, it would make
a big difference to food

60
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
production.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,769
Of course, not everybody is
convinced by this, and in fact

62
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,960
many people violently or at
least passionately opposed to

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,860
the use of genetic
modification.

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,230
And we see here an example of
one of just many protests

65
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,700
around the world-- this one
happens to be in Spain--

66
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,839
against the use of genetic
technologies in agriculture.

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,040
So what are these people
concerned about?

68
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, the first thing they're
concerned about is just the

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,410
basic question is it right?

70
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,630
Should we as humans be
interfering with nature?

71
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,010
Secondly, are genetically
modified foods safe to eat?

72
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,310
And if they are, should they be
labelled so that at least

73
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,030
as consumers we can
make a choice?

74
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,130
And if they should be labelled,
how on Earth would

75
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,560
we make sure that
that was done?

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,830
There are other issues to do
with intellectual property and

77
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,100
ownership of the seeds,
but we don't have

78
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,810
time to go into those.

79
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,610
So clearly there's a debate, and
different countries have

80
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,650
reacted to that debate
in different ways.

81
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,800
Some of them have decided that
genetically modified organisms

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,860
should not be a part of their
agriculture except in research

83
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,200
institutions.

84
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,150
Other countries have taken a
different approach, and large

85
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,870
areas of those countries are
planted in genetically

86
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,180
modified crops.

87
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,320
I guess as consumers all we can
do is make ourselves aware

88
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,969
of issues, and I hope this
course may in some small way

89
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,540
have raised your awareness.

90
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,750
Now this is the end of this
module, and in the next

91
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,620
module, we're going to move
on and look at some other

92
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,720
sustainability issues that are
impacting on agriculture.

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,358
