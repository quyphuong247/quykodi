00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,972

00:00:00,972 --> 00:00:02,980
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Well, Professor
Yerraballi, what are

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,830
we gonna learn today?

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,780
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Well, we're
gonna try something a little

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,660
challenging.

6
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,612
But we'll try and keep things simple.

7
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:16,660
We're gonna learn the basics
of electrical circuits in

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,540
an abbreviated session.

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,180
So let's hope we can get you to
understand the basics and apply them

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:31,980
as it is relevant in the context
of embedded systems.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,330
Let's look at the foundations that
govern electrical circuits.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:44,690
Electric circuits are made up of basic
elements, what we call as passive

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,070
elements and active elements.

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,470
But before we get to those elements,
we want to define some terms.

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,660
So the first term that I'm going
to look at is current.

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:04,780
Current is the flow of charge.

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,050
And when we say charge, we're looking
at a positive or negative charge.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,780
In our case, we're going to look at
electrons as a unit of charge.

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:21,160
So the units for current are, because
it's a flow of electrons, we're going

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:27,760
to look at it as coulombs per second.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,010
In other words, it's a rate of flow of
charge, and charge, the units for

22
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,310
charge is coulombs, so it's
coulombs per second.

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:41,230
So rather than say coulombs per second,
we use a term called amperes

24
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,550
to represent current.

25
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:49,920
So the idea, then, is current flows,
current is the flow of electrons, or

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,680
the flow of charge.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,430
And the units for current are amperes.

28
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:07,090
Current has a direction, as we will
see, and so when we talk about

29
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,789
current, we're always talking about the
flow of current, where it makes

30
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,715
sense to talk about the direction
in which current flows.

31
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:23,020
So through a conductor, we say that
current flows in some direction.

32
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,880
So the second term we're gonna
look at is voltage.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,300

34
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,490
Voltage is what we call as
electromotive force.

35
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:48,220
Electromotive force are sometimes
called potential difference.

36
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:58,300
And the idea of voltage is always, we
talk of voltage as a difference in

37
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,950
potential between two points.

38
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,240
So when I say, for example, points a and
b, we refer to the voltage as Vab

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,560
as a potential difference
between points a and b.

40
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:19,420
Now, the definition of voltage is it's
the amount of energy, so amount of

41
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:33,910
energy needed to move one unit of
charge, in this case a unit of charge

42
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,850
is a coulomb, from a to b,

43
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,500
from one point to another point.
One volt will deliver one joule of energy 
per coulomb of charge that passes through it.

44
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,600
So that is the voltage.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:52,670
So voltage, then, has the units of
joules, which is the unit for energy

46
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,485
per coulomb.

47
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:58,100

48
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,120
Again, we have a short for this.

49
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,160
We simply call these volts.

50
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,090
So the units for current are amperes,
and the unit for voltage is volts.

51
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,880
So Ohm's law gives us a relationship
between voltage and current, the two

52
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
terms that we just introduced.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,390
So what Ohm's law says is that the
current that flows through a

54
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,580
conductor, and here I'm going to
represent this conductor like this,

55
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,950
the current that flows through a
conductor from its positive side to

56
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,430
the negative side, we call those a and
b, which are positive and negative.

57
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,630
So Vab is a voltage across these two
points, and it's saying that the

58
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:51,510
current and the voltage are related by
a rule that says V equals I times R.

59
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,030
Where R is the resistance
of the conductor.

60
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,250
So we can write it in various ways, and
so for example, I can say R equals

61
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,825
V by I, or I can say I equals V over
R. All these are different forms of

62
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:15,410
Ohm's law where R is given, R is the
resistance, and the unit for

63
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,840
resistance R ohms.

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,850
So we have Ohm's law, which is giving us
the relationship between these two,

65
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:32,690
but what we also say is that when
current flows, we say we're talking

66
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,860
about the flow of current.

67
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:44,010
And we say the power dissipated, if you
will, through this resistance is

68
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:54,760
given by the voltage times V times I.
And the units for power are watts.

69
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:01,820
And the interesting thing is that we
can actually derive this as being

70
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,640
joules per second.

71
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:18,250
And this is simply because the unit for
voltage is joules per coulomb, and

72
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,180
the units for current are
coulombs per second.

73
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,340
So the units for power is joules per
second, which is also called watts.

74
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,590
