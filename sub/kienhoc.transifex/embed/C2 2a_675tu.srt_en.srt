00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450

00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,730
(JONATHAN VALVANO) Next, we're going
to look at the components of an

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,705
embedded system.

4
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:11,240

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,500
And we said that the embedded system
had a computer inside.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,790
So we'll represent the computer as
this little integrated circuit.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,980
And we're going to embed
this into many things.

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,595
We could put them in our
cars, our automotive.

9
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:34,080

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,900
We could put them in our bodies.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,190
We're actually going to embed
computers inside of people.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,700
And the medical electronics has
a lot of embedded systems.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,326
We could put it in our toys,
our consumer electronics.

14
00:00:51,326 --> 00:01:07,920

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,630
We're going to put it in our homes.

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:18,010

17
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,140
The military uses a lot
of embedded devices.

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,250

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,950
We can put it in our cell phones and
anything that has to do with

20
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,200
communication.

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,310

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:43,870
And lastly, but not least, is we will
see that embedded systems are

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,570
ubiquitous in industry.

24
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:54,670
So industrial embedded systems,
our robots, inventory control,

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,410
manufacturing.

26
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,530
This is a very large sector
for embedded systems.

27
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,550
All right, so now let's talk
about the computer.

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,449
As we see, embedded systems
are everywhere.

29
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:19,390
There are estimated over 5 billion of
these embedded systems in our world.

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,020
And these are computers hidden
inside of devices.

31
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,600
So let's look inside
an embedded system.

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,570
It has a computer.

33
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:39,600
And when you say computer most people
think of an x86, which is the standard

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,800
computer in personal computers.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,170
But now we have, coming
along, ARM computers.

36
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,390
And the ARM computer that you probably
are most aware are the A series, which

37
00:02:52,390 --> 00:03:02,070
are in your cell phones, your iPads,
and those types of devices.

38
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,990
But the computers we're going to talk
about are ARM computers in the M

39
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,992
Series, or the microcontrollers.

40
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:12,080

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,790
And we'll see what that
is in a moment.

42
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,370
There's another series while
we're on it, the R series,

43
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,550
which is for real time.

44
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,480
A bunch of those in your
cell phones as well.

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,970

46
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,260
Inside the computer, we also have
memory to store things.

47
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,430
So this is our storage element.

48
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,980
And what you're going to learn in this
class is I/O. I/O is where the

49
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,680
interface happens.

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,790
This is the glue which will connect
the components together.

51
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,980
And so we will see that this I/O will
have a couple of components.

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:04:01,320
There will be hardware, mechanical
connections, electrical connections,

53
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,570
and special software.

54
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,410

55
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,190
And before we go on, let's make a list
of the important considerations when

56
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,670
building an embedded system.

57
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,709
First and foremost is the ability
to test or to verify.

58
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,740
We're going to place embedded systems in
important life critical situations,

59
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,980
where if we make a mistake we could lose
not only money, but loss of life.

60
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,790
So when building an embedded system the
ability to test or to verify it

61
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,450
works will be extremely important.

62
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,090
Of course, we're engineers and we
would like to make some money.

63
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,130
So another important consideration in
embedded systems is the ability to

64
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,050
make profit, which, as you know, is
a combination of market share, and

65
00:04:53,050 --> 00:05:00,830
that's making something that everybody
wants to buy, and reducing the cost,

66
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,270
which is both development cost
and manufacturing cost.

67
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:11,280
As we saw also that these systems
are powered often by batteries.

68
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,760
So power, which affects size,
and heat, and cost,

69
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,600
is extremely important.

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,240
Size, we want to fit it in our pocket.

71
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,180
We want to embed it in our bridges.

72
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,960
We're going to carry it around
inside of our hearts.

73
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,060
We need to make sure that things fit.

74
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,450
And the last consideration that we will
have for embedded systems is this

75
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,880
idea of time.

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,530
In many computer systems, it's important
to get the correct answer.

77
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,050

78
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,700
And in embedded systems
that's still true.

79
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,880
We want the correct answer.

80
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,970
And in an embedded system, we not only
need the correct answer, but we need

81
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,290
the correct answer at the right time.

82
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,980

83
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,040
When your engine is flying towards you,
you want your air bag to go off

84
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,270
before the engine gets there.

85
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:16,660
So in order to produce systems that
can behave responsively to our

86
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,060
problems we're going to have a number
of facilities to manage time.

87
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,310
OK, what's next?

88
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,520
