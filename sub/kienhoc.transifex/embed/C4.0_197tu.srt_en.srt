00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:02,070
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
In this short video,

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,500
we are going to answer
the question, what

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,600
is a logic high and a logic
low on our microcontroller?

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,630
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: OK, so
we go to the table of contents.

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,100
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: And
we see in our chapter 24,

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,449
it will tell us what ratings are.

8
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:18,490
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: OK.

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,200
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: And
it will tell us our levels.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,229
So let's look that up.

11
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,270
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: OK.

12
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,050
Section 24.3.

13
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,447
So here, in section 24.3, it's going
to tell us what the voltages are.

14
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:35,280
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So we want to look up

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,580
what a voltage high and
a voltage low ranges are.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:49,770
So we'll see that for a high, the lowest
high voltage you can have is 2.4V.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,007
And for a low, the maximum
you can have is 0.4V.

18
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,090
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,340
And similarly, we can
see what voltages it

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,640
thinks are high and low for the inputs.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,980
So these are the VIH and VIL.

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,900
And we can use these
equations here to calculate

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,680
what the voltages will be
that the microcontroller will

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,020
consider an input high or an input low.

25
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,934
There we have it.

26
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:19,434
