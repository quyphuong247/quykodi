DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: I'm Jon Valvano.

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,080
In this video we will use
edge triggered interrupts

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,940
to solve a real time problem.

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,460

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,530
The problem we're
going to solve is we're

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,570
going to have a switch attached to
PF4, and when we touch the switch,

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,690
there will be a falling edge on PF4.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,200
The action I wish to perform
is to increment a counter.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,580
This is a software action,
and so the interrupt

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,600
is going to trigger a software action.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,780
And the time between the hardware
event and the software action

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,780
is called latency.

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,455
This is a time delay between
a desire and an action.

15
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:55,390
And if this latency is less
than a bound, in other words

16
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,900
it's always less than
some number, then we

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,780
will classify this system as real time.

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,180
In order to make this real time,
we're going to use the interrupts.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,410
The interrupt is going to cause a
trigger on the falling edge of PF4.

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,390
We'll acknowledge the interrupt,
which is to clear the trigger,

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,090
and then we'll increment the variable.

22
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,990

23
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,430
After incrementing the variable, we'll
return back to where we came from.

24
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,165
Next we'll show you the steps
involved in initializing

25
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:31,171
the edge triggered interrupts.

26
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:31,671
