DR JONATHAN VALVANO: So as
we saw from last chapter,

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,340
the Logic Analyzer is a non-intrusive
hardware debugging instrument.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,200
And I've connected the Logic
Analyzer to the UART system,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,381
connecting one wire, channel
zero, from the signal from A to B,

6
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:27,950
and channel one from the transmit line
from B to A. And we're going to see,

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:34,070
that if I select a pattern-- like
if I want to send the color Red--

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,650
I will then push the send button.

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,520
And over here on the
Logic Analyzer, we see

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,070
that this is the UART
pattern which was sent

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,100
from B to A. Let's
send a different color.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,780
Let's send Green.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,870
And there is the Green pattern.

14
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,250
The signal is transmitted in serial.

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:00,370
And we have the start bit, bit zero,
bit one, bit two, bit three, bit four,

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,370
five, six, and seven.

17
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,560
And right here is the stop bit.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,690
So we can see voltage versus time
as our signal is transmitted.

19
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,340
And I have it triggered
on the falling edge, which

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,090
is the idle to start the transition.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,780
So if I send a Blue, we can
see that the pattern changes.

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,470

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,880
Now if I switch the Logic
Analyzer to trigger on the falling

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,100
edge of the other one, so now we
have the falling edge of the A to B.

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:46,720
And over here, if I send a Red, we see
that the A to B signal has the pattern.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,910

27
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,860
Green, Blue.

28
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,430
And I can use the Logic
Analyzer to test to make

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,430
sure the baud-rate is
correct by measuring

30
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,140
the time between these pulses,
and make sure my pattern is right

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,120
as I push the values.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,560
So in summary, the Logic
Analyzer is a hardware device

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,950
that allows us to measure
multiple digital signals

34
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,173
in their amplitude versus time behavior.

35
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:15,673
