DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
In this video, let's

3
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,180
look up some information
about our resistors.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,800
Are resistors are carbon film.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,470
The first thing let's look at
is, what's inside of a resistor?

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,870
We can see in this picture
here that inside the resistor

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,180
there is a carbon film.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,360
It is this carbon film which
affects or creates the resistance.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,470
The next question I want to know
is, how much power can I dissipate?

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,350
So I search the data sheet and
look for the maximum power.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,660
And it turns out what we have
is a quarter-watt resistor.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:47,540
So the maximum amount of watts that
this resistor can sustain is 1/4 watt.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,100
There are lots of places to
look this up, but as you know,

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,990
resistors have color codes.

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,840
This data sheet will also
show us the color codes.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,010
Let's search for it.

17
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,950
Again, data sheets have
lots of information.

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,080
So it's important for you to have
a goal while you're searching.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,210
And again, my goal is
to find the color code.

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,440

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,620
There are two pieces of
information in the color code.

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,470
The first is the
tolerance and it turns out

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,490
there we're probably going
to have 5% tolerance.

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,150
The second is the resistance itself.

25
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,550
And as you can see from
this diagram, that there

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:34,710
are three numbers and a fourth
number which is the multiplier.

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,160
So using these colors, we can
look up what the resistance is.

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,090
And lastly, there's a
resistance tolerance.

29
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,510
Like I said, we're probably
going to have 5% resistors

30
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,220
and we'll see a gold band at the end.

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,680
So in summary, we've looked up how a
resistor works, how much power it has,

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,015
and how do we search and look up
the color codes of our resistors.

33
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:00,765
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
By the way, there's

34
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:05,660
a lot of easy mnemonics people post
on the internet for remembering these.

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,532
You're welcome to look up those, too.

36
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:09,032
