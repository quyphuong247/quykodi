00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: We've set
up our chat tool in our offices,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,770
and we're going to
use it to communicate.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,480
I wonder if Professor
Yerraballi is in his office.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,980
In order to use it, I will
push the Select button

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,830
until I get the message
that I want to send.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,430
Red means "Are you in
your office", and I

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,800
push this button to send that message.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,696
Sent the message.

9
00:00:26,696 --> 00:00:29,800
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Oh,
I see a message from Jon.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,049
He's asking me if I'm in my office.

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,320
I will send a response back,
"Yes", I am in my office.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,380
I send a White saying,
yes, I'm in my office.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,120
I wonder if he wants
to go out for coffee.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,260
Let me send a message back.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,420
I pick a color, I pick
the color Blue, and I

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,066
send it to see if he
wants to have coffee.

17
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:58,080
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Oh, I see a Blue.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,900
I'm not thirsty so let's
select a response, not thirsty.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,330
OK.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,090
Push the Select button until it
goes black-- Black means "No" --

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,950
and I will send the Black message out.

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,190
So I've sent the black message
saying I'm not thirsty,

23
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,240
but I am hungry, always hungry,
so I was ask him if he's hungry.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,920
So I will select the Green light,
which means "Are you hungry",

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,750
shall we go out.

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,420
And send the Green message.

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,570

28
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,730
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Oh, I see
he's not thirsty, but he's hungry.

29
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,190
I'm hungry too.

30
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:45,940
Let's meet for lunch, but let me
first tell him, "Yes" I am hungry.

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,810
And maybe I should come over to his
office so that we can go from there.

32
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,075
And make a message,
that's my message, which

33
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:59,190
is a Cyan, asking him if
he wants me to come over.

34
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,720
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Oh, I see he sent
a Cyan that says, do you want to meet.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,440
And so I will say, Yes,
come up to the office.

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,360
So I select the White, which
means yes, come up to the office.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,890
So in summary, what we have
are two microcontrollers

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,200
connected by this long cable.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,240
We can transmit data from
my computer to his computer,

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,420
out this transmitter into that receiver.

41
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,540
And then he can select his response by
sending data to in the other direction.

42
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,409
And, as you can see, every time we hit
the Send, we send one 8-bit packet.

43
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,950
I wonder if he's coming to my office.

44
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,070

45
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,980
There he is.

46
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,672
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Hey, John.

47
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:46,020
You ready to go?

48
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,895
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Let's go out for lunch.

49
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:49,520
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Let's do it.
