00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,850
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Hi,
this is Jon Valvano.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,910
JONATHAN VALVANO: And this
is Ramesh Yerraballi.

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,090
Welcome to Embedded Systems
Shape the World.

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,120
We are glad you have joined us.

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,180
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Embedded
systems are ubiquitous.

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,450
Did you know that there are more
computers on the planet than humans?

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,930
JONATHAN VALVANO: That means there
are billions of computers.

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,610
RAMESH YERRABALLI: We interact with
these little computers everyday.

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,460
Most of these computers are single chip
microcontrollers, like the ones

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,340
you'll be learning in this course.

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:34,370
Some are embedded in our cars, in our
homes, in our CDs, in our toys, in our

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,810
workplaces, and some are even
embedded inside us.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,950
JONATHAN VALVANO: Therefore, as the
world becomes more complex, so have

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,690
the microcontrollers embedded
in our devices.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,640
So as engineers, we need you to develop
and manage products based on

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,890
these embedded microcontrollers.

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,930
RAMESH YERRABALLI: We believe an
effective way to learn is to do.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,500
In the traditional classroom
environment, we're able to accomplish

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,019
this by lab components in our classes.

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,280
JONATHAN VALVANO: Therefore, we will
bring our lab to you by creating a

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,830
substantial lab component
in the MOOC format.

23
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:17,820
If successful, the innovative lab
techniques developed in our class will

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,150
transform the MOOC environment.

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,440
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Yes, we believe your
lab experience will be successful

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,110
for a number of reasons.

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,230
First, ARM and Texas Instruments
have generously

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,030
contributed to our endeavor.

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,960
JONATHAN VALVANO: And second, the
massive growth of the embedded

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,430
microcontrollers have made low cost
development systems readily available.

31
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,720
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Third, online tools
now exist that allows students to

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,560
collaborate with each other.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,200
JONATHAN VALVANO: And lastly, your
instructors have the passion,

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,720
patience, and experience in
delivering a quality lab

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,740
experience to large classes.

36
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,420
RAMESH YERRABALLI: We look forward
to working with you over

37
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,670
the next few months.

38
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,653
