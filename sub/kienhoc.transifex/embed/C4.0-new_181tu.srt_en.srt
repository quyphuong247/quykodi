00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,300
Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi: Professor
Valvano, what are we

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,600
going to learn today?

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,025
Dr. Jonathan Valvano: Today we will
learn about the basic building blocks

5
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:10,590
of all modern electronics,
which is the transistor.

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,910
Which can be thought of as a switch.

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,520
Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi: So what's the
point of learning about transistors?

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,700
Dr. Jonathan Valvano: Don't you want
to know how everything works?

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,690
We will learn about the n-channel
and the p-channel transistor.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,220
And we will put them together to build
some simple logic, like an AND gate or

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,910
a NOT gate.

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,180
Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi:
Oh, I see your point.

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,630
So we can take these basic building
blocks, which are transistors, and

14
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,740
build gates.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,390
And these gates can be put together
to build higher level logic.

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,990
Like decoders, multiplexers,
adders, and multipliers.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,760
Dr. Jonathan Valvano: Yes.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,945
And this is called 'Digital
Logic Design'.

19
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:52,980
Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi: That sounds
like a vast topic in itself.

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,170
Dr. Jonathan Valvano: Yes, it is.

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,520
But we will show you just a few simple
things, just to give you a glimpse of

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,140
how the real computer works.

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,737
