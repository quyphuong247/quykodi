PROFESSOR JONATHAN VALVANO: A robot
used a TIP120 to drive the motor.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,950
And let's look up a couple
of parameters on the TIP120.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,610
First, we can see how to wire it up.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,500
There's the base, there's the
collector, and there's the emitter.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,790
Second, let's look up
and see what the gain is.

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:25,750
The current gain here, the
hFE for the TIP120 is 1,000.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,310
Next, let's look up the
relationship between the input

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,830
voltage and the output voltage.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,490
And so we can see that
here, that on this plot,

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,330
we can see a relationship
between the base emitter voltage.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,300
So we're going to
drive it in saturation.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,350
And the relationship
between the base emitter

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,310
voltage and the maximum
collector current.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:57,220
So for instance, if we have a 0.5
A that we're driving to our motor,

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,920
we're going to have or need
a base emitter voltage here

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,500
of about 1.4 volts.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,830
And once we put in 1.4
volts on the base emitter,

19
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,940
we're going to see that
our collector emitter

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,540
voltage will be about 0.75 volts.

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:28,440
So from this diagram, we can see
here that if the voltage here

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:35,400
is above 1.4 volts, there will be a
half an AMP of current that can flow.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,790
And that will generate,
at most, about 0.7 volt

24
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,810
drop across that NPN
Darlington transistor.

25
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,240
So this is how we used
the data sheet to look up

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,142
the parameters for our operating device.

27
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:50,642
