00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,070
PROFESSOR RAMESH YERRABALLI: So let's
take a look at how the ADC works

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,206
and get that information
from the data sheet.

4
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:10,330
PROFESSOR JONATHAN VALVANO: All right,
the first one we're going to look up

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,750
is PSSI.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,720
OK, so we go to the data sheet.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,500
I'm going to use my bookmark.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,830
And the ADC is Chapter 13.

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,310
And I want to find the registers.

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,964
And I'm going to look for PSSI, PSSI.

11
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:36,050
Come on-- there it is.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,530
This is the processor sample
sequence initiate register.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,030
OK, so in here, it'll
show us how it works.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,620

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,100
We're going to write to bit three,
which will start sequencer three.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,740

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,090
PROFESSOR RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Hence the value 8 here.

18
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,020
PROFESSOR JONATHAN VALVANO: All right,
let's look up the raw interrupt status

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,099
register, which has our flags in it.

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,210

21
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,630
So again, I'm going
to use the bookmarks.

22
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,420
Again, I'm going to use the
bookmarks to search for the register.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,950
And the register I want is
RIS, Raw Interrupt Status.

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,920
There it is.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,470
So here, it will show us
that each of the sequencers

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,540
has a raw interrupt status.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,110
And bit three is associated
with sequencer three.

28
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,610
PROFESSOR RAMESH YERRABALLI: So we just
check for that bit to see the sample

29
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,564
is completed.

30
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:42,230
PROFESSOR JONATHAN VALVANO: There we go.

31
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,830
What else do I need?

32
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,135
PROFESSOR RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Let's look at the result,

33
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:48,650
where to read the result from.

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,650
PROFESSOR JONATHAN VALVANO: OK, so
again, we're searching each register.

35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,080
So we go back.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,180
So we go back to our bookmarks.

37
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,795
And we're looking for the
FIFO sequencer three register.

38
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:03,280
And there are a lot of
registers of the ADC converter,

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
so we need a way to find it.

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,220
There it is.

41
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,580
Click on it, and we can see this
register is not very interesting.

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,690
But we can see that it is
a 12-bit register, which

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,710
will contain the conversion result.

44
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,380

45
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:27,790
One more register-- that's
called the ISC register.

46
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,460
PROFESSOR RAMESH YERRABALLI:
This is our acknowledge register.

47
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,530
This is the one we
have to make sure we do

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,309
to indicate that we've
read the converted value.

49
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:39,600
PROFESSOR JONATHAN VALVANO:
There we go, let's find it.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,812

51
00:02:47,812 --> 00:02:49,520
PROFESSOR RAMESH
YERRABALLI: Right there.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,010
PROFESSOR JONATHAN VALVANO: Right
there-- there it is, the ISC register,

53
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,060
click.

54
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,770
And this is one of those
interesting registers here.

55
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,720
And you can see that it
is a read/write register.

56
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,250
But when we write a 1 to
it, it will clear the bit.

57
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,650
So this is one of
those interesting bits.

58
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,980
Let's go down and look
at it in the description

59
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,510
right here, that if we
write a 1 to this bit,

60
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:25,570
it will clear the corresponding
bit into the raw interrupt status.

61
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,830
There we go.

62
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,940
Again, don't be afraid
of the data sheet.

63
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,568
It's your friend.

64
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:31,068
