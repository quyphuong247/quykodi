00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,722

2
00:00:00,722 --> 00:00:03,430
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So, Jon,
what are we going to learn today?

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:09,950
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Today, we're going
to learn our first try at communicating

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,020
between devices, between two or
more devices using the UART, which

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,440
stands for Universal Asynchronous
Receiver Transmitter.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,840
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So does universal mean

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,100
that all devices communicate this way?

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,370
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: No,
the UART is one of the first,

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:34,730
or one of the original, communication
protocols using what's called RS-232.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,457
And we will use it because
it is quite simple.

11
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:40,790
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So it
must be easy to learn then?

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,940
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes, especially
compared to something like TCP/IP,

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,699
the one used for the internet,
which is extremely complex.

14
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:51,490
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Is it because it has

15
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,357
to account for all kinds of devices that
have to communicate with each other?

16
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:56,440
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,160
In our case, we'll use
a simple protocol where

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,970
two devices are connected
with one serial cable.

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:14,414
And we'll transmit information
from one to the other.

20
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:17,580
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So we're going
to build something exciting this time?

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,960
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Absolutely.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,150
Let's build a chat room.

23
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,227
I will use one launch pad.

24
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:25,060
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
And I'll use another.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,880
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: And we will
be able to ask and answer questions

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,500
by communicating between each other--

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,657
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Using a
simple interface of the launch pad.

28
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:36,740
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,002
This way, we'll have our own
private communication channel.

30
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,460
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Let's do it.

31
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,010
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes!
