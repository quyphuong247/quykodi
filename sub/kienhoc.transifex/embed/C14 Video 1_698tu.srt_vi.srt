00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,440
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
In this video, we will

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,440
demonstrate the fundamental
concepts of sampling.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,200
Here is a slide plot similar
to the one you will use in lab.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,550
The analog signal is shown in
the plot as the blue signal.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,660
And the data points are sampled
as plotted by the red signal.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,440
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So if the
sampling were done faithfully

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,740
to capture the signal, then the
red line would track the blue line.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,665
That is a digital capture would
capture the analog signal faithfully.

10
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:39,600

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,710
So what if it doesn't track?

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,450
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Then
we get the wrong answer.

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,970
So there are many ways in
which the digital samples

14
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,350
are different from the analog samples.

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,590
The first is amplitude quantization.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,360
That means that at every
point, the only choices

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,710
we're going to have are discrete
values between some number

18
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,740
and some other number.

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,490

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,990
Additionally, there
is an amplitude range.

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:20,070
In other words, there is a finite
difference, a finite range,

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,290
between which our samples must exist.

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,975
So in our case, that's
going to be 0 to 3 volts.

24
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:29,940

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,760
The third is time quantization.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:41,800
Because we have to collect
the data into a computer,

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,220
there will be a finite time.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,840
In this case, we can
see where the times are,

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,110
a finite time, that
the data are sampled.

30
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:02,500
And furthermore, one more, and that
is, the time interval is fixed.

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,040
In other words, no matter how much
memory we have in the computer,

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,770
there's always a finite
amount of it, which

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:15,620
means that we can only represent
the data from some minimum time

34
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,910
to some maximum time.

35
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:24,000
And these are the four limitations
that exist in sampling.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,012
So let's review the components
of the data acquisition system.

37
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,720
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
This is the system

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,870
that you're going to build for Lab 14.

39
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,550

40
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,300
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: It begins
with something we want to measure.

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,940
In our case we're going
to measure distance.

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,695
This distance is converted by a sensor.

43
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:47,330

44
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,545
The sensor is connected to a
circuit, to give us a voltage.

45
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,070

46
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,430
The voltage will then
be input to the analog

47
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:05,710
to digital converter, which will
give us a number, a 12 -bit number.

48
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:11,920
Software, that we write,
will convert that number

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,280
into something that means
something, to a distance.

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,130
And lastly we're going to output those
results to a display, which in our case

51
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,255
will be the UART.

52
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:27,760
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Here we're
showing you the data flow diagram.

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,700
So the data initially
is resistance, which

54
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,840
gets converted to a voltage, which
then gets converted to a number.

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,750
And eventually it gets converted to a
string which is displayed on the UART.

56
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,430
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Exactly.

57
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,890
So let's look at the ADC
parameters, the fundamental behavior

58
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,430
of the analog to digital converter.

59
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,640
The first is Precision.

60
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,260
The precision is the number
of different alternatives.

61
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,770
How many different
values can we measure?

62
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:14,460
In our case, it's going to be
12 bits, or 4,096 alternatives.

63
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,149
The second will be the Range.

64
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:24,480
In other words, what is the minimum to
maximum voltage that we can measure.

65
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,580
In our case it will
measure 0 to 3 volts.

66
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,790
And putting those two together,
we can ask what is the Resolution?

67
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:42,680
In other words, the resolution
is the smallest change in voltage

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,575
that can be reliably detected.

69
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:52,660

70
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,230
These three parameters are related.

71
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,780
In other words, the
resolution is a function

72
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,983
of the range divided by the
precision in alternatives.

73
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,690

74
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,800
In our particular case,
the range is 3 volts

75
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,890
minus 0 volts, divided
by a precision of 4,096.

76
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,960
And this will result in a
resolution of 0.7 millivolts.

77
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,290
So any change in voltage here,
greater than 0.7 millivolts,

78
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,470
is detectable by the analog
to digital converter.

79
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,450
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So in summary then,

80
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,790
if we have a really good sensing system,
and an analog to digital converter that

81
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,390
has high resolution,
what we're saying is

82
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:49,850
that it has it can convert and measure
even the smallest change possible.

83
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,170
So the higher the resolution, the
better the sensor, the more expensive

84
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,450
it's going to get.

85
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,140
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Exactly.

86
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,640
All right.

87
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,280
Next we're going to see how the A to D
converter works in our microcontroller.

88
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,903
