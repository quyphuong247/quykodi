00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,940
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So now that
we understand the laws and the

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,280
terminology, let's look at a couple of
concepts that are going to be repeated

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,360
quite often.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:17,540
The first thing is the idea of voltage
division, or voltage divider.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:26,175
The idea of voltage division is that
when I have an element-- here's a

7
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,810
resistance, a second resistance--

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,830
and we have two points a and b.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,750
Let's call this ab, and this
is positive, negative.

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,800
So we have a voltage Vab, which we
just applied across these two

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,300
conductors or resistors.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,190
And we said, let's say these
are resistance R1 and R2.

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,410
And we say that we are connecting
these in series.

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,570
The idea of connecting elements
in series is that they

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,880
share a common point.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,410
That is the idea of connecting
two elements in series.

17
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,420
So this element here and this element
here have a common point.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,320
So there, we say that
they are in series.

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,950
Now, a series connection of
elements creates what we

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,530
call as voltage divider.

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:24,650
That is, the voltage ab is divided
between the first element, R1, and the

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,890
second element, R2.

23
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,470
So we say that there is a voltage drop
here at V1, a voltage drop here at V2,

24
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,070
and there's a plus, minus,
plus, minus.

25
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:43,410
And we have our current, I. So since
they share a common point, the same

26
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,040
current flows through both
of these resistances.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,360
So one of the things we often like
to think of is drawing this as an

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,600
equivalent circuit.

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,710
We say that this is same
as the circuit ab, with

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,040
the voltage ab applied.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,090
And this is my current.

32
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,970
And This is the equivalent circuit.

33
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,190
What this tells us is that the
equivalent resistance, R, is given by

34
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,330
R1 plus R2.

35
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,435
This is what connecting them
in series will give us.

36
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:24,225
What we also know is that the total drop
from a to b is going to be, which

37
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:30,320
is Vab, is equal to the drop across the
first one plus the drop across the

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,120
second one.

39
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,120
So by combining these two equations,
and the fact that the same I flows

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,890
through them, we can say that V1
is given by R1 divided by R1

41
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,635
plus R2 times Vab.

42
00:02:47,635 --> 00:03:00,380
And V2 is given by R2 by R1 plus R2
times Vab, which means that the

43
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,800
voltage drop across any of these
resistance is proportional to the

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,030
resistance R1 divided by the
total equivalent resistance.

45
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,010
So these are things that
we should remember.

46
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,320
So that voltage divider does that.

47
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,000
This is the equivalent resistance
of a voltage divider.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,110
Now, let's take a look at what happens
if you connect elements in parallel.

49
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:36,520
So if I connect two elements in
parallel, so here's my Element R1 and

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,770
Element R2.

51
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,860

52
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:49,290
And here we have, again, a voltage,
so this is my Point a and Point b.

53
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,980
So we have a voltage Vab, which is, by
the way, the same voltage across these

54
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,890
two points, also.

55
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,590
And we have a current I.

56
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:07,850
Now, I is going to split between
these two paths, I1 and I2.

57
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:13,090
You can think of this as water
flowing along a path.

58
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,540
And there are two possible
paths to the water.

59
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,180
Some of the water is going to go this
path, and some water is going to take

60
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,399
the other path.

61
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:27,030
Now, in this case, the amount of
water, and again, here that's

62
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,240
equivalent to current, the amount of
current that flows through R1 and R2

63
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,430
can be calculated based on what
the values of R1 and R2 are.

64
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,570
Let's see what this one looks
like in its equivalent form.

65
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,956
So we say that this is the equivalent
resistance R. And this is, again, ab.

66
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,330
And this is our current, I.

67
00:04:51,330 --> 00:05:01,360
So on the equivalent resistance R,
when we have parallel connection,

68
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,490
again, the idea of parallel connection
is that they share

69
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,340
two points in common.

70
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,330
That is, the two endpoints, so R1
and R2 have the same endpoints.

71
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,150
So they're connected in parallel.

72
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:23,290
R is now given by R1,
R2 by R1 plus R2.

73
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:32,380
This is simply another way of writing
1 by R equals 1 by R1 plus 1 by R2.

74
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:39,620
What we also see is that the voltage
across this, V1 and V2

75
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,650
are really the same.

76
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,240
So V1 equals V2 equals Vab.

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,620
And this should be obvious to you.

78
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,210
Because the voltage across the Element
R1 is a voltage between these two

79
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,600
points, which is also known to be Vab.

80
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,520
The voltage across this is the voltage
across these two points, which is also

81
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,340
known to be Vab.

82
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,220
Now, what we know is I is equal
to I1 plus I2, because

83
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,430
the current is divided.

84
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:20,430
And we can also write, based on these
equations, we can write that I1 is

85
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:33,830
given by R2 divided by R1 plus R2 times
I. And I2 is R1 divided by R1

86
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,320
plus R2 times I.

87
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,670
So this is different from
our voltage division.

88
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,665
This is our current division.

89
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:51,870

90
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:58,760
And current division says that the
current is divided into two parts, if

91
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,770
there are two parts.

92
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,090
And the current is determined
by the relative voltages.

93
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,350
I1 is based on R2 in the numerator.

94
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:14,210
And I2 is based on R1
in the numerator.

95
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,330
Something to remember, because this is
a very common mistake students make.

96
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:26,840
So to summarize then, when we are
working with parallel circuits, we

97
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,760
have current division.

98
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,360
This is the equivalent resistance.

99
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,190
And current is equivalently
divided in these ratios.

100
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,778
