00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,437

2
00:00:00,437 --> 00:00:02,770
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So
here's our stepper motor robot.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,880
And let's review the components.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,810
Up here is the launch pad.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,370
And we have two stepper motors,
each one tied to a wheel.

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,595
There's one stepper motor
tied to the left wheel,

7
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:17,250
and another one to the right wheel.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,060
We have two sensors.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,510
We have the left bumper sensor
here, which is just a switch

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,210
and the right bumper switch as well.

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,910
On the protoboard here are
the L293 motor drivers.

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,490
Here's the one driver, and
over here is the second driver.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,840
This pretty black chip
here is the regulator,

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,630
which takes power from the
battery, the 8.4 volts,

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,720
and generates 5 volts out
to power the launch pad.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,460
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: The two sensors
are connected to port E pins 1 and 0,

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,970
and the two stepper motors
are connected to port B.

18
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,260
And what are those back sensors, Jon?

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,600
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Oh.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,750
Well, every robot has to
protect itself, and you

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,070
don't want to run into
things going backwards,

22
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,685
so the back ones are
for future development.

23
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:16,060
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: All right.

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,894
So let's try it out.

25
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:19,143
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All
right, here's the on switch.

26
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:20,160
Look out.

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,140
Stand back.

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,180
It might explode.

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,570
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: And this
an approaching from the side

30
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,280
where it turns in response.

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,710
Now, if you want to try the
other configuration, where

32
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,810
this is going to approach
from the other angle,

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,340
it should turn according to that
finite state machine design.

34
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:53,080
Now, it's going to be harder for us
to simulate, or envision the situation

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,820
where both bumpers hit at the same time.

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,040
It's unlikely, so because
this one struck first,

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,517
it's going to turn to the right.

38
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:04,850
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right.

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,062
Will this robot protect itself,
or will it fall off the table?

40
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,620
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: It
will fall off the table.

41
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,120
