00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,259

2
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:02,050
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Let's build a system.

3
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,550
We'll use our life
cycle, which means we'll

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,840
begin with the design of the system.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,870
We'll develop a prototype.

6
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,054
We'll test to make sure it works, and
then we'll deploy the embedded system.

7
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:16,470
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So the
system we are going to build

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:28,740
is controlled by a switch, and it's
going to produce a sound, a 100 Hertz

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,170
sound, which is our sound
that we are going to look at.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,510
And we will design both the software
and hardware that goes into it.

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:49,470
And we will use systick
interrupts in the software,

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,387
and we will design a DAC
as part of the hardware.

13
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,720
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,500
Show me the DAC.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,940

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,390
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So we will take
a different approach to the DAC here.

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,280
We've seen two designs for
the DAC that are possible.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,420
One, which is a binary-weighted design.

19
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,340
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: And that's
the one you're going to use in lab.

20
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,470
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: And now we
look at a different design, which

21
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:33,050
is called an R-2R ladder design, which
is a design that a lot of the chips

22
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,341
have in them that produce sound.

23
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:38,340
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So
how does the R-2R work?

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,470
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So let's take
a look at this R-2R ladder circuit.

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,220
As described, it's going
to be a bunch of resistors

26
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,080
that are hooked up this way, which is--

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,490
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Don't
talk while you're erasing.

28
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,820
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
-that are hooked this way.

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,900
We have our three signals,
and we have our resistors.

30
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,950
And this is where we're going to
connect our headphones or our speakers.

31
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,720

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,580
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So why
is it called an R-2R ladder?

33
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,375
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So the resistors
that we use will be in the ratio R-2R.

34
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:29,860
So there's an R here to our 2R.

35
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,640
This will be a 2R.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,580
And this is a 2R, and this is a 2R also.

37
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,150
And so if, let's say, we
picked our R to be 11k.

38
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,580
And that's a good choice because
of the way our voltages work.

39
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,205
And so the 2R is going
to be simply a 22k.

40
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:52,300

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,740
So the way we are going to connect
this to our microcontroller

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,340
is we have our three bits.

43
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,600
This is bit 2, bit 1, bit 0.

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,770
And we connect this to our bit 0.

45
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:18,190
We connect this to our bit 1,
and we connect this to our bit 2.

46
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,360
And we connect this to the ground.

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,940
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So the lowest bit
is furthest away from the headphones--

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,180
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: That is correct.

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,520
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: -physically.

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,478
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
And we'll see why that's

51
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:30,250
the case once we do our computation.

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:38,237
Now, the analysis of this is done easily
using the Principle of Superposition.

53
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:43,531

54
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:45,620
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
So what does that mean?

55
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,690
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So let's take
a look at how superposition works.

56
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,226
