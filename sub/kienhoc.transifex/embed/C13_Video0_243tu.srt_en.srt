00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,280
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So, Jon,
what are we gonna learn today?

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,130
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Today we're going
to build systems that work with sound.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,580
We'll import sound with
a microphone, and we

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,997
will produce sound with a speaker.

6
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:16,830
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
OK, so you mean we're

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,199
going to build systems that look
like MP3 players and recorders?

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,990
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Well, yes, but rather

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,280
than deal with the complexities
of a format like MP3,

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,810
we'll focus on the fundamentals
of signal processing

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,430
as it applies to sound.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,280
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So we will be
looking at concepts like digitization,

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,390
the Nyquist Theorem, and maybe
apply these concepts to build

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:50,010
a circuit hardware that converts
digital information to analog form,

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,687
or analog information to digital form?

16
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:53,770
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,380
First we'll build a Digital
to Analog Converter, or DAC,

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,819
and we'll use it to create sound.

19
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:04,860
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: The DAC circuit
sounds interesting, but where will

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,454
we use it?

21
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:07,120
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Well, you know me.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,050
If we don't build something that's
interesting and useful, it's no fun.

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:19,290
So let's build a DAC system that outputs
a hundred Hertz sine wave connected up

24
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,640
to a speaker, and we'll
generate a pretty tone.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,280
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK, so we could
also watch it on an oscilloscope,

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,597
so that we can verify the function
by looking at a sine wave.

27
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:32,680
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,162
This sine wave we will
use to shape our world.

29
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:37,662
