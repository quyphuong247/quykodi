00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,150
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Let's talk about sound.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,180
We're going to see sound
from two perspectives.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,950
We're going to see some
from the generation.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,580
How do we generate sound?

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,200
And then we're going to look at
sound and how we perceive it,

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,880
and how the perception happens.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,660
Our micro controller
is going to control.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,580
It will use our DAC to
convert the digital to analog.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,090
And then we'll use a speaker
to generate the sound.

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,140
The sound is a air pressure.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,820
And so we're going to have pieces
of air at high pressure followed

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,500
by pieces at low pressure.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,050
High pressure, low pressure,
high pressure, low pressure.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,870
And this sound is going
to-- this pressure

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,370
wave is going to traverse the air.

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,110
And our ears are going to perceive it.

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:04,390
The ear drum will oscillate, and
we'll touch the nerves in our ear

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,605
and our brain will perceive the sound.

20
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:10,750

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,400
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So some
perceived this way, visualize this way,

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,140
is change in air pressure.

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,390
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,700
And if we look at this air
pressure, we can visualize it

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,940
as an oscillation of pressure.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,310
And so, we can see
that at any given spot,

27
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,740
the air pressure is going to
oscillate with respect to time.

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,870
The other way that we can perceive
sound, or understand sound,

29
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,820
is the fact that this pressure
wave actually travels.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,400
And so this pressure is
also oscillates in space.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,260
So the wave actually propagates away
from the generator to the perceiver.

32
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,050
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So now that
we've looked at what sound is,

33
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,020
let's look at the properties of sound.

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,919
First, we know that sound
can be visualized as a wave.

35
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,765

36
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:18,390
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: And so
there are properties of this wave.

37
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:25,610
One of the obvious properties
is the period of this wave.

38
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:32,040
And one over this
period is the frequency.

39
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,580
And when we talk about sound,
we define this frequency

40
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,090
as the pitch, high pitch or low pitch.

41
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,590
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: The second
property of sound, or in a wave,

42
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,860
is the amplitude.

43
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,930

44
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,140
In the context of sound,
we call this loudness.

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,340

46
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,175
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So if the sound
is much louder, it will be bigger.

47
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:03,710

48
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,290
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: That is correct.

49
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:13,290
So, let's take a simple note, a
sound that all of us can relate to,

50
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,360
an A-note on a piano or a keyboard.

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,110
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
This A note is going

52
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:26,470
to oscillate and 440 cycles per
second, so we'll call it 440 Hertz.

53
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,470
If we were to go down an octave to the
octave below, we get another A note,

54
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,980
and it oscillates at one half
that frequency, or 220 Hertz.

55
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:46,965
If we go 1 octave up, then it'll
oscillate twice that, or 880 Hertz.

56
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:51,270

57
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,370
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So we can
have notes in between things.

58
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,780
Let's look at some notes that
are useful and make a nice sound.

59
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:16,529
The note G which is at 392 Hertz,
the note E, which is 329.6 Hertz,

60
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:23,180
and the note C which is 261.6 hertz.

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,920
You will see that these numbers
have a relationship when

62
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,332
you do the lab for this
class, this particular module.

63
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:32,207
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Yeah, in the lab, where

64
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:37,650
it's going to use these four
notes to generate a piano.

65
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,950
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So, we saw sound
can be described by three properties-

66
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,930
the frequency of sound, the
amplitude, or the loudness of sound,

67
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,560
and there's a third property,
which is the shape of sound.

68
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,080
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So if you
wanted to listen to a trumpet,

69
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,197
you would see that the trumpet wave
looks different than the sine wave

70
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:05,360
that we drew in the last picture.

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,270
The shape of this sound is different.

72
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,870
It still oscillates, but it's
not as regular as the pure tone

73
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,382
that we did in the last slide.

74
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,090
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So let's
put all of these things together.

75
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,490
We're going to build a system
that will produce sound

76
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,250
by converting digital
signal to an analog sample.

77
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,860
We'll hook up a speaker that'll
produce sound that we can listen to.

78
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,180
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
All right let's go.
