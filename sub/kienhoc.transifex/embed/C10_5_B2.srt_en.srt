00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,420
You have seen a Logic Analyzer 
operating in simulation mode.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,250
Today, we're going to show you 
a real Logic Analyzer.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:13,519
First, we're going to connect signals
of our circuit to the Logic Analyzer.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,790
So we're going to connect 4 pins 
for the left motor and 4 more pins

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,440
for the right motor and the two pins 
associated with the sensors.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,320
So we'll connect these 10 pins 
to the Logic Analyzer.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,640
OK.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,160
This is a window showing you real-time recording 
as the motor is spinning.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,690
Both sensors are off, so they're spinning
in the same direction.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,829
These four pins right here, these four signals, 
represent one motor.

11
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:47,489
And there's the 5-- 01, 01.

12
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,070
And these four pins are the other motor.

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,460
And there's a 5.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,630
And so as it turns, we can see that the two
motors will go through the pattern

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,190
that we've programmed.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,190
This is a hardware physical way to test that
the system is operational.

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,570
So Jon, what
would happen if I were to press the left bumper

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,950
sensor that is detecting a wall?

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,460
You see that what will happen
is the speed will drop in half.

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,170
And the one motor will turn in one direction.

21
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,190
And the other motor will turn in the other
direction.

22
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,590
Push the other button.

23
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,590
OK.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,640
Let me try the other one.

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,470
Again, pushing the right bumper
will rotate one wheel in the opposite direction

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,210
and drop the speed in half.

27
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:51,900
So we verified the functioning of our logic,
both physically by observing it and also by

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,740
monitoring it in a Logic Analyzer.

29
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,329
One last thing to notice
is that the time between steps is exactly

30
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,229
20 milliseconds.

31
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,670
And this 20 milliseconds was created with
the SysTick periodic interrupts.
