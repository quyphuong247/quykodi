JON VALVANO: Hi, I'm Jon Valvano, a
professor of electrical and computer

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,750
engineering here at the University
of Texas at Austin.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,810
I received my bachelor's and master's
degree in 1977 from MIT in computer

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,630
engineering.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,800
And then in 1981, I received my Ph.D.
From the joint Harvard MIT program in

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,260
medical engineering and
medical physics.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,220
I've been here at the University of
Texas for 32 years, teaching and doing

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,390
research in medical instrumentation.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,260
I've written five college textbooks on
embedded systems, and my research

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,310
involves analog and digital circuits,
low power design, simulation, and

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,400
medical instrumentation.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,620
Recently, I co-founded a company called
Admittance Technologies, which

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,900
deploys medical devices for
cardiac measurements.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,480
I just love to build things.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,700
But more importantly, I
just love teaching.
