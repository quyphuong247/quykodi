DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So in this
module, as we said, we're going to

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,870
look at some fundamental concepts
that underlie embedded systems.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,740
But before we get to components of an
embedded system, we want to get some

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,590
basics out of the way.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,850
The first important concept we're going
to look at is number systems.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:31,140
That is, all computers use a basic
representation for numbers.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,980
In order to understand the binary
number system, which is what the

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,550
computers use, we'll draw parallels to
a system that we are more familiar

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,050
with-- the decimal number system.

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:51,960
The decimal number system is sometimes
referred to as the base-10 system.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,870
A base-10 system has--

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,780
any system has two important
characteristics.

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:06,350
That is, each position
has a place value.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,960
That is, when I say that
I have a number of--

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,800
5 digit number, each digit
is a position.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,253
So each position has a place value.

17
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:23,580

18
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:32,220
And the value attributed to each
place is a power of 10, which

19
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:41,160
is a power of 10.

20
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,680

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,740
The second characteristic of
any number system is, what

22
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,030
are the valid values?

23
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,020
That is, when we--

24
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,626
the valid values are the coefficients.

25
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:58,680

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:12,197
In the case of the base-10 system, the
valid values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

27
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:14,600
7, 8, and 9.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,430

29
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:31,010
So for example, when I look at a number
like 4723 in base 10-- so we--

30
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,740
to represent a number in base 10,
we simply write it this way.

31
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,500
We say that this number represents 4--

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,040
so each of these positions.

33
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,770
So we have 4, 7, 2, and 3.

34
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:51,000
And three has a place value,
which is 10 to the zero.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,084
2 has a place value, which
is 10 to the one.

36
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:57,280
7 has a place value, which
is 10 to the two.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,640
And 4 has a place value, which
is 10 to the three.

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,460
So when we add these together, we get
the numbers, so which is 4,000,

39
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,920
700, 20, and 3.

40
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:28,010
So this number represents
4723 in base 10.

41
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:35,880
So let's take a look at the binary
number system, which is a base-2

42
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,130
number system.

43
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:43,520

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:54,870
So again, the first thing is, we have
place values, which are powers of 2.

45
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:04,880
And the valid values are 0 and 1.

46
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:14,960

47
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:28,560
So for example then, if I'm given
a number, 1101 to the base 2--

48
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,770
so a number, 1101 to the base 2
represents the coefficients

49
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,750
1, 0, 1, and 1.

50
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,580
And this 1 has a place value
of 2 to the zero.

51
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,530
This 0 has a place value
of 2 to the one.

52
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,310
This 1 has a place value
of 2 to the two.

53
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,340
And this 1 has a place value
of 2 to the three.

54
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,710
So I add them up.

55
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,430
I get an 8 plus a 4, plus that's
a 0 times 2 to the one.

56
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:09,420
That's a 0 plus one, which
is a 13 in base 10.

57
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:16,300
So now that we understand how a base-2
system works and how a base-10 system

58
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,910
works, we can actually generalize
this to any base.

59
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:34,280
For example, if I look at a
base-n system, where my--

60
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,700
it's n can be either 2 or 10 in this
case, then the valid values are going

61
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,730
to be from 0, 1, 2, all the
way up to n minus 1.

62
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,040
So for example here, it's
10 minus 1, which is 9.

63
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,790
Here it is 2 minus 1, which is 1.

64
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:03,530
So as we move on, any base system can
be easily deciphered based on our

65
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:10,710
understanding of what the coefficients
are and what the base is.

66
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,860
