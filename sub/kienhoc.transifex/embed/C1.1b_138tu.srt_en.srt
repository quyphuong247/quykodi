RAMESH YERRABALLI: Hi, I'm Ramesh
Yerraballi, a senior lecturer here at

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,330
the University of Texas at Austin.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,640
I have dual appointments from the
Department of Electrical and Computer

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,390
Engineering and Biomedical
Engineering.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,630
I've been a researcher and a teacher
for the past 20 years.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,240
My research interests are in real time
systems, multimedia communications,

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,630
and operating system security.

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,980
As a teacher, I've been teaching
courses in computer

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,170
science off all subjects.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,860
What I've been doing more recently is
teaching embedded systems, programming

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,820
at all levels, and statistics
and probability.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,690
Jon, my colleague, may have written
the book on embedded systems, by I

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,440
make him look good when
I teach from it.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,900
I love teaching, but what I like more
than teaching is building things.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,920
And I hope to share my passion
for building and teaching

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,170
through this course.

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,070
