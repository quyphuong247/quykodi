DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Next we're
going to test the robot car.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,490
Similar to a logic
analyzer, an oscilloscope

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,080
is a non-intrusive hardware
debugging instrument

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,630
that allows us to observe signals in
their amplitude versus time behavior.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:22,170
I have connected up to channel
0 one end of the motor.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,040
So we see when the output is a 0
to the motor, power is applied.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,180

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,510
On channel two we have the output
of the microcontroller, which

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,680
is the PWM, or Pulse Width
Modulated Signal here at 10%.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,240
So over here we've got a
measurement going, 10%,

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,710
and now we're going
to push some buttons.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,250
And now we're going to 20%.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,440
You see the motor has started.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,990
30%.

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,950
Faster.

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,670
40%.

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,360
50%.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,010
60%.

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,550
70%.

21
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,280
80%.

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,780
90%.

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,280
And the motor is now spinning very fast.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,080
So in summary, the microcontroller
adjusts the power to the motor

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,050
by adjusting the duty cycle.

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,570
And we see for each of the patterns,
the period was exactly a millisecond,

27
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,770
but we adjusted the duty cycle.

28
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,600
And this measurement was
obtained with an oscilloscope.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,567
