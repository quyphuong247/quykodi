00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450

00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,241
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Professor Yerraballi,

3
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:03,690
what are we going to learn today?

4
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,840
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:.Today we will
take stock of everything we have

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,180
learned in this class.

6
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,560
Put them all together to work
on a single, final project.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,870
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
That sounds exciting.

8
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,430
But if we include all things in one
project, it'll be very complicated.

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,299
To make it worthwhile,
can we do something fun?

10
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:23,840
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:.In fact,
that's exactly what it'll be,

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,460
as much fun as you want to make it.

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,130
After all, it'll be a game that
you'll design from scratch.

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,790
We will provide the basic idea, which
would be based on an '80s style arcade

14
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,650
game called Space Invaders.

15
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,939
You stretch your imagination and
make it as much fun as possible.

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:39,980
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah.

17
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,220
So from a hardware standpoint,
we could make a game controller

18
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,030
using the switches, the
LED, and the slide pot.

19
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,370
And to make sound, we'll use the DAC.

20
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,574
And then we'll add graphics on an LCD.

21
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:51,740
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:.Yeah.

22
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,580
And on the software front, you'll
program timers, interrupts, the ADC,

23
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,590
and write device drivers
for the DAC and the LCD.

24
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,650
We'll put together all of these in
a game engine that we will provide.

25
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,800
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah.

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,700
So this is quite a complex undertaking.

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,865
Will the students have to
write everything from scratch?

28
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:12,240
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:.Not quite.

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,890
We will provide a starter
project for this lab,

30
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,460
and the starter project will have the
support routines for the LCD graphics.

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,650
The rest of the stuff will
come from your own work

32
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,870
that you finished in the previous labs.

33
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,555
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Can we
see what one might look like?

34
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:25,840
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:.Yeah.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,410
Let's take a look.

36
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,270
So here you see the project
implemented in its entirety.

37
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,460
John is playing the game.

38
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,075
The controller involves
two buttons, two LEDs,

39
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:41,870
a slide pot which acts like a joystick.

40
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,440
The audio is implemented using a DAC.

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,030
And audio jack is connected
to a speaker here,

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,340
but you could connect
your headphones to it.

43
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,040
You see the display, which is
an optional display-- which

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,834
is a black and white display
that you can purchase.

45
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,000
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: If
you don't have the display,

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,845
we'll have a way for you to
send the signals on to your PC

47
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:07,193
and display them on that screen.

48
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,516
Oh.

49
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:09,400
Dead.

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,785
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:.Dead.

51
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:11,284
