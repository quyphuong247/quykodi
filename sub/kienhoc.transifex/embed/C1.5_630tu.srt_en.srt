00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,820
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Hi.

3
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,100
I'm Ramesh Yerraballi.

4
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,830
JON VALVANO: And I'm Jon Valvano.

5
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,310
And in this video, we will
show you the lab kit.

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,420
And just to get you excited about this
class, we will also demonstrate the

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,890
completed labs.

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,620
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Here they are.

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,970
JON VALVANO: The most important
part of the kit is the

10
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,520
microcontroller board.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,690
And each of you will purchase a Tiva
LaunchPad development system, which

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,090
comes with a standard USB cable.

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,229
And this is the ARM Cortex-M
processor.

14
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,070
You will be using this board to
complete five of the labs.

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,010
RAMESH YERRABALLI: The remaining labs,
which are a little more exciting,

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,810
require some external components.

17
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:48,270
The components you will need are a few
resistors of various sizes, a few

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,470
light-emitting diodes of different
colors, a few switches,

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,010
and add audio jack.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,260
JON VALVANO: And for the transducer,
we'll be using a slide pot.

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,950
Depending upon where and how you
buy it, you might get a short

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,320
one or a long one.

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,170
Either size is OK.

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,360
RAMESH YERRABALLI: And to put things
together, you will need some cables

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,930
and a breadboard.

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,950
You could buy them as a separate
kit, or as a kit together.

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,240
It does not matter.

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,370
And what size you buy also
does not matter.

29
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,910
JON VALVANO: And all the buying
instructions are on the website.

30
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,920
And we will now show you the labs
in the order in which you

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,400
will complete them.

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,230
RAMESH YERRABALLI: So as Jon mentioned,
the first few labs, we'll

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,560
just use the launchpad and a cable
connected to your computer.

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,640
JON VALVANO: And in the interfacing
lab, you will interface a

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,335
switch and an LED.

36
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,580

37
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,010
RAMESH YERRABALLI: In the traffic light
controller lab, we will use a

38
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,870
finite state machine to implement a
traffic light controller, and the

39
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:59,540
interface will involve switches for
traffic and a switch for the

40
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,230
pedestrian button.

41
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,520
JON VALVANO: And in the guitar tuner
lab, we will use interrupts to create

42
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,500
the note A.

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,530
RAMESH YERRABALLI: So Jon,
what is this doing here?

44
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,200
JON VALVANO: Well, Ramesh, in addition
to the labs the students will do,

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,380
there will be some projects that
we will show you how it works.

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,020
And so this stepper motor car actually
combines all the components of these

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,530
labs so far.

48
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,325
And you can see, it moves.

49
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:36,248

50
00:02:36,248 --> 00:02:39,490
Professor Yerraballi, the labs
are getting more interesting.

51
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,270
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Yeah, let's
take a look at them.

52
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,980
JON VALVANO: This is the
digital piano lab.

53
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,520
You will interface switches and build
a digital to analog converter.

54
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,120
And together, they will make sound.

55
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,500
[PLAYING TUNE TO "MARY
HAD A LITTLE LAMB"

56
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,650

57
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,805
And that sound can also
be used as music.

58
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,068
[EMITS MUSICAL BEEPS]

59
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:03,460

60
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,220
RAMESH YERRABALLI: This is
the data acquisition lab.

61
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,320
And in this lab, you will interface a
slide pot, a potentiometer, and the

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,200
position of the slide pot will be
displayed on an LCD display.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,350
JON VALVANO: And we'll put it all
together and create a handheld video

64
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:27,100
game, which has a joystick, it has
sounds, and here you see a space

65
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,430
invader game.

66
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,810
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Here's an alternate
version of the same game, except we

67
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,830
put all of the components
on a single board.

68
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:41,230
Again, you have your joystick and
your buttons to play the game.

69
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,300

70
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,070
Hey, Jon, what is this again?

71
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,840
JON VALVANO: Just like before, there
will be some projects that we will

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,850
build for you.

73
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,260
Here is a digital to analog converter
which is different than the one that

74
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,630
you build in lab.

75
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,940
And here is our autonomous robot.

76
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,430
We'll put together all the concepts of
this class to make a robot which can

77
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,580
drive straight down the road.

78
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,790
There you have it.

79
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,230
I hope you have as much fun taking
this class as we had

80
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,480
making it for you.

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,793
