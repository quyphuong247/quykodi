PROFESSOR JONATHAN
VALVANO: In this video,

3
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,580
let's look up how to
connect the audio jack.

4
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:09,750
Now, there's lots of audio jacks
out there, but this one is typical.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,700
Let's look and see if we
can find how to connect it.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:19,300
So down here, it tells us that
there are terminals, and the three

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,880
terminals that most of the
jacks have is this one here,

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,050
which is the sleeve,
which will be our ground.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,920
And most of them have a
seven, which is the tip,

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,200
and we'll have a six
here, which is the ring.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,990
Hey Justin, which is which?

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,896
What's the ring and tip?

13
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:45,244
JUSTIN: The tip is the left channel
and the ring is the right channel.

14
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:46,535
PROFESSOR JONATHAN VALVANO: OK.

15
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:49,320
So Justin tells us that
the tip is the left channel

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,380
and the ring is the right channel.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,870
To see it as a circuit,
we can scroll down

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,610
and see that the equivalent
circuit for this jack.

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:05,370
again, is the sleeve and
the tip and the ring.

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,310
So we're going to connect our output
across the sleeve and either the ring

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,476
or the tip to make our sound.

22
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:14,976
