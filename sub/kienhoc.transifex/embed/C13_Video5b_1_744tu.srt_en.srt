00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So let's
analyze the R2R ladder circuit

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,470
that we've used for our design.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,210
So we have three situations here.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,160
The three situations
correspond to our bit2 bit1,

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:29,070
bit0, being 0,0,1, which is my first
one; 0,1,0, which is this scenario;

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,007
and a 1,0,0, which is
the third scenario.

7
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,090
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So
the Law of Superpositions

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,770
says if we look at these
three basis elements,

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,540
and prove that these three
work, the other five, which

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,786
are combinations of these
three will also work.

11
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:49,590
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So
we see that, in this circuit

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,100
here, let's analyze this one first,
we see that all of these circuits

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,190
have something common to them
in terms of their behavior.

14
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,830
When they finally reduce them,
they will have this form.

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:19,340
That is, we will have a signal
that is at 3.3 volts with a 2R

16
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,630
and a R. That is, the net resistance
from the powering signal to ground

17
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,770
is going to 3R.

18
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,740
it's just a matter of combining
them based on what you already

19
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,010
know about series and
parallel resistors.

20
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,870
So if you did that, then we can
find out what the current is.

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,850
The current as we see
here that is leaving out

22
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:57,760
of this node, this node, or this node
is simply given by 3.3 divided by 3R,

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:10,490
which in our case is going to come out
to be 0.1 milliamps because R is 11K.

24
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,510
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: I see
you also ignored the speaker.

25
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,760
The 32 ohms of speakers is a very
small number compared to 11,000,

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,210
so you just ignored it.

27
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,460
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Yes, that is correct.

28
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:30,070
So now what we notice then is when
we look at each of these values,

29
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,850
and we find out what the current
is, which this is I,0,I which is,

30
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,090
in our case, the current.

31
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,990
The first one is a I sub
0,0,1, which is this one.

32
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:53,080
In the second case, it's a I sub 0,1,0.

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,140
and in the third case,
this is an I sub1,0,0.

34
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,350
so we can calculate
this is by looking at,

35
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,570
for example, how I sub
0,0,1 gets calculated.

36
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,730
We have I coming out of
here, which we know is this.

37
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,340
It gets split.

38
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,150
And it gets split in 2R and this net
resistance is also going to be 2R,

39
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,780
so it splits halfway.

40
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,170
So half goes here.

41
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,030
Half goes here.

42
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,420
And then, when it comes
here, the same thing

43
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,740
happens, which is this
is going to be 2R.

44
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,510
So it goes half goes
here, and half goes here.

45
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,330
so we've halved it again.

46
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,380
And eventually it goes
half here and half here.

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,380
So what we see is that I,0,0,1
has been halved three times,

48
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,410
so it's going to be I divided by 8.

49
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,080
Similarly, here, we will have
this divide half and half.

50
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,400
And again, it will be exactly half.

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,550
And then it'll divide
half and half and half.

52
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,430
And so it's only divided two times,
so that's going to be I divided by 4.

53
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,440
And in this case, it is
divided half and half.

54
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,400
So it's only divided once,
so it's going to be I over 2.

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,420
So the law of superposition the tells us
that if I had a different combination,

56
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:25,220
let's say I had a combination which was
up 0,1,1/ Then this will give me a net

57
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:33,910
current of I over 8, which is because
of this bit which is a 0,0,1 scenario,

58
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,010
plus the 0,1,0 scenario,
which is an I over 4.

59
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,810

60
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,290
And similarly, we can evaluate the other
situation, so no matter what we have,

61
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:57,140
it's a simple linear combination
of our individual bits.

62
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:06,834
And lastly, 1,1,1 is going to be simply
I over 8, plus I over 4, plus I over 2.

63
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,880
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So we have a
linear relationship between the number

64
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,580
N, which is between 0
and 7, and the output

65
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,435
current, which is going
across our speaker.

66
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,060
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: That is correct.

67
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,230
And the higher the digital
value, the higher the current.

68
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,820
And that's how we know it is doing
a digital-to-analog conversion.

69
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,080
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Well, we still
have to make it oscillate, don't we?

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,960
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: That is correct.

71
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,085
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: How
are we going to do that?

72
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:34,834
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So what we did here

73
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:40,390
is build the hardware
part of our solution.

74
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:46,620
Now we have to look at the software
part of our solution, which

75
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,370
is going to be using SysTick.

76
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,550
