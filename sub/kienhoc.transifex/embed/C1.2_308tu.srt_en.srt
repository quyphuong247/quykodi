00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,110

2
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,570
JONATHAN VALVANO: So, Dr. Yerraballi,
do you suppose we have a philosophy

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,360
that guides us in our teaching?

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,720
RAMESH YERRABALLI: I'd like to think
there's three parts to it.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,580
The first is we urge you to try.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,270
Try till you succeed.

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,290
We believe education is about
mastering skills.

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,610
It's not a race to the top.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,350
Therefore, we allow you multiple
attempts on quizzes and labs.

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,260
JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,610
Realizing that it is OK to try and
fail leads to risk taking and

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,750
exploring alternative paths.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,210
Ultimately, with this approach, you
will develop a creative mind.

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,760
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Second, we believe in
a bottom up approach to education.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,190
This means we start with
simple concepts.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,450
JONATHAN VALVANO: And once you've
mastered those simple concepts, you'll

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,900
be able to put them together to
develop higher level tasks.

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,080
This means that in the early part
of this class, the labs

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,930
may seem very easy.

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,780
But once you've mastered these
concepts, you'll be

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,060
able to put them together.

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,020
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Our third philosophy
is learning by doing.

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,710
Therefore, we placed 90% of the
grade in this class just on

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,420
completing the labs.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,060
10% of the grade is on quizzes.

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,770
45% of the grade is on completing
the labs in simulation.

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,510
The remaining 45% is to complete
the lab on the real board.

28
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,390
JONATHAN VALVANO: We know in our years
of experience that students do not

29
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,230
learn by the careful words we speak in
lecture or write in our books, but

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,770
rather our students learn when they take
our words and apply them to lab,

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,300
designing, developing, testing,
evaluating, on a real lab environment.

32
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,440
RAMESH YERRABALLI: So we invite
you into our adventure.

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,850
Please do not be deterred by the
mistakes you make in the lab.

34
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,210
JONATHAN VALVANO: It is our intent for
you to explore new ideas and learn

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,460
from your mistakes.

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,202
