1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,287

2
00:00:00,287 --> 00:00:02,870
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: We have
written the software, downloaded

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,900
onto the launch pad, and we
have built the R2R ladder.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,740
Next we're going to debug it.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,460
What we have is one channel
of the logic analyzer

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,955
connected here to the DAC output,
and we have the second channel

7
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:19,870
of the logic analyzer
connected to the heartbeat.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:25,800
And now let's look at the output
of the DAC when we push the button.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,240
On this screen over here,
we see the oscilloscope.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,120
The orange is the DAC output,
and the blue is the heartbeat.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,110
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So I'm
going to press the switch, which

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,530
should cause an interrupt, which it's
being interrupted by the SysTick,

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,749
and we're producing a sine
wave in response to it.

14
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:47,790
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: OK.

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,940
We see that the heartbeat
toggles the output.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,450
Every interrupt.

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,340
And so we can see that each
time we get an interrupt,

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,940
a new value is output to the DAC.

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:10,255
The numbers that we're outputting were
a 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 6, 5, 4,

20
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:13,440
2, 1, 1, 1 again.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,730
And this pattern repeats over and over.

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,615
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So, how do we verify

23
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:23,809
whether the time between interrupts
is correct to 100 Hertz, Jon?

24
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:24,850
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah.

25
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,000
That's fairly easy,
because all I need to do

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,120
is measure the time
here to the time here

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:42,790
to see that my system takes
approximately 10 milliseconds

28
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,030
to generate one wave form.

29
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,677
So that's something I
do with oscilloscope.

30
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:49,760
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So
what does it sound like?

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,060
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah.

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,560
Plug it in.

33
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,490
Let's see.

34
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,281
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So let's plug it in.

35
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:58,770
So we'll plug in a speaker to our DAC.

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,320
And I'm going to play the sound.

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,180

38
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,510
And it sounds like 100 Hertz.

39
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,996
So if you play around with this,
we could get something more fun.

40
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:12,870
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
That's what lab is for.

41
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,370
DR. RAMESH YERRBALLI: All right.

42
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,220
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Your turn.
