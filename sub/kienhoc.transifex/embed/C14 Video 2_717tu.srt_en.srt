00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,279

2
00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:02,070
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So in this video, we

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,680
will show you the essential process by
which the analog to digital conversion

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,900
occurs.

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,803
This is called successive approximation.

6
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,590

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,150
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: There
are a couple of components.

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,320
The unknown input exists here
that we're trying to sample,

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,040
and will eventually show
up as a digital output.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,700
We're going to demonstrate how
this works by playing a game.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,070
And we need one person to be
mean and one person to be smart.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,520
Professor Yerraballi, which
one do you want to be,

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,580
the mean one or the smart one?

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,570
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: If you ask
like that, I want to be the smart one.

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,611
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: OK.

16
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:42,120
So I'm the mean person.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,060
That's me right here.

18
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:50,710
And what has just happened is I have
guessed a number, an 8-bit number.

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,930
And this 8-bit number can
exist from zero to 255,

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,250
but I'm not going to
tell you what it is.

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,560
You're going to have to guess.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,730
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: But you're
going to give me some hints.

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,854
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: I am.

24
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,770
So Professor Yerraballi is going
to make the guess right here.

25
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,303
And then I'm going to tell him
whether his answer is high or low.

26
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,386
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

27
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:13,359
I'm going to guess 128.

28
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,400
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: OK.

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,610
Good guess.

30
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,990
Professor Yerraballi guesses 128.

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,902
My answer is lower than that.

32
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:24,860
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So it's lower than that.

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,933
So I'm going to choose 64.

34
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:28,474
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah, good guess.

35
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:28,973
64.

36
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:30,760
But not right.

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,057
My answer is lower than 64.

38
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:35,140
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

39
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,900
Even lower.

40
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,600
So I'm going to guess 32.

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,122
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah, 32.

42
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:43,400
Well, now you've stumped me.

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,817
My guess is actually
higher, or it might be 32.

44
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,900
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

45
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,000
So I will guess between 64 and 32.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,279
I'll guess 48.

47
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:56,320
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Hm.

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,130
48.

49
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,307
My guess is lower than 48.

50
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:03,390
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,600
So 32 and 48.

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,631
I guess 40.

53
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:08,672
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah.

54
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:11,360
You're getting closer.

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,547
My guess is higher than 40,
or it might be 40 itself.

56
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:17,630
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

57
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,339
So how about 44?

58
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:21,380
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah.

59
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,070
Closer still.

60
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,042
My guess is lower than 44.

61
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,250
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Go on.

62
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,210
Give me your answer.

63
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,279
I'm going to go for 42.

64
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,320
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Hm.

65
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,740
42.

66
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,887
My answer is higher than 42,
or it might be 42 itself.

67
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:40,970
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

68
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,800
How about 43?

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,610
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: My
answer is lower than 43.

70
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,840
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Ah.

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,050
You got to be kidding me.

72
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,004
It is 42.

73
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,170
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: It is!

74
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,980
Good guess.

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,300
My answer was 42.

76
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,810
And that's what will come out over here.

77
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,809
Do you want to see a cool trick?

78
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:02,350
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Yeah, show me.

79
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,683
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right.

80
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:09,060
What if every time you
guessed, I gave a binary value?

81
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,320
What if I said low meant
0 and high meant 1?

82
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,700
So you guessed low, low, high, low,
high, low, high, low, in that order.

83
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,188
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Ah.

84
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:26,460
So what you've done is
in each guess you're

85
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,406
guessing one bit of the binary
representation of the number.

86
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:32,780
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Absolutely.

87
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,321
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Starting
with the most significant bit

88
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,416
and winding down to
the least significant.

89
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,540
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yeah.

90
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,960
So if you look at this
first guess, we can

91
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,320
see something very
significant happening.

92
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,490
By guessing 128, I was forced to
tell Professor Yerraballi what

93
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,540
bit seven was, and I did
that by saying it was low.

94
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,870
Then, knowing bit seven,
he then guessed bit six.

95
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,570
And one by one, he guessed each bit in
order from bit seven all the way down

96
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,930
to bit zero.

97
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,210
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
That's a cool trick.

98
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,126
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
It's not really a trick.

99
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:16,649
It's actually how your A to D converter
in your microcontroller works.

100
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:24,040
It's called successive approximation
because each guess reveals one bit.

101
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,080
So with our 12-bit
converter, the same process

102
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,662
happens, except it
has to guess 12 times.

103
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:32,820
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So
the ADC conversion speed

104
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,880
is linear with the number of bits.

105
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,040
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

106
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,100
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: That is,
if I double the number of bits,

107
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,390
it's going to double the amount
of time to reach an answer.

108
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,940
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.
