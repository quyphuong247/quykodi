00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,493
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Hi.

3
00:00:01,493 --> 00:00:05,210
I'm Professor Yerraballi, and this
is the University of Texas at Austin.

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,290
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: And
I'm Professor Valvano.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,085
And today we're going to demonstrate
this robot we've been building.

6
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:14,210
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK, so John,
let's talk about some of the components

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,289
on that robot.

8
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,330
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
There are three components.

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,130
The infrared sensors together
with A to D converter

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,300
are used to measure
distance to the wall.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,120
The background thread, the
interrupt service thread

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,020
will generate two PWM signals to
control the power to the two motors

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,170
so that I can turn left and right.

14
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,530
And the controller, the
main loop of the software

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,080
will adjust the power to
the two motors and attempt

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,849
to drive straight down the road.

17
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:47,890
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK, so we saw
the software, we saw the components,

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,410
now let's see it run.

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,300
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Yeah, let's try it.

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,336
Straight down the road, there.

21
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,740
Straight down the road.

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,949
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Wally.

23
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:58,240
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Oh, yeah.

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,330
Nice and straight.

25
00:00:59,330 --> 00:00:59,780
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Yeah.

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,720
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Nice and
straight, nice and straight.

27
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,436
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Take it easy.

28
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,269
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Look out for the wall.

29
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,430
Yeah.

30
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,670
And around the corner.

31
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,710
Yeah, Wally.

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,940
Good job.

33
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,800
Don't hit the cameraman.

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,100
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So Jon,
what have we learned from this lab?

35
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,440
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Today we learned
that the sensors collect information,

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,450
and the A to D converter
on the micro controller

37
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,570
converts that information
into digital numbers.

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,170
The software then can make
decisions on those numbers,

39
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,310
and then have outputs connected to
actuators that can affect the world.

40
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,810
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So that's it.

41
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,090
Embedded Systems shape the world.

42
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,490
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Indeed.

43
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,391
