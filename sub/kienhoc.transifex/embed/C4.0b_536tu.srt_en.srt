DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Hi.

3
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,940
In this video, we will introduce
digital logic--

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,780
not to teach you everything about
it, but give you a glimpse

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,250
of how things work.

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,080
In digital logic, we have two states.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,670
The true state is going to be
mapped to a high voltage--

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,450
in our case, 3.3 volts--

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,710
and a false state is going
to be mapped to 0 volts.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,900
And the way this is going to work
is around two transistors.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,980
The first is a P-channel.

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:40,040
The P-channel has three pins, it
has a gate, it has a source,

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,090
and it has a drain.

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,970
And the way the P-channel works is,
if there is a positive voltage--

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,300
a positive voltage--

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:56,620
between the source down to the gate,
then this transistor will be on, and

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,400
can conduct current down,
from source to drain.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,630
The other type of transistor
also has three pins.

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,700
It's called an N-channel.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,300
And the N-channel has a gate.

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,200
And this one's the drain.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,790
And this one's the source.

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,780
But it works differently.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:24,980
In the N-channel, a positive voltage
between the gate and the source will

25
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,420
turn the N-channel on.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,240
But now the current will go in this
direction, from drain to source.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,600
And what we're going to do
is to combine these two

28
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,580
transistors to make a gate.

29
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,604
And the first one we're going
to build is an NOT gate.

30
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:51,440
The NOT gate has an input, which can be
True or False, and an output, which

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,280
is the opposite.

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,280
So True goes to False, and
False goes to True.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,800
And the way we're going to build it is
we're going to tie the two gates

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,210
together here.

35
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,000
And that will be our input.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,920
And we're going to tie the
two drains together here.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,139
And that will be our output.

38
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,464
And then, we're going to tie this
source, here, to 3.3 volts.

39
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:18,300
And we're going to tie
this one to ground.

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,704
Now let's see how it works.

41
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:26,680
If the input were True, OK--
so if the input were True--

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,260
that means it is 3.3 volts.

43
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,550
And that will create--

44
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:38,330
across this transistor, you'll see
there's 3.3 volts in this direction.

45
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,850
And this transistor will
then become on.

46
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:48,780
But over here, we see we've got
3.3 volts to 3.3 volts.

47
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,510
And so there's no voltage across the
source gate of the P. And this one

48
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,430
will be off.

49
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,880
And if this transistor's off, and
that one's on, we can see--

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,040
there's 0 volts--

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,080
that becomes 0 volts.

52
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,400
The other case is also easy to see.

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,450
Now if the input were False, that
means there'd be 0 volts here.

54
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,960
And on the N-channel, we have 0 volts
to 0 volts, which is no drop.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,180
And so this one will go off.

56
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,490
But over here, we have 3.3
volts down to 0 volts.

57
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,980
And so we see a positive voltage
between the source

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,630
and gate of the P-channel.

59
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,490
And it will come on and conduct.

60
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,390
So if this transistor is on, and
conducts, this 3.3 volts shows up at

61
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,060
the output as 3.3 volts.

62
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,400
And there you have it.

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,160
True goes to False, and
False goes to True.

64
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,430
And this is just a glimpse
of how digital logic

65
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,750
works inside the computer.

66
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,029
