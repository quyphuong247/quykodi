00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,010
RAMESH YERRABALLI: So Jon, can
a student take our class

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,460
without a real board?

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,005
JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes, but we feel
strongly that the hands on learning

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:14,620
that results by doing the labs
on the physical hardware--

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,710
simulation is an important tool in
engineering design and so therefore,

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,990
everyone will design, develop, and debug
each lab in simulation, even if

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,480
you have a real board.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,900
RAMESH YERRABALLI: However, we
understand that some of you will not

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,900
be able to purchase a real kit.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,300
In this case, you'll be able to write
the software, design and test it in

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,950
simulation, as we will demonstrate
in module two.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,830
JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,970
Performing the labs in simulation will
develop some learning, but we have

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,490
decided that performing each lab on the
real board will be necessary to

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,770
get certification.

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,370
RAMESH YERRABALLI: So how
do you feel about people

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,870
working together in groups?

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,630
JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah, we strongly
encourage you to reach out to others

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,070
in your local area and take
the class together.

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,920
And possibly, in that way, you
could share a single kit.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,270
RAMESH YERRABALLI: So you'd say,
working in a small group is a

23
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,040
wonderful way to learn.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,240
An effective team size is anywhere
from two to three students.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,620
