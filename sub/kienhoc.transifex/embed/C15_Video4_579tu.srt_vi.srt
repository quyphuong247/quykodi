00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,708
PROFESSOR JONATHAN VALVANO: Next, let's
show you how to make your own images.

3
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:06,190
But this is an optional step
that you can do if you want.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,900
So this is the starter project.

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,480
And I'm going to look inside the files.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,090
And I'm going to edit one of
the Space Invader art files.

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,520
So I'll find an enemy and we'll edit it.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,010
So I'm going to open this enemy here.

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,470
And I'm going to open him in Paint,
your favorite drawing program.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,756
And any application that
can edit BMP files can work.

11
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,380
Now, as you can see, it's pretty small.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,685
So let's make him bigger.

13
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:38,300

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,300
So in this mode, we see
that a white is going

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,730
to show up as a pixel on the screen.

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,660
And a black will show up as a blank.

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,660
So I'm going to change this guy
to make him a very scary guy,

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,926
like moving his insides.

19
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:58,770

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:11,440
And then let's make him a little
more meaty here and have great big--

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,405
and have great big ears.

22
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:16,000
Because ears are scary.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,260
And we'll give him more
fluff around the outside.

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,930
Remember, I got to leave
two pixels all around.

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,633
So we'll make a really scary.

26
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:32,240

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,940
So now I have a new image
that I want to create.

28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,395
Let's Save As.

29
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:43,720
And this step is important for you to
make sure you save it as a 16-color

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,510
.BMP.

31
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:50,720
And so we're going to
call him small enemy new.

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,460

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,430
Give him whatever name you want.

34
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,546
All right, so I've just created
a BMP file, a new BMP file.

35
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:01,420
And so now what I'm
going to do is, I'm going

36
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,720
to convert that BMP
file into a-- I'm going

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,590
to convert that BMP file into text file.

38
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:23,480

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,850
So I'm going to use
this executable, which

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,820
will take a BMP file
and create a text file.

41
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,640
So I got to remember the name
of the file I just created,

42
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,720
which was small enemy new.

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,060
And into this window, I'm
going to write the name

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:48,540
of this file I just
created small enemy new.

45
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,340
Hit enter.

46
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,340
And this created a text file.

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,220
So I'll find where it
went, small enemy new text.

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,000
So I will open up the one I
just created in a text editor.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,680
You could see this is now C code.

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,440
I will copy it.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,850
Now I'm going to go
over to my application.

52
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,620
And I'm going to paste the
bad boy right in there.

53
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,400
And now I have a new
image that I can create.

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,260
That I can display.

55
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,140
So let's draw him on the screen,
show you what he looks like.

56
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:34,770
So right here, I'm going
to copy, paste, take

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,020
his name-- he's called small enemy new.

58
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,680
Where would you like to put him?

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,590
Let's put them in the middle.

60
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,880
Halfway across is 48.

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,610
Halfway down is 24.

62
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:57,530
Again, this will put him at the middle
at location x equals 48, y equals 24.

63
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:06,717
So we will build, download, debug.

64
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:11,100

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,670
So again on the screen we see
nothing, left over from last time.

66
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,279
And so we will step over,
step over, step over.

67
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,430
This will clear the RAM screen.

68
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,990
This will draw the new enemy.

69
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,330
And then when I hit
the display buffer, we

70
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,020
can see our new enemy
is drawn on the screen.

71
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,970
Very scary-looking fellow is he.

72
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,010

73
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,140
So that's a summary of how it is
you could create your own bump

74
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,663
images if you want to modify
the game to make it more fun.

75
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:45,163
