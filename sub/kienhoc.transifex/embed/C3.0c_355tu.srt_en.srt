00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:04,660
PROFESSOR: Let's tie all of these
together with something practical.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,600
All of you know what a battery is.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,750
A battery in your cell phone runs the
loads that your phone requires,

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,590
whether it is communication, the phone
activity, whatever it might be.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,580
So we can think of your phone or any
other system that has a battery as a--

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,850
this is my symbol for a battery.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,200
And let's say we have
a 9-volt battery.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,020
And we look at the battery as being
a chemical device with terminals.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,120
And we say there are positive
and negative terminals.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:56,436
And whatever your system is built off
can be abstracted as a load, we are

12
00:00:56,436 --> 00:01:03,510
representing the load as a resistance,
R. So when we subject our battery to

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,270
this load and we typically will have an
on/off switch or some kind, maybe.

14
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,960
And maybe I'll have an on/off
switch of some kind.

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,330
So when I turn this switch on--

16
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,609

17
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:29,480
OK, when the switch is closed, this will
cause a current to flow across

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,590
the load that will power the function
of your system, whether it's a cell

19
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,340
phone or any other device.

20
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:45,360
Now we have the equation that we saw
before, which is energy is equal to

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,540
power times time.

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:01,690
So I'm going to write that
as E equals P times time.

23
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:10,354
But we also know power, P, is given by
V times I. So I can write this as V

24
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:15,520
times I times time.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,700
So when we have a battery, the battery
has a fixed amount of energy.

26
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,995
So this is fixed.

27
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:25,690

28
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,800
And one of the properties of a battery
is it provides a constant voltage.

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,300
This is also fixed.

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:42,210
So this equation tells us is that, if I
want the battery to last for a long

31
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,550
amount of time, the only thing
I can control is the current.

32
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,940
This is the control.

33
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:57,490
So I have these two in my control, so I
can consume less current and make it

34
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,580
last longer.

35
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,290
Or I can consume more current
and have it last less time.

36
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,050
So this is a practical application
of something that we've

37
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,300
already looked at.

38
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,939
