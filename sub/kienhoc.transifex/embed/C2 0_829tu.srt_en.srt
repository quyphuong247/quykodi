00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,160
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Hi, this is the
module on fundamental concepts.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,800
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: In this module,
we will look at number systems,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,790
microcontroller design, and instruction
set architecture.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,945
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: OK.

6
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:18,330
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,990
So let's first ask ourselves, what is
an embedded system to you, Jon?

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,930
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: An embedded
system is the combination of

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,730
electrical, chemical, mechanical,
optical, computer, software all

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,140
combined for a dedicated purpose.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,640
And we're going to in this class
add one more requirement.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,400
And that is an embedded system
is going to have a

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,050
computer embedded inside.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,720
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,320
So it sounds like what you're
saying is everything in

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,170
engineering is a system.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,040
And so it's either a system or it's
an interface between systems.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,510
So embedded systems seem to
embody both these aspects.

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,990
They are systems and you
have interfaces that

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,040
interface these systems.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,110
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: That's correct.

22
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:11,550
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,130
So let's look at some sample
embedded systems.

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:16,940
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right.

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,630
Let's begin with my favorite.

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,520
Here are a couple of pacemakers.

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,360
Hopefully you don't have these.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,020
But this would be embedded inside the
body and it helps your heart beat at a

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,040
regular rate.

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,200
Inside here is a computer, software that
runs that computer, mechanical

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,890
catheters, chemical reactions between
the catheter and the body, a battery

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,170
with chemistry in it, all combined
for the dedicated purpose to

33
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,635
help us live longer.

34
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:48,090
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

35
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,410
So here is an embedded system that
is more familiar to some of you.

36
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:59,920
Its a computer inside, but the
identifying feature of this is that it

37
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,660
has switches.

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,200
All kinds of switches to
control the behavior.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,880
And you have an LCD display, which
is a black and white LCD display.

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,040
And it runs on batteries.

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,760
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: My rule about
finding an embedded system in your

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,470
life is to look for things
that run on electricity.

43
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,090
Take them apart, and then look
for the computer inside.

44
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,420
This, as you can see, is a hard drive.

45
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,510
And in here are mechanical
parts which rotate.

46
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,400
Electrical parts which
control the motor.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,284
And optical parts to read and write data
from the disk [Hard drives use

48
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:42,534
magnetic encoding, CD drives use
lasers to read/write data].

49
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:44,110

50
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,620
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Here is
another embedded system.

51
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:54,210
Now this is an embedded system which is
used primarily to use these probes

52
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:02,430
to detect voltages at different
inputs on your testing device.

53
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:09,260
And what it allows you to do is to
monitor the conditions of the

54
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,150
operation of any system
that you're testing.

55
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,910
Again, the characteristic is that it has
a rich interface, there is a lot

56
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,246
of probes that allows you
to track information.

57
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:23,876

58
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:26,300
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: I've
got another one.

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,590
Motors.

60
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:26,900
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Oh, nice.

61
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,820
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Oh, look at that.

62
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,220
Yeah.

63
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,070
If you ever want to control
stuff, you need motors.

64
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,520
So an embedded system, again,
has components.

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,050
So there's a component over here, a
component over there, and an interface

66
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,170
between the two which
allows it to run.

67
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,000
Again, this is a motor controller.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,900
And obviously this system would then
be placed in a bigger system.

69
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,750
A robot, an industrial robot.

70
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,660
And then this system would be then
placed in a larger system, like an

71
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,150
industrial robot.

72
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,930
And the idea is embedded systems
are built for doing things

73
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,346
that humans want done.

74
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:03,780
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK.

75
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,790
So let's look at a more
sophisticated system.

76
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,500
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right, wait
a minute Professor Yerraballi.

77
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,400
We're not having any fun here yet.

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,930
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK, let's
take something apart.

79
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,240
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yeah, come
on, let's take something apart.

80
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:26,380

81
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,270
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: This is
a popular embedded system.

82
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,450
What you see here is an iPod
that's been taken apart.

83
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,550
We took out the hard drive so that we
can look at the guts of this machine.

84
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,600
And what we see here is
a set of processors.

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,610
An embedded system may have multiple
processors that do various functions.

86
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,590
And it has, again, a display.

87
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,770
An interface, which is
a clicker interface.

88
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:03,600
And what you also see is an onboard
battery that allows such a system to

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,130
be operated for long periods
of time without being

90
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,380
hooked to a power source.

91
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:21,560

92
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,060
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: This
is a game controller.

93
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,570
Let's take it apart.

94
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,330
I removed the screws to
allow access inside.

95
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,010
We'll take off the front.

96
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,880
Parts go flying.

97
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,470
That's all right.

98
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,050
Don't need this.

99
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,840
What we're looking for is the
microcontroller inside this fun thing.

100
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,160
OK, we don't need that.

101
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,190
And on this side we see some switches.

102
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,150
And on this side the electronics.

103
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,560
And right there in this little
black dot under there is the

104
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,870
microcontroller.

105
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,860
And again, an embedded system combines
mechanical, electrical, power to

106
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,520
perform a duty that we all want.

107
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,040
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Light
sensors on this.

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,150
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yeah, sensors,
accelerometers, all sorts of fun

109
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,880
things for us to use.

110
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,684
