00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530

00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,456
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So let's look
at the UART as part of the launch pad.

3
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:09,590
The launch pad has eight UARTs.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:16,470
The first one we'll look at is UART0
, which is here on PA1 and PA0.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,940

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,540
PA1 is the transmitter as an output.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,150
PA0 is the receiver, which is an input.

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:38,050
This UART is hardwired into the
debugger chips on your launch pad,

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:50,100
goes across the USB cable to your
PC, and shows up as a COM port.

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,510
The second scenario,
what we will see is UART1

11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,200
could be connected to PC5 and PC4.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,970
This is the transmitter,
and in this case,

13
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,290
we could connect to a second launch pad.

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,080
And we'll tie PC5 to PC4, and
data will flow in this direction.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,850
And we'll tie PC5 back to PC4.

16
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,970
And over here, it's the receiver,
and over there it's the transmitter.

17
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,410
So the roles are reversed.

18
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,040
And in order to make this work,
as you know, we define voltage

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,440
as the potential difference
between two pins,

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,640
so whenever we use the
UART protocol, we're

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,730
going to have to tie
the grounds together.

22
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,360
We have one more possibility.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:55,960
If we used UART2 with PD7 and PD6, and
we wanted to connect to an external

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,720
device very far away, we could take the
transmitter and connect it to a driver

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,919
chip called a Maxim3232 .

26
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:18,310
And this would allow, again three
wires, transmit, receive, and ground.

27
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:25,357
But this driver chip would
allow us to go up to 50 feet.

28
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:27,440
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Using some sort of a cable?

29
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,960
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes, a cable to
an external device that's very far away.

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,100
And there's our receiver and
our ground is tied together.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,170
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So the DB9 connector,

32
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,250
which you are very familiar with
if you've used old machines,

33
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,230
is one such connector
that uses the serial port.

34
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,230
It has nine pins on it,
but only three of the pins

35
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,310
are essential, pin three, two,
and five, and those make up

36
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,950
the transmitter, receiver,
and common ground.
