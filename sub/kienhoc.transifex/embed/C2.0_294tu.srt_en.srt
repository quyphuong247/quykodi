00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,269

2
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,060
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So let's take a look

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,340
at how we can use a data
sheet to clarify information

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,402
on registers in our program.

5
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:09,735
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Because
sometimes we give you code

6
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:11,950
and you may not understand it.

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,580
So let's look up this register here.

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,069
So I copied this register.

9
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:20,110
Let's see if we can look
it up in the data sheet.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,430

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,847
So here's our data sheet for
the TM4C123 microcontroller.

12
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:31,680
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So let's try
to find what we are looking for.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,221
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right
so I'm going to do Control F,

14
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:38,170
and down here I'm going to type
in the register I'm looking for.

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,870
Unfortunately, the syntax is such
that we're not going to find that.

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,700
And that's because, in the data sheet,
it doesn't call it by the underlines.

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,900
It doesn't use the underlines.

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,800
So in order to look up
a register with find,

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,470
we're going to have to
talk data sheet language.

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,160
And that is the RCGC2 register
without the underlines.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,570
So we can search for it.

22
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,740
Now there's a lot of them.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,380
This found it in the table of contents.

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,440
So that's pretty good,
at the table of contents,

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,430
I'm just going to click right here.

26
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,970
And there we are.

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,300
This is the run mode clock
gating control register 2.

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,870
And if we scroll down we can see that
the particular pin that we were turning

29
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,420
on was bit 5 to turn
on Port F. So again,

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,930
if you're going to search the data sheet
make sure you don't use the underlines.

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,024
And so you can see that this register
is defined just with the letters

32
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:43,190
and not with the underlines.

33
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,226

34
00:01:46,226 --> 00:01:48,100
All right, don't be
afraid of the data sheet.

35
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,189
It has lots of information.

36
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:50,688
