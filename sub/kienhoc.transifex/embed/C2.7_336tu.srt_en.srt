00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,679

2
00:00:00,679 --> 00:00:02,470
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
In this short video,

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,870
we'd like to look up
the data sheet to learn

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,674
about the memory layout
on the microcontroller.

5
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:11,215
So let's go to the table of contents.

6
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:13,910

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,465
And we'll look up the overview of
the microcontroller, which is 1.2.

8
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:21,090
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Click right here.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,890
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Yeah.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,160
So we notice that these
have been checked.

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,240
What we looking for is how
much flash memory it has.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,700
And how much system RAM it has.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,430
The flash memory is where
our code is going to go.

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,380
So we know that we have a
capacity of 256 kilobytes.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,937
And our data is going to go in the
RAM, which is a limit of 32 kilobytes.

16
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:55,020
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right, so
the next question we might want to ask

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,730
is, where or what
addresses are our memory?

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,660
So we go back to the table of contents
and look for more things on memory.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,970
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So go to Section 2.4.

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,762
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Right there.

21
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:10,220
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: And that
tells you our memory model.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,710
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Here is our memory model.

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:20,230
We can see that we have 256 kilobytes
of ROM located at these addresses.

24
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,940
And we have 32 kilobytes of
RAM located at those addresses.

25
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,190
Also in this data sheet, it tells
us what we use the memory for.

26
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,320
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So this table, table 2.5,

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,590
tells us that we use the
memory region here for Code.

28
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,730
This region from 0x2000.0000
onwards is used for data.

29
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,350

30
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,820
And then we have our device
IO registers, which are here.

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,670
These are all our GPIO pins.

32
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,550
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: But Ramesh,
is that all the registers?

33
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,716
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
There's some extra registers.

34
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:03,990
These are our Private Peripheral Bus.

35
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,030
These are devices like
our NVIC and our SYSTICK.

36
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,617
These are right here.

37
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:11,950
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right.

38
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,680
So again, use the data
sheet to look things up.

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,600
Don't be afraid to search around.

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,670
There's a lot of information in there.
