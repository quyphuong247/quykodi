DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
In this video, we're

3
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,050
going to show you how to configure
the slide pot, the potentiometer,

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,560
to do this lab.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,060
Most of the potentiometers
have these extra tabs.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,590
Now, notice that there are
two types of pins on here.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,800
The pins labeled one, two, and
three, those are the important pins.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,210
Don't bend those.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,430
But these other big
fat tabs we don't need.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,520
So I'm going to bend
them out of the way.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,680
So I grab my suppliers, I hold on
tight, and I bend it out of the way.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,700
Now, notice I didn't bend
pin one, two, or three.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,610
I just bent one of these tabs.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,090
So I'm going to take all the
tabs that I don't need to

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,840
and I'm going to bend
them out of the way.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,330
And that was two.

17
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,840
Take this one, bend it out of the way.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,790
Take this one, bend it out the way.

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,290
OK.

20
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,400
So now I have left three pins.

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,590
Pin three is going to be
connected to plus 3.3.

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,560
Pin one will go to
ground, and pin two will

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,560
be connected to the
analog-to-digital input.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,510
And as we saw, we're going to use
PE2, which is analog channel one.

25
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,160
So now I can flip this over and
plug it into the protoboard.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,600
Notice that pin (three) is
going to be tied to 3.3,

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,500
and down here we have pin one going
to the ground-- that's this one--

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,280
and pin two is going to the
analog-to-digital input.

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,260
And so now we have our
slide pot here, which

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,370
can be used to create
our analog voltage.

31
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,900
One last important step is we're going
to convert this pot to a distance

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,690
measure by attaching a scale to it.

33
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,960
And so if I define the measurement
point as right here, that

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:51,570
is 0 millimeters, 5 millimeters,
10 millimeters-- you see,

35
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:59,820
my edge is right here at 10
millimeters-- 15, and lastly 20.

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,940
Now some pots have more
or less millimeters,

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,410
but they all go from
one side to the other.

38
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:11,730
And so now I've created the transducer,
which I can use to measure distance.

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,711
Have fun building it.

40
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:14,210
