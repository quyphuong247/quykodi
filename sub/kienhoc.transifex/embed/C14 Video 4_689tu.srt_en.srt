00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,262

2
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:02,470
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So
we looked at the two steps.

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:07,350
One is the initialization step,
which is what this routine is doing.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,380
The initialization ritual, which we
do one, which is a 13 step sequence.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,740
You can look at all the details here.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,970
We talked about it.

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:24,970
This part here is simply making the GPI
pin be an alternate pin and an input.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,660
So this is saying input.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,780
We did the clock.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,230
We did the alternate bit.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,930
And then we did select, and we
enabled (Disable digital) it.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:40,740
Now, the second part is we
turn on the clock for the ADC.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,600
We wait for a little bit too
for the clock to get going.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,990
We set the sampling rate.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,510
We set the priority of the sequencer.

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,310
We disable it and enable
it between these two steps.

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,310
And while we are configuring
it, the steps involved

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,425
are, what is the trigger we're using?

19
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:05,730
We're using software as a trigger.

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:12,700
We are saying, I'm using channel
PE2, which is analog in one(AIN1).

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,187
And we made sure that IE0 is set to one.

22
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:19,770
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: I have a
question, Professor Yerraballi.

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,090
Why did you disable the digital input?

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,240
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Oh, that is correct.

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,340
In fact, what we did for the
D-enable is we turned it off.

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,840
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yeah, but why?

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,350
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: That
is because it's not digital.

28
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,210
It's analog.

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,460
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah, yes.

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,356
You're right.

31
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:40,730
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: All right.

32
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:47,650
So let's take a look at our second
routine, which is our routine

33
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,530
where we're actually
going to be read the data.

34
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,220
So this is a data read routine.

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,210
This is when there is a sample,
and you're ready to read it.

36
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,490
And this routine has been called.

37
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,520
This routine's responsibility
is to tell the ADC module

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,234
that you are ready to read
it, which is our first step.

39
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:10,130
OK.

40
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,320
Let's take a look at the read routine.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,560
We've already seen it, so
I'm going to summarize it.

42
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,480
We start.

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,260

44
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,950
And once we get the
sampling going, we'll

45
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,260
keep checking to see if it is done.

46
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,680
So you're we're going
to check the status bit.

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,680
And if the status bit
says that it's Busy,

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,920
then we keep going back
and keep checking it.

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,990
And eventually, it's
going to say it's done.

50
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,745
And once it's done, we're
going to read the data.

51
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:57,320

52
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,420
And we're going to clear the bit.

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,220
So that's exactly what you see here.

54
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,900
This is a start.

55
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,990
We have a loop here, which
repeatedly checks the status.

56
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,200
Then we come out of this.

57
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,590
We read the data, which is
right here in the FIFO3.

58
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,330
And the last step is we cleared
the bit, which is right here.

59
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,630
And we return the results.

60
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,757
So we return.

61
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:30,667

62
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,000
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,030
Shall we see if it works?

64
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,990
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Let's do it.

65
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,323
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right.

66
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:40,190
So we have a analog signal
connected up to PE2.

67
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,010
So to test it, we ill
use this main program.

68
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,330
And we will ask the ADC
converter to capture the input

69
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,740
and store it into this variable.

70
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,240
All right.

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,050
Let's go.

72
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,230
Build.

73
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,830
Download.

74
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,330
Debug.

75
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,159

76
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,450
Let's look at the watch window.

77
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,840

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,310
And in this watch window,
we have the variable

79
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,200
that we're going to set
every time we sample.

80
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,880
So let's hit the Go button.

81
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,120
In this watch window, we can see
the results of the ADC converter.

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,600
That's a 12-bit number.

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,870
So Professor Yerraballi,
make it go smaller.

84
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,500
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So
I'm sliding the slide-pot.

85
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,520
And it's moving it to the right.

86
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,550
And I moved it as right as I can.

87
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,550
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Oh,
that's a small number.

88
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,490
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
And it's a small number.

89
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:33,845
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: OK.

90
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:36,930
The ADC converter goes from zero
to, what number does it go to?

91
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,968
Let's see.

92
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:39,502
Ooh, bigger.

93
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:40,752
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Bigger.

94
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:41,200
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Bigger.

95
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,250
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: I'm moving it.

96
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,060
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Come on, faster.

97
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,830
No, not so fast.

98
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,141
Slow it down.

99
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:46,640
There we go.

100
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,690
And the largest number is 4,095.

101
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,065
There we are, 12 bit converter.

102
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:54,340
Now, you try it.
