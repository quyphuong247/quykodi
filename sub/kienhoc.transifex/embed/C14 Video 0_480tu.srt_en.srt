00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,791
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Professor Yerraballi,

2
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:04,130
what are we going to learn today?

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,230
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Today we're going
to see how computers can take stimuli

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,920
from the external analog world and
store them digitally in the computer.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,440
So take an example.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,610
Here's an example of a volume knob
in a rotational form or as a slider.

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,280

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,030
What's essentially happening
here is that the position

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,540
is a variable resistance.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,160
So if we can convert this
variable resistance to say,

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,060
voltages between some
range, 0 to 3 volts, 3.3

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,100
volts, then we can take
that voltage and store it

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,400
inside a computer as 12-bit number
using an analog-to-digital converter.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,910
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
That means that any signal

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,215
that we can convert into
a voltage could then

16
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:58,000
be entered into the
computer with the A-to-D.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,520
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: That is correct.

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,790
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Let
me show you some examples.

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,910
The first is a strain gauge.

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,620
And it could be used to
measure force or pressure.

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,005
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Here's a thermostat

22
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:11,337
that can be used to measure temperature.

23
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,670
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Here's
another temperature sensor.

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,576
It's an integrated circuit.

25
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:19,523
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Here's a
microphone that measures sound.

26
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:21,910
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Here's a digital camera.

27
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,080
It looks at the image and creates
a two dimensional digital array

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,230
of what it sees.

29
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,840
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Here is a GPS that

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,587
senses the coordinates of where you
are, latitude and longitude (actually

31
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:35,670
the HMC6352 is a compass).

32
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,360
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Here's
the infrared distance sensor

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,910
we're going to put in our robot.

34
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,550
And it measures distance.

35
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,760
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Here's
another distance sensor.

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,860
This is an ultrasonic distance
sensor that gives you distance.

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,940
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Here is a
catheter that measures biopotentials.

38
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,950
This ring right here
is inside the heart.

39
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,974
And it allows the pacemaker to measure
the biopotentials in your heart.

40
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:06,200
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Yes, as a matter of fact,

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,714
the LaunchPad has internal
sensors which sense temperature.

42
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,543
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So
what are we going to build?

43
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:16,560
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: We're
going to build a robot.

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,210
And the robot car we're going to
build is will use infrared sensors.

45
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,400
This is different from
our bump sensors, which

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,100
sensed an obstacle by
actually colliding with it.

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,740
Now we can measure the
distance from the obstacle,

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,190
and then we're going to
take evasive action so

49
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,080
that we can avert bumping
against obstacles.

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,550
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So this
is a classic control system.

51
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,270
In other words, our
objective is to drive

52
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,500
straight down the middle of the road.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,760
And we're going to begin
by sensing where we are.

54
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,590
To tell where we are relative
to the middle of the road.

55
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,430
And then the software in
the computer will then

56
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,656
adjust the power to the two motors in
an attempt to drive fast and straight.

57
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:07,280
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: That is correct.

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,940
So let's build it.
