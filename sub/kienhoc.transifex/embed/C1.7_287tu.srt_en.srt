00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,419

2
00:00:00,419 --> 00:00:02,210
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Professor Yerraballi,

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,550
what are we going to
learn this time around?

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,466
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
This time around, we've

5
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:10,379
enhanced the class from the
last offering in spring 2014.

6
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:11,420
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: OK.

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,994
What's new?

8
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:15,660
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: We've added
a lot of additional material.

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,860
We found things that students were
having trouble with, like for example,

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,717
finite-state machines, and
we added material on that.

11
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:22,800
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,745
And let's add some material
on how to read a data sheet.

13
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:27,870
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Yes.

14
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,170
And also, since this class
is really a debugging class,

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,957
we've added a lot of lecture
material on debugging.

16
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:35,040
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,310
And the coolest thing we've
added this time around

18
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:44,030
is a chapter on wireless communication
and the internet of things.

19
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,000
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So we're going
to use a CC3100 BoosterPack, which

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,410
sits on the LaunchPad.

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,947
This will be our vehicle
to connect to the internet.

22
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:53,030
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

23
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,250
And you've heard of the
internet of things, haven't you?

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,050
These are the things.

25
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,475
Well, what about certification?

26
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:01,330
How is that different?

27
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,910
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So we
made certification easier.

28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,180
In the last offering, we required you
to do eight labs out of a possible 11,

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,830
and they were sequential.

30
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,180
This time around, we've made it easier.

31
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,310
So you can pick and choose
seven labs out of a possible 13

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,707
and earn your certification.

33
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:19,790
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yes.

34
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,610
And we learned that people took
this class for many reasons,

35
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,820
and they're all good.

36
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,370
So we encourage you to navigate
through our class in whatever manner

37
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,632
you feel best suits your needs.

38
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:33,840
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: This
is kind of like a buffet.

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,970
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yeah, let's go.
