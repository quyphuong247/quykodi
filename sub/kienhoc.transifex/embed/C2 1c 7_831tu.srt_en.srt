DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So now that we
understand numbers systems, one of the

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:13,850
questions that often comes is how
do computers represent numbers?

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,090
That is, do numbers have to always
be of a certain length?

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,720
And if they are of a certain length,
what do they represent?

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,820
The most common number we represent
on computers are integers.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:36,380
Integers are the most common numbers,
and integers, by definition, are on

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,660
the number line you have
positive integers.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:49,420
So some maximum positive integer, zero
to maximum, and some negative on the

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,600
negative number line.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,810
So we have numbers represented
on the number line.

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,280
So for the most part, we are happy to
represent numbers as being unsigned.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,930
And that's what we did in
the last description.

14
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,110
When we say a number this unsigned we
primarily focusing on numbers that

15
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,400
range from zero to some
positive maximum.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,720
So unsigned numbers don't have
a positive or negative sign.

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,900
So unsigned numbers.

18
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,380
So let's take an example
of an unsigned number.

19
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,540
Here is an unsigned number, 10001101.

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,630
And if I told you that this is an
unsigned number which is in binary, we

21
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,870
know what it represents.

22
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:45,320
We know that it represents, again just
to make the point I say that this as a

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:52,560
position of 0, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,190
And so one of the convenient things to
do is to look at the numbers and just

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,030
identify the coefficients
that are non-zero.

26
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,100
In this case, the one coefficients.

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:15,820
So the coefficients occur in positions
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

28
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:25,450
And the place values, accordingly, are
1, that's 2, this is 4, because that's

29
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:36,490
2 to the 2, this is 8, and this
is 16, 32, 64, and 128.

30
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:49,220
So I'm going to write this number as 1
plus 4 plus 8 plus 128, which is the

31
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,940
number 141 in base 10.

32
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,350
So what if we want to represent
numbers that can have a sign?

33
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,870
That can be a positive number
or a negative number?

34
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,840
So let's take a look at what such a
representation would look like.

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:16,600
So the number, 01000110, let's say this
were a signed number in base 2.

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,470
What we do when we're representing
signed numbers is we assign a special

37
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:31,320
meaning to the most significant
bit we call this the sign bit.

38
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,710
And the significance is that a sign
bit is either a zero or a one to

39
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:46,325
represent positive numbers
or negative numbers.

40
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:51,030

41
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,000
So here's a number because it
has a zero here it has to

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,390
be a positive number.

43
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,780
So let's understand what
this number represents.

44
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,400
So this number then, has the bit.

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,430
This bit represents a
place value of 2.

46
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,120
This represents a place value of 4.

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,089
And then we have 6, 8, 16, 32, and 64.

48
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:24,690
So this number then, represents
64 plus 4 plus 2.

49
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,040

50
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,980
Which is 70 in base 10.

51
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,340
Now, this is a number that
is a positive number.

52
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,670
So what if we have a signed number
that is a negative number?

53
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,210
A signed number that is negative,
let's take a simple

54
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,660
example of such a number.

55
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,020

56
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,640
Here is a signed number
that is negative.

57
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:56,410
So 10001101.

58
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:03,050
And again, we notice that because this
bit is a 1, this tells us that this

59
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,680
number has to be a negative number.

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,340
So what does it represent?

61
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:17,270
Well, our place values are 1, that's a
2, that's 4, that's an 8, and this

62
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,330
still has a place value which is 128,
but now we notice that this number

63
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:36,410
will actually represent 1 plus
4 plus 8 plus a -128.

64
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,800
Because that's a negative number.

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,265
So this number represents
a -115 in base ten.

66
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:48,060

67
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,840
So in summary then, let's see if we
can understand something about the

68
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,550
ranges that these two number
representations can capture.

69
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:08,460
So let's look at how signed and unsigned
numbers go from, for example,

70
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:14,820
if I have eight bits that I have eight
bits to represent, then I can go from

71
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:25,290
zero, so from here, all
the way up to 255.

72
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:31,090
Now if I have a signed numbers, again
in eight bits, because I have to

73
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,380
represent both positive and negative
numbers, I will only be able to

74
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:47,460
represent 127 on the positive side,
and I will represent -128 on the

75
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,240
negative side.

76
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,490
So the range is from -128 to +127.

77
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,040
Here is a neat little trick that we
use sometimes when we want to show

78
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,740
numbers and show them in, not in their
full glory in binary, but to

79
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,560
show them as in hex.

80
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:19,440
So we could write this number again as
a 8 followed by a D, because that's a

81
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:27,710
1101, which is 12 plus 1, which is 13,
13 stands for D. So I could represent

82
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,270
this number as 0x8D.

83
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,430
And that's simply a convenient way so
that when we look at numbers, it's

84
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,460
sometimes simpler to represent
them as binary.

85
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,020
Represent them as hex, or represent
them as decimal.

86
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:50,820

87
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,070
OK.

88
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,501
