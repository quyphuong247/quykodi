00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,876
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Hey, Ramesh.

3
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:03,360
Let's build something.

4
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,550
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
OK, so let's build a DAC.

5
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,390
Remember what a DAC does.

6
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,440
A DAC is a digital to
analog converter, which

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,010
means when I have my microcontroller
produce a digital value,

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,090
we write to the DAC and the
DAC produces an analog value.

9
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:29,580
So maybe it produces one
particular value on a signal.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,960
Some signal.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,510
So, we want to see how to do this.

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,390
And we will do this by
using this circuit for it.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,180
There are two designs that we
can do for the analog circuit.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:52,960
One is a binary-weighted circuit.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:03,800
The other, which is more popular in
systems, is an R-2R ladder circuit.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,010
The binary weighted design is
intuitive, so we will do this first.

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,810

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:23,690
So our goal is to produce
a signal, so we've said.

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,090
Let's say we're working
with a three bit DAC, which

20
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,890
means that I have eight levels.

21
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,310
So our precision-- so
we have a three bit DAC.

22
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:49,200
We have eight levels, and the eight
levels are from zero to the seven.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:59,180
And we are going to write that down
here- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

24
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,290
And we want to produce a voltage.

25
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:11,190
And let's assume our voltages
are between 0 and 3.3 volts.

26
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,540
So we want to use an analog
value-- this is our digital--

27
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,330
and we want to produce
an analog value, Vout,

28
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,690
which ranges between 0 and 3.3 volts.

29
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,240
Well, each of these then
will be a fraction of that.

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:43,590
So this will have a value
of the 3.3 times 1 over 7.

31
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:50,220
This will be 3.3 times
2 over 7, and so on.

32
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,760
So when we get here, it'll
be 3.3 times 7 over 7.

33
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,840
That will be my voltage.

34
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,092
So that's my behavior
that I want to get.

35
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:00,550
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So what's
the resolution of this DAC?

36
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,980
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So, as we see
the smallest change we can capture

37
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,590
is a difference between consecutive
values, which in our case

38
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,720
is 3.3 divided by 7.

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:18,030
So our resolution delta
is 3.3 divided by 7.

40
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,710
And our precision, again, is eight.

41
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,120
So that's the design we're looking for.

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,820
So let's design this.

43
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,996
So again, here is our
schematic, microcontroller.

44
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:32,870

45
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,030
And we're going to use
three bits for now.

46
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,850
It doesn't matter.

47
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,170
I'm going to call them bit
two, bit one, bit zero.

48
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:48,340
So this is our bit two,
bit one, and bit zero.

49
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,380
So, we're going to use
the three bits, and we're

50
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:57,050
going to produce our output,
which is going to be our Vout.

51
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:05,170
And the way we're going to do that
is we're going to connect resistors.

52
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,910
And we make an observation that
each of these bits-- this bit

53
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,160
has a position of one, this
bit has a position of two,

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,750
and this bit has a place
significance, or place value of four.

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,000
So when we choose our
resistors, we will choose them

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,520
in that ratio, which
is 4 is to 2 is to 1.

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:38,480
So we will use the-- bit two will
have 11 K, we'll have 22 K here,

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,240
and this will be a 44 K

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,150
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So which one
is twice as much as the other one?

60
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,550
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So bit zero is-- remember

61
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,580
that bit zero has a place value of one.

62
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,040
So the resistance, that is, whatever
signal comes out of here for a one

63
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,610
has half the significance as bit one.

64
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,720
So in order to do that, we
subject it to a higher resistance.

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,420
And so the lower the significance,
the higher the resistance.

66
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,700
So bit two has the highest significance,
so it has the least resistance, which

67
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:24,090
is 11 K. And notice the ratio
between these three is 11 is to 22

68
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:31,390
is to 44, which is 1 is to 2 is to
4, which is exactly what we want.

69
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,720
So let's analyze this circuit
to see how it behaves.

70
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,660
So let's take our table again.

71
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,645
This is our N. This is the bit values.

72
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:48,510
And I'm going to represent
them by Q2, Q1, and Q0,

73
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,000
which is basically what I see here.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,660
Q2, Q1, and Q0.

75
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:08,070
So, if I have zero, this is a
0, 0, 0, and this is my Vout.

76
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:15,610
Now if I have an N value of
one, then what I have is 0,

77
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,400
0, 1, which makes this
a 0, this a 0, and this

78
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,610
is a 3.3 volts-- I'm going to
make because I have a one here.

79
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:31,230
And similarly, I have a
two, which is a 0, 1, 0,

80
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:43,060
so that's 3.3, and 0, and three
which is 0, 3.3, and 3.3, and so on.

81
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,740
And I'm just going to write one more.

82
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,860
Four, which is 3.3, 0, and 0.

83
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,810
And so on, all the way up to
seven, which is all three bits

84
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,730
are on- 3.3, 3.3, and 3.3.

85
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,080
So we'll calculate how our Vout is.

86
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,660
So first, I'm going to do an
analysis for one of these.

87
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,130
So let's do an analysis of our four.

88
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,430

89
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:25,580
So the circuit for this situation is
we have a 3.3 here, a 0 here, and a 0

90
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,370
here, which gives us a
equivalent circuit-- I'm

91
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:35,730
going to draw the equivalent circuit
here, which is our 11K with a 3.3.

92
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:42,650
And we have these two,
which are in parallel,

93
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,580
and they connect to our zero volts.

94
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,440
And we want to find out what Vout is.

95
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,830
And Vout is with respect to zero,
so we want to find out this voltage.

96
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:01,040
So if I were to convert this--
and remember these are 22 K,

97
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,940
and this is a 44 K. So if
I were to convert this,

98
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:16,880
the equivalent circuit looks like
this, where I have 22 times 44.

99
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,410
Remember these are in
parallel by 22 plus 44, which

100
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:29,870
gives me a value of 44 by three kilohms.

101
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,700
OK, so I have 44 by 3
here, and I have 11 K

102
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,945
they are in series, and what
I have is a voltage divider.

103
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:42,620

104
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:49,630
So I know that Vout is going
to be given by a value, which

105
00:08:49,630 --> 00:09:00,970
is 44 by 3 divided by 11 plus 44
by 3 times 3.3, which comes out

106
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,060
to be 4 over 7 times 3.3.

107
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:13,600
So that's my 4 over 7 times 3.3.

108
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,240
Now it's a good idea to do one where--
there are two of them that have a one.

109
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:31,550
So let's take this example of three,
which says now my equivalent circuit is

110
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:41,400
going to be one where I have a 0
here, a 3.3 here, and a 3.3 here.

111
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,710
So now I have this
circuit, which is my 0.

112
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,300

113
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,496
And I'm going to draw it
this way-- let me clear it.

114
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:58,770

115
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:10,090
So the equivalent circuit is this,
where I have my two resistances, which

116
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:19,220
are 22 K and the 44 K, which
are in parallel with 11 K.

117
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,100
And 11 K is at 0 volts.

118
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,480
One end of it is at 0 volts,
and this is my 3.3 volts,

119
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,010
and I want to find out
what the voltage here

120
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,050
is, which is my Vout,
which, by the way, is

121
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,070
the voltage across the resistance, 11 K.

122
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,150
So, again, my circuit is similar
because we already calculated it.

123
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:50,690
So this is a 44 by 3, this is
11 K, and this is my V out,

124
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,250
and that's 3.3 and 0 volts.

125
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,810
And so it's a voltage divided.

126
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:05,920
But now my Vout is given
by 11 divided by 11 plus 44

127
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:18,350
by 3 times 3.3, which gives me a
3 over 7 times 3.3 volts, which

128
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:24,350
is 3 over 7 times 3.3 volts.

129
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,950
So similarly, we can fill
in the rest of my analysis.

130
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:39,220
So this is a three bit DAC
using a weighted design.

131
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,380
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So Professor
Yerraballi, what will they do in lab?

132
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,800
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So in the lab,
you will take this idea of the design

133
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,590
and extend it to four bits, which means
that you will add an extra bit, which

134
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:56,990
is B3, and you will make
a four bit DAC, which

135
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,270
will be much better,
because it'll be better

136
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,510
at more levels, more
precision, more resolution.

137
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,720
Therefore, when we
hook it up to a sound,

138
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,580
you can produce really
high quality sound.

139
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,602
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Ah, sweet.

140
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:11,102
