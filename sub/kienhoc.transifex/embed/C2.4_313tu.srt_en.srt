00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,065

2
00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:01,940
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Throughout this course,

3
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,480
we will present to you a series of short
videos on how to read the data sheet.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,010
Because this class deals with input
and output, in this first video,

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,715
we'll show you how to look up IO pins.

6
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:21,190

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,770
One of the convenient ways
to search the data sheet

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,640
is to use the table of contents.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,500
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So
let's go to Chapter 10, which

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,211
has information about the
general purpose IO pins.

11
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,960
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: All right,
so I'm going to click right here.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,887
And now we're in Chapter 10.

13
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:42,220
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So
what we find here in this page

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:49,520
is the description of the fact that they
are 43 GPIO pins on our microcontroller

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,250
and they're called ports.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,454
And there's port A, B, C, D, E, and F.

17
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:59,870
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So one
of the questions we might ask

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,320
is, what's a pin?

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,380
So we go back to the table of contents
and look for information on pins.

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,160
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: And
we'll find it in Chapter 22.

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,950
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
There it is, Chapter 22.

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,200
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: It
should have the pin diagram.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,949
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
So we click on that.

24
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:24,290
All right, so here in Chapter
22, we see the pin diagram.

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,150
And here's a picture
of our microcontroller.

26
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,120
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: And so
we can identify the pins here.

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,610
And in one of our first
labs, we have these pins,

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,800
PF 1, 2, and 3 are going to be outputs.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,255
And PF 0 and PF 4 are
going to be inputs.

30
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:46,380
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So
the answer to the question

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,520
is, a pin is an actual signal connected
to the microcontroller with which we

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,557
are going to do our input and output.

33
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:57,140
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: And this
is the actual, physical layout

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,980
at the chip level.

35
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,530
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yup.
