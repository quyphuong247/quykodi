00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,322

2
00:00:00,322 --> 00:00:03,030
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Today, we're
going to demonstrate aliasing,

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,800
which is what happens if we
violate the Nyquist theorem.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,900
I've invited our videographer,
Justin, to participate

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,405
in this next demonstration.

6
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:17,990
Hey Justin, does your video camera
capture data in digital form?

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,130
JUSTIN: Yes, it does.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,630
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Oooh, so
it must have a sampling rate.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,330
So, do you know what
that sampling rate is?

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,877
JUSTIN: 24 frames per second.

11
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:27,710
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Oooh, so I wonder what

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,920
happens if I rotate the motor
at 12 rotations per second.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,730
I wonder what would happen?

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,970
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Oh, I guess it
has to violate the Nyquist theorem,

15
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,850
so we should see the aliasing effect.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,300
JUSTIN: Stop talking, let's see it.

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,930
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So
we're now at 1.3 volts,

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,600
and we're spinning at that rate.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,650
So I'm going to increase the
voltage so it should spin faster.

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,160

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,750
And it slowly spins
up faster and faster.

22
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,340

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,590
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: OK, ramping up.

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:13,690
Ramping up to two frames per
second, so two rotations per second.

25
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,610
Three-- And steady at three.

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,610
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: So, we're still
under the 12 rotations per second,

27
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,570
so you should still see the blue dot.

28
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,395
So let's go faster and see what happens.

29
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:30,960

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,380
Increasing voltage from
two to three volts.

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,650
So it should be speeding even faster.

32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:45,630

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,030
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: So
we're at six and rising.

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:58,859

35
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:00,650
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Let's go even faster.

36
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:06,007

37
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:07,100
At four volts.

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,710

39
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,890
We cranked up the voltage so
the motor will spin very fast.

40
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,840
As it spins faster and
faster, watch the white spokes

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,013
as they appear to first spin
clockwise and then counterclockwise.

42
00:02:24,013 --> 00:03:02,110

43
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,810
Next we cut the power and the
motor will start slowing down.

44
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,560
As it spins slower and
slower again, the spokes

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,585
will appear to spin clockwise
and then counter clockwise.

46
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:26,440

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,650
What we have witnessed is aliasing.

48
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,030
Aliasing occurs when the
input signal oscillates

49
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,750
at a rate greater than or equal
to one half the sampling rate.

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,000
In this case, the camera
samples at 24 frames per second.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,370
So any image moving at a rate
greater than 12 times per second

52
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,610
will get all messed up.

53
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,230
Aliasing causes the apparent
rotations per second

54
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,220
to be different than the
actual rotations per second.

55
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,141
