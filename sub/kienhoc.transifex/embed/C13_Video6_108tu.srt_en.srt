DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Hi, in this demo we

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,250
will show you two aspects
of generating sound.

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,690
The first is amplitude.

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,880
The amplitude of the
sound will be a function

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,190
of the electrical power
applied to the speaker.

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,800
We can see in this demo that we're
generating about 6 volts at 1 amp.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,130
6 volts times 1 amp is 6 watts.

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,540
So the amplitude of the
sound is going to be 6 watts.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,190
The second aspect of the sound
is the frequency or pitch.

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,610
We've slowed it way down so
you can see the cone move.

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,960
The frequency at which
it oscillates will

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,260
determine the frequency of the sound.

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:37,940
