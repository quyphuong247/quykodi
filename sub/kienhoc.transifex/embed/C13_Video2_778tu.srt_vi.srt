DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Let's
look at the Nyquist Theorem.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:11,020
The Nyquist Theorem says that if a
signal is oscillating at frequency F,

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,470
in order to capture
it faithfully, we must

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,510
sample at a frequency
that is strictly larger

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,380
than two times F. The essence
of the Nyquist Theorem

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:34,185
is that if a signal is oscillating we
must sample faster than it oscillates.

8
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:38,370

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,520
The mathematical proof
for the Nyquist Theorem

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,590
is beyond the scope of this class.

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,590
But let me show you an example
that illustrates the concept.

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,200
We have a circular
running track, and we have

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,560
a person who is running
around the track.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:05,390
And our job is to count the number
of times they go around the track.

15
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,970
Let's say the fastest one could run
is around the track in one minute.

16
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,570
So every 60 seconds, a fast
person could get around the track.

17
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,230
I'm a lazy person, and I
want to know, how often do I

18
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,190
have to look at my runner in order
to tell how many times they've

19
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,540
gone around?

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,910
So for instance, if
the runner is running

21
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:34,250
at a rate of one lap per one
minute, and I look every 15 seconds,

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,400
I will see them here.

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,750
I will see them over here.

24
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,990
I will see them over here.

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,320
And I will see them over here.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,890
And I can count because I've
seen them before the finish line,

27
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,410
and I've seen them
after the finish line.

28
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,300
And so I can count that I've seen it.

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:04,220
However, if I count every two minutes,
then I'm going to see them here.

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,470
They're going to go
around the track twice,

31
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,467
and I'm going to see them again there.

32
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:12,550
And they're going to go around the
track, and I'm going to see them there.

33
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,050
And so I will be unable to count
how many times they've gone.

34
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,310
There's something
special about 30 seconds.

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,990
If I count slower than every
30 seconds, I will see them.

36
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,300
So in other words, if I were to
count at 40 seconds or 45 seconds,

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:40,432
I could potentially only
seen them once per lap.

38
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:43,700
And if I only see them
once per lap, I can't

39
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,420
tell whether they've going around
once or they've not gone around at all

40
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,130
and not moving.

41
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:57,170
And so it turns out that this magic
number, in order to solve my problem,

42
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,720
is, in order to tell how many
times they've gone around the loop,

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,030
I have to look at least every 30
seconds, which is my Nyquist Theorem.

44
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,190
The oscillation of my runner has
a frequency of one lap per minute.

45
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,440

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:27,210
And I need to look at least twice
per minute in order to tell.

47
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,160

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,540
Here's another example
of the Nyquist Theorem.

49
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,350
We're stuck back on the island,
and we want to get to the mainland.

50
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,550

51
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,260
But this time there's a boat.

52
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,430
And luckily for us, this
boat takes a periodic trip

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,780
between the island, the
mainland, and back to the island.

54
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,220
It takes about 12 hours
for the boat to go

55
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,630
one trip, island to
mainland and back again.

56
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,820

57
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,209
And while it's at the island,
it'll sit on the dock.

58
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,860
And luckily for us, it'll
sit at the dock for 12 hours.

59
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:30,120
So if we look at the signal,
is the boat at the dock?

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,640
We will see that it oscillates.

61
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,870
The boat is at the dock for 12 hours.

62
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,560
And the boat is not at the
dock for about 12 hours.

63
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,420
At the dock, not at the dock,
at the dock, not at the dock.

64
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,310
This is a periodic wave.

65
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,170
And we see that the
signal oscillates at once

66
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,270
per day, which means, according
to the Nyquist Theorem,

67
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,240
we must sample it at twice per day.

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,820
For example, if I go down
to the dock every 11 hours,

69
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,480
I'm guaranteed to see the boat.

70
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,510
There's no time that the boat
could come, stay at the dock

71
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,410
and leave that I wouldn't notice it.

72
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,950
So regardless of when I start looking,
I will get onto the next boat.

73
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:34,980
On the other hand, if I sample
the signal every 13 hours,

74
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:42,060
I am slower than the twice
per day, and it's possible--

75
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,230
In this case here, we see that
the boat came to the dock right

76
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,380
after I looked at it and left
right before I looked at it again.

77
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,580
And so we see there's something
magical about this 12 hours.

78
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,790
And looking at the
boat every 12 hours is

79
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,320
equivalent to looking
at it twice per day.

80
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,620
And so we see that if we sample
faster than twice the frequency,

81
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,680
we will capture everything we
need to know about that signal.

82
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,911
And that's the Nyquist Theorem.

83
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:20,411
