DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:
Let's build an R-2R ladder.

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,050
This DAC can be built with a pile
of resistors of the same value.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,960
Each of the legs along
the bottom is 22k.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,610
Each 11k arm across the
top can be made by placing

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,150
two 22k resistors in parallel.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,980
Next we connect the headphone
jack, and lastly, we

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,620
attach it to the micro controller.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,460
Remember to connect up the ground.
