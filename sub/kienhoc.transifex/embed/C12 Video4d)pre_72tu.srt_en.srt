DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Let's
build the robot circuit.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,530
Here are male-male pins so we
can later attach the LaunchPad.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,920
Next, we'll build a
regulator with a 7805.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,170
Which will convert 8 volts from the
battery to 5 volts for the LaunchPad.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,890
We'll use this connector
here to attach the motors.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,200
We'll build two motor driver
circuits with TIP120s.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,240
Now, we'll connect the
motors to the connector.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,800
And lastly, we'll attach the LaunchPad.
