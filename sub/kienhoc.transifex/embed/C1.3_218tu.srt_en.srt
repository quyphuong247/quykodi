RAMESH YERRABALLI: Hi.

3
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,530
This is an introductory class modeled
around EE319K, which we teach to

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,440
freshmen in electrical engineering
and biomedical

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,800
engineering here at UT Austin.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,440
JONATHAN VALVANO: There are two
prerequisites for this class.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,590
The first is computer programming.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,240
We assume you have some knowledge
of computer programming.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,970
The software you write in this class
will be quite simple, so we'll be just

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,720
fine if this is your second class
involving programming.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,090
If you've never programmed before, it'll
be challenging to learn both

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,910
programming and embedded systems
in this one class.

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,360
RAMESH YERRABALLI: The second
prerequisite is electronics at the

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,380
level of high school physics.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,280
We expect some prior experience with
concepts such as voltage, current, and

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,340
resistance.

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,270
You should know Ohm's Law.

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,740
If you're missing this prerequisite,
you can get some help from a fellow

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,850
classmate or use an online resource.

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,690
JONATHAN VALVANO: We have designed
this course with three types of

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,320
students in mind, a high school or
college student considering a career

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,250
in engineering, a tech geek, like us,
who enjoys dabbling with gadgets, and

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,520
the professional engineer expanding
their skills to

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,610
include embedded systems.

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,310
RAMESH YERRABALLI: Whatever your reasons
for joining us, we're glad

26
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,110
you're here, and hope you have as much
fun with this class as we had building

27
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,360
it for you.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,260
