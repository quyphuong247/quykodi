00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499

2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:06,400
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: This is the
robot car with two DC motors--

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,360
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
Operated by these two switches.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,157
The switch-- one will reduce the speed,
the other will increase the speed.

5
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:14,740
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Let's go faster.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,602

7
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:18,560
Here we go.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,000
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI:
So this is a high duty

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,900
cycle, which you already know about.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,209
And we'll see whether the car--

11
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:28,500
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Let's go.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,010
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: --moves fast.

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,860
So here's the car moving really fast.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,830
Good catch.

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,332
Let's see what's the maximum
speed we can operate it at.

16
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,790
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Yeah, faster!

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:53,550

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,130
Do it again.

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,430

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,305
Come on, let's go!

21
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:03,700
[LAUGHTER]

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,610

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,180
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: And you
could operate it at a low speed.

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,634
This is a 10% duty cycle.

25
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,410
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: Car won't move.

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,034
DR. RAMESH YERRABALLI: Not enough umph.

27
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:23,920

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,400
This is a joyride.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,400
DR. JONATHAN VALVANO: I think it needs
sensors to tell where it's going.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,250
Don't you?
