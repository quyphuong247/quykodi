DR. JONATHAN VALVANO:

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is a stepper motor.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When I push this button it rotates clockwise.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
When I push the middle  button it rotates counterclockwise.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And when I push the third button,
it steps one direction clockwise.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And if I push both buttons,
it oscillates back and forth.
