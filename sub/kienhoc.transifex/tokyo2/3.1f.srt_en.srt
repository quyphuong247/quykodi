00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:11,480
In 1886 Shoyo Tsubouchi wrote his novel titled The Portraits of Contemporary

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:18,390
Students that became one of the first best seller in Meiji period.

3
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:28,420
In this novel, he described Tokyo as a city of students and rickshaw men.

4
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:38,300
Rickshaw man was the symbol of lower class people.

5
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:45,550
And on the other hand, students were the other major element

6
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,540
or people in the city, according to his description.

7
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,030
So actually, students-- especially university students--

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:06,550
were most important new phenomena in Tokyo in Meiji era.

9
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,910
Shoyo Tsubouchi described in his novel about student's life

10
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,490
and leisure in Tokyo in many ways.

11
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:26,240
Actually, those students lived in very concentrated area.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,110
I already explained the concentration of university in Jimbocho area.

13
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,640
University of Tokyo moved from Jimbocho area to Hongo campus.

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,410
So Hongo and Ochanomizu and Jimbocho was of the major districts

15
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,170
of these students.

16
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,990
But Mita and Waseda were also important districts for students

17
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:01,380
because in Mita, Keio University was located in this district.

18
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,990
And in Waseda, of course Waseda University

19
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,430
was established in that district.

20
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,810
So Mita, Waseda, and Hongo and Ochanomizu and the Jimbocho area

21
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,040
became the major student area in that days.

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:25,680
And in this area, there were many students' houses and other kind

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,520
of restaurants and bookshop where students were gathered or concentrated.

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,110
So these kinds of the students' culture was

25
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:44,110
one of the most prominent phenomena in Tokyo until prewar period.

26
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,860


27
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:55,200
But after the war, the students' culture had gradually changed.

28
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,290
But still, until the early 1950s, this kind

29
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,620
of the tradition, the relationship between the university

30
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,940
and the students' houses and the district culture of students

31
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,770
still remained.

32
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,990
In the next film, that was produced in 1953,

33
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:23,960
show a kind of the continuity of students' culture in Tokyo.

34
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,170
In some of the district, some of the culture of the student life and leisure

35
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:35,790
and the relationship with university still remained, even after the war.

36
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,590
So please see the students' culture in this film.

37
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,430


38
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:50,265
[MUSIC PLAYING]

39
00:03:50,265 --> 00:05:24,530


40
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,810
In the previous module, I already discussed

41
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,920
about the plan for reconstruction in postwar era.

42
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,910
In that plan, some of the university towns or university district

43
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:45,030
tried to make new university culture or new university cultural zone

44
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,130
around the university.

45
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,420
The University of Tokyo or Waseda University and Keio University

46
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:58,030
tried to challenge to that kind of the new urban redevelopment project

47
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,370
after the war.

48
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:07,970
In case of Hongo and Ueno and Koishikawa district, as I already explained,

49
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,170
the president Shigeru Nambara and Kenzo Tange

50
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,140
and some of the professors in University of Tokyo

51
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:25,690
tried to change this area toward something similar to Oxford.

52
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:34,570
Shigeru Nambara explained, they want to make the Oxford district or Oxford-like

53
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,200
area in Tokyo.

54
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,470
So they tried to combine the Hongo campus

55
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:46,000
and Ueno Park and also Koishikawa areas together.

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,420
And in this larger district, they tried to realize that university area

57
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,264
or university town like Oxford.

58
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:06,800
From contemporary perspective, their dream is or might be impossible

59
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,850
and it is not easy to imagine what they tried

60
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,740
to realize in this downtown area in Tokyo.

61
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,480


62
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,080
But the important thing we need remind or remember

63
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:32,990
is in the early 1950s or late 1940s, the students' culture in this university

64
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:40,980
area still continued from prewar period to postwar period.

65
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,080
The number of students was quite limited.

66
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,770
So cultural tendency was basically same from prewar and postwar era.

67
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,520
But after the late 1940s, the number of the university students

68
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,250
increased very rapidly.

69
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,740
And this increasement of the university students

70
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,180
changed the university culture drastically.

71
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,220
You can see in this graph how rapid the number of the university students

72
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:25,940
increased after the late 1940s until the early 1940s or middle 1940s.

73
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:32,200
The number of university students or university students

74
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,110
themselves are basically not so huge.

75
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:43,830
But their existence was very prominent in Tokyo.

76
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,720
But after that, the number of those students

77
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,480
itself increased more and more.

78
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,970
So this kind of expansion of the number of the students

79
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:08,400
changed the college or university students in Tokyo qualitatively.

80
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,340
This graph also shows the number of the university students in Tokyo.

81
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,890
So we can understand the rapid increase of university students after the war.

82
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,510


83
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,730
This is a graph that compare that increasement

84
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,340
of the number of the university students and growth of national income.

85
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:42,940
So from this graph, we can understand that increase of university students

86
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:49,990
occurred even before the national income increased in 1960s.

87
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:56,060
So in the 1950s, the number of university students already increased.

88
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:03,600
Also, many of the houses or people were still very poor.

89
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:12,080
In Tokyo, many of the poor university students expanded in many areas.

90
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,330
In the next unit, we are going to see what happened in the university

91
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,830
students after the 1960s in Tokyo.
