1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,900
Chicago School of Urban Sociology is still important

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,990
because they insist on the importance of the population

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,560
concentration in the cities.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,730
Although they are very much criticized by sociologists after the 1940s

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:25,570
because their theory is not so strong, and the people, or academics,

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,160
criticized that, the relationship between the population concentration

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,950
and cultural pattern cannot be directly related with each other

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,260
because there's many different elements, including economy, and politics,

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,880
and capitalism.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,640
And many other structural reasons need to be included to think about,

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,230
or to understand, the new formation or the culture in the city.

12
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:59,670
But, again, I also want to emphasize the population concentration has

13
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:07,170
some meaning to understand the cultural pattern or practices in city.

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:15,450
After the 1940s, the success of the urban sociology of the Chicago school

15
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,350
went two different directions.

16
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:28,295
One is a very dense and intense ethnography on an urban community.

17
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:30,840


18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,410
Some of the urban sociologists, especially ethnographers,

19
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,510
focused on a small community in the cities,

20
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,710
especially communities of the minorities.

21
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,950
For example, one of the very representative masterpieces

22
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,700
of this ethnography on small community was written by William White.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,780
And the book was titled Street Corner Society.

24
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,230
And in this book, White focused on a young group

25
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,240
who lived in little Italian communities.

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,290
And he stayed with them where he did long-term participant observation

27
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:21,300
with those young people, young groups, in the city.

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:30,410
And he observed the many concrete and every day life behavior of young people

29
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,370
in the community.

30
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:42,990
Other ethnography was also very dense and the result of long-term participant

31
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,830
observation.

32
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,190
Hervert J. Gans wrote The Urban Villagers in the 1960s.

33
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,500
And Elijah Anderson wrote Streetwise in the 1990s.

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,895
All of this urban ethnography focused on a small community in a metropolis,

35
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:08,085
and described the people's lives in those communities.

36
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:10,610


37
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:16,360
But on the other hand, there's another direction

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,305
which started from the Chicago School of Urban Sociology.

39
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:28,640
That was developed especially by Howard Becker and Erving Goffman.

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,500
In the book Outsiders, Howard Becker maintains

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:42,940
that the deviance was produced by the labeling process.

42
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:53,680
He did participant observation in dance musicians and also marijuana smokers.

43
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:03,970
And some of the deviant performance or practices was produced by the labeling

44
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,900
by the other people.

45
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,480
If you are called or you are labeled as deviant,

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,209
you tend to perform as you're labeled.

47
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,080
So this kind of the process, because the deviant performance was not only

48
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,810
produced by the essential some kind of element of the deviant himself.

49
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,180
That is a product or a process, from the interaction between within and from

50
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:44,930
outside, interaction between the performer or actor and the spectator

51
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,730
audience.

52
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,770
Erving Goffman developed this kind of direction much

53
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:59,980
radically because in some of the book written by Erving Goffman,

54
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:07,740
he described that some of the people who are stigmatized by the others

55
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,580
can perform this stigmatized role in a very different way

56
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:22,545
from the other people's perspective, or from-- there's

57
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:26,950
many other kind of performance he can develop many other kinds of performance

58
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,705
from this stigmatized role itself.

59
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:31,620


60
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,930
So from the perspective of Howard Becker or Erving Goffman,

61
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:47,160
we can think the city, or the urban space, something like theater.

62
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:55,390
Many kind of deviant or another kind of role or performance by people.

63
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:03,166
And this role was gazed, or labeled, or called by the other people.

64
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:08,520
And because of this labeling process, the stigmatized role

65
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,200
was performed some of the actor.

66
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,010
So always, this kind of gazing, or labeling, or performing interaction

67
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:24,160
was operated on the stage of the city.

68
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,600
So these two directions, I think, can be integrated, or related with each other.

69
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,850
On the one hand, the dense observation of the community

70
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,310
is very important to understand the city life

71
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,240
in contemporary city, urban life in contemporary cities.

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,620
But on the other hand, we can appropriate the theoretical perspective

73
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,540
of the performance and theater within this process.

74
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,160


75
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,900
So this is a very rough image about the city

76
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,520
and urban life from this discussion.

77
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:15,050
Because on the one hand, city is the place of the population concentration.

78
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,930
So from countryside, or foreign countries,

79
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,230
many migrants and immigrants concentrate, or enter, into the city.

80
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:31,840
And they start to create some of the communities, ethnic communities,

81
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,200
or communities of the minority, like hobos or other kinds of minorities.

82
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:44,340
But at the same time, city is a space of gazing and visualizing practices.

83
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:51,390
So some kind of the practices are labeled or stigmatized,

84
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,980
by the other people.

85
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:01,290
Such kind of visualizing practices are always operated in the cities.

86
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,830
Especially some of the minorities and migrants

87
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:12,220
tend to be labeled very minor role in the city in many cases.

88
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,840
And on the other hand, some of the people

89
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,290
played their role more positively on the stage,

90
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:26,690
likes street, like some place on the street, or theaters, or big plaza,

91
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,930
and so on.

92
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,240
So always, the city has many places of the visuality.

93
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,760
In these places, many kinds of different performance and drama

94
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,750
were operated and performed by different perspectives.

95
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:53,930
So we need to understand what kind of the community was emerged in Tokyo,

96
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,560
and also what kind of the stage and theater

97
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,860
was emerged in Tokyo in the modern period.

98
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,560
Especially, we need to focus on the minority community,

99
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:13,750
or on the minority practices who came from outside Tokyo in the 20th century.

100
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:22,250
In that process, we can compare what happened in Tokyo

101
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,630
with what happened in London and also in Chicago.

102
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,472
