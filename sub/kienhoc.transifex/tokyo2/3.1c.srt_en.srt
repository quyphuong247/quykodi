1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,650
Among the knowledge industries, newspaper, and broadcasting stations

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:16,770
are one of the most powerful and major industries in this field.

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,330


4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,660
And these two industries-- newspaper and broadcasting--

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,330
are connected with each other.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,670
So centricity of Tokyo is very important.

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,380
Both of these two industries, mass communication industries.

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:44,140
We will see the relationship between these mass communication industries

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,700
and city of Tokyo.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,350
As I already explained, the 38% of whole employees

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:58,200
in Japan in newspaper companies are concentrated in Tokyo.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:06,460
And 34% of all employees in broadcasting stations are concentrated in Tokyo.

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:13,780
So we can discuss about the relationship between these mass communication

14
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,150
industries and Tokyo in more detail according, or focusing

15
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,310
on, some of the districts in Tokyo.

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,570
So next, we watch the news film after the war

17
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:34,700
about the development of a newspaper industry in Tokyo city.

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:04:00,410


19
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,840
After the 1960s, the impact, or power, of television

20
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,570
became more and more strong.

21
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:14,220
So television companies became the centeral power, or agent,

22
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,959
which organized, or which changed or influenced

23
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:29,030
in the culture of the cities in many areas, in many regions.

24
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:37,210
But the television industry is strongly interconnected with newspaper industry

25
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,830
and other broadcasting industries.

26
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,180
But there is two connection between them.

27
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,460
On the one hand, in the case of NHK.

28
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:54,160
NHK television has developed from radio broadcasting system.

29
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,610
So there's a continuity from NHK radio broadcasting system and NHK television

30
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,220
system.

31
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,780
But on the other hand, the private television network

32
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,160
was strongly interconnected with newspaper companies.

33
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,910


34
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,040
Most of the major private newspaper companies

35
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:27,050
dominate, or influence, to television broadcasting stations.

36
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,660
So newspaper companies and radio broadcasting system

37
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:40,100
are interconnected in television system in Japan after 1960s.

38
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,840
Film industry is quite different from this triangle,

39
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:55,010
because film industry did not commit to television industry in early days.

40
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:00,430
So film industry is, in some sense, isolated

41
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,410
from this triangle of newspaper companies

42
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,970
and television networks and radio broadcasting system.

43
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:15,280
In case of the newspaper companies, head offices of main newspaper company

44
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,290
are concentrated in downtown area, or centeral area,

45
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:30,340
in Tokyo-- Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, and Sankei Shimbun.

46
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:38,780
These three major newspaper are concentrated in Otemachi area,

47
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:46,380
and Mainichi Shimbun are located in Takebashi, very close to Otemachi.

48
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:55,330
And Asahi Shimbun company are located in Tsukiji, also close to Ginza area.

49
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:05,280
These five major newspaper company was completely main companies in Japan.

50
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,450
And these five newspaper companies are concentrated in Otemachi, Takebashi,

51
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,490
and Tsukiji area.

52
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:19,480
So these kinds of concentration was very strong.

53
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,930
One of the reasons why the newspaper companies so much concentrated

54
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,970
in Tokyo, especially in this area, were in the history.

55
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:35,170
Because in the early Meiji period, in the late 19th century,

56
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,790
as I already explained, Ginza brick district

57
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,500
was the entrance gate toward Western civilization.

58
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,560
Because there is a railroad from Shimbashi to Yokohama,

59
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,500
and all the new information came from Western countries

60
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,030
first ported to Yokohama and then moved to Shimbashi Station.

61
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:06,050
So Ginza was closest place toward European civilizations.

62
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:13,330
So more so the new newspaper companies concentrated in Ginza brick district,

63
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,990
you can see Tokyo Nichi Nichi newspaper company and some of the other newspaper

64
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,630
company building in the Ginza brick district in Meiji era

65
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,890
in this woodblock print.

66
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,400


67
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,120
After that, some of the newspaper companies

68
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:40,600
moved to North or West or East, but still remained some other areas

69
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,500
around Ginza.

70
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,169


71
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:50,240
In the case of broadcasting stations, most of the broadcasting stations

72
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,810
are located in Minato Ward, or Chuo Ward, or Shibuya Ward.

73
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,220


74
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:13,460
In case of TV Asahi, or NTV, or TBS, those major broadcasting stations,

75
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,370
are concentrated especially south downtown area in Tokyo.

76
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,390


77
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:27,130
And this area was strongly close or connected

78
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,040
with American military facilities in occupation era.

79
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,215
Because broadcasting stations were developed in postwar era

80
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:40,920
from the 1950s and 1960s.

81
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:48,750
So in those days, connection with American occupation army and occupation

82
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,890
facility was very strong and important.

83
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,320
In the days of the newspaper, from Meiji era,

84
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
connection with the Western civilization,

85
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,466
especially European civilization, was important.

86
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:05,180


87
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:13,300
But after the war, the relationship between US facilities and newspaper

88
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,390
companies, or broadcasting companies, became more and more important.

89
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:25,620
So some of the broadcasting stations were located in South downtown areas.

90
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:33,260
This photo is quite interesting, because in this same photograph,

91
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:42,850
you can see three major broadcasting towers in very close areas.

92
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:49,320
You can see TBS broadcasting tower in the center.

93
00:10:49,320 --> 00:11:00,520
And in the right side of TBS, you can see NHK broadcasting tower and also

94
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,900
NTV broadcasting tower.

95
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,495
So three broadcasting towers were concentrated in this same picture.

96
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:12,730


97
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:19,980
From this broadcasting tower, the program and other kinds of information

98
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,340
spread around the archipelago or in this society.

99
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:36,750
So you can see the network expanded throughout 1960s and 1970s.

100
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,250
So both of the broadcasting system and the newspaper companies

101
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,620
concentrated in the center area of Tokyo.

102
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,740
In case of a newspaper company, Otemachi, Takebashi, and Tsukiji area.

103
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,140
In case of broadcasting station, the South downtown area.

104
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,810
Those headquarters are so much concentrated,

105
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:05,030
very narrow area in downtown Tokyo.

106
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,250
And more than that, both of these information systems,

107
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,730
or mass media systems, are integrated already.

108
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,950
There's a very strong connection between newspaper companies and broadcasting

109
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,240
stations.

110
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,800
In case of Nippon Television Network, they have a strong connection

111
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,840
with Yomiuri Shimbun, Yomiuri Newspaper company.

112
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:41,140
And basically, Yomiuri Shimbun, Yomiuri newspaper,

113
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,180
is stronger than Nippon Television Network.

114
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:52,530
Or in some sense, they have a strong influence to Nippon Television Network.

115
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:57,190
Other relationship between broadcasting stations and newspaper company

116
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:03,400
is almost same, in case of TV Asahi Corporation, which was strongly

117
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,970
influenced by the Asahi Shimbun Company.

118
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,820
And in case of TBS, that has relationship

119
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,450
with Mainichi Shimbun, Mainichi Newspaper Company.

120
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,590
And in case of Fuji Television Network, that

121
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:29,900
is connected with Sankei Shimbun, Sankei Shimbun newspaper company.

122
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,730
And in case of TV Tokyo Corporation, has strong relationship,

123
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:41,810
or connected with Nihon Keizai Shimbun, or Nihon Keizai newspaper.

124
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,510
So in all of these cases, the newspaper company

125
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,680
has strong power to broadcasting stations.

126
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,200


127
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,640
And there are no other independent media which

128
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,920
has strong influence or power in Japan.

129
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,320
So in Japan, all the mass communication system

130
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,200
was basically integrated to these five major network

131
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,920
of newspaper and broadcasting system.

132
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,170


133
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,850
That is one of the reasons why the gaze from Tokyo

134
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,350
has so much influence or so much power.

135
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:37,730
The gaze from Tokyo, in some sense, dominates the gaze in Japanese people.

136
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,990
Because of the strong power of these integrated mass communication

137
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,420
industries.

138
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,300
I'm going to discuss a little bit more in the later part.

139
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,250
But there is other kind of the media industry, or knowledge industry

140
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,900
in Japan, that is printing system.

141
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,640
So I move to discussion about printing system in the next unit.
