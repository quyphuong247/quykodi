1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,580
Publishing is another huge area of knowledge industries.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:16,050
Magazines, books, and other kinds of publishing materials

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,460
have a big weight in the field of knowledge.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:30,970
And, in this sense, 67% of all employees in publishing industries

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,110
are concentrated in Tokyo.

6
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,455
In the case of printing, it is a little bit

7
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:42,700
of smaller number because 24% of all employees in printing companies

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,130
are concentrated in Tokyo.

9
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,500
And publishing and printing are, of course, related

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,170
which each other closely.

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,360
If you see the historical transition, the development

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,330
of the printing industry also concentrated in Tokyo.

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,830


14
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:17,480
So the blue line or the blue pole shows the employees

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:25,370
in the printing industry, and also the shipping amount of the printing

16
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,060
industry.

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,120
So the blue line and the pole show Tokyo, and red show Osaka,

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,150
and green show Nagoya.

19
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:44,130
So you can understand that Tokyo-- the printing industry in Tokyo

20
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:52,590
increased or developed from the 1950s, 1960s, and the 1980s, continuously.

21
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,590
This is also a very interesting and insightful graph.

22
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,200
This is a graph about the relationship between the size of printing companies,

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,860
and production amount per engineer-- per employee.

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,970
So the horizontal scale shows the scale or size of companies,

25
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:26,050
and the vertical scale shows the average production per employee.

26
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,740
So in this graph, hypothetically, we can consider

27
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:41,960
that in the case of the printing for office use, that shows red line--

28
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,500
there's no difference between urban areas and provincial areas

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,760
because basic tendency is almost the same.

30
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,840
But in the case of books and magazines, the tendency

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,390
in urban areas-- especially big metropolises

32
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:07,210
like Tokyo, and provincial areas, was quite different

33
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,280
because in provincial areas, if you are a big company,

34
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:24,300
maybe you can produce a big amount of books and magazines in your factory.

35
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:31,680
But if you're a very small printing company or printing factory,

36
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,810
it is quite difficult to produce the magazines or books from your factory.

37
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:46,240
But in urban areas, or in Tokyo, not only big factories, but also very small

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:55,930
factories can produce the material of books and magazines in your factories

39
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:02,800
because the blue line has no strong relationship or correlationship

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,870
with the size of the company in big urban areas.

41
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,230


42
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:19,130
So this graph, I think, might mean that in Tokyo, or some

43
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,330
of the big metropolises-- not only the big printing factories,

44
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,270
but also the small printing factories-- can

45
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:35,630
have a lot of printing demand from other industries.

46
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,480
Maybe the most important industries-- correlated--

47
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:49,100
were connected with this printing industry is publishing industry-- so

48
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,420
in Tokyo, there is a very strong connection

49
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,370
between the printing industry and the publishing industry.

50
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,940
I'm going to explain about this.

51
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,310
Before that, let's see some of the images

52
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,520
of the development of the printing and publishing industries in postwar Tokyo

53
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,460
in the next film.

54
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:39,080


55
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,740
In the Meiji era, the first major industry--

56
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,870
which is strongly connected with the printing industry,

57
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,780
and some of the related industries, including publishing,

58
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,150
was newspaper industry.

59
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,120
As I explained, these newspaper industries

60
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,590
concentrated in the Ginza area in the Meiji era.

61
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,570
So close to this Ginza area, or Ginza district,

62
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,650
some of the publication distributors concentrated-- especially

63
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,660
in Kyobashi district, north of Ginza.

64
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,730


65
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:27,580
And also, some of the first bookstores, or old bookstores

66
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:34,060
were concentrated in this Kyobashi area especially.

67
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:43,000
So Ginza and Kyobashi had been the major districts for newspaper, publishing

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,875
and the distributing.

69
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,860


70
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:54,150
Also, in case of the printing factories, printing factories

71
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:03,380
were also concentrated especially in the Kyobashi district,

72
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,770
north district of Ginza district.

73
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,730


74
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,930
In case of the engineer or factory worker in printing

75
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:24,110
factories-- also concentrated in those similar areas in Kyobashi

76
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,860
and some of the other districts around Kyobashi.

77
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,420


78
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,610
So the printing industry, and the publishing industry,

79
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,410
and the newspaper industry in the Meiji period

80
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:44,490
had been concentrated basically in the Ginza and Kyobashi areas.

81
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:51,140
But, gradually, little by little, this kind of geography

82
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,040
has changed after the middle of the Meiji era,

83
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:03,770
in the 1880s, and '90s, and 1900.

84
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:11,580
The most important reason of this change of the knowledge geography--

85
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:19,080
or geography of the knowledge industry was universities.

86
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,030
This is a map in the middle of the Meiji era.

87
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:34,322
And as shown in this map, most of the Japanese universities in the Meiji

88
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:40,980
period were completely concentrated in the Jimbocho and Takebashi

89
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,880
districts, especially the Jimbocho district.

90
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,830


91
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:52,390
University of Tokyo, and Tokyo University of Foreign Studies,

92
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,690
and Hitotsubashi University, and Gakushuin University.

93
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,390
These are major universities and National University-- Gakushuin

94
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,130
University is not national, but is a special university

95
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,040
for aristocractic people in Meiji and Taisho eras.

96
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,260
So this is a little bit different from a other private universities.

97
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:23,270
So all of these universities were started in Jimbocho,

98
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,040
in early or middle Meiji era.

99
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,950
So all of these universities are closely connected with each other

100
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,755
when they were started.

101
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:39,160


102
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,520
And also, some of the private universities

103
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,050
were established in the same Jimbocho area.

104
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:54,280
For example, Senshu University was established in the 1880s and Hosei

105
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,140
University also in the 1880s and Meiji University, 1881,

106
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:08,350
and Dokkyo University started in 1884, and Chuo University started in 1886,

107
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,700
and Nihon University started in 1890.

108
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,610
And today all of these universities are very huge and big universities,

109
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,950
but they-- all of them started from the Jimbocho district.

110
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,470
So Jimbocho area had been the major university

111
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,830
area in Meiji and Taisho and Showa eras.

112
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:41,800
So it is quite reasonable why the new type of bookshop and the publishing

113
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,740
industry started to gather and concentrate in these university areas--

114
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:55,350
because the bookshop area in Jimbocho was the closest area, or district

115
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,750
to these universities.

116
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,930
They can expect the students-- the large number of students as customers.

117
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:11,250
So they published new types of books from their stores.

118
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,820
You can see the relationship between the university area and the bookshop area

119
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,360
in Jimbocho, in this map.

120
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,270


121
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:27,470
It is one of the reasons why some of the bookstores and publishing companies

122
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,580
moved from the Kyobashi area to the Jimbocho area.

123
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:38,320
And, at the same time, the printing industry gradually

124
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,570
moved from the Kyobashi area to Iidabashi and Ichigaya area.

125
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,220
That is also close to Jimbocho area.

126
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,630
So Jimbocho and Iidabashi and Ichigaya and these kinds

127
00:11:52,630 --> 00:12:01,780
of North-West of downtown Tokyo-- became the central area for the knowledge

128
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,970
production, especially based on the printing system.

129
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:14,670
Today, major publishing companies are still

130
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,650
concentrated in the Jimbocho area, and the Jimbocho area

131
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:27,600
is still a very strong bookshop area-- or very attractive and popular bookshop

132
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,570
area, even today.

133
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,110
And major printing companies are also concentrated

134
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,510
in Iidabashi and Ichigaya area, still today.

135
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:48,320
So these kinds of geography were formed based on university concentration.

136
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,810
The relationship between the publishing companies and printing companies

137
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:01,195
and bookshops, is strongly connected with the university students.

138
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:04,500


139
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:11,370
This is the number of the printing plants-- or printing factories today.

140
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:18,890
So you can see the Bunkyo-ku and Shinjuku-ku-- basically this

141
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,200
means the Iidabashi and Ichigaya areas.

142
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:29,790
So these areas are very concentrated areas

143
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,730
or printing companies, still today.

144
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,920
You can see the amount of shipped printed goods.

145
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:47,120
So Shinjuku-ku and Bunkyo-ku-- so Iidabashi and Ichigaya areas

146
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,790
are still today very important printing districts.

147
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,580
So this tendency continued until today.

148
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,320
So as I discussed, there is a strong relationship between university

149
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,180
students, and printing companies and the publishing companies,

150
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,860
and book-selling-- or bookshops.

151
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:17,120
All of these elements had been concentrated in the Jimbocho and Kanda

152
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,620
districts.

153
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,020


154
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:28,320
After the postwar era, only universities went out--

155
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:36,820
some of the universities went out from this Jimbocho area, to Western suburbs.

156
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,120
Some of the universities remained in this district.

157
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:47,110
So after the 1970s or '80s, this formation has changed a little,

158
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:54,660
but basically, the publishing culture or university culture

159
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:02,177
was formed in this structure, especially concentrated in the Jimbocho district.

160
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:02,676
