1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:11,930
The end of student revolt was symbolized in the Asama Sanso Incident in 1972.

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:18,800
The communist militant group, Red Army, occupied a villa called Asama Sanso,

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,460
and they fought against riot police.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,000
Asama is the name of the mountain area, and this is the image of their fighting

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,290
that was reported in the newspaper.

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,410
So from this image, people may imagine the fighting

7
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,930
occurred in very remote mountain areas.

8
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,670
But it is not true.

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:53,120
Because actually, Asama Sanso is one of the villas and resort houses

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,560
near to Karuizawa Station.

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,630
Karuizawa is the resort area for the people in Tokyo.

12
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,730
So Asama Sanso was actually not so far from Tokyo.

13
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,970
So it is one of the reasons why most of the broadcasting stations

14
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,040
came to the Asama Sanso area.

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,990
And they covered all the process of the incident.

16
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,910
This is the broadcasting hours about the Asamo Sanso Incident.

17
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,740
So NHK broadcast more than ten hours.

18
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,010
NTV, TBS, FujiTV, and all the other private TV stations

19
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,970
covered more than eight hours.

20
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,350
So they covered the incident enthusiastically

21
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:52,510
and they broadcast many news programs and other kind of programs

22
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,300
in their channel.

23
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,220


24
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:03,880
Average audience rating was also amazing because in case of NHK program,

25
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,000
50.8% of the people watched the program.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,970
So Japanese people also enthusiastically watched

27
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,675
the program about the Asama Sanso Incident.

28
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:20,620


29
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:32,750
According to this figure, in some moment, almost 80 or 90% of the people

30
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:39,050
watched the program of the Asama Sanso Incident.

31
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:46,500
And the average audience hour surpassed six hours.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,830
So, so many people watched the incident.

33
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,830
Very long time, very long hours, and enthusiastically.

34
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:05,770
In other words, this incident was consumed by television and audience

35
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,010
in front of the television.

36
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,470
This is a map around Asama Sanso and Karuizawa Station.

37
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:21,100
So you can understand Asama Sanso, and where that incident occurred

38
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,720
relatively near from Karuizawa Station.

39
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,770


40
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:34,470
So we can understand, maybe, the historical meaning of this incident.

41
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:41,300
I think, on the one hand, the communist militant group

42
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:48,070
who fought against the riot police believed that they're actually

43
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:55,820
fighting against the establishment, and government, and the state.

44
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,970
Basically, this is the basic meaning of this fighting, for them.

45
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,936
But if we see this process in historical context,

46
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:15,670
the Asama Sanso Incident was one of the very attractive spectacles

47
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,410
for television.

48
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,290
Television covered this incident, and spectacularized the incident

49
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,900
by television camera.

50
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:34,530
And society enthusiastically consumed the spectacle

51
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,868
with huge number of the television in the living room.

52
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,500


53
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,970
So we can understand what happened after the 1960s, rapid economic growth,

54
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:56,290
because as I already explained, the television broadcasting network already

55
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,470
saturated all around this nation.

56
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,320
So you can easily visualize any kind of incident

57
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,652
that occurred in many different places.

58
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:19,090
The Asama Sanso Incident is one of the very attractive and very, very exciting

59
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,340
incidents which occurred not so far from Tokyo.

60
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,540
So for television stations, it is very easy to cover the process.

61
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:38,170
That means the gazes of Tokyo expanded beyond the border of the city.

62
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:44,842
The gazes of Tokyo visualized that Red Army incident and other kind

63
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:55,440
of political incidents by students, from the late 1960s and early 1970s.

64
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,680
It was exactly this kind of context that the students who actually revolt

65
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,410
didn't know.

66
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:13,550
They fought against the government, university, and police.

67
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,840
But I think, actually, they played the role of the students who

68
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,510
fight against the government or police.

69
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:30,660
These two things are very similar, but completely different.

70
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:38,560
Because after the 1970s, all the space in this society became a kind of space

71
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,090
for the television camera.

72
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,410
Any kind of incident, or performance, or fighting,

73
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:52,800
can easily be the spectacle for the television consumption.

74
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,510
This is a society of the television.

75
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:02,550
And the gaze of the television became stronger and stronger.

76
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:09,840
On the other hand, students have gone out from the downtown area.

77
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,090
Because after the late 1970s, many of the private universities,

78
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,810
which had once located in Jimbocho and some of the downtown areas,

79
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,640
moved from the downtown area.

80
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,360
And they established large campuses in suburban areas,

81
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,030
in Tama and Hachioji and other areas.

82
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,490
In the case of Chuo University, they established Tama campus in 1977.

83
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,740
Hosei University also established Tama campus in 1984.

84
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,940
Tama is an area which is located far from Tokyo

85
00:07:52,940 --> 00:08:00,800
downtown, located to the west-- western suburb of Tokyo,

86
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,420
and relatively far from downtown.

87
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,820
In 1987, Waseda University established Tokorozawa campus,

88
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,270
and Keio University, in 1990, established Fujisawa Campus.

89
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,810
And in 2003, Aoyama Gakuin University also established Sagamihara campus.

90
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:28,240
All of these areas were also remote areas from the downtown area,

91
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,740
in the suburbs.

92
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,580
So all of these private universities established the campuses

93
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,440
in suburban areas.

94
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,470
So suburbanization of university campuses

95
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:47,040
proceeded in the late 1970s, or 1980s, 1990s.

96
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:57,830
So on the one hand, television gaze expanded beyond the city of Tokyo.

97
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:04,990
And on the other hand, the university campus moved from downtown.

98
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:11,900
So more and more, university students cannot be the active subject

99
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,520
of the city or gazing after the 1970s.

100
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,680
The broadcasting station, or mass media system,

101
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,190
became more and more powerful and integrated system

102
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,380
of visualizing in this society.

103
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,750


104
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm going to explain a little bit more what happened after the late 1970s

105
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,130
in the next unit.
