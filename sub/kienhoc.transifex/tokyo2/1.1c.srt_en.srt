1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:10,340
Movie theater was the most important public space in post-war Tokyo.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,270
This is a graph which shows the number of movies theaters in post-war Japan.

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:26,990
So in 1946, there were only 1,300 movie theaters whole around Japan.

4
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,170
But this number increased very rapidly, and at the end of the 1950s,

5
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:40,590
there were more than 7,000 movies theaters in Japan.

6
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,640
In those days, the total number of population around Japan

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,450
was around 90 million.

8
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,960
So every 10,000 people have more than one movie theater.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,940
This is the huge number.

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,069
Movie theater is very familiar or very common

11
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,810
public spaces for everyone in those days.

12
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:17,060
This graph shows the number of new film production in Japan per year.

13
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:26,120
So in 1946, only 60 or 70 new movies were released.

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,320
But also, this number of production increased very rapidly.

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,730
And at the middle of the 1950s, more than 500 movies

16
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,700
were newly produced every year.

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:50,360
This means almost 1.5 new movies were produced almost every day.

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,070
This is also the huge number.

19
00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:01,280
And the spectator also during the 1950s-- the number of spectators

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,300
increased very much.

21
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,320
This graph shows the number of the spectators very much increased

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,620
throughout the early 1950s.

23
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:19,710
And then after the 1960s, they drop, the number dropped very rapidly.

24
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:26,070
So 1940s and 1950s was the period of moviegoing.

25
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,230
There are not television systems yet, so the movie theater

26
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,850
is the most important and most attractive

27
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,320
popular entertainment in those days.

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,110


29
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:47,240
This graph also shows the percentage of domestic film and foreign film.

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:53,040
So compare with the U.S. and European countries.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,630
Of course, in the US, there is the Hollywood movie system,

32
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,150
so many of the U.S. films were domestic.

33
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,840
But in the case of European countries in the 1950s,

34
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,530
many of the films newly released were imported from foreign countries,

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,105
maybe from the U.S. But in the case of Japan,

36
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:30,990
a major part of newly released films were domestic, produced in Japan.

37
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:36,330
Because, as I explained, in Japan in the 1950s,

38
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,290
every year, more than 500 films were produced.

39
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,120
So the huge number of films were produced and consumed.

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,710
So the Hollywood film was very much attractive and very much famous.

41
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:57,190
But at the same time, domestic film was very much popular in those days.

42
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:12,350
But in the graph, the right side shows the total budget for each film.

43
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,570
So you can, it's a big difference between the U.S. films

44
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,920
and Japanese films.

45
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:25,590
Compared with the U.S. film, Japanese film is very much cheap.

46
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,930
So in Japan in the 1950s, so many Japanese films

47
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:40,390
were produced with very cheap budget and consumed by many people.

48
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:48,050
This map shows the location of the movie theater in 1953.

49
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:54,570
So you can see where the movie theater in Tokyo was located.

50
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,750
And there's a peculiar tendency that so many movie theaters

51
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:07,860
were located in east side of Tokyo, especially Ota-ku, Shinagawa-ku,

52
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,870
and Sumida-ku, or Taito-ku, in those areas.

53
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,430
These areas were industry areas, basically,

54
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:24,460
and where many of the laboring class people were living.

55
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:32,450
So maybe there's some kind of connection between these kinds of movie theaters

56
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,510
and entertainment of laboring class people.

57
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,470


58
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:46,740
Also, we can see some kind of change or transformation of movie theater

59
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,500
from before and after the war.

60
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,220
This map compares the number of movie theaters

61
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:03,450
in major cultural districts in Tokyo between 1930 and 1954.

62
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:11,390
So in Asakusa, the number of movie theaters only increased from 14 to 17.

63
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,090
But, for example, in the case of Shinjuku,

64
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:20,460
in 1930, there were only 4 movie theaters.

65
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:27,020
But in 1954, there were 19 movie theaters already.

66
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,100
In Shibuya, movies theaters increased from 4 to 12.

67
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:39,220
And in Ikebukuro, also movie theaters increased from 3 to 12.

68
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:46,580
In the case of Ginza, the number of movie theaters increased from 2 to 18.

69
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,670
So all around this district, the number of movie theaters

70
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,850
expanded very rapidly after the war.

71
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,560
So the important thing is, what is the relationship

72
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,730
between this increase of movie theaters and spectators?

73
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,370
What kind of people go to these movie theaters?

74
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,110
So we need to discuss in more details about the history of movie

75
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,270
theaters in Tokyo in the next unit.
