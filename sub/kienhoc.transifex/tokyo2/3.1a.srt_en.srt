1
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:24,720
In the previous module, we learned sociological researches

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,530
in London, Chicago, and Tokyo from the late 19th century

3
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,490
to early 20th century.

4
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:39,220
Because of the Industrial Revolution and rapid industrialization,

5
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,440
many migrants or immigrants and labor-class people

6
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,120
concentrated in new metropolis from late 19th century.

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,420
So in London, new sociological research was

8
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,890
started in some kinds of the lower class residential areas.

9
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,810
In Chicago, Chicago School of Urban Sociology

10
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:11,820
started their research in many migrant communities.

11
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,560
And in Japan too, in Tokyo there are many urban poor districts

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,590
in early 20th century Tokyo.

13
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,210
But the industrialization is only one part

14
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:34,190
of longer urbanization process in human history.

15
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:41,160
Because industrialization started from late 18th or early 19th century and it

16
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,400
continued about 100 or 200 years.

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,100
But history of urbanization already started in ancient times

18
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,350
and it continued in medieval times.

19
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,570
So some of the historians focused on this process of urbanization

20
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,080
before industrialization started.

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,030
For example, the famous historian Henri Pirenne,

22
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,470
who is a very famous historian doing a lot of research

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,550
in medieval history in Europe.

24
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,750
And he proposed the idea of medieval cities.

25
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,360
According to his model, medieval city in Europe

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,665
include a lot of merchants and artisans and those kinds

27
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:39,550
of different type of people.

28
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,345
And medieval city organized as a network of cities.

29
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:47,070


30
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,200
Between these networks, or in this network,

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,530
many different kinds of travelers, including merchants, artisans,

32
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,070
professors, students, religious people, and other kinds of people travelled

33
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,910
from one city to the other cities.

34
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,062
And in this network people enjoy the cultural freedom.

35
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:19,590
For example, the university itself emerged from this culture of cities.

36
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,360
Lewis Mumford, he is also a very famous and important cultural historian,

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,670
emphasized the importance of this culture of cities

38
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,120
proceeded to industrious cities.

39
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,140
According to his discussion, industrialization, or Industrial

40
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:45,250
Revolution, in some sense, destroyed the culture of cities.

41
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,180
Of course in the process of industrialization,

42
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,610
the city was expanded in many fields, or in many societies,

43
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,820
but the culture of a city was something different from industrial society,

44
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,295
or industrial cities.

45
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:04,890


46
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:16,910
So he emphasized freedom, or diversity, or creativity of the city

47
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,050
from viewpoint that proceeded before the Industrial Revolution started.

48
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,630


49
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:30,240
Some of the sociologists also criticized the discussion

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,130
of Chicago School of people because they only focused on the industrial city.

51
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:46,070
But sociological research can also expand the perspective

52
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,280
beyond the industrial cities.

53
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,960
Gideon Sjoberg did the research in African cities

54
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,810
and he emphasized, or maintained that the cities in Africa,

55
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:08,100
in the 20th century, are very different from the cities in the US

56
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:15,270
because, according to the Chicago School model, the concentric model,

57
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,960
urban elite people tend to live in suburban areas in metropolis.

58
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,790
But in Africa, even in the 20th century, urban elite people

59
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:35,110
still continue to live in the urban center, the core area.

60
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:41,000
So the development of the city are quite different from the model of the Chicago

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,570
School.

62
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,180
Sjoberg proposed his model of pre-industrial cities.

63
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,700
And pre-industrial cities still remain in contemporary society.

64
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,290


65
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:03,410
If we consider about the modernization process

66
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:09,436
there are three stages in the process of modernization,

67
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,060
or in the process of industrialization.

68
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,270


69
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,800
Because before the rapid economic growth of industrialization,

70
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,730
there was a stage of pre-industrial society.

71
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:31,550
And after that rapid economic growth, or expansion of industry,

72
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,890
there is a stage of post-industrial society.

73
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:43,690
And in terms of the city there is a city of pre-industrial stage,

74
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,270
so-called pre-industrial city.

75
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,720
And there is a city, a post-industrial society

76
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,760
that can be called post-industrial city.

77
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:01,350
And many of the research or sociological historical research focused

78
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,860
on the late 19th century or early 20th century cities, especially

79
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,760
emphasized the industrialized moment of the cities.

80
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,810
But after the late 20th century or 21st century,

81
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,200
we more and more need to focus on the post-industry moment

82
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,730
of contemporary metropolis.

83
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,970
Because in this metropolis, knowledge-based society,

84
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,110
or knowledge and creativity became more and more important.

85
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,440
And in order to understand this post-industrial city

86
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,970
there's a kind of correspondence between pre-industrial cities

87
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,640
and post-industrial cities.

88
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,740
For example, even in the post-industrial city more and more

89
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,060
elite people or creative people tend to live

90
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,946
in the core of the city, or center of city.

91
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:07,020
They will move from suburban area and they again

92
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,320
came back to the center of the city in contemporary metropolis.

93
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,200
This pattern is a little bit similar with pre-industrial city,

94
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,980
which Sjoberg explained.

95
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,170


96
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:28,750
But in this post-industrial city, there are two different visions.

97
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,409
One is creative city and the other is urban revolution.

98
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,130


99
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,649
Recently the discussion about the creative city was booming industry.

100
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,200


101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,140
This discussion was basically done especially

102
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:52,240
by Charles Laundry and Richard Florida, and some of the other people.

103
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,750
The discussion about urban revolution was mainly

104
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,990
done by Henri Lefebvre in the 1960s.

105
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,920
But I think there is kind of similarity and difference

106
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,430
between these two different type of discussions

107
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,310
about post-industrial cities.

108
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,890


109
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,370
In the case of the creative city discourse,

110
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,360
Charles Landry and Richard Florida recently wrote some of the books

111
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,640
about this concept.

112
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,980
According to Florida, he maintains that there

113
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:38,460
are three key elements in creative city, or in other words,

114
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,810
the creativity of the city consists of three different moments.

115
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,110
One is technology and the other is talent,

116
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,500
but final one element is most important.

117
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,110
It is tolerance.

118
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,440
Tolerance includes, or tolerance means the inclusion

119
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,490
of many different types of people, diversity.

120
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,250
So according to his discussion diversity is

121
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:20,010
one of the most important elements, or condition for creativity of the city.

122
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:26,590
In that sense he emphasized the importance of the creative city

123
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:35,990
with the rate of gay people, or multi-ethnic people, or bohemian people

124
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:43,950
because the city where many of the gay people, or homosexual people, or many

125
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:51,190
of the different ethnic group people, or people who are very much bohemian

126
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:57,540
can easily live is very important condition,

127
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:05,096
from which such kinds of creative knowledge, or creative culture emerges.

128
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:11,610
He emphasized the population of these bohemian people, and at the same time

129
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,230
creative people, or highly intelligent people

130
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,610
are increasing, even after the industrialization.

131
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,610


132
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:28,220
He defined so-called creativity class in two different ways.

133
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,710
One is super creative core, including the scientists, engineers, professors,

134
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,050
poets, novelists, artists, and entertainer, and designer,

135
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,840
and architect, and editor.

136
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,010
And also he emphasized the people of creative professional,

137
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,650
including the member of the financial, and legal, and medical, and consulting,

138
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,570
and such kind of industries.

139
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,310
So those kinds of creative class people increase

140
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,080
in post-industrial society, or post-industrial cities.

141
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,300
And they prefer to live in the center of the cities, urban core.

142
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,440
They do not want to live in suburban area.

143
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,980
So the center of the cities became more and more crowded

144
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,910
in post-industrial stage.

145
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,050
The other discussion done by Henri Lefebvre in the 1960s

146
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,280
were urban revolution.

147
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:40,380
Because he also emphasized after the end of industrialization,

148
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,830
because industrialization finished when the industrialization

149
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,370
or industrial element saturated in the society.

150
00:12:50,370 --> 00:13:00,270
After that a kind of urban revolution started it in many urban spaces

151
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,480
in contemporary society.

152
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,940
Industrial revolution, or industrialization

153
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:16,920
can be characterized by unification, factory, and homogeneity.

154
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,260
But urban revolution, or urban society can

155
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:34,070
be characterized by diversification and heterogeneity, and new urban society.

156
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,330
He also emphasized city as heterotopia.

157
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,580
That means the concentration of different types of people.

158
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:50,140
And the city is a place of destruction and construction.

159
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,000
And urban form is that new culture production.

160
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,920
So that kind of element he emphasized.

161
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,250


162
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:10,640
These kinds of discussion emphasize not only the creative people, but also

163
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,880
urban poor, or different economic classes

164
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:23,060
because this discussion was strongly influenced by Marxian thought.

165
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,240
And the discussion of urban revolution strongly influenced that young people

166
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,780
in the late 1960s, especially in Paris.

167
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,050
But I think there are some kinds of similarities

168
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,130
between this discussion of the urban revolution

169
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:46,830
and creative city because all these discussions emphasized

170
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:53,910
the diversity and creativity, and differences from industrial cities.

171
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,890
So after the late 20th century, especially in the 1960s,

172
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:04,680
or 1970s, and especially after the 21st century,

173
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,940
the cities are now transforming from industrial cities

174
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,850
to a kind of the post-industrial cities.

175
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:20,830
And in this phase, the knowledge, information and intellectual people,

176
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:28,440
or creative people, or intellectual or knowledge industry,

177
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,640
and creative industry.

178
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,710
All of these people and the industry are coming to be more and more important.

179
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:44,480
So we need to reconsider about the history of Tokyo from this perspective

180
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,440
because Tokyo is a place where these kinds of students

181
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,680
and other kinds of creative people are so much concentrated.

182
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:03,680
And at the same time Tokyo is a place where the intellectual or knowledge

183
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,560
industry, or culture industry, are so much concentrated too.

184
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,320
So we need to consider the history of Tokyo

185
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,710
from this perspective in the next unit.
