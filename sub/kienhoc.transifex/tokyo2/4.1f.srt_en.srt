1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:11,250
After the 1980s, Tokyo was transformed from the symbolic stage of modern life

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,500
to the virtualized space of fragmented postmodern images.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,620
And in this process, the image of skyscrapers

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,870
in western Shinjuku or Tokyo Tower has changed.

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:34,340
But on the other hand, Tokyo and Tokyo Tower

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,630
were destroyed again and again in monster movies

7
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:47,340
from the 1950s and 1960s and 1970s.

8
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:58,030
This is an image of Tokyo Tower destroyed by monster Gamera in 1965.

9
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,470
This is a title of the movie.

10
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:12,820
And Tokyo Tower was again destroyed by monster Garamon in 1966.

11
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,090
Actually, Tokyo Tower was destroyed so many times by monsters.

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:28,970
For example, in 1961 by Larva of Mothra, and in '64 King Gidora, '65 Gamera,

13
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:38,030
and '66 Garamon, '66 again Goa-Gongon, and '67 King Kong,

14
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,260
and '68 again by Gamera and so on.

15
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:51,790
So from the early 1960's to early 1970s, almost every year, Tokyo Tower

16
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,840
was destroyed by monster.

17
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,370
It's quite funny, because we don't know when

18
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,700
it can be constructed again after destruction.

19
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,280


20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,960
All the image of this destruction, basically,

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,340
came from the movie Godzilla.

22
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,810
First movie Godzilla was produced in 1954, and Godzilla, in this movie,

23
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:29,380
was emerged because of atomic bombing or hydrogen bomb testing.

24
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:36,950
And this is influenced by the incident of Bikini Island,

25
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:44,260
because American military did hydrogen bomb testing in 1954,

26
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:50,430
and Japanese fishermen were suffered by the testing.

27
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,340
But more than this, the image of hydrogen bomb or image of Godzilla

28
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,760
are related with atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

29
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,930
Because in the film of Godzilla, the city of Tokyo

30
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,950
was completely destroyed by Godzilla.

31
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,090
And this destruction, the image of this destruction,

32
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:23,130
was strongly connected with the experience of bombing and destruction

33
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,630
in wartimes.

34
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,940


35
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,970
So the interesting thing is there are many Japanese monsters that

36
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,750
destroyed Tokyo and Osaka and Japanese cities.

37
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:49,320
So in Japanese monster movies, monsters were much stronger than cities.

38
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:56,760
In the U.S., there are many, also, monster movies from the 1950s to 1960s.

39
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,860
But in U.S. movies, monsters are much weaker than cities, of course,

40
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,830
because of a hydrogen bomb or atomic bomb in middle of 1950s,

41
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,270
there are some monster movies in the U.S.

42
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:20,440
that appear because of hydrogen bomb or atomic bomb testing.

43
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:28,010
And these monsters appeared in New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles.

44
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,370
But always, these monsters could not destroy the city, itself.

45
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,880
Of course, they killed many people.

46
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,970
But the city, itself, is still remained.

47
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,360


48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,600
So people cannot imagine the Empire State Building destroyed by huge

49
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,770
monsters.

50
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:01,430
But in case of Tokyo, Godzilla actually destroyed all of Tokyo City.

51
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,700
So in Japanese monster films, the monster

52
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,310
is much stronger than city itself.

53
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:16,760
And this relationship is connected with the experience of the war, war times,

54
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,465
or atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

55
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:23,420


56
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:31,190
In this context, the popularity in Godzilla from the 1950s and 1960s

57
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,940
is very interesting.

58
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:41,400
Because from the 1950s and 1960s, as I already explained, in the real world,

59
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,010
again and again, Tokyo was constructed.

60
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,610
And new building and new road was constructed.

61
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,950
And Tokyo was expanded before Olympic Games.

62
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,500
But at the same time, in the movie, Tokyo

63
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,110
was destroyed, again and again, by big monsters.

64
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,150


65
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:14,060
These kind of relationships were contrast, finished, in the early 1970s.

66
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:24,820
Because all of this destruction basically finished by the early 1970s.

67
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:31,610
In case of Godzilla, the popularity of Godzilla declined after the late 1960s.

68
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,760
Before that, for example, first Godzilla in 1954,

69
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,220
collected more than 9 million audiences of spectators.

70
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:51,570
And Return of Godzilla in 1955 collected more than 8 million theatergoer

71
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,180
or spectator.

72
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:02,210
And 1962 or 1964, Godzilla movie always collected so many spectators.

73
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:08,950
But that kind of popularity declined after the late 1960s.

74
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,750
And at the same time, violent element of Godzilla

75
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,160
disappeared, especially after the late 1960s.

76
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,310
So that kind of tendency was strongly connected

77
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:29,400
with the change of the social consciousness of Japanese people.

78
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:37,180
After this process, after the early 1970s,

79
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,320
the destruction of the Tokyo by huge monster

80
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:50,870
was disappeared or finished until the early 2000.

81
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:59,440
But in some case, Tokyo was destroyed in very different reason.

82
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,650
In many-- not many, but in some comics and animations,

83
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,960
Tokyo was destroyed completely.

84
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,980
One of the examples of this destruction was seen in Akira,

85
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:25,415
drawn or written by Katsuhiro Otomo-- very talented and impressive

86
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:32,130
or stimulating comic writer and animator in Japan.

87
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,179
He wrote two very important comics.

88
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,650
One is Domu and the other is Akira.

89
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,580
Akira is a very popular comic and animation in Japan.

90
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:51,290
And in this comic, Tokyo was imploded or Tokyo was destroyed by itself,

91
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:59,200
not by the big power from outside, but by the big power from inside,

92
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,930
Tokyo was destroyed completely.

93
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:13,960
So the destruction after the 1980s was caused from inside, not from outside.

94
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,570
Many, or some, Japanese animation in the comic

95
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:27,600
represent these kinds of destruction in some different ways.

96
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:36,290
So throughout the postwar history, Tokyo was actually destroyed so many times.

97
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:43,400
I don't know any other city which was destroyed so many times in postwar era.

98
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:52,260
New York, London, Paris or other cities, I think,

99
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:58,830
were not destroyed so many times, like Tokyo.

100
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,270
But actually, in the world of the imagination,

101
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,290
Tokyo was destroyed so many times.

102
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,210
And this destruction, or this image of destruction,

103
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:20,260
was connected with the experience of the war and bombing and the suffering

104
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,120
by atomic bombing.

105
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,850
So Japanese people, imaginarily defeated, again and again,

106
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,920
the image of war and the image of destruction many times

107
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,880
in Tokyo or in the image of Tokyo in comics

108
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,610
and in movies and other imaginary fields.
