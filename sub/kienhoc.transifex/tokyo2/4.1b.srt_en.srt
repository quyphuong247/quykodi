1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,070
In this course, I also emphasized the city

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,480
as a place of gathering, or concentration,

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,880
of many different type of people.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:23,540
In the city people gathered as migrants, immigrants, urban poor, intellectuals,

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:31,900
and all the other kinds of the people, and live in some places.

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:41,500
So visual relationship, or gazing in the city, is much more diverse.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,310
Of course, the visuality from emperor, or visuality of Douglas MacArthur,

8
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,520
or visuality from many different kind of the camera and television

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,400
is so powerful.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,330
But at the same time, the visualizing practice

11
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,640
was also done by many different kinds of people,

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,480
including these kinds of migrants, and immigrants, and urban poor.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,995
So I discussed again and again about the visuality of these kinds of people.

14
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,790


15
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,470
There's a kind of the confrontation between these two

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,200
different kinds of visualities.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,460
Maybe we can say visuality from above and from below.

18
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:33,040
It might be too simple, but in case of Shinjuku

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:41,770
the clash between these two visualities, or two gaze, was very clear.

20
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,060
Because on the one hand, in the area of western Shinjuku

21
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,180
because of the redevelopment of the business area,

22
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:57,190
more and more, the view from above became dominant.

23
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,720
But at the same time, Shinjuku was a place

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,280
where many poor people, or marginal people, gathered.

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,490
So view from below,

26
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,410
that means, the view from the people who are

27
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,300
living in the periphery of this city was also powerful.

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,480
And this view also related with a view from the students

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,150
who gathered in western Shinjuku area.

30
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,450
So there was a kind of a clash between these two

31
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,510
different types of visualizing.

32
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,170
Of course, this kind of clash often and again

33
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:42,720
and again occurred in postwar Tokyo, just after Japan's defeat,

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,970
or in occupation era.

35
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:53,750
Imperial Palace became the place of such kind of the clash, or encounters.

36
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:02,430
Because many people from below gathered in this Imperial Plaza area.

37
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,680
But at the same time, the parade and the military ceremony

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,730
of the occupational army was also held in that same place.

39
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,640
During the May Day, there was a clash between the protesters and police

40
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,820
at the Imperial Palace.

41
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,280
And again, in this process-- or this clash

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:36,110
was seen by occupational army people, American army people from above again.

43
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,960
So the visual relationship and visual practice

44
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,370
was very diverse, and at the same time, multilayered.

45
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,320
We've being discussed and considered about the system of these multilayers,

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:58,310
or multilayered relationship of visuality throughout postwar Tokyo.

47
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,650
In the late 1960s, young people gathered in some of the urban spaces.

48
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,300
And they tried to visualize, or they tried to fight,

49
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,180
against some of the power in the city.

50
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,150
These kinds of the process of their protest also visualized in the city

51
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,670
itself.

52
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:32,190
On the other hand, some of the people, like children in some of the area,

53
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:41,570
or some district in the city, were also filmed and visualized

54
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:47,060
in some pictures or documentary films.

55
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,980
Also, some isolated people, for example this kind

56
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,920
of the lady, who lost the intimate person in the world

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,500
was also filmed and documented.

58
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,370


59
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,980
Some of the photographers, the U.S. photographers,

60
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:14,012
documented the people who lost everything in the war,

61
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,210
in occupational era.

62
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,290


63
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,850
Especially the documentary films, which we've already watched,

64
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,450
explained very well about the perspective

65
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,270
from below by these kinds of people.

66
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:38,780
For example, when we talked about the Emperor,

67
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,640
the old poor man living in Sanya appeared.

68
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,430
And his perspective, or his view, was quite different

69
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,040
from the perspective of all the other people.

70
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,090
So it was quite interesting, and documentary film

71
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:05,080
explained very well about his perspective.

72
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,240
Also in Part 1, we talked about Olympic Games,

73
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,730
anyoung woman who was looking for her parents appeared.

74
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,390
And she has another type of the perspective,

75
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:26,766
or she was trying to do another type of visualizing practices in this city.

76
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:30,010


77
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:37,140
And also, when we talked about Shinjuku, the old, poor woman living

78
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,185
in western Shinjuku has another perspective.

79
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:44,270


80
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,350
Also the people in Sanya, when we talked about urban poor.

81
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,685
These kind of people, in Ueno or Shinjuku,

82
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:56,470
has also another type of the perspective.

83
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:05,670
So the visualizing practices, or the gazes by the people

84
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,860
who are living in the periphery of this city

85
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,250
was quite different, and quite diverse.

86
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:20,120
In order to understand the city of Tokyo in deep way, or deeply,

87
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,350
we need to find-- we need to consider all

88
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:31,570
of these kinds of different perspective at the same time.

89
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,730
Considering about the television eye, or television

90
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:41,440
gaze, or gaze of occupational army, was not enough to understand this city.

91
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,570
Of course, it is necessary to understand that relationship between the Emperor

92
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,730
and people, or occupational army and people,

93
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:59,380
and also television gaze when Olympic Games was held.

94
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,480
But at the same time, the other type of the visualizing practices

95
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,410
by the people who are gazed by these television

96
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,270
and other kind of the visualizing practices

97
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,760
was also necessary to be considered.

98
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:24,630
And documentary film is one of the best examples, or best method,

99
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:30,450
to understand the different view from these kinds of different people.
