1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,920
Redevelopment project in Tokyo also went underground.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,540
Subway, underground road, underground plaza, and also

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,990
underground shopping area were constructed before and after the war.

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,990
So after the 1960s, a kind of underground city

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,549
emerged beneath the ground level.

6
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,720
But the imagination toward the underground world

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,600
was already exist from the 18th century.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,300
The famous Italian painter Giovanni Battista Piranesi

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:01:00,210
drew the famous print series of prisons in middle of 18th century.

10
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:08,470
In his series, he show some kind of image of underground like this.

11
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:17,720
This image is very much Kafka-esque or Escher-like or labyrinthian image.

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,940
And this kind of image influenced very much in Romanticism,

13
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,190
and also surrealism in the 19th and 20th century.

14
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,180


15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,520
In the late 19th century, especially in 1864,

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,180
Jules Verne, very famous novelist in those days,

17
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,320
wrote the famous science fiction novel titled Journey

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,650
to the Center of the Earth.

19
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:59,170
In his novel, German Professor Otto Lidenbrock who believed there volcanic

20
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,140
tubes going towards the center of the Earth.

21
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:12,970
So he and his friends go to the deep underneath level,

22
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:20,700
and they encounter many adventures and many prehistoric animals, and so on.

23
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,360


24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,090
These kinds of images are influenced or related

25
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,900
with new underground tube which constructed almost same age.

26
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:41,840
The first underground railway was constructed in London in 1863--

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,880
almost same year when Jules Verne wrote his novel of underground.

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,030


29
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,350
The first underground railway was started-- or opened--

30
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,690
between Paddington and Farringdon.

31
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,826
And this underground railway was locomotive-- steam locomotives.

32
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:09,220


33
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,310
After that in many metropolis, in London, in Paris, New York,

34
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:23,780
and also in Tokyo, new underground railway-- subway,

35
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,980
that is called subway-- was constructed and started to move.

36
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,710
So in case of Tokyo, first subway in Japan

37
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:42,300
was started in 1927 between Asakusa and Ueno.

38
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:50,110
And in 1939 the Ginza line between Aoyama, Asakusa also started.

39
00:03:50,110 --> 00:04:00,220
So you can move from Aoyama to Ueno directly by subway in 1939.

40
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,450
Subway network connect one district to the other district underground.

41
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,500


42
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,200
So we can move from one district to the other district

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,190
not passing all the landscape between these two districts.

44
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,750
This new transportation system changed our recognition of the city very much.

45
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,150


46
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:36,400
After the war, and today, we already have 13 subway lines in Tokyo,

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,775
and 285 subway stations.

48
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:42,330


49
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,930
So subway system very much developed in postwar Tokyo.

50
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,170
And this big transportation system-- well,

51
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:57,220
this very much developed transportation system is very convenient.

52
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,700
So we use it.

53
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:07,450
But this system itself changed our recognition of this city very much.

54
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,450
This process was already started just after the war--

55
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,590
especially before the Tokyo Olympic Games era.

56
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:25,900
The next film featured about the construction of the early subway

57
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,880
network in postwar Tokyo.

58
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,770
Subway line was new thing in those days.

59
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:43,060
So the landscape above the ground level and the landscape beneath the ground

60
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,340
level was quite different in those days.

61
00:05:46,340 --> 00:07:08,150


62
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,830
Underground spaces are not only for transportation purpose,

63
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,450
but also these spaces can be shelter for the people who

64
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,360
lost their houses by war.

65
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,110


66
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,280
After the war ended in the late 1940s, there

67
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,800
were many people in Tokyo who lost their houses by bombing.

68
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,310


69
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,040
So some of the people gathered in underground spaces in Ueno,

70
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,490
and underground road became a kind of a shelter for those people.

71
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,300
This is a photo taken by Shigeichi Nagano, who

72
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,030
is a very important professional photographer.

73
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,880
And he took the photograph in the late 1940s about these people

74
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,390
in Ueno station.

75
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,770
Underground spaces are useful also for commercial purposes.

76
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,760


77
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,450
They constructed many underground shopping area in postwar Tokyo.

78
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,980


79
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:24,250
This is Miharabashi Underground Shopping Area, which constructed in 1952.

80
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,800
It is first underground shopping area.

81
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,210
Beforehand, there was wide canal called Sanjukken-Bori.

82
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,530


83
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:46,950
But the canal was buried, and after that, new shopping area

84
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,390
was constructed where canal was buried.

85
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:58,250


86
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,810
Besides this Sanjukken-Bori, or besides this Miharabashi Underground

87
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,300
Shopping Area, many other underground shopping spaces

88
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:14,970
were constructed connected to subway stations in Ikebukuro, Ginza, Shinjuku,

89
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,971
and so on.

90
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:18,680


91
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,690
So this is a map of underground shopping area in Tokyo,

92
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,910
so you can understand the relationship between this kind of a shopping

93
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,590
area and subway stations.

94
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,370
So people move from one district to the other district.

95
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:43,530
And also people consume, or enjoy shopping, in these underground areas.

96
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,470
More and more, underground city became important,

97
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:55,300
and more and more, people did not or became

98
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,340
to not to watch the landscape above the ground.

99
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,840


100
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,750
At the same time, some of the underground spaces

101
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,130
can be the space for young people.

102
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,970
In Shinjuku, underground plaza in Western Shinjuku

103
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:23,550
became the huge plaza for the people-- especially

104
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,830
young people-- who gathered in this place and sang a song,

105
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,490
and talk, and discussed.

106
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:37,130


107
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,290
But basically, the development of underground area

108
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,740
was especially for the transportation purpose.

109
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:55,800
So even after the 1980s or 1990s, many new road and subway

110
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,355
were constructed under Tokyo City.

111
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:04,390


112
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:14,740
So next program featured the construction of new underground highway

113
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,230
in Western Tokyo.

114
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,490
So you can understand so many underground road and railway

115
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,853
were already constructed until the 1990s.

116
00:11:29,853 --> 00:13:31,390


117
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:38,330
Generally speaking, underground space has three different dimensions.

118
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,070
First, transportation network.

119
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:47,590
Many subway and underground road, and the network of this road and railway

120
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:55,560
system, became more and more important for transportation in this metropolis.

121
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:03,840
Secondly, underground space can be used for gathering poor youth,

122
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,490
or homeless people gather in these underground spaces.

123
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:18,000
Thirdly, underground space can also be used for commercial purposes.

124
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,470
New underground shopping area increased in many different district

125
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,975
connected with subway system.

126
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:28,490


127
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,490
Throughout postwar era, these kind of underground city

128
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,110
expanded in many directions.

129
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:45,490
So in postwar Tokyo, above the ground, many huge revelopment process--

130
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:51,080
especially skyscrapers were constructed.

131
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,140
And beneath the ground, in underground world,

132
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,080
new underground spaces-- commercial or transportation

133
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,745
and other kind of cultural spaces-- were expanded.

134
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:08,730


135
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,120
So final question for us is the relationship

136
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,670
between these physical development and physical expansion

137
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,365
with our imagination on the city.

138
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,910


139
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,080
City is not only the places for physical expansion and development,

140
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,280
but also places for our imagination.

141
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,970
So we are going to discuss about this relationship

142
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,490
in the final part of this module.

143
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,338
