1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,970
Throughout this course I've been discussing

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:14,870
about the people who migrated, and gathered, and moved in postwar Tokyo.

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,780
There were many different types of people who gathered in this city.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:29,860
These are the people who were running away from burned out areas in war time.

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:37,500
These are the people who gathered around black market in Shinjuku.

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,220
These are the people who gathered around the entertainment district in Asakusa.

7
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,930
These are the people who gathered in the Imperial Plaza just after the war.

8
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,410
And also, these are the people who gathered around street corner TV.

9
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,180
So many different types of people gathered in many different places.

10
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:10,070
Young people performed new kinds of music and drama in the late 1960s.

11
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,980
Also, some of the young people continued to perform their role

12
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:26,210
on the streets of Harajuku, and they danced also on the streets of Harajuku.

13
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,530
So people gathered, and performed, and interacted

14
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,620
in the centeral area of this city.

15
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,870
According to my discussion, there are two different faces in this city.

16
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,440
One is the place of concentration.

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,840
Because a city is a place of concentration, and people

18
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,280
migrate, and immigrate, and gather.

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,100
But there's another dimension of the city,

20
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,450
that is city as a place of visuality.

21
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,460


22
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,030
In this dimension, people preform their role in front of the others' gaze.

23
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,350
Or in other words, people watched the people

24
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:22,530
who preformed their role in this city.

25
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,230
But the most important point that I discussed in this module

26
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:36,270
was that this visuality, or this gaze, in the city was not one-dimensional.

27
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,390


28
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,080
The visuality, or gazes, or gazing in the city

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,290
was very much different in each context, especially in terms of poor people.

30
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,980
The city of Tokyo gazed, or investigated,

31
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,310
the poor people in this city in many different ways.

32
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,990
Roughly speaking, there are four different patterns

33
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:12,710
of this gazing, or perspective, toward urban poor in modern and postwar Tokyo.

34
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,190
The first perspective was the views of journalists.

35
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,120
And this perspective focused on the poor people as darkness.

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,640


37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,270
For example, Iwagoro Matsubara focused on the poor people

38
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,570
in surrounding district.

39
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:41,660
And they describe the behavior of the people who are moving in this darkness.

40
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,140
So the description about the poor people is

41
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,150
description about the darkness of the city.

42
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,190


43
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:57,220
But after the Taisho era, more, and more scientific, or sociological

44
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,220
perspective, emerged.

45
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,900


46
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,280
Influenced by Charles Booth, or influenced

47
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:11,730
by the Chicago School of Sociology, Iwasaburo Takano and Yasunosuke Gonda

48
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,360
operated the Tsukishima Survey and the Asakusa Survey.

49
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,940
And also, the Ministry of Interior organized

50
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:29,030
or operated the urban poor survey in the north east area in Tokyo.

51
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:35,570
And more than that, from the 1920s to the 1930s the Tokyo city government

52
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,900
established the new Department of Social Affairs.

53
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,030
And they organized more than 300 surveys on urban poor.

54
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:51,810
All of these services focus on the urban poor as a problem of poverty.

55
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,220
So the perspective of social surveys focused on the poor people

56
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:04,970
as the example of poverty, or the major issue was poverty of the people.

57
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,170


58
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:16,240
As we watched in some of the documentary films after the war period,

59
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,510
as a kind of perspective maybe the perspective of the surveillance

60
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,970
also existed in postwar era.

61
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,350
Because especially in Ueno Station but some other Tokyo

62
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:40,380
areas where many isolated young people came from their countryside.

63
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:48,820
And they're the people who need to be investigated by the government,

64
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,160
or by the social welfare, or by the police.

65
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:01,080
So this kind of gaze was a gaze of surveillance or disciplining.

66
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:14,960
We also already discussed about these kind of surveillance of the gazing,

67
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,480
but finally we also need to think about the fourth type of the gazing

68
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,490
or perspective.

69
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:30,580
That might be called as the views or perspective of documentary,

70
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,970
because we used many documentary film and program.

71
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:48,000
And these documentary films tried to feature

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,180
the perspective of marginalized people themselves,

73
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,830
the perspective from the poor people.

74
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,985
The documentary films tried to feature these kinds of perspectives.

75
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:09,000
Let me explain a little bit more.

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,450
This is a photograph taken by an American soldier just after the war.

77
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:20,180
In this photograph, this is a very beautiful photograph, beautiful sky,

78
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,740
in a burned out area.

79
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,300
But what was the relationship between photographer

80
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,720
and the person who was taken by this photograph?

81
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,400
Because that person standing in the center has nothing, completely nothing.

82
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,990
And maybe he was the object of this photograph.

83
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,480
Maybe in this photograph the relationship

84
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,300
between the occupier and occupied, or American soldiers

85
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:04,420
with very high technology camera, or American photograph

86
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:11,760
with a very expensive camera, and the person who has completely nothing.

87
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,040
But this photograph is a more contemporary one

88
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:23,390
and the person, the homeless old man was sitting in the center.

89
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,320
And this photograph was taken by Japanese photographer

90
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:36,230
the homeless man looks at something with his very sharp eye

91
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:43,830
and it is not surprising if he starts to speak something from this photograph.

92
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,040
So the relationship between the photographer

93
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,130
and the person who was taken by, him or her,

94
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,410
is different from the previous photograph.

95
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,570
So there are many different type of relationships,

96
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,200
the visual relationships between the first person

97
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,000
who took the picture with film and the person,

98
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,960
or people, who were featured, or documented.

99
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,010


100
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:21,470
In this series we focus on a different type of the merging of people.

101
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,180
For example, in the module on the emperor,

102
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:33,410
we met an old man who has a strong sense of self outside of the emperor's gaze.

103
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,340
Also in the module about the Olympic Games,

104
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,210
the young woman looking for her parents appeared,

105
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,260
and she also has a kind of her own perspective from herself.

106
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,800


107
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,040
And also in the module about Shinjuku, old woman living in western Shinjuku

108
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,100
just besides a skyscraper appeared.

109
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,020
And she also has her own perspective.

110
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,110
So in all of these documentary films or programs

111
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:18,440
the directors were very keen to understand the perspectives

112
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,090
from these marginalized people.

113
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,630
So this gazing, or these perspectives, we're

114
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,570
quite different from the other three patterns of gazing.

115
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:37,920
Gaze of journalist, or gaze towards darkness.

116
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,592
And gaze towards poverty and gaze of surveillance.

117
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:44,800
Or gaze towards the deviance.

118
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,350


119
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:53,000
The documentary film gaze, gaze of the documentary film was quite different.

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,016
We have been using many different documentary films about postwar Tokyo.

121
00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:00,600
From these documentary films, or especially

122
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,720
from the perspective of these documentary films,

123
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,920
we I understand the limits and possibility of gazing in postwar Tokyo.

124
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,120
This is the purpose of this module, and of course,

125
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,820
one of the important purposes of this course.

126
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:28,080
So I'm happy if you find some of the other possibility

127
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:35,170
of the gazing around different type of people in the city of Tokyo.
