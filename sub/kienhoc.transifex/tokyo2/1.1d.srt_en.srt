1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,750
In prewar Tokyo, Asakusa was the most popular and busiest entertainment

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,400
district.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,740
Around 40 movies theaters, opera theaters, amusement parks,

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,090
and Asakusa Tower were concentrated in this district.

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,740
Many different kinds of people, especially poor people,

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,410
working class people, often gathered in this district

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,660
and enjoyed different kinds of entertainment.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,800
Asakusa was the outstanding entertainment area

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,670
where new urban culture and popular culture emerged.

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:48,700
I will show one of the film which was taken in the middle of 1910s

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,020
about this district.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,750


13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,120
This is the silent film taken in the middle of 1910s.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,560
This road is the road in front of a temple in Asakusa.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,390
You can see the main gate, and also the main building or this temple.

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:14,550
People visit to this temple to worship goddess of Asakusa.

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,210
Around this temple, there are many street vendors

18
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,580
who did small business with the visitors.

19
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,690
And also, this is an amusement park called Hanayashiki.

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,400
It is also very popular for people.

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,390
And here you can see many movie theaters and other entertainment theaters which

22
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,400
has so many flags in front of their entrance.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,150
Here, a small park.

24
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:56,020
And also, Asakusa Tower was very famous with its 12 stories.

25
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,890
In the 1910s, especially after the World War

26
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:09,340
I, the number of working class people, especially laboring class people,

27
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,280
increased rapidly.

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,590
And new tendency of popular entertainment, popular culture,

29
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,560
became very evident.

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,030
So newspapers, magazines, and other kind of the media

31
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,865
focused on this new tendency.

32
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:32,430


33
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:39,430
First, the people in the field of literature and critique

34
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,040
started to discuss about this new tendency.

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,130
They discussed about new popular art.

36
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:55,940
And after the end of 1910s, some of other social scientists,

37
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,290
including economists and sociologists, also

38
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:06,280
started to discuss about the importance of this new cultural tendency.

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:14,120
In that case, they titled this new tendency as popular entertainment

40
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,230
But in this debate about popular entertainment,

41
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:24,190
there were two different kinds of the points which was debated.

42
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,960
First point was the definition of that popular.

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,520
Who is the popular?

44
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,220
Some of the people maintained that the definitions of popular

45
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,150
include everyone, all human beings.

46
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,350
But some of the other people maintain that the popular

47
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,440
meant working class people, labor class people.

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:59,240
The second point which was debated was producer or consumer.

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,570
Even if the popular can be defined in relation with emergence

50
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,540
of the huge amount of the working class people,

51
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,540
popular entertainment is the entertainment

52
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,040
for the popular or working class people.

53
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,470
This is a discussion some of the people maintained.

54
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,120
But some of the other people also maintained

55
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,940
that the popular entertainment is the entertainment which

56
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,800
is created by the working class people.

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,360
So consumption or creation is the second point of that debate.

58
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,475


59
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:54,580
Among these many different discussions, one of the most import intellectuals

60
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,726
which maintained about definition of popular entertainment

61
00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:58,600
was Yasunosuke Gonda.

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,750


63
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,800
After that Tsukishima survey-- Tsukishima survey

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,420
was the most important social survey which

65
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,760
was initiated by Iwasaburo Takano and Yasunosuke Gonda

66
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:25,590
from 1918-- Gonda started to research about Asakusa district.

67
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,400
Already in Tsukishima survey, this survey

68
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,240
focused on not only economic situation of working class people,

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,290
but also the situation of the cultural lives in working class people.

70
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,640
Gonda continued to focus on this cultural dimension

71
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,950
of this working class people, especially in Asakusa.

72
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:58,370
Gonda wrote that Asakusa is a textbook for popular entertainment studies.

73
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,860
In Asakusa, there were two different concentration.

74
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,890
One is a concentration of the new working class people,

75
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,550
or poor people without money.

76
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,090
But on the other hand, Asakusa was the district

77
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,000
where new cultural industry also concentrated.

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,540
There are many movies theaters, and opera theaters, and so on.

79
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,750
All of these cultural facilities could be

80
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:34,420
possible with relatively large capital.

81
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:42,030
So in Asakusa, we can see a kind of encounter between cultural industry,

82
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,380
and the huge amount of working class people.

83
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,050
So Gonda observed many interesting interrelationship

84
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,500
between the huge amount of the working class

85
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:05,610
people, how they behave in Asakusa, and how they react or accept or receive

86
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,770
the production of the popular entertainment in this district.

87
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,760
His survey is very important still today,

88
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,920
because his survey is one of the first cultural studies

89
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,850
or cultural surveys on popular entertainment in Tokyo.

90
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,590
But Gonda also understood the people in Asakusa

91
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,540
were not limited to working cross people or factory workers.

92
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,800
Because many different kinds of miscellaneous business, small business

93
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
people, also gathered in Asakusa.

94
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,700
Many migrants from the countryside to Tokyo

95
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,850
enjoyed Asakusa with very small money, and they consumed many different kinds

96
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,760
of the cultural products in this district.

97
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:16,100
Especially after the 1890s, the district where the very poor people lived

98
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:22,700
concentrated in Asakusa district and Shitaya district.

99
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,960
Shitaya district is the district located between Asakusa and Ueno.

100
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:35,260
And it was very famous for the poor inhabitants.

101
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:45,370
And after 1910s, also these kinds of poor districts

102
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,650
expanded to Fukagawa and Honjo districts.

103
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:57,190
Fukagawa and Honjo is a district in east side of Sumida River.

104
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:04,830
So you can see in this map that Shitaya and Asakusa is just

105
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:10,640
western side of Sumida River, and Fukagawa and Honjo is just

106
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,140
east side of Sumida River.

107
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:22,800
And this area was very much highly dense area of poor residents,

108
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,980
or poor population.

109
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,470
And Asakusa was exactly the center of all these districts.

110
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:44,880
The poor people who lived around these four areas very often, and willingly,

111
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,260
gathered in Asakusa area.

112
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,670
And they enjoyed many different kinds of popular entertainment in Asakusa

113
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,510
with small money and very much freely.

114
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:05,210
So the excitement of Asakusa in prewar period

115
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:11,920
consisted of the excitement of all these kinds of poor people.

116
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,260
And Asakusa was exactly the one and very much outstanding

117
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,860
popular entertainment district until the war.

118
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,700
I will show the image of Asakusa after the war.

119
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,070
Because after the war, there is some change in Asakusa,

120
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,910
but at the same time, continuity from prewar period.

121
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,040
But the important thing which has changed after the war

122
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:50,220
is increase of the districts such as Asakusa around Tokyo

123
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,060
City in some other places.

124
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,020
For example, Kawasaki or Kamata, or some of the other districts,

125
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:06,540
became the popular entertainment district like Asakusa after the war.

126
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,350
So the number of the districts with many small movie

127
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,910
theaters and small, cheap theaters increased.

128
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:24,040
But this increase means the importance or significance of the Asakusa district

129
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,470
itself may be relatively decreased.

130
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:33,040
I will show the image of Asakusa after the war.

131
00:11:33,040 --> 00:12:47,210
