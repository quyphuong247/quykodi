1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:09,090
I have been talking about the poor and marginal people in modern Tokyo.

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:16,180
In the late 19th Century, there were three major poor districts called

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:22,950
'Hinminkutsu.' And Samegahashi and Mannencho and Shinami.

4
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,990
In these three poor areas, the people who are discriminated against

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,280
are concentrated.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,310
But after the early 20th Century, more and more large number

7
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,120
of the people-- poor people from countryside

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,890
are concentrated, some of the other outskirt area of the city.

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,400
And these poor areas were expanded and dispersed

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,830
in Northeast area of this city, metropolis.

11
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:05,010
There were many surveys and observation and reports about those people.

12
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,020
In other word, the gazes on these people was

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,750
developed through late 19th century and early 20th centuries.

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:25,300
After the war, also many isolated youths, poor youths came to Tokyo.

15
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,770
And those young people were also the object

16
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,500
of these kinds of observation and investigation.

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,350
So there's many different type of interaction

18
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,530
between these newcomers and gaze of the city.

19
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:54,490
But after the 1980s, the constitution of the newcomers has very much changed.

20
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,680
Because before the 1970s, most of the people--

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,320
consists of the people who come from the north Japan.

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,960
But after the late 1980s, the people who came to Tokyo who migrated to Tokyo,

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,710
consists of the foreigners or foreign labor.

24
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:18,920
And they start to live in Shinjuku and some of the other area around Shinjuku.

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,380
But after the 2000s, one of the interesting tendency

26
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,740
in these kind of new people, or poor people in the city,

27
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:37,270
was there is a tendency in which these kind of areas

28
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:44,260
tended to merge with each other after the 2000s.

29
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,020
Not only Shinjuku and other Shinokubo area but also

30
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:55,210
some of the Northeast area in Tokyo the foreign people start to live.

31
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:03,090
So the special discrimination or special difference decreased more and more.

32
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,720
The different areas tend to converse with each other after 2000.

33
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,045
So this is a new tendency of this city.

34
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:16,340


35
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,440
Next program in NHK shows because next program

36
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,440
was broadcasted after 2000, 2006.

37
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,020
And this program shows the new tendency of the people in Sanya.

38
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,390
Because even in Sanya district, more and more the foreigners started to visit

39
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,770
and stay and live there.

40
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,200
So the interaction between the old types of people and new types of people

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,915
are increasing.

42
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:50,470


43
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,000
This is era of globalization.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,180
And this is the era-- this is a city in the era of globalization.

45
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,211
Let's see the next program.

46
00:04:01,211 --> 00:05:10,405


47
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:12,850
Tokyo is a city of concentration.

48
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:18,990
The concentration of migrants from countryside, and foreign workers,

49
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,450
and people who are discriminated against, and poor youth.

50
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,550
So many different type of the people who don't have enough money

51
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:37,685
or who don't have a good relationship with new cities.

52
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:42,710
But the pattern of this concentration, or pattern of this segregation

53
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,720
has changed.

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,670
And especially in era of globalization.

55
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:54,980
The special segregation or difference in these areas has changing.

56
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:02,250
In some way, that these different types of the area tend to be converse.

57
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,360
Also, segregation remains.

58
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,790
But more and more, the foreign people start to live in Northeast area.

59
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,145
And more and more, some of the other kind of the converse was occurring.

60
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:18,860


61
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:25,070
So after the 2000, Tokyo City is now changing

62
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:31,220
to different type of global cities from before.
