1
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:28,290
In this course of Visualizing Postwar Tokyo, both of Part 1 and Part 2,

2
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,260
I've been talking about the relationship between the people who are visualized

3
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,810
and the people who visualize, or the relationship of visualizing

4
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,880
in postwar Tokyo city.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,460
The important point is the same situation or same history

6
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,130
can be visualized in different ways.

7
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:03,590
For example, we watched this image in the first module.

8
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:14,620
This was filmed by American Air Force when they started the bombing in Tokyo,

9
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:23,460
so this image was taken from very much above or from the sky.

10
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,500
But on the other hand, this was an image on the street filmed

11
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,801
by Japanese photographer on the road.

12
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:41,190
The image filmed by US photographer and the image filmed

13
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,670
by Japanese photographer were completely different,

14
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,890
so this explains that the same situation can

15
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,900
be visualized completely different way.

16
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,660
The relationship between these two cases was insightful

17
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:12,930
because the important point was who visualizes, from which place, and how?

18
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,690
These kind of questions are quite essential when

19
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:23,450
we consider about the visual image of the city in postwar era.

20
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:31,920
We also watched this image in the first module.

21
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,640
This is an image of Douglas MacArthur when he landed,

22
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,990
and this image explains well how he visualized the occupied country

23
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:51,550
because he watched around the area, and his perspective

24
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,520
was very much bird's eye.

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,400


26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,730
But at the same time, we also watched this image.

27
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:07,260
This is an image of Emperor Meiji gazing at a map of maybe Korean peninsula

28
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,700
just before first Sino-Japanese war.

29
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,590
These two images, the image of Douglas MacArthur and image of Emperor Meiji

30
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,970
were in some sense similar because both of these gazes

31
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:29,710
by General MacArthur or Emperor Meiji was the gaze of the occupier

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,740
or gaze of occupation.

33
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,860
But on the other hand, some of the pictures

34
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,280
show different kinds of gazing or visualizing.

35
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,040
We already watched this woodblock print of Ginza red brick district,

36
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,120
and this image explains how people visualize

37
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,090
or imagine the world of Western civilization.

38
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,960
This woodblock print shows the visuality or gaze

39
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,360
of the people from Ginza red brick district

40
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,870
to Shimbashi Station and Yokohama and the Western world.

41
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,620
So this is an image of the people who gaze at the new civilization.

42
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,329
On the other hand, as in this picture or photograph,

43
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:27,010
we already explained how people's gaze or visuality

44
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,330
are organized in the spatial structure of the Tokyo

45
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,900
Station, which was constructed in 1914.

46
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,900
In this spatial structure, people are unconsciously motived

47
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,560
or unconsciously organized to watch the Imperial Palace from Tokyo Station.

48
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
So people's gaze or visuality are already

49
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,920
organized institutionally or spatially in these contexts.

50
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,440


51
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,230
In this process, we can understand the importance of this photograph.

52
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,990
This is a very symbolic and so famous photograph

53
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,950
of Douglas MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito,

54
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,980
and as many people explained that this photograph

55
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,410
is a very much symbolic photograph which very well explains

56
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,500
about the relationship between Japan and the US after the war.

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,600
But at the same time, more important point for us

58
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,800
is this image was filmed by a very talented American

59
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,750
photographer in American embassy.

60
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,740
So this photograph was filmed by the person

61
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:53,660
who was standing in front of the two important persons.

62
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,750
So the visual relationship between the American photographer and Emperor

63
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,030
Hirohito and Douglas MacArthur is important

64
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,960
and we need to consider about this kind of relationships of visualizing.

65
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,130


66
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:14,420
Many photographs of occupation era explain these kinds of relationships

67
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,930
very well.

68
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,010
In this photograph, which we already watched,

69
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:25,470
the American photographer featured many Japanese children on the street.

70
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,510
At the same time, American photographer also

71
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,660
filmed Emperor Hirohito in many places, as we already watched.

72
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,870
These photographs explain very well about the relationship between American

73
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:45,840
photographer and tour of Emperor Hirohito after the war era.

74
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,180
This also explains about that kind of relationship.

75
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,470
These photographs also explain more deeply

76
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:02,430
about the relationship between the occupier and occupied,

77
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,945
and as the American peoples, because in the center of this photograph,

78
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:13,620
Douglas MacArthur is walking, and Japanese people are watching him.

79
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,175
But at the same time, American people with cameras

80
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:22,640
are also watching him or looking at him.

81
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,910
So there is a relationship between the three different people.

82
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,560
One is Douglas MacArthur and some of the top level

83
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,890
people in American military system, and secondly, Japanese spectators,

84
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,290
and thirdly, other American people in occupational army.

85
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:49,190
But more than that, one camera is filming all these kinds

86
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,430
of relationships between these different agents.

87
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,590
We don't know who filmed this photograph.

88
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:07,610
But a camera was watching the relationship between Douglas MacArthur

89
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,720
and Japanese spectators and American people around him,

90
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,611
and he or she filmed these relationships.

91
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:27,420
In the case of royal wedding, people on the second floor looked at the prince

92
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:35,260
and princess riding on the carriage, but one camera is watching or taking

93
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,320
pictures of this relationship, both of prince and princess and the people

94
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,140
who are watching these two couple.

95
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,580
This is an image of an athlete being watched

96
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,390
by a huge number of the spectators in the stadium,

97
00:08:52,390 --> 00:09:04,220
but this relationship was watched by a camera from outside.

98
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,740
So there are two different visualizing relationships

99
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,410
between the people in the stadium and the camera

100
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,800
and the people in the stadium.

101
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,530


102
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:30,090
In some of the photographs, this camera itself is filmed by other people.

103
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,904
So the gazing relationship or visualizing relationships

104
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:34,695
were multi-layered.

105
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:38,710


106
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:48,250
In this multi-layered structure, the postwar visualizing system

107
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:55,260
was developed, especially in movie theaters and television network.

108
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:02,370
In movie theater, the number of screens expanded in the 1950s.

109
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,590
That means the new eye or new gazing relationship

110
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,790
was expanded in many different ways.

111
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,190
Also, in some urban core districts, the number of movie theaters

112
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,890
increased rapidly after the war.

113
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,860
So it was this kind of increase of visualizing relationships

114
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,180
which characterized the development of culture in postwar Tokyo.

115
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:39,770
Also, the TV was expanded in postwar Japan.

116
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,170
The number of televisions in households was

117
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,340
expanded, especially after the 1960s.

118
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,940
Also, broadcasting stations were expanded,

119
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,050
but at the same time concentrated in downtown Tokyo.

120
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,600
So people watched television, but the image which people watched

121
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,510
was produced by these television networks.

122
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,520
People watched television on the street and people

123
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,670
watched television in front of the electronic shops,

124
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,130
and finally, they watched television in their own households.

125
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:25,170
So many of the events in this city, in Tokyo in postwar era,

126
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:36,040
was televised and broadcast and consumed through all these kinds of processes.

127
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,630
Royal wedding, Tokyo Olympic Games, university dispute,

128
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,510
and some of the other incidents, all of these processes were televised.

129
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,200


130
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:59,070
So in postwar Tokyo, there appeared new gaze, or new perspective,

131
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:11,690
especially by camera, and the image of this city was expanded or duplicated

132
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:17,030
and reproduced in many ways, and people started

133
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:23,820
to consume those kinds of reproduced images of this city in many occasions.

134
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,650


135
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:33,680
So this process of the reproduction of images by the camera

136
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:41,400
was one of the central points I have been discussed in this course.

137
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:50,990
Tokyo is a place where this process was rapidly or densely proceeded

138
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:58,220
from the 1950s and 1960s and 1970s.

139
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,680
One of the important findings in this course

140
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,300
was how this kind of visualizing relationship

141
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,060
was developed and penetrated in many different places,

142
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,400
in many different ways.
