1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,530
I have discussed about the correspondence between the small movie

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,040
theaters, especially silent movie theaters, and movie theaters

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:20,290
in the street zone, and kamishibai in those areas for small children.

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,770
But I also can relate with these correspondence

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:32,710
with street corner TV, which was very popular in the 1950s in Tokyo.

6
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,530
During the 1950s, the street corner TV was very much popular.

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:45,050
In some sense, more popular than the TV which was watched in living room.

8
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:52,570
Because the TV within the house, or domestified,

9
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,470
was still very small number.

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:02,880
So most of the people watched the TV on the street first.

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,730
NTV, the first private broadcasting company,

12
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:14,550
located around 220 screens on the street.

13
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:22,640
And they invite the huge number of people free of charge,

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,520
and they attract the people to watch the program on TV.

15
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,420
This is a people who are watching very tiny TV screen on the street.

16
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,165
So you can imagine when there was a famous wrestling match, people gathered

17
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:45,780
around the TV to watch the competition.

18
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,380
But the important point is the location of these street corner TV in 1950.

19
00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:00,290
This red point shows the location of the street corner TV

20
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,400
when the television broadcasting was started in 1953.

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:13,040
So basic tendency was also similar, because many of the street corner TVs

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,605
were located in east side of Tokyo.

23
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:19,170


24
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,190
After 1956, the location already expanded, even

25
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,770
included west of Tokyo city.

26
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:40,060
But in this street corner TV, the people enjoyed the many program free

27
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,090
of charge.

28
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,190
And there's a kind of interaction similar with the movie theaters

29
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,250
or kamishibai, because the culture of the street corner,

30
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:59,140
or culture of the street still exists in Tokyo of 1950s.

31
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,410
Many of the street corner TV was also exist not only

32
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:11,130
did NTV placed the TV on the street, but also, electronic shops

33
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,380
placed the TV in their window.

34
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,200
Because the number of the electronic appliance

35
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:27,790
shops increased throughout 1950s, and many electric appliance shops

36
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:34,990
locate, or put new TV machine in front of their shop.

37
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,990
The number of the TV in electric appliance shops

38
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:53,340
increased to 20,000 around 1953 to 30,000 in 1954, and 40,000 in 1955.

39
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,930
So this number much surpassed the number of the street corner

40
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,160
TV set by NTV on the street.

41
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,540
And the relationship between the shop owners and these,

42
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,700
the TV on the public space, is very interesting.

43
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,560
I will explain some examples.

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,795
This is a quote from a woman remembering her father.

45
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:27,160
"At the time, my father was running a small electronics

46
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,600
shop, where he designed televisions.

47
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,370
The television faced a small window.

48
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,920
Because the television was still rare at that time, people passing by

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,970
would stop and watch the television.

50
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,620
Children came from all over the neighborhood

51
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,680
to watch the children's programs.

52
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:58,200
When there were popular programs, they would bring chairs and gather.

53
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,130
I'd also bring a chair out from the store and watch.

54
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,960
My father was proud to get the crowd in front of his store,

55
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:16,200
and I was happy to sit next quietly to the neighborhood bully and watch."

56
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:23,710
So these kinds of electric appliance shops expanded throughout the country.

57
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,350
One of the very famous example of the area where

58
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,550
these kind of electric appliance shops concentrated was Akihabara, very famous

59
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,260
for manga and anime today in Tokyo.

60
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,780
But Akihabara was started as a town of electric appliance shop.

61
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,290
And some of the shop in Akihabara also have

62
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,250
the TV machine in front of their shop.

63
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,630
So Akihabara became very popular, because there's so

64
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,940
many people who want to see the TV in front of the shop.

65
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,930
So the relationship between the TV on the street and spectator

66
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,710
was also related with that history of Akihabara area.

67
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,450


68
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,710
Also, the locations of TV station was important.

69
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,230


70
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:26,040
This is a map which shows the locations of the TV stations in Tokyo.

71
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,610
So many of the locations of the TV station

72
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:35,090
was basically concentrated in south or west

73
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:42,150
areas of Tokyo, especially relatively south downtown area.

74
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,380
This location is a little bit different from the location of the movie

75
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,170
theaters and the kamishibai and street corner TV.

76
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:58,790
Because those location of movie theater and kamishibai and street corner

77
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:05,150
was basically concentrated in east of Tokyo.

78
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:12,200
So there's a kind of difference between the broadcasting station,

79
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,650
and the locations of broadcasting station,

80
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,030
and the places where the audiences, or spectators, gathered.

81
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:25,230
I need to think about the meaning of this difference

82
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:31,150
and meaning of this distance at the end of this module.
