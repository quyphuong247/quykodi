1
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:24,550
Cities are places of concentration, migration, and immigration.

2
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:31,090
Cities are places of dense interaction and encounterment.

3
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:36,940
After the 19th century, because of the Industrial Revolution,

4
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:44,710
many cities in England-- for example, Newcastle, Birmingham, Liverpool,

5
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,300
Manchester, Leeds, those were the industrial cities--

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,320
increased the number of the population very rapidly.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,670
Also the center of these areas was London,

8
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:06,250
that capital of this Industrial Revolution.

9
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,655
So the number of population in London also increased very rapidly.

10
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:15,430


11
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:26,840
But after the 1880s, the United States accepted so huge number of immigrants

12
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,400
from Europe and other countries, including Asian countries.

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,790
So in this process, some of the American cities, especially Chicago,

14
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,551
became huge metropolises, expanding metropolises.

15
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:51,460
On the other hand, after World War I, in Asia,

16
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,885
Japan became an empire, including some of the colonies, Taiwan,

17
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:59,270
and Korean peninsula, and so on.

18
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:07,370
And Tokyo became the capital of this expanding or emerging empire.

19
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,280
So Tokyo included many different types of people,

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,990
from north Japan, south Japan, Korean peninsula, and Taiwan

21
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,310
and some of the islands.

22
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,950
So these three cities expanded from the late 19th century

23
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,026
to early 20th century.

24
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:34,670
We can do some kind of comparison between these three big metropolises,

25
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,910
especially focusing on poor people who started

26
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,240
to live on the fringe of these big metropolises.

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Because London, Chicago, and Tokyo include huge number of poor citizens

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,090
who migrated from outside to the city.

29
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:05,650
There are many observations and research and reports about those people.

30
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:15,410
So we also can compare these different types of observation and surveys.

31
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,300
Let me start from the case of London.

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,830
But before London, we a little bit mention about some

33
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,710
of the industrial cities.

34
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:32,010
Because in 1884, Friedrich Engels, he's a very

35
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,740
famous by his work with Karl Marx-- but Friedrich Engels

36
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,970
wrote his first book, The Condition of the Working Class in England.

37
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,800
He stayed in Manchester from 1842 to 1884.

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,160
And he observed the working class district,

39
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,390
and he integrated his observation with the contemporary reports

40
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,870
about the working class.

41
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:05,900
He showed in the cities like Manchester, the mortality rate

42
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,970
was much higher than in the surrounding countryside.

43
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:17,279
He argued the Industrial Revolution had made workers worse off.

44
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,950
Based on many empirical data and analysis,

45
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,550
he developed the wide-ranging critique against industrialization.

46
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,260


47
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:34,330
After Engels, some of the journalists and social scientists

48
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,760
focused on the poor people in London.

49
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:46,170
In 1851, Henry Mayhew wrote a book titled London Labor and the London

50
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,790
Poor.

51
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,970
And in this book, he did detailed interview

52
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,470
with people describing their lives and work,

53
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,420
including beggars and street entertainers and market traders

54
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,550
and prostitutes and sweet shop workers and so on.

55
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,360
So he did interviews with them, and he described

56
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,410
about the clothing and the living conditions and customs

57
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:19,132
and entertainment and incomes and all the everyday things in his book.

58
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:24,520
This book, or his writing, was a very vivid and concrete

59
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,910
journalistic description about the poor people in London.

60
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,680


61
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,770
This tradition was, in some sense, succeeded

62
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,660
by Iwagoro Matsubara, who wrote also very concrete and popular

63
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,410
journalistic analysis on the dark-- on the poorest area

64
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:56,290
in Tokyo titled Darkest Tokyo in the 1890s.

65
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,550
But there was another type of observation and analysis

66
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,690
on poor districts or poor people's districts,

67
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,020
more social scientific analysis.

68
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,680
The most important and influential project in this context

69
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,340
was Life and Labor of People in London.

70
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:28,130
This is the name of the book, written by Charles Booth in 1889.

71
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,295
He developed the social research in the east end

72
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:35,980
of London, a very poor district.

73
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:43,230
75% of the people who lived there were in abject poverty.

74
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,070
So Charles Booth developed his very important methodology

75
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,890
to analyze or to research in poor districts.

76
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,030
One is a Sociological Monograph.

77
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,625
He integrated two different levels of data.

78
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:06,370
On the one hand, he collected the statistics of family budgets.

79
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,170
And on the other hand, he did the interview with workers,

80
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,450
and he collected many personal descriptions about their own life.

81
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,800
And he integrated these two different levels.

82
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,850
One is quantitative, and the other is qualitative.

83
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:32,460
And he wrote the sociological monograph of the poor people

84
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,530
in London, east end of London.

85
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,520
The other methodology is Social Map.

86
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,140
You can see in these slide the map with different colors.

87
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,680
Each color has different meaning.

88
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,680
And this is a map of East London.

89
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,580
So with this social map, people can understand the situations of poverty

90
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,000
in this district.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,130
It was called social map, or Charles Booth's Poverty Map.

92
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,900
And these two different methodologies were so influential,

93
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,010
and it was followed or in some instances,

94
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,900
imitated by some of the sociologists in Japan

95
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,190
who tried to do the survey in poor districts in Tokyo in Taisho Era.

96
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,638
Especially Iwasaburo Takano and Gonda Yasunosuke, Yasunosuke Gonda,

97
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:33,650
did operate the survey, the Tsukishima Survey and the Asakusa Survey.

98
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,880
And in these surveys, they also used these methodologies,

99
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,370
which was influenced by Charles Booth.

100
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,520
So there is the continuity from London to Tokyo.

101
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,850
Many methodologies which were developed by Charles Booth and some

102
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:03,410
of the other researchers was appropriated

103
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,100
by some of the Japanese researchers in poor districts in Tokyo.

104
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,420
This continuity is very important to think about here.
