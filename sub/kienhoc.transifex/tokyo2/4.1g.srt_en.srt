https://youtu.be/oVF0l4MGc9M

1
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:11,720
The image of Tokyo in television commercials and monster movies

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:18,590
were quite different from actual development of Tokyo in postwar era.

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,990


4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:31,470
Postwar Tokyo has different faces and in real world, in many different areas,

5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:39,290
new construction was continuing from the 1960s to 1970s and 1980s.

6
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:47,160
But for example, in television commercials the image of postwar Tokyo

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,890
was virtualized especially after the 1980s.

8
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,350
And in the field of monster movies, Tokyo

9
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:08,480
was destroyed completely again and again in the 1950s and 1960s.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,890
So the contrast between imaginary Tokyo and real Tokyo

11
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,680
was very clear throughout this period.

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,930


13
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:28,020
But on the other hand, some of the media sphere

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,500
or some of the media presentation of Tokyo

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,700
are more close to real scene or real history.

16
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,430


17
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,890
Especially the documentary photographs tried

18
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:53,410
to focus on the people who actually were living in the City of Tokyo

19
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,600
in postwar era.

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:04,780
So finally, I'm going to focus on these kinds of media presentation,

21
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,240
especially in the field of documentary photographs.

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,550
I'm going to pick up two very important professional documentary photographers.

23
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,020
The first one is Shigeichi Nagano.

24
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,550


25
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,240
He learned from Yonosuke Natori in early days.

26
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,050
Yonosuke Natori is the founding father of Japanese documentary photography.

27
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:35,680
And after that, he became the photographer in Iwanami Photo Book.

28
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:45,030
He took pictures in 60 volumes of Iwanami Photo Book from 1949 to 1954.

29
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,460
After that, he became an independent photographer.

30
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:57,100
And also he moved to film direction or movie film.

31
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:04,330
And he also moved to the field of television commercials.

32
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,010
So he knew all of these different fields of photography.

33
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,720


34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,100
Many of his films were very well-designed

35
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,350
especially his photographs from the late 1940

36
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:28,270
to early 1950s focused on the people living in postwar Tokyo.

37
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:34,550
His photographs took pictures from the perspective of the people who

38
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,740
live in postwar Tokyo.

39
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:44,330
But at the same time, he took pictures focusing on the perspective itself

40
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:51,230
of the people in Tokyo after the war.

41
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,720
Let's see some of his photographs.

42
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,160
The first photo we already watched is a people

43
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,560
who are staying in underground road of Ueno Station.

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,040
Most of the people lost their houses because of war.

45
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,459
So there are no spaces outside of this underground road.

46
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:23,520
The old man in the center watched the cameraman himself.

47
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,190
The next one is a photograph in Ginza.

48
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,040
In this photograph, you can see the back of an American guy

49
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,440
and American lady in the left side.

50
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,470
And in the center of this photograph, you also

51
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,770
can see maybe Japanese veteran who came back from the battlefield.

52
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:51,180
And there is kind of a tension between these two different types of people,

53
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,870
because the Japanese veteran watched the couple of American people.

54
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,560
At the same time, this is also a photograph in Ginza.

55
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,480
In the the left side, there is some American soldiers.

56
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,400
And exactly in front of them, this Japanese woman

57
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,540
represents or show or displayed herself in front

58
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,590
of these American soldiers in Ginza.

59
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,710
So again, the act of watching and act of displaying herself

60
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,650
is a very interesting relationship.

61
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,040
Again, this is in Ginza.

62
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,080
This couple, a man and a woman, walking across the street

63
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,570
and their faces are very happy.

64
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,590
They look very happy.

65
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,240
So this is a very-- some kind of the happy image of Ginza

66
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,380
after the war in 1951.

67
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,830
At the same time, this photo is also in Ginza.

68
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,840
And these women with their babies looking at the show

69
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,730
windows in the street of Ginza.

70
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,840
So, again, the relationship and difference

71
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,370
between the commodities in the show window and their gaze

72
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:28,340
and the real situation with their babies are also very stimulating.

73
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,760
This is a photograph of Ginza at night.

74
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,520
In the center of this photograph, you can see the person

75
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,340
with clown-like clothes.

76
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:45,410
He's advertising some of the club or restaurant or bar.

77
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,390
But at the same, he performs something from some place.

78
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,870
We're not so sure to where his gaze is directing.

79
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,670
But anyway, he's performing something in front of the people walking

80
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,470
on the street of Ginza.

81
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,040
This is different because this is the photograph in Shinjuku.

82
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,440
And so many people are looking for their job.

83
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,270
So their eyes, or their gaze, is much more, in some sense,

84
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,720
difficult or hard towards the cameraman.

85
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:35,290
But anyway, this photograph also focused on the gaze of these people.

86
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:42,340
This is another photograph taken at the riverside in east Tokyo.

87
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:48,090
So people on the bridge are looking at something on the river.

88
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,610
But the camera cannot see what they are watching.

89
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,040
But anyway, again, the viewing relationship

90
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:05,350
by the people in the photograph is also important, or important theme

91
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,120
in this photo.

92
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,530
This is a photograph of a local residential district.

93
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,830
The houses in this photograph looks like they are very poor.

94
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,880
But many people in the early 1950s lived in these houses.

95
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,200
At the center of this photograph, you can see water drainage.

96
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,900


97
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,090
And public hygiene workers come to this district.

98
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:40,429
And they tried to exterminate or disinfect the rats or other kind

99
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,049
of things from this district.

100
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:50,370
So people in this district are watching the process of the disinfection

101
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,810
by public hygiene workers.

102
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,510
This is a photograph of Asakusa.

103
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:00,070
Those kids are playing inside the temple.

104
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,300
And then you can see two statues of Buddha.

105
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,040
But girls are on the statue of Buddha.

106
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,740
And a young boy at the center watching the girl on the statue of Buddha.

107
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,740
On the other hand, the girl at the center watching the cameraman, maybe.

108
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,080
So the visual relationship between the young boy and girls or girls

109
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:35,540
and cameraman are very well-designed or well-documented in this photograph.

110
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,750
This is a photograph in the Imperial Palace.

111
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,790
And these people came from the countryside.

112
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,285
And these people came to see the Imperial Palace after the war.

113
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:51,280


114
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,680
So I've already discussed about the Imperial Palace

115
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,720
after the war-- demonstration and political fights and other things.

116
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,810
But this is another kind of the image of the Imperial Palace after the war

117
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,770
because people who come from countryside to the Imperial Palace

118
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:21,370
want to see something different from that scene or practices which were done

119
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,530
in the Imperial Palace in those days.

120
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:29,170
And they watched the Emperor Hirohito or the Imperial Palace itself.

121
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,910
In all of the photographs by Shigeichi Nagano,

122
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,780
he documented very well the relationship between people and people,

123
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,300
especially visual relationships.

124
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,840
The gaze or vision by the people in postwar Tokyo,

125
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,250
we can understand the people are watching to some place or some people

126
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,980
in postwar Tokyo.

127
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,290
He documented very well in this photograph

128
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:06,480
that kind of the visual relationship, which was performed in postwar Tokyo.

129
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,110
Secondly, I'm going to pick up some of the photographs taken

130
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,380
by Masatoshi Naito.

131
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:20,740
Masatoshi Naito is a photographer who focused on the invisible side

132
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,160
of the City of Tokyo.

133
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,940
Actually, he was not only a professional photographer, but also an ethnographer.

134
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:36,490
He did a very interesting ethnographic folklore in north Japan.

135
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,720
And in this process, he took many pictures

136
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,790
in the forestsides and mountainsides of Japan.

137
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,670
After he came back to Tokyo, he took some

138
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,000
of the photographs, very interesting photographs of Tokyo,

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,370
which focused on hidden dark side-- or hidden darkness of this city.

140
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,030


141
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:10,640
And these photographs were published in the book titled Tokyo.

142
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,850
So we are going to see some of his pictures

143
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,770
in Tokyo in the 1970s and '80s.

144
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:27,050
The first photograph by Masatoshi Naito was people, maybe very poor people,

145
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:33,890
looking at something on the road or on the bridge.

146
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,360
They are looking at something from these places.

147
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,240
And most people, the face, we can understand that most of the people

148
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,740
are not so rich.

149
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,330
So what are they watching?

150
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,060
We are not so sure.

151
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,650
I don't know.

152
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,840
This is people who are sitting on the bench.

153
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,460
And their gaze is not so sure.

154
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:09,750
They're just sitting and not so, how to say, they are just sitting and staying.

155
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,420


156
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:19,530
This is a photograph of a man who is singing in Asakusa.

157
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,520
What he's doing-- I'm not so sure.

158
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:29,760
But at least we can understand he's very much isolated from other people

159
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,230
or from the surrounding landscapes.

160
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,910


161
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,420
Masatoshi Naito especially focused on the homeless people or very poor people

162
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,440
in Tokyo.

163
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:49,050
This old man who is walking with a very strong gaze.

164
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:56,790
So this photograph is quite impressive for the people who see this photograph.

165
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:05,060
And this is the same person who is sitting on the road on some open space.

166
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:15,750
So he's a homeless guy but his eyes are very-- look very deep and very strong.

167
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,270
This is an old woman who is sitting also on the street.

168
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,480
She is also a homeless person.

169
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,800
And her face is very much impressive for us.

170
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,030
And finally, this is a photograph of a homeless woman.

171
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,280
But we cannot see her face itself.

172
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,820


173
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,660
Because many of Masatoshi Naito's photographs focus on something,

174
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,100
which are not visible.

175
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,250
In many of these kinds of documentary photographs,

176
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:07,270
the photograph focused on something, which are not visible.

177
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,070
So an invisible field is existing in this photograph

178
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,290
and the relationship between visible and invisible

179
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:26,290
is quite an important focus or scene of these photographs.

180
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:32,630
In the photograph by Shigeichi Nagano, the visual relationship in postwar era,

181
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,860
especially in postwar Tokyo was well documented.

182
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,780
Some people watching something, and some people look at something.

183
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:50,370
So he documented very well about these visual relationships in Tokyo.

184
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,510
But on the other hand, in Masatoshi Naito's photographs,

185
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:03,930
he focuses on something invisible-- hidden darkness.

186
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:10,060
So from his photographs, we can understand there is still something

187
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:19,920
which cannot be visible or which stay in the darkness in Tokyo.

188
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:27,520
We've discussed about visualizing Tokyo.

189
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:34,930
And many scenes and the many phenomena we discussed, which are visualized

190
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,850
or which have been visualized.

191
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:48,185
But at the same time in Tokyo, there are something and some people and some

192
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:51,920
places which cannot be visualized.

193
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,610


194
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:04,180
The photograph taken by Masatoshi Naito explain and told us

195
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:13,070
that in Tokyo there are such kinds of invisibility remained.
