1
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,530
In the previous modules, Visualizing Postwar Tokyo, Part 1,

2
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,330
we've been discussing about four different topics.

3
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,250
First, American gaze.

4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,670
American occupation.

5
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,070
Second, emperor and royal family.

6
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,310
Third, Tokyo Olympic Games.

7
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,650
And finally, Shinjuku.

8
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,260
In the first module about American occupation,

9
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,450
we discussed about American gaze, which was introduced to Japanese society

10
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,550
with the huge number of cameras.

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,360
So post-war Japan, especially occupied Japan,

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,720
was visualized with these cameras.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,710
But at the same time, I discussed about invisibility of occupation itself.

14
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,730


15
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,750
Through this invisibility, there is a kind

16
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:22,775
of process of self-colonization of ourself in post-war Japan.

17
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:26,090


18
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:32,800
On the other hand, in the discussion of emperor and royal family,

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,180
we discussed about the continuity of imperial gaze

20
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,180
from pre-war and post-war era.

21
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,290


22
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:52,820
Emperor Hirohito, reappeared on the front stage towards the people,

23
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,770
even after the war, 1946.

24
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:04,570
And he regained that interaction, or connection, or visual connection,

25
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:13,140
with the people through many visiting and many tours all around the society.

26
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,790
So there's a kind of a continuity from before the war

27
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,110
and after the war about this kind of the imperial gaze.

28
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,040
But at the same time, at the end of 1950s,

29
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,770
royal wedding had a strong impact to ordinary people.

30
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:37,140
And people are so fascinated by new couple, prince and princess.

31
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,820
And this process was shown through expanding TV network.

32
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:52,560
So imperial gaze, or visual relationship between nation and the royal family

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,850
was-- reproduced and broadcasted through the expanding TV networks.

34
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:08,140
Thirdly, in the discussion about Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964,

35
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:17,290
I discussed about this event in terms of demilitarization of Japanese society.

36
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,890
But in some sense, there is a kind of continuity

37
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,130
from pre-war period to post-war period, especially

38
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,200
in relation with this kind of demilitarization.

39
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:40,180
In other words, many of the stadium of sports was former military ground.

40
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,900
And some kinds of element within military system

41
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,280
was continued in sports system.

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,920
So we need to think about the division or discontinuity from pre-war

43
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,730
to post-war period.

44
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,890
But at the same time, we need to discuss and consider

45
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,020
about the continuity from pre-war and post-war era,

46
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,520
especially in terms of this kind of Tokyo Olympic Games.

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,970
And throughout this Olympic Games, Tokyo was redeveloped or developed

48
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,649
in many areas.

49
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,100
Highway system and transportation system,

50
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,170
and the new urban space and new road.

51
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:32,010
So we already discussed about that new urban construction and new urban space

52
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,050
was emerged through this Tokyo Olympic Games.

53
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,790
And also, throughout this high rapid economic growth period,

54
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:47,170
the people who gathered in this city felt strong isolation.

55
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,400
So the identity of the people, or isolations of people, in the city

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
was also our interest.

57
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,440
Finally, we discussed about Shinjuku.

58
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,720
Shinjuku was a place of the concentration.

59
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,940
And in this concentration, there's two different kinds

60
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,740
of concentration of the population-- concentration of the commuters,

61
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,970
and, at the same time, concentration of the immigrants or migrants.

62
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,140
So Shinjuku was a place of the concentration

63
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,860
of the economic activity and the culture activity, too.

64
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,360
But these two element-- economic activity and culture activity--

65
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,880
clashed with each other around 1970.

66
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,530
So this process was related with many other process of urbanization

67
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,470
in this city, Tokyo.

68
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,180
Throughout all of these kinds of discussions,

69
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,660
we especially focused on two different gazes in the city.

70
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:05,420
One is gaze from above, and the other is gaze from below.

71
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,150
These different kinds of the gaze are correlated,

72
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,030
and in some sense confronted.

73
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,270
Many documentary films and programs focused

74
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,720
on this kind of the confrontation, and relationship-- very much

75
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,420
complicated relationship-- between these different kind of the gazes

76
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,100
in post-war Tokyo.
