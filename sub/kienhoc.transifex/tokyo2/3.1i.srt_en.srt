00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,070
After 1970, the relationship between the young people and the city

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,080
has changed structurally.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,280
When I discussed the Shinjuku and young people and development of an urban core

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,030
in the district, the crash between young people

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,560
who gathered in western Shinjuku and the new urban core

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,420
was a very evident phenomenon.

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:37,490
But after this crash, the university campus moved from the downtown area

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,950
to a suburban area.

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,450
And also the students became more and more--

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:53,470
the students' movement became more and more ended in many different ways.

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:07,470
So Tokyo cannot be the city of students anymore in the same way as the 1960s.

12
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:15,110
In some sense, the students are marginalized more and more in Tokyo

13
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,740
after the 1970s.

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,920
Of course, the number of the students increased more and more,

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,080
and the students started to enjoy the city life in Tokyo.

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,350
But at the same time, the student culture in the 1950s and 1960s

17
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,820
were marginalized in the city.

18
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,860
And on the other hand, the television gaze or the gaze of mass media

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,045
expanded beyond the city.

20
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:51,810


21
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,820
We can say that these media gaze or gazes of Tokyo

22
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:05,540
expanded and saturated throughout this society after the 1970s.

23
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,630
So people could easily consume many different kinds

24
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,160
of images of the people in this society.

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,820
This means, on the one hand, through this media system,

26
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,540
people in this country consumed the image of Tokyo in many different media.

27
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,300
But at the same time, these media consumed many different types

28
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,300
of people and images in this society from Tokyo--

29
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,940
from the perspective of Tokyo.

30
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,510
So this visual relationship between Tokyo

31
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:51,490
and provinces, or center and periphery, was completely systematized,

32
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,260
and the systematization of this relationship

33
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,240
was completed until the late 1980s.

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,590
In this context, in Tokyo, after the 1970s-- for example,

35
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,910
in 1970, fashion magazines, Anan and Non-no and other kinds

36
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,990
of fashion magazines, published and expanded.

37
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,420
And in 1973, PARCO and Park Street in Shibuya--

38
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,420
it's a commercially developed area in Shibuya--

39
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,910
became verify fashionable and popular.

40
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,200
And in the 1980s, many young people gathered

41
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,640
in Harajuku and Omotesando area.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,760
And in 1983, Tokyo Disneyland opened.

43
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,620
And in the late 1980s, some of the trendy drama in private broadcasting

44
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,260
system became a booming industry.

45
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:57,055
All of these phenomena mean or meant that the people, young people, or life

46
00:03:57,055 --> 00:04:03,600
in Tokyo became more and more the image which

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,420
could be consumed through the mass media gaze.

48
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,110
I already explained some of the images in Harajuku,

49
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,980
in Takeshita Street like this, and Takenoko people

50
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:27,790
like this, and Disney goods like this, and waterfront area like this.

51
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:34,050
all of these are images which easily can be consumed by the people

52
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,080
after the 1970s and '80s in Tokyo.

53
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,820
So in this process, Tokyo became a kind of commodity,

54
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,310
which can be consumed by the television gaze or other kinds of media gaze.

55
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:55,280
And at the same time, on the other hand, the whole society of Japan

56
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:03,660
became a kind of a commodity, which also could be consumed by media gaze.
