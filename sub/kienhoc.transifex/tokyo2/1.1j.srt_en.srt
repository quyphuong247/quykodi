1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,420
This is the conclusion.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,270
In this module, I have talked about the relationship

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:16,309
between urban visuality in postwar Tokyo and class formation of this city

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,740
from the 1950s to 1960s.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,700
In the late 1940s or 1950s, the movie theater

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,610
was expanded all around the city.

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,630
The number of the movie theater, especially cheap and small movie

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,570
theaters, increased rapidly.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:39,640
And also new film, which was made in Japan, was also rapidly increased.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,550
So in 1950s, we have so many new movie theaters and so many new films,

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,720
especially cheap films, in Tokyo or other cities in Japan,

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:58,610
we saw the locations of these movie theaters in the city in the 1950s.

13
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:04,430
But we also discussed about the correspondence

14
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,430
between these locations of movie theaters

15
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:15,380
and the locations of Kamishibai performance and also street corner TV.

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,070
There was a kind of a similarity and a correspondence between movie theaters

17
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,640
and the Kamishibai performances and the street corner TV

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,210
in the culture of postwar Tokyo, especially in the 1950s.

19
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,880
These similarities and correspondences are

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,780
based on the working class culture in those days,

21
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,910
because many movie theaters and street corner TV,

22
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,390
and especially Kamishibai was located especially

23
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,440
in the east side of Tokyo City.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,340
So there's a kind of relationship between urban visuality in the 1950s

25
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,280
and the culture of working class people in Japan.

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,920


27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,050
Many of the working class people often go to the cheap movie

28
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:16,760
theater on the weekend, and they also gathered around the street corner TV.

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,800
And kids and their family, eager to go to the-- eager to watch, or they

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,610
are very keen to watch the Kamishibai performance on the street corner.

31
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:40,880
So all of this process was a part of working class culture in the 1950s.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,250
But this kind of culture in the public space

33
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:53,740
was decreased or declined and disappeared after the 1960s.

34
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:00,890
Because the new media, that means the television, was domestified,

35
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,470
or many people started to buy their own television

36
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,490
set within their own household.

37
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:15,800
So TV became the main and the major and most important communication media

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,310
after the 1960s.

39
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:26,900
All the culture, which was performed or enjoyed in the public space

40
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:36,950
was domestified in households after the 1960s with TV.

41
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,210
This was a process from the the 1950s to the 1960s.

42
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:49,410
But finally, in this unit, we need to think a little bit

43
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:56,650
about what happened after that late 1980s.

44
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,270
From the 1920s to the 1950s, movie theaters and Kamishibai

45
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,200
performances, and also the street corner TV,

46
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,840
were some of the major media for working class public cultures.

47
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,670
There's a strong connection between the working class

48
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,890
culture in the city and these kinds of the new media,

49
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,810
especially in the public spaces.

50
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:32,060
So after the 1940s, late 1940s in Japan, in many movie theaters

51
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,970
the working class people gathered there and enjoyed new movies, especially

52
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,390
young people, and even the women enjoyed those kinds of movies.

53
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:52,860
But after the 1960s, this kind of public working class culture declined.

54
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:00,880
And television especially was bought in many families in their living rooms

55
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,610
or kitchens.

56
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,010
And there appeared new television culture,

57
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,480
which were domesticated in each household.

58
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,250
And this process was initiated by middle class people.

59
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:27,350
But after the 1990s, this process of the domestification has, in some sense,

60
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,940
changed in other directions.

61
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:39,190
I need to explain a little bit about this process and the cities in Japan

62
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,940
after late 1980s or 1990s.

63
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:49,230
But before that, I need to explain a little bit about the expansion

64
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:56,860
of new media from the late 1970s because Sony Walkman was

65
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,730
the first step for this process, I think,

66
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:07,860
because Walkman was a kind of stereo or audio set,

67
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:17,620
which we can bring with ourself or mobile stereo for us.

68
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:26,300
So beforehand, the stereo set, or audio set, was placed in our household.

69
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,600
Plus young people tried to bring the small portable stereo

70
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,510
set that was called Walkman with their own bodies.

71
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:46,460
So this was a new breakthrough for new public culture

72
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,810
after the late 1980s or 1990s.

73
00:06:50,810 --> 00:07:01,380
And after that, Nintendo produced Gameboy in 1989.

74
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:12,930
And also, in the 1990s, before the new mobile phone, the pager expanded.

75
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,060
And also after the late 1990s, or in 2000,

76
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,150
there is a booming industry of mobile phone.

77
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,050
And today, iPhone from Apple, and iPad and iPhone,

78
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,895
was very much a booming industry.

79
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:33,780


80
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:42,700
And on the other hand, in the city, the new screen, or projection screen,

81
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,400
was increased after the 1980s.

82
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,960
The first version of this huge, big screen

83
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,780
on the wall of the building in the city was

84
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,700
started from Shinjuku ALTA building.

85
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,740
It was the 1980s.

86
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,140
And after 1983, Tokyo Disneyland was open

87
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:16,110
and there's some visual screens or big screens in a theme park.

88
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,800


89
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:31,030
And in the late 1980s, in Shibuya there appeared big screen vision on the wall.

90
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:37,140
More and more cities have their own big screen in the huge buildings,

91
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:43,370
and more and more people have their own mobile media with a small screen.

92
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,630
Visual media are no longer limited to the home.

93
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,540
The visual technologies have already gone out

94
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,210
from middle class household spaces.

95
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,110
And all of these visual media are connected

96
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,460
with each other in many cities, even beyond national borders,

97
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,450
because the disappearance of borders is one

98
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:14,800
of the chief tendencies of the 21st century.

99
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,140
It is quite interesting because, from the 1960 to the 1980s,

100
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,940
it was the age of the middle class in Japan

101
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,930
and some of the European and American countries.

102
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,400
So in that period, the television within the household

103
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,550
was the major and dominant media, individualizing technology

104
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,290
for many people.

105
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,860
But before and after that period was a little bit different,

106
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:51,890
because before the 1960s until the 1950s, it was an era of public viewing,

107
00:09:51,890 --> 00:10:00,300
or the visual culture was basically performed on the street

108
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,400
or in the movie theater, in the public spaces.

109
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:15,470
And after this kind of household, middle class period, after the 2000s,

110
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,130
we are facing a new situation of visual technology, which

111
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,850
was performed more and more on the public spaces

112
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,400
on the road in different way from the 1950s.

113
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,365
But we need to think about some kind of the similarities between the 1940s

114
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:43,340
and 1950s and after 2000, because more and more, a kind of classification

115
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:56,920
or inequality and very much-- the more and more contradiction and difficulty

116
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:06,340
of society became more evident in our society today.

117
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,440
We only talked about the visual technology,

118
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,320
so we cannot explain or discuss much more.

119
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:20,876
But we still think about how visual technology was strongly entangled

120
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:25,510
with the social situation and the social context in each field--

121
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,670
the 1950s, 1960s, and also after 2000.

122
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:37,070
We need to think about visual technology based on or embedded

123
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,120
in the social situation-- the social historical situation

124
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,652
in many different ways.

125
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:45,151
