00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:10,150
As I explained, Asakusa was the most powerful entertainment area

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,840
especially among working class people.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,280
Many movie theaters and entertainment theaters concentrated in that district.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:29,630
But after the 1920s, Ginza became very much influential especially

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,690
for and by middle class people.

6
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:43,630
Ginza and Asakusa were two major urban culture areas from before the war.

7
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,970
But the characteristics of these two areas were quite different.

8
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:57,420
Because in Asakusa, the many visitors or atmosphere of this district

9
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,050
were created especially by working class people.

10
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,650
Of course, in Asakusa, middle class people and other kinds of the people

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,910
gathered.

12
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,700
But basic atmosphere was very much related with these working class

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,980
people.

14
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:23,980
But in Ginza, Ginza is a district for middle class people.

15
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,490
And Ginza didn't have many movie theaters like Asakusa.

16
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,180
Because the cinema was regarded as the working class,

17
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,810
or lower class entertainment until 1930s.

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,000
So major part of Ginza was the department store, or cafe,

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,100
or other kind of shops, and so on.

20
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:02,180
But just before or after World War II, the cinema and theater increasingly

21
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,225
established also around Ginza district.

22
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,220


23
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,790
Especially, there are two major districts

24
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,360
where these theaters and movies concentrated.

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
One is Hibiya which is located in west side of Ginza.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:31,365
And the other is at Tsukiji which was located in east side of Ginza.

27
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:36,070
These two districts were a major two district

28
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,350
where movies and theaters were established.

29
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,320


30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:52,242
I will show this landscape of Ginza just after the war.

31
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:53,206
[MUSIC PLAYING]

32
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,652


33
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:57,062
[TRAIN HORN]

34
00:02:57,062 --> 00:04:44,430


35
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,680
From this film, you can imagine the atmosphere of Ginza

36
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,594
after the war period.

37
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:57,600
As I explained, there were two major districts

38
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,660
where movie theaters and other theater were concentrated.

39
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,060
One is Tsukiji located in east of Ginza.

40
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,590
And the other is Hibiya located in west of Ginza.

41
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:22,820
In Tsukiji, many of the theaters were developed and organized by Shochiku.

42
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,560
Shochiku is one of the major cultural or entertainment companies in Japan.

43
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,980


44
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:40,390
Most of the theater there has 1,000 seats or 2,000 seats.

45
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:46,600
So those theaters were very gorgeous and large.

46
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,300
Those theater were theaters as grand palace.

47
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,090


48
00:05:53,090 --> 00:06:01,170
In Hibiya, most of the theaters were developed and organized by Toho.

49
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:10,110
Toho is the other also major cultural and entertainment company in Japan.

50
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,190
So Tokyo Takarazuka Theater and other theater

51
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,690
also have large number of seats.

52
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,660
And those theaters were also grand palace.

53
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,800


54
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:35,980
So most of the theater, in Ginza was the theaters of the huge number of seats.

55
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,340
And grand palace-like theater were very luxurious theater

56
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,670
that is quite different from other small movie theaters in working class

57
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,330
district.

58
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:54,296
The difference also can be explained from the history of Ginza.

59
00:06:54,296 --> 00:07:03,590
As I already discussed that Ginza was the first entrance gate

60
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,300
toward Western civilization from Meiji era.

61
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,500
Shimbashi Station was the south end of this district.

62
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,210
And there's connection from Shimbashi to Yokohama.

63
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:24,390
And people came to Ginza to enjoy what to feel.

64
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,180
The some kind of atmosphere over the Western civilization.

65
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:38,800
After the 1920s, Ginza was the famous district for modernity or modernism.

66
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,260
People came to Ginza to experience a modern atmosphere.

67
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,110
So the atmosphere of modernism or Western culture,

68
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:55,430
was completely embedded in this district.

69
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,750
With this kind of the cultural atmosphere,

70
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,180
most movie theaters, in Ginza, were basically became

71
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:10,900
very large, and very Western, and very, in some sense, snobbish or middle class

72
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,730
style.

73
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:22,480
So this kind of the tendency was not common among all the other movies

74
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,760
theaters bBecause many of the other movie theaters, in late 1940 or 1950,

75
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,340
was much more smaller than movie theaters in Ginza.

76
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:41,110
I'll explain the audience or spectators in those small movie

77
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,380
theaters in 1940s and 1950s.
