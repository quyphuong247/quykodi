1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,915
I have been discussing about the relationship with the movie theater

2
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:11,270
and the spectator in there.

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,920
In this process, I emphasize the importance

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,890
of working class people who eagerly or willingly to go to a movie theater

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,520
very often, but with little money.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,520


7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,980
I think there's some kinds of similarity between these kinds of movie

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,530
theater going and other kind of performers, including Kamishibai

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,590
and the street corner TV.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,090
In case of Kamishibai, I need to emphasize

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,300
that Kamishibai is a performance of a paper screen show

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,010
which started after the 1920s.

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:57,290
Of course, you can trace back to this performance in the 19th century,

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,310
the paper puppets show.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,640
But basically, the culture of Kamishibai was

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,420
started after the late 1920s, originated from the silent movie.

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,270
Around 1930, silent movie has changed to talking movies with voice and sound.

18
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,510
So some of the people, including the benshi,

19
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,540
is a narrator of the silent movie.

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,590
And some of other workers in silent movie theaters,

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:37,480
go out or drop out from the movie theaters after the 1930s.

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:46,060
And those people started to make the new performance, which

23
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:53,050
is similar with the film theater, or movie, on the street.

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,120
That was Kamishibai.

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,240
So the production and circulation system of Kamishibai

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,810
was very similar to movie theater, especially silent movie theaters.

27
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,350


28
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:16,600
Of course, the Kamishibai performer had a very small capital, or small money.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,400
But there's a kind of division of the labor,

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,130
or very similar with system or the productions

31
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,920
and circulation of the films.

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,570
And also, I can think, this is some kind of correspondence

33
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,980
between Kamishibai performance and spectator of those Kamishibai

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,240
in the geography of postwar Tokyo, or pre and postwar Tokyo.

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,170


36
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,940
I will show the performance of some Kamishibai

37
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,270
and the spectator of this paper show in postwar era.

38
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,530
Because we can imagine what Kamishibai was from this film.

39
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:17,242


40
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:18,736
[MUSIC PLAYING]

41
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:31,684


42
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,178
[CHATTER]

43
00:03:33,178 --> 00:05:13,460


44
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,730
I've discussed the dynamic relationship between film and spectator

45
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,980
in movie theaters in pre and postwar Tokyo.

46
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,330
Especially the working class people played an important role

47
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,660
in these interactions.

48
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,380
So you can see the interaction between the Kamishibai performer

49
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,940
and many small kids around him.

50
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:49,260
Kamishibai performer play that this papers show, free of charge.

51
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,090
But he sells many small sweet to small kids.

52
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,920
And small kids gather around him and enjoy to see

53
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:11,820
and listen to the narration, or story, which Kamishibai performer explains.

54
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,640
These kinds of relationship is a little bit similar with the silent movie,

55
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,500
because the role of the Kamishibai performer

56
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:28,340
is similar with benshi in silent movie.

57
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:35,960
And paper is some kind of a screen in silent movie theaters.

58
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:44,230
Visuality and orality is connected even in these small performances.

59
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,230


60
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,080
Interesting point about Kamishibai is location

61
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,740
of these Kamishibai performers.

62
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,540
Because one Kamishibai performer moves from one

63
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,420
place to the other place with his bicycle.

64
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,190
And he plays this performance in many street corners,

65
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:12,090
where many small children gather.

66
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:18,440
This is a map of the Kamishibai performance in 1935, started by Tokyo

67
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,915
metropolitan government, or social department

68
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:24,900
of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.

69
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:31,300
So you understand that basically, many of the Kamishibai

70
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,920
performers were concentrated in the east side

71
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,820
of Tokyo city, specially east north side.

72
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:48,540
And maybe you can remember the location of the cheap movie theater

73
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,910
corresponded with this kind of geography, or locations.

74
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,720


75
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,170
Also, the cheap movie theaters, and the Kamishibai

76
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:06,160
performers were concentrated in east side, especially east north

77
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:14,120
side of this city, where many cheap workers or laboring class people,

78
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,885
or relatively lower class people were concentrated.

79
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:20,460


80
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,640
Maybe I can say that the silent movie and the cheap movie theaters, and also

81
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:34,860
Kamishibai theater, were the very important entertainment,

82
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,000
popular entertainment, among these working class

83
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,083
people and kids, or children, of their families.

84
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:43,583
