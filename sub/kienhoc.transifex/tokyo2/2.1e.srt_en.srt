1
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:07,700
The culture and pattern of lower class people district

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,370
has not changed a lot, even after the war.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,980
This is the image of Minamisenju area in 1930.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,160
This area was already famous for poor people's district in prewar period.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,670
We are going to see the documentary film of the almost close area in Sanya

6
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,650
District in 1959.

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:41,590
But two images, or image of this district, in 1930 and 1959

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,850
were not so different with each other.

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,010
Maybe we can understand a kind of the continuity

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,670
from and after the war was clear in these poor districts.

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,890
So let's see the documentary film which was featured

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,310
in 1959 by Tokyo Metropolitan Government about the lower district in Sanya.

13
00:01:08,310 --> 00:02:45,660


14
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,820
As we saw, there's a continuity from prewar

15
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,165
and postwar area in terms of the urban poor district.

16
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:56,710


17
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:02,390
We can imagine the culture and everyday life in these areas

18
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:07,060
was not so much different or changed a lot, for example,

19
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,410
in the 1930s and 1950s.

20
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:18,100
The poor people stayed there and liveed there in a very similar way.

21
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,260
But the location of these districts have changed a lot.

22
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,470
This is a map of these poor districts in the 20th century.

23
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:39,500
So the black area was a concentrated area until the early 20th century.

24
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,190
But this area of poor people moved out from south to north,

25
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,755
and again north beyond the river.

26
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:52,320


27
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:01,710
So the poor district dispersed or expanded and divided

28
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,660
in the prewar and postwar era.

29
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:11,580
So the area of poor people are not so much concentrated in one place,

30
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:19,299
but much more dispersed and widely spread

31
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:29,920
around the northeast area of Tokyo around the Sumida and Arakawa River

32
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,550
area in the north.

33
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,450


34
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:41,200
But on the other hand, the area around the Ueno Station

35
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,220
had a different face after the war.

36
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,590
This is the number of the homeless people in postwar Tokyo.

37
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,300
So we can understand the number of the homeless people expanded

38
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,860
in the late 1940s because of poverty, and because

39
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,040
of the burnout and crash of this city.

40
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,990
Many people became homeless in those days.

41
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:15,160
Also, it's amazing to understand that so many percentage of these homeless

42
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,870
were female.

43
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:24,080
And the number of these homeless people decreased after the middle of 1950s.

44
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,300
But until 1950, the number of the homeless people was not small.

45
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,640
And also amazing data is this, because this data shows

46
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,930
the distribution of homeless people in Tokyo.

47
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,820
So these homeless people, or poor people, concentrated in the area

48
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,570
around Ueno Station.

49
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,490
Some of the people became like this because he's

50
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,310
looking for something in the garbage box.

51
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:05,760
And some people continuously stayed in underground slope in this station.

52
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,290
These isolated people who were concentrated in Ueno Station

53
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,600
after the war because they lost their own houses in Tokyo

54
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,840
was a little bit different from those people

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,080
who continuously stayed in poor district from before the war.

56
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,900
I already explained about those districts which

57
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,500
were dispersed in the northeast area in Tokyo,

58
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,560
especially alongside with the Arakawa and the Sumida River on the map.

59
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,520
So those people who stayed, or who lived, in the poor district

60
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,020
was continuously lived in those districts.

61
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,570
But people who gathered around Ueno Station

62
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,430
were more tentatively living in Ueno Station,

63
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:57,780
and tentatively looked for the way to survive.

64
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,445


65
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:04,220
And these people were a little bit different

66
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:11,282
from those people who lived continuously in the poor district in the Arakawa

67
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:11,990
and Sumida River.

68
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,435


69
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:25,940
But we can see more culture, more atmosphere, from this documentary film,

70
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,890
because in order to understand the atmosphere around Ueno Station,

71
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:37,110
we are going to see one documentary film featured

72
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,745
in the series of the Real Faces of Japan.

73
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:43,490
Real Faces of Japan was the title of the series which

74
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:50,630
NHK broadcast as their first documentary program series in the 1950s.

75
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,990
In this series, Ueno and other areas in Japan

76
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:02,390
were portrayed from the viewpoint of the lower classes and abnormal people.

77
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,833
This series features lives of people living

78
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:11,760
in the outskirts of the metropolitan area,

79
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,670
and portraying them in a condescending way, very much.

80
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,730
Even though the way is very condescending,

81
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,600
but we also can understand an image very vividly

82
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,230
about the people who are living around the Ueno,

83
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,600
and around the periphery of Tokyo, and around the Ueno Station.

84
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,450
So let's look at the program.

85
00:08:38,450 --> 00:12:08,703
