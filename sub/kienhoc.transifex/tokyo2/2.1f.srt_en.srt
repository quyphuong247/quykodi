1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,420
After the war, there were a huge number of the people--

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,080
I selected the people who lost their houses in Tokyo, and together,

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,040
around Ueno station.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,020
But not only those kind of people, but also

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:23,370
the great number of street children who moved around Ueno and other stations

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,790
in Tokyo, after the war.

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,910
This graph shows the number-- the great numbers of street children

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,890
were teenagers.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,660


10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,680
And those teenagers were the objects of the investigation by police

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:50,480
and administration, and other kinds of gazes by the society in those days.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,810
The next film explain how these street children or other young people

13
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:04,140
were in investigated by the society in 1950s and 1960s,

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,400
in postwar era in Tokyo.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:02:59,380


16
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:06,230
As we saw in this film, in 1960, or in the 1950s and 60s, the young people,

17
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,950
teenagers, who came to Tokyo alone, were the object of investigation

18
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,050
by the society.

19
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,480
This is so many people who came to Tokyo, who,

20
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,330
who went out from their own houses, and who came to Tokyo.

21
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,112
And they tried to start new life in Tokyo.

22
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:34,640
But all the people, so many of the people among them,

23
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,870
were the object of investigation in this society.

24
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,830
They were labeled or they were objectified.

25
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:48,890
Or they were investigated and observed in many different ways.

26
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:56,990
So there's a kind of the interaction and clash between these kinds of gazes

27
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:07,530
or a power of observation, and their own identity process or their challenge

28
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,060
to change their own life.

29
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,900
One of the very notorious clash between these observation or investigation,

30
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,710
and the challenge to build a new life was the case of Norio Nagayama.

31
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,500
Norio Nagayama was famous for his murder in late 1960s,

32
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,540
because he killed some people in Tokyo and other cities,

33
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,436
when he was teenagers.

34
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:37,080


35
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,910
But he was born in 1949, in a very small north town in Hokkaido.

36
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,310
And after that, he was grown up in Aomori.

37
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,240
So in very poor-- very, very poor family.

38
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,020
And in 1965, he went out from his own family,

39
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:15,840
and he came to Tokyo as-- by group, uh-- he came to Tokyo in 1965.

40
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,100
And after that, again, again, he tried to build himself

41
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,470
as new career, or a new identity in this city.

42
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,210
He tried to get again, again-- he tried to get his new identity in this city.

43
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:40,730
And first, he started to work in very famous fruit store in Shibuya.

44
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,120
And after that, he tried to move away or he

45
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,480
tried to go abroad secretly, or illegally.

46
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,800
But he failed.

47
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,240
And after that, he tried to be the high school students,

48
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,510
and he tried to work or study hard.

49
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,550
But he could not graduate high school.

50
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,910
And after that, he tried to be a member of the Self-Defense Force.

51
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,230
But he was failed to be.

52
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:20,750
So again and again, he want to set up his new career and new identity.

53
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,700
But he failed again and again.

54
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,500
One of the reasons why he failed continuously

55
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:35,200
was, he had some kind of obsession that he was scrutinized, or observed,

56
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,240
and labeled by society.

57
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,660
He has strong feeling of the stigma.

58
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,030
And he can not escape from stigmatized identity.

59
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,021
Again and again, he has a feeling of being,

60
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:58,325
being observed and revered by the society.

61
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,830


62
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,610
And he tried to run away from his own negative

63
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,560
the identity, or identity of a deviant.

64
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,930
But he failed.

65
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:19,770
And finally, he himself, played that role of deviant.

66
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,560
The role of murder.

67
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,430
And he killed some people in this city.

68
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,670
And of course, he was arrested.

69
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:43,170
And he was labeled as a very, very, a very bad and very, very awful murderer.

70
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,530
Because he killed some people continuously.

71
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:54,570
And so he became the, he became the very notorious, serious killer or murderer.

72
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,740
So his case is one case of the young people,

73
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:07,140
or young poor people who moved to Tokyo, in postwar era-- who

74
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,250
moved to Tokyo with no money.

75
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,890
And who moved to Tokyo alone.

76
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:19,070
And they have-- they havd the feeling of scrutinize or of the labeled

77
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,080
and stigmatized.

78
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,340
So that Ueno or Shinjuku, there's some area-- area

79
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,669
where this kind of the young people, who have the feeling of the stigma,

80
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,100
gathered.

81
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:41,030
So one of the important, uh-- important element, in postwar Tokyo

82
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,150
was emerged from these kinds of the relationship,

83
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,390
between countryside and city.

84
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:57,110
Many of the lone or isolate people moved to, or came to Tokyo.

85
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:04,310
And they tried to escape from their original, previous identity.

86
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,480
And they tried to create a new identity in this city.

87
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,100
This kind of the dynamics between city and the identity formation

88
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:24,320
was performed in some of the special areas, like Ueno or Shinjuku,

89
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:33,163
or the other kind of area of these-- or on the fringe of the city.

90
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:40,320
Those area was once called zones of transition in Chicago school.

91
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,990
So similar thing already happened in Chicago or London,

92
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,390
or other cities in the world.

93
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,750
This is a typical process of urbanization.

94
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,560
And these typical a process of urbanization

95
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,470
also occurred in postwar Tokyo.

96
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,560
We can understand the process, especially in Shinjuku and Ueno

97
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,010
and some of the other area, like Asakusa and those area.

98
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:13,570
And we can-- we can find that many cases of these kind of performance

99
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,970
in those areas.
