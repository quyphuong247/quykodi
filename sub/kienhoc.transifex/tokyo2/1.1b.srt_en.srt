1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,200
I discussed the city as a place of concentration.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,180
Concentration of population, economy, and culture.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,170
But as I already discussed, these three elements of concentration

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:24,720
are connected and contradicted, and in some cases clash with each other.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,260
So all the definitions of "city" and "urbanism"

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,540
need to clarify the relationship between these three elements of concentration

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,010
in some ways.

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,870
Traditionally, the Chicago School of urban sociology

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,180
try to define the city as the concentration

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,460
of the heterogeneous population.

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,530
And they did many interesting researches and ethnographies and surveys

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,790
in Chicago from 1910s to '20s and '30s.

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:03,200
And they tried to find out some kind of theoretical relationship

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:11,340
between these population concentration and particular style of cultures,

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,570
especially urban way of life.

16
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:23,490
This discussion by Chicago School was criticized after 1940s or 1950s,

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:32,620
especially those criticism said that the relationship between the population

18
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:40,610
concentration and the particular style of culture are not clear in any way.

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,960
And urban studies after 1970s more focused

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,830
on the relationship between culture and the economy.

21
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:56,330
In other way, they tried to define the urbanism and the city

22
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,070
more on collective consumption of particular lifestyle.

23
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:06,700
And they tried to locate these production culture

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:21,720
style in some economic system or contemporary formation of capitalism

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,810
has this decisive role to produce this cultural form.

26
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,840
Because until the 1970s, the consumerism or consumer society

27
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,330
was already saturated in our society.

28
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,060
So the relationship between the urban culture

29
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,450
and huge capitalist economic system became more and more important.

30
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:53,940
But from my perspective, I think the concentration element is still

31
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,380
important.

32
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,620
I want to insist on some kind of the population

33
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:07,450
or other kind of the culture and economic concentration in the city.

34
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,160
From this perspective, I want to define the city

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,410
as the concentration of media and public spaces.

36
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,400


37
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,890
The difference between I and the Chicago School

38
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,010
is they tried to define the city as a population concentration.

39
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,290
But I want to define the city as concentration

40
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,895
of media and public spaces.

41
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:39,100
Henri Lefebvre, the Chicago sociologist, tried

42
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,310
to define the city as the social formation of the spaces.

43
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,050
Or he tried to consider about the social production of spaces in the city.

44
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:59,130
I highly appreciate his challenge to the analysis of the city,

45
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,030
focusing on the materiality of spaces.

46
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,530
But I also include the media, including the telephone, television,

47
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,790
movie theater, and others kinds of media within this process.

48
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:22,540
So there is a kind of the entanglement or two different elements of the space

49
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,350
and media are entangled with each other in the process

50
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,830
of production of culture.

51
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,310
So I want to include the media element and the space element

52
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,330
to define the city as a space of a concentration.

53
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:49,590
In terms of the public spaces, I want to include many concrete examples.

54
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:55,010
Market, theater, library, museum, cafe, department store,

55
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,070
and the amusement park.

56
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,030
All of these cultural spaces include so many different kinds

57
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,790
of people who concentrate in these spaces.

58
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,130
And people who concentrate in these spaces interact

59
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,640
and communicate in many different kind of way.

60
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,090
But at the same time, especially after the 20th century,

61
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:26,280
more and more many different kinds of media permit in the city.

62
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:35,120
And these media can make it possible to communicate

63
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,040
beyond the physical border of the spaces.

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,570
Telephone, television, movie, radio, and Internet.

65
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:51,300
All of these media systems are entangled with spacial system.

66
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,750
And these kinds of entanglement between spacial system and media system

67
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,110
is very important to think about our formation of bodies and interaction

68
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,220
in the city.

69
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,390
On the other hand, I want to explain about urban culture, including

70
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,670
culture of modernism, culture of Americanism,

71
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:21,150
and labor class culture, youth culture, and immigrant culture, and so on.

72
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,830
These all different kinds of cultures are concentrated

73
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:32,050
or exist, emerge and develop in many different way in the city.

74
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,351
So my focus is the relationship between these kind

75
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:40,170
of the concentration of media and spaces,

76
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,750
and also cultural home in the city.

77
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,680
I will explain some of the example of these relationships.

78
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,420
Can you remember, because we already watched these woodblock print pictures.

79
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,280
This picture shows the Ginza brick district in 1870s.

80
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,530
There is a red brick district, and this district

81
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:12,410
was very different from previous Japanese buildings

82
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,900
and houses, which is made of wood.

83
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,330
But this is made of red brick.

84
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,150
So the image of this district was very western and modern.

85
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,520
But at the same time, at the end of this district,

86
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,080
you can see locomotive train connected to Yokohama International Port.

87
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,740
So this locomotive train moved from Shimbashi station to Yokohama station.

88
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,000
Over there, you also can see the Yokohama Port and ships

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,120
from Western world.

90
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,970
So this picture explains about the image of the people on Ginza.

91
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:58,300
For the people, Ginza was a gate or a window for western civilization.

92
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,320
In this sense, architectural form in the city--

93
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,400
in this case, red brick district-- and some kind of the imagination

94
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:16,390
towards the future or towards the west are combined with each other.

95
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:24,340
After the 20th century, more and more, media, information media,

96
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,750
penetrate in the city.

97
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,210
So until that late 19th century, architectural form

98
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:38,539
was most important element to organize the formation of body in the city.

99
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:44,730
But after the 20th century, especially after 1920s and '30s--

100
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,120
for example, photograph, film, radio, television,

101
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,780
and the many other different kinds of the media technology

102
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:00,600
are penetrated in the city.

103
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:08,200
For example, photograph makes it possible to reproduce our images.

104
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,720
And film makes it possible to reproduce movements.

105
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,790
And the radio makes it possible to reproduce voices.

106
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:22,570
And television makes it possible to reproduce our everyday life.

107
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:30,590
So all of these media make it possible to reproduce culture itself.

108
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,700
So relationship between the spacial formation

109
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:40,600
of a city and location of these media are very much

110
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:49,190
important to understand how the culture are immersed and organized in the city.

111
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:56,040
Book shop, library, photo studio, music cafe, movie theater, TV station,

112
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,980
and Karaoke, and also comic cafe.

113
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,960
All of these kinds of the media spaces are located in some way in the city.

114
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,550
So about the post-war Tokyo, I'm going to discuss

115
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,440
about the most important media space among these.

116
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,070
That is, movie theater.
