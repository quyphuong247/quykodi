1
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:09,370
Tokyo is a city that experienced very rapid population increase after World

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:16,795
War I. This is a graph, which shows that population of Tokyo-- increase

3
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:18,800
of the population of Tokyo.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,440
So you can understand, especially after 1910, that population in Tokyo

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,090
increased very rapidly.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,920
Of course, during the 1940s, the population

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,250
decreased because of the war.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,050
But again, after the 1950s and 1960s, population increased.

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,540
So from 1910s to 1960s, the population in Tokyo

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:55,760
continuously increased alongside with Japanese industrialization.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,000
Tokyo was the center of this industrialization process.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,430
And until early 1900, especially in the Meiji era in 19th century,

13
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:17,420
most of the major area where the poor people concentrated was limited.

14
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:28,530
There were three major districts, which were very, very known in those days.

15
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,080
One is Shitayamanencho.

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,440
The second one is Yotsuyamegahashi.

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,270
And the third one is Shibashinamicho.

18
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,660
So Manencho and Samegahashi and Shinamicho

19
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:53,340
were called as three major large slums in Tokyo.

20
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,000
And all of these slum area or poor district

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,600
was close to the major stations, or of urban core, which I already mentioned.

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,120
Shitayamanencho was close to Ueno Station.

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,990
And Yotsuyamegahashi was close to Shinjuku.

24
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,150
And Shibashinamicho is close to Shinagawa Station.

25
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:32,320
So these three areas expand along with the industrialization of Tokyo city.

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,100


27
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:44,430
And in the late 19th century, especially 1880s and '90s, some of the journalists

28
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,920
focused on these districts.

29
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,750
The people's living and behavior in this poor district.

30
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,930
The most famous and the representative among these observation

31
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,820
was written by Iwagoro Matsubara.

32
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,200
His book was titled as The Darkest Tokyo.

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,890
Iwagoro Matsubara was a novelist, and he changed to journalist,

34
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:16,580
and he wrote an article in Kokumin Shimbun, Kokumin Newspaper.

35
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,615
And Darkest Tokyo is a report from this dark area,

36
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:28,770
or this slum area, was article, which appeared in this newspaper,

37
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:36,280
was concrete description about the people's behavior in this district.

38
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,570
You can understand the image of this book from the title of each chapter.

39
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,220
Here, the Chapter One was "The Night View of the Slum."

40
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,690
And Chapter Two is "Cheap Lodging Houses," and "Homeless,"

41
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,940
"Inside Houses," "Trades," "Daily Employment," and "Leftover Rice,"

42
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,920
"Food," "Gang," and "Shinami-District," and "Hunger and Freezing,"

43
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,490
and "Accommodation Bill," and so on.

44
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,220
So all the chapters are very much concrete and descriptive

45
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,630
and journalistic.

46
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,420
So attractiveness, because of attractiveness of this book,

47
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,660
his book became very popular.

48
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:31,540
And there's a booming industry of writing about those poor districts

49
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,460
and behavior by poor people.

50
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,340
But there was another direction.

51
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,700
among these observations in poor district,

52
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:47,990
which was represented by Gennosuke Yokoyama's book titled, The Lower

53
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,320
Society in Japan.

54
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,220
Gennosuke Yokoyama is also a journalist in newspaper,

55
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,570
and he wrote article about these poor districts,

56
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,830
but his way of writing is a little bit different from Iwagoro Matsubara's.

57
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:13,500
Because you can see some of the titles in his book like this--

58
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,790
"The Condition of Poor in Tokyo," and "Society of Craftsmen,"

59
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,220
and "Textile Factories in Kiryu-Ashikaga Area," and so on.

60
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,480
So each title of the chapter was very abstract and general,

61
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,010
because he wanted to describe the condition of poor people

62
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:38,200
more, in some cases, social scientific way or more objective way.

63
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,390


64
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:48,410
After his book, there appeared many social surveys

65
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:59,520
done by government and other people who do the-- many other social surveys were

66
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,250
done by government and social scientists.

67
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:11,060
Ministry of Interior organized the survey on urban poor

68
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:18,660
in 1911, 1912, and 1921.

69
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,490
They focused on poor district in Asakusa, Shitaya, and Fukagawa,

70
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:33,050
and Honjo, so northeast area of Tokyo and the living condition of the people.

71
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,420
In Taisho era, Iwasaburo Takano, Yasunosuke Gonda

72
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,940
and some of the other sociologists and social scientists

73
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,300
operated the survey, like the Tsukishima Survey and Asakusa

74
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,340
Survey in which they appropriated Charles Booth's methodology

75
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,810
of social map and sociological monograph.

76
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,670


77
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:07,760
After 1919, because in 1918, the Civic Disturbance, titled "Rice Riot"

78
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,730
occurred, and this disturbance was initiated

79
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,840
by many miscellaneous people or poor people in urban areas.

80
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,280
So the administration of government became

81
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,010
to have more strong attention toward these poor people in city.

82
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,730
And Osaka City Government and Tokyo City Government,

83
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,100
established the Department of Social Affairs almost at the same time,

84
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:41,110
and in Osaka, after 1919, 260 volumes of survey reports

85
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,500
were published in Tokyo city after 1919.

86
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,590
More than 300 social surveys about the urban poor people

87
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,080
was done by government and researchers.

88
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,800
So the poor district and poor people became more and more

89
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:04,910
surveyed and researched and investigated by the government.

90
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,360
One of the most important reasons why such kind of the survey was expanded

91
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:18,570
was districts was much more dispersed and increased after the World War I.

92
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,900
Before that, in Tokyo, as I explained, there are three major slums.

93
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,760
But after the 20th century, this kind of a poor district

94
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:37,950
dispersed or expanded toward some of the other areas.

95
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,400
So the investigation or report from these three major slums

96
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,950
was not enough to understand urban poor people.

97
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,560
More wide-ranging analyses and survey came

98
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,890
to necessary to understand the poor people in Tokyo city.

99
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,480
Under this pressure, the Tokyo city government and social researchers

100
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,290
organized many interesting surveys after the 1920s.

101
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,270
Some of the surveys was titled as "Injury or Illness of Day Workers,"

102
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,380
"Homeless and Prostitutes in Tokyo," "Day Workers in Tokyo,"

103
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,170
"Diary of Day Workers," "Homeless and Beggars with Children,"

104
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,450
"Teenage Casual Labors," "Korean Workers in Tokyo,"

105
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,210
"Homeless around Asakusa Park," and "Condition of the Construction

106
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:38,300
Workers," "Rag-picker," "House Servants in Tokyo," "Boat Dwelling People,"

107
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,590
so many different kinds of the surveys on these small,

108
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:49,160
poor people were done by Tokyo city government.

109
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,960
Yasoo Kusama is one of the representative researchers

110
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,630
in these researches.

111
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,800
He had been journalist in newspaper, but he changed his job

112
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,730
to social researcher, and he organized, or he

113
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:14,300
operated many researches focused on the homeless or prostitute in Tokyo City

114
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,440
in the 1930s.

115
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,420
Let me summarize all these processes, because I

116
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:29,440
started to explain about social survey in London in the late 19th century.

117
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,490
I mentioned about the report by Henry Mayhew and also Charles Booth.

118
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,520
Some of the methodology done by Charles Booth

119
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,830
was influential toward the Iwasaburo Takano and Yasunosuke Gonda's surveys

120
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,780
on the poor people in Tsukishima and Asakusa.

121
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,770
Also, in the 1920s and '30s, Chicago school of sociology

122
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,190
developed many interesting methods and surveys in Chicago.

123
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:07,090
And their work was so much influential to Tokyo city government and other city

124
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,760
government, or researchers in them.

125
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,790
So the social researchers in Tokyo city, they

126
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,700
know very well about what is going on in Chicago

127
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,560
and other cities-- European and American cities--

128
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,310
and among the social researchers.

129
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:31,020
After the 1920s, the society was becoming more and more globalized,

130
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,090
and researchers, social researchers in poor districts,

131
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,130
knew about what was happening and what was researched,

132
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:47,650
what was being researched in many other cities in European and American cities.

133
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:57,180
So some of the sociologists were trying to do the similar things in Tokyo.

134
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,450
So the relationship between the London, Chicago, and Tokyo

135
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,800
was closely related with, not only because of the population expansion,

136
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,300
but also because of the methodology and survey, which

137
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,200
was done by major researchers in these cities.
