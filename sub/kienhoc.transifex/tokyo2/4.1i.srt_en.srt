1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,520
This is our last unit.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,550
Before ending this course, let me explain about the concept of postwar.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,140
Postwar is a very common and popular word in Japan.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,170
Throughout the late 20th century, people often

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,960
use this word in many different ways.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,830
Generally, or in conventional view, postwar

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:38,290
means the era after the end of military mobilization-- so after the end of war,

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,790
or after the defeat, American occupation period started.

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:50,910
In 1952, it ended, and postwar era started.

10
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,710
And postwar era was taken over by rapid economic growth in the 1960s.

11
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,850
This is very general, or conventional, view.

12
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:09,580
But I think there are some different perspectives about postwar.

13
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:17,150
In Japan, people do not so often use the word Cold War,

14
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,700
but there is some kind of correspondence between postwar in Japan and Cold War

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,520
regimes in global sense.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:39,050
Cold War started after the late 1940s, and it continued until the late 1980s.

17
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:46,350
And this Cold War era almost corresponded with postwar era in Japan.

18
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:54,630
So in this alternative perspective, postwar in Japan

19
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,450
is corresponded with Cold War in the war.

20
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,680
So the definition of postwar may be different between Japan

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,300
and the rest of the world.

22
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:18,020
But still, we have some questions-- when postwar started and when postwar ended.

23
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:26,800
In terms of a starting point, in Japan, we usually

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:36,500
think postwar started from 1945, or from 1952, or something else.

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,550
But anyway, postwar, usually, we think started

26
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,670
from the late 1940s and early 1950s.

27
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,140
But in Okinawa, for example, American occupation

28
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,430
continued until the early 1970s.

29
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:03,590
And in Taiwan and South Korea, Korean War continued in the early 1950s,

30
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:11,020
and dictatorship continued until the middle or end of 1970s.

31
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,000
And in China, political and cultural revolution

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,380
continued until the middle of 1970s.

33
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,330
And in Vietnam, Vietnam War continued until the middle of 1970s.

34
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:35,790
So all around Asia, it was hot war era until the early 1970s.

35
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,970
The postwar could only start from the late 1970s.

36
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:50,870
On the other hand, we also can ask, when did the postwar end?

37
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:57,740
Some of the people maintained that postwar ended at the end of the 1950s

38
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,405
because after that, rapid economic growth started.

39
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:04,540


40
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:11,580
But some of the other people emphasized that the postwar could only

41
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:19,390
end around the 1970s because the concept of postwar

42
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,290
includes the concept of rapid economic growth.

43
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,920
So if you include the rapid economic growth in postwar,

44
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:36,010
you need to include the 1960 as the postwar era.

45
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,000
But there's some other people who also maintained

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,700
that the postwar only end the late 1980s or around 1990s because postwar

47
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,060
is connected with Cold War.

48
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,550
So Cold War ended in 1989 or early 1990s.

49
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,710
So basically, postwar regime in Japan continued until the late--

50
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,360
until the late 1980s.

51
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,465
But there are some other people who say postwar still continues.

52
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:18,630


53
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,830
So these are many different kinds of views about postwar, even in Japan.

54
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,640


55
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:35,790
And if we expand our perspective in Asian countries,

56
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,870
the starting point, or the definition of the postwar,

57
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,600
might be quite different from Japanese definition of postwar

58
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,320
because as I explained, in South Korea and Taiwan, maybe postwar,

59
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,620
or postwar democratization, started after the late 1970s,

60
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,060
or especially in 1980s.

61
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:09,990
In China, after the 1980s or 1990s, a kind of end of revolution era

62
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,220
started, and in Vietnam too.

63
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:22,820
So basically, in other Asian countries, postwar and economic growth era

64
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:29,130
started from the late 1970s or 1980s.

65
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:35,770
So this Asian postwar era is-- in Japan, in some sense,

66
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,290
we can call post-postwar era.

67
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:48,160
It's a little bit strange title, but we can say after the late 1970s in Japan

68
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,260
can be called as post-postwar era.

69
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,280
That's a kind of different concept between Japan

70
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,740
and other Asian countries.

71
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,090


72
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,040
In postwar era, there are two different decades, or two different periods,

73
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,440
even in this quote "narrow" sense of postwar

74
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,660
because from 1945 to the early 1970s-- it

75
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:24,340
was the age of dream, Tokyo Tower, and fad of royal wedding,

76
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:32,590
and Tokyo Olympic Games-- all of these monuments and monumental events

77
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,560
mean people's dreams for future.

78
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:48,430
But on the other hand, after the 1980s, the major monumentous space or event

79
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:58,250
became accepted not as dream, but as a kind of consumable simulacre,

80
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:05,930
consumable sign or consumable some kind of symbol in the society.

81
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:12,660
For example, Tokyo Disneyland and theme parks in Tokyo or other kinds of areas,

82
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,010
like Akihabara and the cool Japan phenomenon and so on.

83
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:23,540
All of these phenomena after the 1980s explain

84
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,460
a kind of the reality or paradigm of the reality

85
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,530
has already changed and virtualized, as I already explained.

86
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,830


87
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:44,990
So all of these postwar processes can be localized or located

88
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,440
in wider or longer historical process.

89
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,400
I've been discussed about two different periods-- from 1945 to the early 1970s,

90
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,821
and after the 1970s toward 1990s-- I can say

91
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:12,700
that, every, or almost all historical processes in Japan in the 19th, 20th,

92
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,310
and 21st century can be divided every 25 years.

93
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:26,110
Maybe this is too rough and too simple definition or dividing,

94
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:33,770
but 25 years has some kinds of meaning because after 1945-- 25

95
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,920
years after 1945 is the 1970s.

96
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,020
In 1970, we have-- or in Japan, the Osaka Exposition--

97
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:52,470
international exposition took place and students' revolt was 1968.

98
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:59,420
And after-- the 25 years after 1970 was 1995,

99
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:06,400
so Hanshin-Awaji earthquake and the Aum incident was occurred in Japan.

100
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:15,640
25 years before 1970 was 1945, and 25 years before 1945

101
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,790
was 1920-- so Great Kanto earthquake occurred in 1923.

102
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:34,260
And 25 years before 1920 was 1895, so China-Japan War occurred-- 1895.

103
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:49,240
And 25 years before 1895 was 1870, so Meiji Restoration occurred in 1868.

104
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:57,350
And again, 25 years before 1870 was 1845,

105
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:04,930
so 1840 was the era of Opium War in China--

106
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,740
so European invasionism or European imperialism

107
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,610
come to East Asian countries.

108
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,320
So throughout this process from themiddle

109
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:25,500
of 19th century toward the early 21st century, every 25 years-- in every 25

110
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,630
years, the history changed in some way.

111
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:37,830
Roughly speaking, from the middle 19th century toward the end of 20th century,

112
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:45,560
on the one hand, European imperialism, or colonialism, expanded to Asia.

113
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,930
And at the same time, especially after 1895,

114
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,110
Japanese invasionism and imperialism expanded in East Asia.

115
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:05,130
Even it was defeated in 1945, some kind of the Japanese era,

116
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:13,870
or Japanese economic expansion, continued until the 1990s.

117
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:21,556
But after the 1990s, the history changed drastically

118
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:23,300
in the age of globalization.

119
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,890


120
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,840
So European imperialism, and the Japanese imperialism,

121
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,510
and Japanese economic growth, and the U.S.-Japan relationship--

122
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:43,930
all these processes are connected with the history of Tokyo in postwar era.

123
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,920
I've discussed about the history of Tokyo in postwar era,

124
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,610
but my discussion can be localized or can

125
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,860
be located in wider range of history in East Asia

126
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,846
or in history of globalization from the 19th century.

127
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:05,450


128
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,400
Let me introduce two books, which are very important, related

129
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,580
with my discussion about postwar Japan and postwar Tokyo.

130
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,740
Both books were written by the lecturers in Visualizing Japan

131
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,040
course, which is a collaborative course, in edX.

132
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,900
One is Embracing Defeat, written by John Dower.

133
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:38,400
This book got Pulitzer Prize, so this is a very famous and very influential

134
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,250
book.

135
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,340
And this book focused on the history of postwar Japan

136
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,470
in many, very much stimulating and interesting way.

137
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:55,250
And the other book is A Modern History of Japan by Andrew Gordon.

138
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:01,360
This book discuss the history of Japan very long range,

139
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:10,550
around almost 150 or 200 years, from the 19th century to 2011-- March 11

140
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,450
in 2011.

141
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,410
The big earthquake was coming, and Fukushima nuclear plant

142
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,550
was melted down on March 11, 2011.

143
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,300
So he discussed about very long history in Japan.

144
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,060
These two books, written by John Dower and Andrew Gordon,

145
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,420
was strongly related with my discussion in this course.

146
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:48,570
So please read these books, and at the same time, please discuss about some

147
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,180
of my topic in many different perspectives

148
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:59,060
after you finish learning this course.

149
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,270
So thank you very much for joining this course.

150
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,280
I'll be very happy to learn with you.

151
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:15,020
So see you in some place and some occasion for learning much more.

152
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,555
Thank you.

153
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:17,055
