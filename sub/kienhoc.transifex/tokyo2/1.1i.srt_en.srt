1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,039
In the late 1950s, television gradually moved from public space

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,360
to private space.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,430
In the first stage, many of the television

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:24,050
was placed in street corner or the front window of electric appliance shops.

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,340
But gradually, the restaurants, cafes, department stores,

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,960
and those kinds of the same public spaces

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:40,290
wanted to have new television sets within their shops and restaurants.

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,650
And after that, some of the rich people began

9
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,250
to have new television sets within their homes.

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,920
And then neighborhood want to go there and watched the television

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,250
in their neighborhoods.

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,750
And finally, every family tried to have their own television

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,680
within their living room or kitchen.

14
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,230
This graph shows the rapid diffusion of television sets

15
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,080
in many households in this country.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:26,400
The red line shows monthly disposable income in each family.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,440
So this income gradually increased from the 1950s to 1960s,

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:41,680
but the blue line shows the rate of diffusion of television in families.

19
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,610
So from the end of the 1950s to the beginning of the 1960s,

20
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:56,670
a huge amount of the people, families, tried to buy new television sets.

21
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,390
They want to have new televisions within their own households very much.

22
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:12,970
So the diffusion rate expanded in these very few years, or in very short term.

23
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,690
This change of television culture was documented or referred

24
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:27,080
in many articles or some kind of the news and other kinds of articles.

25
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,750
Some of the articles in newspapers already mentioned about the change.

26
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:42,670
This is an article that appeared in Asahi newspaper in 1955.

27
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:51,190
It said, quote, "Although the 'Age of Street Corner TV' can not easily end,

28
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,110
the peak has gone already.

29
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:00,920
Recently, cafes, restaurants are very keen to place TV inside

30
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,365
and the TV audience is now changing.

31
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:05,930


32
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,330
Beforehand, business people assumed that TV audiences on the street

33
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,230
were too poor and could not be good consumers,

34
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:23,090
but recently they have begun to believe that new TV audiences can

35
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,860
be a good market for their commodities."

36
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:40,380
So in this article, two different types of TV audience are mentioned.

37
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,950
First one, very poor working class audience on the street corner.

38
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,550
They have no money to buy TV by themselves,

39
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:57,500
but they're eager to gather to watch the street corner TV.

40
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,650
It was the middle of the 1950s.

41
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:09,330
But secondly, the new TV audience can buy new TV set within their household

42
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:15,900
and they consume TV programs in their household

43
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,399
because they have enough money to buy new TV.

44
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,980
And those kinds of audience can be a good consumer

45
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,960
for industry or companies.

46
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,075
And they can pay money or they can sponsor the commercials in TV.

47
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:35,180


48
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,380
The process in which each middle class people purchased new television set

49
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,180
within their household has its own peculiar tendency.

50
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,970
It was a part of the process of home electrification

51
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,690
that was called "Katei Denka."

52
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:01,700
And this home electrification process was structurally connected,

53
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,760
or symbolically connected with the identity construction

54
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,100
process of Japanese people in postwar era.

55
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,830


56
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:23,930
Often, some of the electronic appliances in this process, especially TV

57
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,310
and refrigerator, and washing machine was

58
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,300
packaged as "Sanshu no Jingi" in Japanese.

59
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,320


60
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,660
Originally, "Sanshu no Jingi" means three sacred treasures of the emperor.

61
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,560
That means sword, necklace, and mirror.

62
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,050
Sacred mirror, sacred sword, and sacred necklace.

63
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:03,340
And these three items legitimatize the status of emperor, that is said.

64
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,670
So these three items, or three sacred treasures,

65
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:15,680
were a national symbol until World War II ended.

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,860
But after the war, the same word was used

67
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:27,030
to mean three basic appliances for home electrification.

68
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,990


69
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:39,660
Symbolically, to buy these home electronic appliances means--

70
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,210
or in the process of the buying these electric appliance,

71
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,610
each middle class family tried to construct

72
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:57,850
their own identity of new nation, or their new identity

73
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,100
as the modernized family.

74
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,760
So when the people buy TVs, or refrigerators, or washing machines,

75
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:17,330
they a little bit construct their own new identity in the postwar era.

76
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,050
You can see this advertisement.

77
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,180


78
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,930
The typical new family image was drawn in this advertisement.

79
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,190
Father, mother, and kids.

80
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:37,300
And in their home, TV, refrigerator, and other kinds of electronic appliances

81
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,230
were placed.

82
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:46,460
And this was the ideal image of a modern household in the postwar era.

83
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:53,270
So to buy the TV set in their own home did not

84
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:59,200
only mean to access a TV program or broadcasting,

85
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,800
but also meant to construct some kind of their own postwar identity

86
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,820
as Japanese people.

87
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,080
Another very peculiar tendency of this purchasing process

88
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:21,110
was new TV, which is purchased, was seen as new family member in your home.

89
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:27,800
There are many articles and descriptions about this.

90
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,309
I quote, "In 1982 the Japan Commercial Broadcasters Association collected 454

91
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:40,000
letters to the editor about 'My Encounter with Television.' Those

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,980
letters reveal how television entered the Japanese home.

93
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,920
One woman recalled her father purchasing a used television.

94
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:59,390
She said, 'I was so happy and shouted, 'The TV's here!' She continued,

95
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:07,360
'At that time 'Today a TV will come to my home was like a powerful phrase,

96
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:15,030
and even if kids were having a fight, those words would end it just like

97
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,840
that.' So, television was not just a thing to buy,

98
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,170
it was an amazing thing to respect.

99
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,490
When the switch was flipped and it was turned on,

100
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,160
we should watch it respectfully-- this was

101
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,865
implanted in the minds of children."

102
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:39,365
Quote end.

103
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:42,500


104
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,660
In another letter to the editor, quote, "The family and neighbors

105
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,170
watching that magical box were transfixed

106
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,191
like people praying at the household shrine."

107
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:54,690
Quote end.

108
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,474


109
00:09:57,474 --> 00:10:03,110
And yet another person stated, quote, "When the television

110
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,090
arrived I moved the dresser with my mother and grandmother,

111
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,440
making a space for the TV in the corner of the tatami room.

112
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,280
Owning a television felt like a modern and upscale family lifestyle.

113
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,815
It was a truly great feeling."

114
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:22,315
Quote end.

115
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:25,120


116
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:35,700
So all of these recollection or memories explain how the Japanese household

117
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,850
accepted new television sets in their homes in the late 1950s or 1960s.

118
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,310
The television set was not only an appliance, but also

119
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:55,950
some kind of the new members with whom all the family start to live together.

120
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,330
And the family itself has changed with these new member

121
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:09,850
because this new member connected each member of the family with new worlds.

122
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:18,440
And this process has completely changed the popular culture, or urban culture,

123
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:28,330
or any kind of the cultural process in Japan throughout from 1960s and 1970s.

124
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:38,850
The urban culture on the street corner in the 1950 ended in this process.

125
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:46,940
We need to understand what would happen after this historical process.
