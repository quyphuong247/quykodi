1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,100
Trong suốt thế kỷ 20, Tokyo đã mở rộng theo rất nhiều hướng khác khác nhau.

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,360
Từ thời kì tiền chiến tranh, các khu ngoại ô mới được phát triển

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,110
và tăng về số lượng ở khu vực phía Tây và Nam thành phố

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:30,860
Sau chiến tranh, những tòa nhà cao tầng mới được xây dựng ở khu kinh doanh phía Nam

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,320
And after the 1980s, bay area, waterfront area

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,590
became the huge redevelopment area in Tokyo.

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,170


8
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:51,421
So to West or downtown South and to East, to the Tokyo Bay,

9
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:56,510
all of these directions was the process--

10
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,430
the process of the redevelopment process was

11
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,390
expanded all of these different directions.

12
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,800
And also, underground spaces were developed or redeveloped

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,740
in postwar era.

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:25,570
Vậy là Tokyo đã mở rộng trong các hướng khác nhau cả về mặt thể chất lẫn tinh thần

15
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,710
throughout postwar era.

16
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,530


17
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:37,570
But finally, there's another dimension in which the expansion of Tokyo

18
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,840
was performed.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,580
It was media sphere, or the world of our imagination.

20
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,210


21
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:58,282
In television, or in film, or in photograph, or in many other media,

22
00:01:58,282 --> 00:02:05,380
Tokyo was featured and documented and emerging

23
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:11,955
in very different way from these real redevelopment process.

24
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:15,110


25
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,185
So first, we are going to focus on TV commercial.

26
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:22,110


27
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,350
There are many very interesting and stimulating television commercials

28
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:35,290
throughout postwar era focusing on Tokyo.

29
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:44,600
Roughly speaking, the commercial, TV commercial in the 1950 and 1960s

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,780
symbolized Tokyo as the stage of modernism.

31
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,675


32
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:57,862
We will see the television commercial which focused on this dimension.

33
00:02:57,862 --> 00:03:03,600
This commercial film especially emphasized

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Tokyo as the symbolic stage on which the new modern style can

35
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,710
be expressed and realized.

36
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,258


37
00:03:16,258 --> 00:03:20,234
[MUSIC PLAYING]

38
00:03:20,234 --> 00:05:18,870


39
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,880
In the television commercials in the 1950s and 1960s,

40
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,940
Tokyo was featured as the stage of the realization of modern style.

41
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,820
Modern lifestyle was dreamy image for ordinary people.

42
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,620
And all or many television commercial featured these kinds

43
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,660
of dreamy image of modern lifestyles.

44
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,630
And Tokyo was the center and at the same time

45
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:58,920
a stage of these realization-- of these realization of modern lifestyles.

46
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,170
But after the late 1970s, there appeared very different kind

47
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:09,780
of the television commercials which no longer featured Tokyo

48
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,400
as the real stage of modernism.

49
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,000


50
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,085
These new television commercial virtualized Tokyo itself.

51
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:27,290
Now, Tokyo became a kind of the virtual stage

52
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,880
of the image of new post-modernism.

53
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,425
Or in other words, Tokyo became the stage

54
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:47,550
of the future, unrealistic futuristic stage of consumer life.

55
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,830
We are going to see two different type of television commercial

56
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:58,300
which featured Tokyo but very different way from the television

57
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,250
commercial, which we already watched.

58
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,125


59
00:07:03,125 --> 00:09:33,640
[MUSIC PLAYING]

60
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,550


61
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,680
In the first television commercial, YMO, Yellow Magic Orchestra,

62
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,760
was a very popular techno music group in those days,

63
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,110
consists of Haruomi Hosono, Yukihiro Takahashi, and Ryuichi Sakamoto.

64
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,630
All of these musicians seemed very popular and influential

65
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,970
in progressive music in the world.

66
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,490


67
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:09,805
And this commercial film, they represented very post-modernistic image

68
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:12,410
of Tokyo.

69
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,310
All the images or all the scenes of Tokyo

70
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,690
were very much fragmented and virtualized.

71
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:27,630
For example, Tokyo Tower is real tower still exists,

72
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:35,440
but in this image of this film, Tokyo Tower was already virtualized,

73
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:46,100
like something different from the physical tower, which exists in Tokyo.

74
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:55,430

Và ngay cả khi họ mặc đồ như những nhà doanh nhân, và sau họ 

75
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,390
they use the photographic image of Imperial Palace.

76
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,360
But the image is quite fictional and quite unrealistic.

77
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,250


78
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,620
So all the image of Imperial Palace or Tokyo Tower which

79
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,420
appear in this commercial are very much unrealistic.

80
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,500


81
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,710
On the other hand, second television commercial,

82
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:35,880
the scene was completely fragmented and connected.

83
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,950
The expression was quite post-modernistic.

84
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,500
On the one hand, the Western Shinjuku business

85
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,250
skyscraper, but on the other hand, the military weapon.

86
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,770


87
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:57,140
An encounter between these different items was quite fictional, unrealistic.

88
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,460


89
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:10,300
Vậy là trong tất cả các quảng cáo trên tivi những năm 1980  

90
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:17,240
Tokyo was already very much virtualized in post-modern way.

91
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:27,940
I can show the transformation of Tokyo in this sense because until the 1960s,

92
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,300
Tokyo had been the stage of modernity.

93
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:39,850
Many different kinds of modern style was performed and staged in Tokyo.

94
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,870
Especially in Ginza and some of the other places.

95
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:54,220
But after the 1980s, Tokyo itself, or many image of the spaces in the city

96
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,760
were fragmented and virtualized, especially by the effect of media.

97
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,550


98
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:12,910
Chúng ta đã nói về nhiều về Tokyo hậu chiến tranh cho đến hiện nay

99
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:20,840
Nhưng sau chiến tranh, Tokyo đã thay dổi, đặc biệt là sau những năm 80

100
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,790
from the real stage to the virtual stage.
