1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,750
In this module I've discussed about development and expansion

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,350
of media and knowledge industry in Tokyo.

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,600
One of the major characteristics of Tokyo City

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,670
might be this kind of expansion, and importance of media knowledge industry,

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,190
or concentration of these industries.

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,220
In the case of the newspaper company, 38% of all employees

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,780
were concentrated in Tokyo, and headquarters of newspaper and company

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,510
are concentrated in very narrow district in downtown Tokyo.

9
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:50,610
In case of the broadcasting company, 34% of all employees concentrated in Tokyo.

10
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,800
And also the broadcasting stations-- key stations--

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:07,210
are concentrated in also very narrow area in south downtown area of Tokyo.

12
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:14,490
And especially in case of publishing company, more than 60%--

13
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,000
67% of employee concentrated in this city.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,140
And bookshop and printing company concentrated also

15
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,460
relatively narrow area until the 1970 or '80s.

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,200
And also advertising company.

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,610
And university students have been concentrated in this city.

18
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:49,970
So Tokyo is very powerful in the sense of information industry and knowledge

19
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,640
industries.

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,940
Still today, Tokyo has a power to visualize

21
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:02,630
many different part of this society from its own perspective.

22
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:08,270
That means whole the society and event in postwar era

23
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:14,995
can be visualized basically or mainly from the Tokyo perspective.

24
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:18,480


25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,090
In 1959, the royal wedding took place.

26
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,350
And in 1964, Tokyo Olympic games took place.

27
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:35,700
And 1969, university dispute-- or student revolt-- took place.

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,100
And in 1970, Osaka EXPO took place.

29
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:48,130
All these big events and incidents were visualized by the gaze of Tokyo--

30
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,160
especially television cameras.

31
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,770
So I've been discussed about these kinds of visualization process

32
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,880
throughout postwar era.

33
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:07,850
And this visualization was strongly based on the city of Tokyo,

34
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,230
or concentrated in Tokyo.

35
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,820
At the same time, the image of Tokyo itself

36
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,610
was constructed by these different types of media.

37
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:30,100
Roughly speaking, the radio broadcasting system expanded after 1920s,

38
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:37,300
and the movie theater expanded after 1930s, and television after 1960s.

39
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,190
So all of these three different mass media

40
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:49,040
characterized or featured the image of Tokyo in different ways.

41
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,040
For example, there are so many different songs

42
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,120
of Tokyo throughout pre- and postwar Japan.

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:09,530
There are almost 800 popular songs which are titled as "Tokyo."

44
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,400
It's a huge number.

45
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,030
But on the other hand, I want to remind you

46
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,320
that Tokyo had been the city of students.

47
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,370
So many students gathered in Tokyo from Meiji area.

48
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,750
And they lived in some of different district,

49
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:34,220
including Jimbocho, Mita, Waseda, and Hongo and Ochanomizu area.

50
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,050
Those people, young people who gathered to Tokyo,

51
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,860
had their own perspective towards this city and society.

52
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:51,720
So this kind of perspective expanded after the postwar era, or after the war

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,510
ended, because the number of the students

54
00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:00,000
expanded after the late 1940s and the '50s.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,030
So the perspective from students expanded in many different ways.

56
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:15,030
In the 1950s and 1960s, student revolt emerged and expanded

57
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,725
in many city space and campuses.

58
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:20,380


59
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:28,770
But after the 1970s, this kind of the perspective from the students almost

60
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:36,020
integrated to the media system, or gaze of television and other kinds

61
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,590
of mass media.

62
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:45,970
So this integration completed until the end of 1980s.

63
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,020
So students became more and more the actors

64
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:59,240
who perform their own roles in front of media gaze, or television camera.

65
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:09,510
City has changed from the place of encounter-- or gathering of migrants

66
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:15,610
or immigrants-- to the place of visuality or stage,

67
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:23,310
where the people consume-- or people perform-- in front of television gaze.

68
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:31,590
But in the 21st century, very different type of communication media

69
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,980
are gradually expanding.

70
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,800
Of course, it is the Internet.

71
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,120
Internet communication was different from the other kind of the media

72
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,520
system, including broadcasting and the newspapers.

73
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,710
This is a map of Twitter activity in Tokyo.

74
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,580
So you can see that Twitter already became

75
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,516
one of the major fields in which people encounter and communicate.

76
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:06,140


77
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,018
There may be many other activities on the Internet,

78
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:15,160
and that can be visualized in different type of maps.

79
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,790


80
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,200
We still need to consider about the relationship

81
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:28,050
this kind of new media activity, or new media formation,

82
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:34,910
with the development or transformation of actual or physical urban spaces

83
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,700
in Tokyo.

84
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,980
I've discussed about the relationship of this kind of actual development

85
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:50,770
and media communication in many ways.

86
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,610
In the 21st century, we still need to discuss

87
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,385
about this kind of the relationship between media and actual urban space.

88
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:03,460


89
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:10,370
Some of the discussion I already did might be insightful

90
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,100
or might be helpful, I hope, to understand

91
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,380
these kinds of new relationships between the Internet

92
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:25,490
and other kinds of physical activities in Tokyo in the 21st century.
