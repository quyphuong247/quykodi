1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,270
Because of the increase of the number of the university students,

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,490
the students' movement became more and more

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,780
powerful and expressive after the war, also in Tokyo.

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,440
This is the image of the students' demonstration in 1949.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:31,100
So students were already quite expressive against the policemen

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,350
and government.

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,920
This is an image of the student demonstration in the 1950s.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:49,180
Maybe the most expanded movement of students and other people in Japan

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:56,120
was the resistance against US-Japan Security Treaty in 1960.

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,500
In that time, the huge number of the students and other kinds of people

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,060
demonstrated around the parliament and National Diet in Nagatacho.

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,090
So this is a picture of their resistance in 1960.

13
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,330
This kind of empowerment of students' movement

14
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,120
basically continued after the 1960s.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:30,090
Of course, after the US-Japan Security Treaty was concluded,

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,660
the students' movement was decreased.

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,590
But it emerged again in the late 1960s.

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:51,380
So in the end of 1960, from 1968-1969, these empowered student movement

19
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,940
exploded in many universities.

20
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,580
There are many documentaries about this explosion.

21
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:09,070
In many universities, students fought against university itself.

22
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,190
In case of the University of Tokyo or Nippon University,

23
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,470
there were some campuses which were occupied by the students' movement.

24
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,990


25
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,810
So we have many documentary films about this revolt

26
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,590
of students in the end of 1960s.

27
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,790
The next film is one of the examples produced by the Labor

28
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:41,010
Union of Iwanami Film Production.

29
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,520
So we can imagine what happened at the end of the 1960s

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,144
in university campuses.

31
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:53,112
[VOICES OF THE CROWD]

32
00:02:53,112 --> 00:04:06,510


33
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,350
In Japan, the student revolt in the universities occurred in many campuses

34
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,130
throughout the late 1960s.

35
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:23,800
In Keio University, the student revolt started in 1965 and shortly finished.

36
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:33,080
In Waseda University, it was started in 1966 and finished in the same year.

37
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,850
In Nihon University and in the University of Tokyo,

38
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:46,780
student's revolt started from 1968 and it continued almost one year.

39
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,320
So Nihon University and the University of Tokyo

40
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,110
became the major field of the university students

41
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,000
who fought against universities and the government

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,130
and other kinds of the institution regimes.

43
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,760
There are many differences between the university movement

44
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,070
in Nihon University and University of Tokyo

45
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:21,320
because the characters and career stage of these university students

46
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,350
were quite different between these two universities.

47
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:31,410
Roughly speaking, university students in Nihon University

48
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,680
fought against police and the regime on the street.

49
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,840
But the students in University of Tokyo, they

50
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,140
fought against the university and other regime within the campus.

51
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,810
It was a big difference between these two movements.

52
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:57,600
But anyway, they finished in 1969.

53
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,150
So we need to consider the situation of these student revolts

54
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:11,630
in the society of Tokyo and Japan in the late 1960s.

55
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:17,240
This is an image of the university students in 1968.

56
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:24,180
And this is also an image of the students revolt in Nihon University.

57
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,430
But we need to locate this kind of the students revolt

58
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,870
in the society of the 1960s because I already

59
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:41,230
explained until the late 1950s, Japanese society itself was still

60
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:50,770
very poor because economic growth has only occurred after the 1960s.

61
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,580
So people were still very poor.

62
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,560
But the number of students already increased.

63
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,780
But the economic situation was not so different between the students

64
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,170
and other parts of the society until 1950s.

65
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:15,170
But after the 1960s, the rapid economic growth

66
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,630
has already started in early '60s.

67
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:26,760
Japanese society held Tokyo Olympic Games and other kinds of event,

68
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,910
even including the Osaka Exposition.

69
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,960
So people became more and more rich or abundant,

70
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:45,150
and society was organized under the system of the capitalism more and more.

71
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,960
So the students who committed with the student movement in the university

72
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:59,850
campus became more and more isolated from other parts of the society

73
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,430
after the late 1960s.

74
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,990
So it is very different from the situation

75
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,430
with the students in the 1950s because the students

76
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,270
in the university continuously very active and very political and very

77
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,470
anti-regime throughout the 1950-1960s.

78
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:31,820
But the students in the late 1960s were relatively isolated

79
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,419
from other parts of the society.

80
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,370
They entered university after the entrance examination.

81
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:48,380
And they enjoy the four-year or a little bit more within the university campus.

82
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:56,980
And after that, they got job in companies or some kind of industries.

83
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:05,990
So the students in the university could enjoy a kind of freedom,

84
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,130
or four-year freedom only within the campus.

85
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,900
And outside of the university campus, the society

86
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:22,035
has changed throughout the 1960s, especially in Tokyo

87
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:25,300
as I already explained.

88
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,400
Tokyo has Olympic Games.

89
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,250
Tokyo has other kind of the huge redevelopment and economy and industry

90
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,455
expanded in these ten decades.

91
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:40,020


92
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:47,100
In the 1960s, Japanese society has changed a lot.

93
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,770
So the people's atmosphere or culture and consciousness

94
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:58,840
in the end of the 1960s has already changed very much

95
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,750
from those in the late 1950s.

96
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,830
But student's movement continued to fight against establishment

97
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:13,580
throughout from the 1950s and 1960s.

98
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,580
So the attitude became a little bit isolated

99
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,700
from other parts of the societies.

100
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:30,940
It is quite difficult to communicate between the students and other parts

101
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,040
of the society in the late 1960s.

102
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,750
The television and other mass media and newspaper

103
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,340
were not so supportive to the students.

104
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:50,660
So in many ways, there are so much isolated from the society.

105
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,440
This isolation means a kind of the very tragic ending of the student's revolt

106
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,610
in the early 1970.
