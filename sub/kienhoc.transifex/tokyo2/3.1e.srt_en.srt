1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,440
The bookstore that developed around Jimbocho area

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,455
after the middle of the Meiji era, was quite different from the bookstore

3
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:17,340
which concentrated, or which gathered around the Kyobashi and some

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,210
of the other area from Edo era.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,040
Because, in the bookstores around Jimbocho

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,370
area basically published the book in Western style,

7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,740
there were two different styles of book publishing.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,340
One is Japanese traditional style, and the other is Western style.

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,305
In Japan, throughout Edo period, the Japanese traditional style

10
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:52,550
of book publishing had developed.

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,700
So you can see in the left photo-- this is

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,700
a photo of the book titled "Kaitai Shinsho."

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,489
This book is one of the first very important medical science

14
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,270
books in Japan.

15
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,770
This book was published in the 18th century, and the style of this book

16
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,120
was the Japanese traditional style.

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,920
But the book in the right side was "Saigoku Risshihen."

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,720
And this is a book published in the early Meiji period,

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,970
and the style of this book was Western style.

20
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,150
And this Western style of the book was introduced in Japan

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,190
in the Meiji, early Meiji era.

22
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:45,710
In Jimbocho, many of the bookstores published these kind of Western books

23
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,690
because the main customer for these booksellers

24
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,160
was students, who want to know, or who want

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,830
to learn, study, the Western knowledge.

26
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:05,020
So these bookstores translated or reprinted Western books.

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,550
So Western knowledge was the most important for these publishers,

28
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,910
and the bookstores, and also students.

29
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,480
The relationship between the university area, and the bookstore area

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,710
was very evident.

31
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,090
Among these bookstores, which were established after Meiji

32
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,710
era-- one of the representative cases of the development of these bookstores

33
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,870
might be the Sanseido Bookstore.

34
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:44,370
Sanseido Bookstore was opened in 1881, just after the Meiji restoration.

35
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,750
In those days, many young people wanted to introduce

36
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,510
or wanted to study the Western knowledge.

37
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,350
So first, Sanseido and some of the other bookstores

38
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,180
started to publish reprint-versions of Western classics.

39
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,150
Because Western classics or Western books that were directly

40
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,090
imported to Japan were quite expensive, bookstores

41
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,120
tried to reprint by themselves in Japan.

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,050
And they sold these books at cheaper prices.

43
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:30,380
But they could get big money from this reprinting.

44
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,830
After that, Sanseido published the English-Japanese dictionary,

45
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:43,090
because English was the most important language for young students,

46
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,870
even before Taisho era, or even in the Meiji era.

47
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,580
So in the early or middle Meiji era, young students wanted to learn

48
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,700
or needed to read English books.

49
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:04,870
So a dictionary was quite essential for their study.

50
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,880
And Sanseido published a very useful and very high-quality

51
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
English dictionary in Japan first.

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,149
And this dictionary publishing got great success.

53
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:24,970
And after that, they started high school textbooks-- geography,

54
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,920
mathematics, history.

55
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,910
Because the students in high school were increasing in those days,

56
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,010
many high schools needed a new style of textbook

57
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,400
in the field of history and geography and mathematics

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,750
and some of the other subjects.

59
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:56,740
So again Sanseido got great success from this textbook publishing.

60
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:03,620
So after that they started the great encyclopedia project,

61
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,810
because Sanseido has a good connection with Shigenobu Okama.

62
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,850
Shigenobu Okama is one of the most important politicians

63
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,490
in Meiji government-- or in Meiji era.

64
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,560
And also, he established Waseda University.

65
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,960
So under the initiation of Shigenobu Okama,

66
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,160
this great encyclopedia project started in Sanseido.

67
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,430


68
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:42,860
The total number of the pages increased to 15,000 pages.

69
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,450
And this project included many, many important intellectual and academics

70
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,860
in Meiji era.

71
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:57,450
So these great encyclopedia project is almost national project,

72
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:03,330
national intellectual project in those days.

73
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:11,990
So it is very easy to imagine that the scale of this project

74
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,980
went beyond the financial capacity of one bookstore.

75
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:27,560
Finally, at the end of the Meiji era, Sanseido went bankrupt.

76
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,380
And they could not continue that great encyclopedia project

77
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,330
after they were bankrupt.

78
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:45,130
In early Taisho era, they re-opened the book store, and in this process,

79
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:53,190
they restarted not only book selling but also some of the other commodities.

80
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:59,080
They tried to be a kind of the Students' department store,

81
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,760
including selling a kind of swimming wear,

82
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:15,050
or hats, or other kind of cosmetics, or stationary.

83
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:21,590
All of the other commodities for students' necessity,

84
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,220
besides just selling books and magazines.

85
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,230
I will show some of the photographs, because this

86
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:35,860
is a photo of Sanseido when they opened their store in early Meiji era--

87
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,510
editing room in Sanseido.

88
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:43,990
So many editors gathered and they do the work of translation

89
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,170
and editing the books, dictionaries and encyclopedias.

90
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,080
Sanseido also has their own printing factory.

91
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,500
So the connection between printing factories and bookstores--

92
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:08,620
and book editing or publishing was integrated in one company.

93
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:15,850
This is one example, or the first volume of the great encyclopedia

94
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,390
that was published from Sanseido.

95
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,480
And the figure is Shigenobu Okama.

96
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,000
Inside the great encyclopedia, you can see

97
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,909
very beautiful and detailed descriptions of, for example,

98
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:42,610
the human body, wrestling style in Judo, and also very beautiful pictures

99
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,720
of butterflies, or other kind of plants and worms,

100
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,060
and other kinds of insects or animals.

101
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:59,160
On the other hand, in the 1930s, Sanseido

102
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:09,300
developed-- or opened and promoted to be a department store of all students.

103
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,380
So this is a section of hat selling, and they also

104
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,950
sold the flags of universities.

105
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:29,020
And they also edited and published their own magazine, titled Echo.

106
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,290
This is a magazine which was published in 1932-- very modern style.

107
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:42,440
So we can understand that the major expected readers

108
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,325
might be the young students.

109
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:46,960


110
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,830
So the publisher, or bookstores like Sanseido

111
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:59,590
tried to include not only book selling, but also publishing, and printing,

112
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:05,570
and editing the encyclopedia, and also a student department store,

113
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,945
in many different functions in the cities.

114
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:19,750
All of these functions are related with students' necessity-- or students' life

115
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:30,200
in the city especially in the district around Jimbocho in Tokyo.

116
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:37,740
So the image or cultural life in Jimbocho and Kanda areas

117
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,990
was quite different from the contemporary image of this district--

118
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,400
that young people, not only from Japan but also from China,

119
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:55,660
and Korea, or some other foreign country also concentrated in this district.

120
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,680
Some of the very important politicians and intellectuals in modern China

121
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,960
studied their knowledge in this district.

122
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,730
All of this cultural productivity was concentrated

123
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:19,120
in this area, where bookstores and publishers and universities

124
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,490
were concentrated.

125
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:31,590
Creative city already existed in early Meiji-- Taisho and Showa period

126
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,040
in this district.
