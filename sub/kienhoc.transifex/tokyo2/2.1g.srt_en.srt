1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:09,910
Until the 1970s, the large amount of the people who migrated to Tokyo

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,250
consisted of the people who came from north

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,239
Japan, the countryside of this country.

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:23,750
But after the late 1980s, the major part of the people who migrate to Tokyo

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,090
changed to foreigners.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:34,320
The foreigners, the cheap labor from South America, South Asia,

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,130
or Southeast Asian countries, came to Tokyo,

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:45,210
and they got many different jobs in this city.

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,720
So the district where the migrants from north Japan

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,990
start to live, and the district where the people from foreign countries

11
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,430
start to live in the city were different.

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:07,460
The people who migrated to Tokyo in prewar and postwar era

13
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,100
started to live in the area around Ueno and Asakusa area.

14
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:19,610
Ueno, as I explained, and Asakusa, and also some of the area in Sanya

15
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:29,200
and Northeast area in Tokyo was the area where the poor and isolated people

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,380
started to live in this city.

17
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,700
But the people who came to Tokyo after the 1980s

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,450
started to live in the district around Shinjuku and Ikebukuro,

19
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,210
especially Shinokubo and Ikebukuro district.

20
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:54,705
So the new zones of transition were located in Shinjuku, Ikebukuro

21
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:59,220
and the Shinokubo area, where many people, who

22
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:09,780
came from many different countries, migrated, and were concentrated,

23
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,175
and started to develop their own life and their own business in this city.

24
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:18,960


25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,270
So we need to move our focus from Northeast of Tokyo

26
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:31,220
to West area, or Centeral West area in this city.

27
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:37,560
Shinjuku, especially, Shinjuku was an important location in this sense,

28
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,060
again.

29
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,660


30
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:48,660
As we a little bit explained, the Kabukicho in Shinjuku was today,

31
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,510
it was very notorious, because of sexual industry,

32
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,020
and also a little bit dangerous.

33
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:04,010
But in the first place, and just after the World War ended,

34
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,300
Kabukicho was developed as an ideal cultural area for postwar era,

35
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:18,430
under the principal of postwar reconstruction of this city.

36
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:26,670
So many buildings were designed as a cultural center of a new society.

37
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:34,210
But gradually this district became more entertainment and more sexual industry,

38
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:41,920
and more drinking, and more went in a different direction.

39
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,940
One of the reasons for this development was

40
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,720
that Shinjuku and the Shinkoko Shinoko area

41
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,580
was a different geographical car basis, because this area included

42
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,200
many more miscellaneous and poor people.

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,260
And based on these poor and miscellaneous poor people,

44
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,150
this area developed their own cultural tendency.

45
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:12,420
This cultural area accepted many poor foreign people, after the 1980s.

46
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,840
So Kabukicho and the Shinoko area became more and more international

47
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,670
and transnational, in this city.

48
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:27,660
And many new introductions of culture emerged from this transnationality.

49
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,560
We are going to see some of the transnational perspective

50
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,020
or tendency in these district from NHK documentary film,

51
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:48,240
titled Shinjuku Ihojin, which was broadcast in 1988.

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,810
[MUSIC PLAYING]

53
00:04:49,810 --> 00:07:18,020


54
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,930
In this module, we've been discussing about comparisons

55
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,640
between London, Chicago, and Tokyo.

56
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:31,800
In Chicago, we focused on the research by the Chicago School of Sociology.

57
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,430
One of the very famous theories developed by them

58
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,980
was Concentric Zone Chicago model.

59
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,785
This model explained special formation of Chicago metropolis.

60
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:47,280


61
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,110
According to this model, the center of the city

62
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,470
was occupied by the Central Business District.

63
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:02,080
And around them, the second zone consisted of Commercial Zone,

64
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,840
and the third zone was the Zone of Transition.

65
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:13,300
Is this the most important zone, because this zone consists of many small shops,

66
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:20,265
and the poor people's zone, and many entertainment zone, and cultural zone,

67
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:20,940
and so on.

68
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:28,550
So the people who migrated to Chicago started to live in this zone,

69
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,049
and many new interactions between different kinds of people

70
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:36,010
were performed in this zone.

71
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:42,039
So I've been talking about basically focusing on this zone.

72
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,470
Around this zone, Working Class Zone and the Residential Zone and the Commuter

73
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,030
Zone continue.

74
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,010
So the most important zone among these different concentric zones

75
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,360
was the Zone of Transition.

76
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,640
Because in this zone, there's many different kinds of a cultural element,

77
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,660
or cultural interaction was performed.

78
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,190
Some of the urban sociologists in postwar era

79
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:16,100
tried to explain Tokyo's special formation,

80
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,670
according to the Chicago model.

81
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,420
Eichi Isomura was a famous sociologist in the 1950s and 1960s,

82
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,730
and he tried to explain the special formation of Tokyo,

83
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,090
according to the Chicago model.

84
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,880
So in Tokyo, like Chicago, there was a central business district

85
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,450
in Otemachi, or Kosumigaseti, or Tokyo special area, Morinouchi and so on.

86
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:51,680
So around this district, the commercial zone was also existing.

87
00:09:51,680 --> 00:10:00,280
And in Tokyo, the Zone of Transition exists not as concentric zones,

88
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,860
but as some kind of the area around the major station.

89
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,360
So some things similar to the Chicago Zone transition

90
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,200
will exactly exist around some of the major stations in railway system.

91
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,350
Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, Shibuya, Akaksaka, Ueno, Shinaga.

92
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,280
All of these kind of the districts were similar with Zone of Transition

93
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,150
in Chicago.

94
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:35,052
So I've been discussing about the area around Ueno, and also

95
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,790
in Shinjuku.

96
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,430
This area around Shinjuku and to Ikebukuro, or Shinokubo

97
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:53,190
became new core zone of transition after the 1980s in Tokyo.

98
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:59,590
Before prewar, or just after the war era, the area around Ueno

99
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,080
was that zone of of transition.

100
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,400
But after the 1980s, it has changed.

101
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,010
And this area moved to Shinjuku and Ikebukuro areas.

102
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:17,880
Of course, before that, as I already mentioned and discussed

103
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,280
that Shinjuku became the cultural center for the young people.

104
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,600
But even after the 1980s, Shinjuku was a zone of transition.

105
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,830
And in a sense, a kind of the contact zone

106
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,340
among different type of the people who came from abroad.

107
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,412
So we can understand from this documentary film

108
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:47,670
that in Tokyo, there's some of these kind of contact of zone,

109
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,660
or zones of transition, in some places.

110
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,690
And Shinjuku, Shinuoko, and these kinds of the Western downtown

111
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,020
center-- Western downtown area.

112
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,750
It is very important, and interesting to be investigated.
