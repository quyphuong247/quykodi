1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,280
In this course of Visualizing Postwar Tokyo,

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,840
we learned the history of postwar Tokyo from many different perspectives.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,100
Now we are approaching to the end of this course.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,770
So let me little bit explain about the concept of visualizing

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:29,230
and also concept of postwar.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,390
That is little bit academic or theoretical, but let me explain.

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,620


8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,630
In the previous modules several times I explained

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:48,830
about the history of sociological analysis on city and urbanization.

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:55,770
We discussed about Chicago School of Sociology in the 1920s and 1930s.

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,870
They tried to analyze Chicago as a sociological laboratory.

12
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:06,030
And they defined the city as a state of mind and body

13
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:15,260
of customs and traditions, and of organized attitude and sentiment.

14
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,280
So they tried to combine or integrate the relationship between the people,

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,840
population concentration and cultural style, or cultural structure.

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,200
So they used the anthropological approaches to the cities

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,800
and they did many ethnographic research on urban migrants and dwellers

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,620
in metropolitan city.

19
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,250
After the Chicago School, many sociologists and anthropologists

20
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,230
focused on the urban community, especially migrant community

21
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,080
in big metropolis.

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,290
William F. White, Hervert Gans, and Elijah Anderson,

23
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,790
all of these anthropologists and sociologists

24
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:14,590
wrote a fascinating ethnography on these villages, or on these communities.

25
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,290
But on the other hand, some of the other sociologists

26
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,170
theorized the relationship, especially visualizing relationship in the people,

27
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,770
in the city.

28
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:36,850
In case of Howard Becker, he emphasized that the deviant behavior

29
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,530
emerged or created by labeling process.

30
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:51,160
So if you're labeled as deviant you tend to be deviant from yourself.

31
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,800
But at the same time Erving Goffman, in his writing,

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,930
he also analyzed the social performances by stigmatized people.

33
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:08,110
So from Goffman's perspective, city is a kind of theater of gazing.

34
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:15,700
Gazed and gazing, or labeled and labeling.

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,419
But Chicago School focused on the city, especially related

36
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,460
to the industrialization.

37
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,090


38
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,280
After the late 19th century and especially 20th century,

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,280
the process of industrialization and immigrant movement

40
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,560
expanded in European countries and the U.S. So Chicago

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,860
was the representative metropolis which integrated, or accepted

42
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,880
the huge number of the migrants and immigrants.

43
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,150
So the research by Chicago School was strongly

44
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,950
influenced by this industrialization process.

45
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:04,500
But as I already emphasized the history of a city and history of urbanization

46
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,420
is much longer than history of industrialization.

47
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,600
So some of the historian discussed about the history

48
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,329
of the city and the urbanization before industrialization.

49
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:23,410
Henri Pirenne is representative because he discussed medieval cities.

50
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,750
Medieval cities with merchants and artisans.

51
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,070
And networks of travelers.

52
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,090
And freedom in the city.

53
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,990
All of these characteristics in Medieval cities

54
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,610
was very different from the characteristics in industrial city

55
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,480
in modern times.

56
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,650
Not only Henri Pirenne but also Lewis Mumford focused on this culture of city

57
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,110
in pre-modern times.

58
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,530
And also in the field of sociology Gideon Sjoberg

59
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,575
discussed about pre-industrial city because he criticized the Chicago

60
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:10,900
School of Sociology because Chicago School only

61
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,720
focused on the industrial city, but there

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,190
are many different type of city in the world.

63
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,340
So we already discussed about the correspondence,

64
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,980
or the kinds of similarities between pre-industrial city

65
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,440
and post-industrial city.

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,590
This similarity also can be extended towards a discussion

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,490
about the creative city.

68
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,610
Richard Florida and Charles Landry, some of the sociologists

69
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:58,840
and some of the scholar emphasized the element of tolerance in creative city.

70
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,940
So more and more in the 21st century, the metropolis or global city

71
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:15,960
has such kinds of elements of creative cities in Tokyo and some other areas.

72
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:25,820
Through these kinds of discussions, city can be defined in three different ways.

73
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,360
Firstly, city can be defined as a place of the concentration

74
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,260
of the heterogeneous population.

75
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,240
This is the definition by Chicago School.

76
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,750
But at the same time, city can be defined

77
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,190
as collective consumption, the place of collective consumption

78
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,910
and particular cultural life style.

79
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,200
Some of the critic against the Chicago School

80
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,090
emphasized this dimension of the city.

81
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:04,110
But on the other hand, I also emphasized, or again emphasize

82
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,810
the importance of concentration.

83
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,970
But concentration of media and public spaces,

84
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:20,310
or concentration of the many settings of relationship or mediation.

85
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,240
So I've been discussed about such kinds of relationship

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,160
of gazing, or visualizing relationship in Tokyo in many different ways.

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:41,850
So as a whole, we can define the city which has two different dimensions,

88
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,740
or levels of concentration.

89
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,690
On the one hand, city is a place of the concentration

90
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,910
of the people because my migrants, immigrants, and many other people

91
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,580
come to the city from countryside and foreign countries.

92
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,880
And they built up a kind of community in the city.

93
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,180
But people in the city are watching and watched in many different ways.

94
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,610
In some or other places.

95
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:21,430
So city also can be defined as a stage of self, city is a place of visuality,

96
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,100
so the relationship between these two different type,

97
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:33,939
or two different level of the definition is exactly what I've discussed.

98
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:36,510


99
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:45,330
In case of Shinjuku I discussed the clash between the view from above

100
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,240
and view from below.

101
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,180
Or the view from skyscraper and view from the students

102
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,550
who gathered in underground plaza.

103
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:05,510
So Shinjuku, there occurred a kind of clash

104
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,890
between these two different gazes.

105
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,740
But there are other kinds of structure of viewing and gazing in postwar Tokyo.

106
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,820
I also discussed about the visuality, or viewing relationship

107
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,590
around Douglas MacArthur.

108
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,390
And also I also discussed about the visual relationship

109
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,570
around the royal family.

110
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,520
In case of emperor, I several times discussed

111
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,250
about the relationship between people and emperor.

112
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,800
Before modern times, roughly speaking, the gaze from the people

113
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,700
could not reach to the emperor, but Meiji Government

114
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,940
tried to construct the direct visualizing

115
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,730
relationship between emperor and the people in this nation.

116
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,890
But after the occupation the U.S. Army brought the camera

117
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:12,170
or, visualizing machine in this society.

118
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,020
And image of visualizing can be duplicated

119
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:24,100
or reproduced massively through television and magazine after the war.

120
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,180
So these kinds of the visualizing relationship

121
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:34,850
multiplied, or expanded and reproduced, in large scale

122
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:41,490
and consumed after the 1960s and 1970s.

123
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,300
Television camera was quite important.

124
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,080
In case of Tokyo Olympic Game, Tokyo Olympic Games

125
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,370
were visualized by television camera and consumed.

126
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:58,100
More and more television camera, or gaze by television

127
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,910
saturated throughout this society.

128
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:09,005
And it's surpassed much more than the visualizing practice by the students.

129
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:11,670


130
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,810
Television camera, or gaze of television even

131
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:22,300
go beyond the national border, or city border.

132
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:29,580
So the television gaze also saturated to countryside and other region and almost

133
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,940
everywhere in this society.

134
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,780


135
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,130
All of these discussion, which was done by me,

136
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:44,200
was strongly influenced by three important theorists, or academic.

137
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,800


138
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,820
All of these three important figure are very famous and very influential

139
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,710
throughout the 20th century and 21st century.

140
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:02,210
First one is Erving Goffman, sociologist.

141
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:08,580
And he theorized the city as a performative place,

142
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,830
or a kind of theater of gazing I already explained.

143
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:19,980
Second, and maybe most important theorist is Michel Foucault.

144
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,610
And Michel Foucault theorized and discussed

145
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:31,910
the process of the production of self by the power of gazing.

146
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,850
In his writing about prison or disciplinary power

147
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,420
in contemporary society, or modern society

148
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:45,370
is quite influential in many academic field.

149
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,470
And finally third one is Marshall McLuhan.

150
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,450
Marshall McLuhan emphasized the relationship media and message,

151
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,090
and according his definition of media, we

152
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:05,660
can expand the definition of the media in many, many different fields.

153
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,440
Not only television, or a radio, or a photograph, and so on, but also

154
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,680
the space, urban space itself including museum,

155
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,780
or university can be defined as media.

156
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,610


157
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:29,560
I've been trying to integrate all of these three different perspectives

158
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,640
in Tokyo, especially postwar Tokyo.

159
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,220


160
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:43,750
So from my perspective, on the one hand city's something like prison.

161
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,320
The disciplinary power in Foucaltian sense

162
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,360
are working and operating in the city.

163
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,280
But at the same time city can be discussed

164
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,470
as a theater in Goffman's sense.

165
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,260


166
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:05,500
And this city, city is prison, and the city is theater,

167
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,230
but these cities are connected with many different type of media.

168
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:19,830
Television, movie theater, and also media event and urban space,

169
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,990
or some of the other media spaces.

170
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,660
So I will discuss about Tokyo, especially Postwar Tokyo

171
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:35,190
from these perspectives including disciplinary power

172
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:42,030
and performance by people with media and so on.

173
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:48,400
I already integrated many different type of the media, photograph, film,

174
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,110
television, and architecture.

175
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,050


176
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,395
So this is my perspective.

177
00:14:55,395 --> 00:15:00,090


178
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,090
If you're more interested in this perspective,

179
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:09,940
you can analyze not only postwar Tokyo, but also, for example,

00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:16,960
Seoul, Shanghai, Beijing, or other cities in the world

181
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,970
from similar perspective historically and sociologically.

182
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:29,920
I'm looking for such kind of discussion from your side in the next stage.
