1
00:00:03,374 --> 00:00:08,940
Who was a spectator of movie theater in postwar Tokyo?

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,420
Especially, who was a spectator of a movie

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,370
theater in industrial zone in postwar Tokyo?

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,980
But movie theaters, in places where working class people lived,

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,970
were more like nickelodeon.

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,470
Nickelodeon was a small, basic movie theater.

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:36,810
Ministry of Labor did a survey in 1953 about leisure life in labor class

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,010
families in some of the industrial zone, including Iidabashi, Kawasaki, Kamata,

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,480
and Omori.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,760
This map shows the location of these areas.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,370
So most of the area where the small factories were concentrated

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,685
was besides a river or a sea.

13
00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:59,190


14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,129
And in this area, according to this survey,

15
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,370
the married working class men had no time

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,940
to enjoy their leisure during weekdays.

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:18,650
In the weekend, the time for leisure increased very much.

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,870
Even more time than-- they had even more time

19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:30,480
than the wives of the factory laborers in large companies.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,540
So we can imagine not only middle class people, but also

21
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:42,060
small or low labor class people can enjoy the cheap movie theater

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,240
or movie going in the 1950s.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,690
In terms of the generation and gender, Eiichi Isomura,

24
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,650
the famous urban sociologist in postwar era,

25
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,870
did a survey on movie theater goer, or spectator of the movie theater

26
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,220
in postwar era.

27
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,350
And he found out that for example, some of the Shochiku's - Shochiku

28
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,080
is also the movie theater company in those days.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,850
In case of the Shochiku Movie Theaters in Shinjuku and Shibuya,

30
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:34,330
almost, or rather 80% of the spectatorw were young people from teenager

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,160
to under 30.

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,625
So most of the spectator in those day were very much young people.

33
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:46,320
As for gender, the movie theater in Shochiku

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,350
had the highest number of the female spectators.

35
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:56,860
In case of Shochiku, 46% of the spectator consists of women.

36
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,340
In case of Daiei, 38%.

37
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,670
Toho, 33%.

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,070
Toei, 32%, and so on.

39
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:12,500
But basically, from around 30% or 40% of the spectator in movie theater

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,934
were women.

41
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:16,810


42
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,690
So not only men, but also many women went to movie theater.

43
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:29,890
And they enjoyed the film very much in 1940s and 1950s.

44
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,030
From the perspective of the movie companies,

45
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:43,180
one of the key elements for the film to succeed

46
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,080
was whether they can get the female spectator or not.

47
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,950


48
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:56,840
For example, in 1957, the two film directed by Billy Wilder

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,210
was shown or released in Japan.

50
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:08,030
One film is Love in the Afternoon starring Audrey Hepburn.

51
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,520
The large amount of the female spectators in this film

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,440
got a great success.

53
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,440
The other film, The Spirit of St. Louis starring James Stewart,

54
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,450
could not get great success among female audiences.

55
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:35,800
Because the main spectator for the men can enjoy, not only movie

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,290
going but also baseball, gamble, and golf, and mahjong in those days.

57
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:50,810
But there are not so many entertainment or pleasure category for women.

58
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,470
Or in other words, reading books or going to movie theaters

59
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:03,240
was some of the major entertainment, or important leisure,

60
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,980
for these women in the 1950s.

61
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,310
One example written by Sakaguchi Ango.

62
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,500
I quote, "recently, I went to see Roman Holiday.

63
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,950
It was early morning and I had arrived at the theater

64
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,980
15 minutes before the film started.

65
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,000
There were only 10 bicycles in front of the theater,

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,140
and I assumed there might be a few spectators.

67
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,730
But as soon as I entered, I found my expectation was completely wrong.

68
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:45,480
My breath caught my throat because the theater was so crowded.

69
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,680
What's more, all were women.

70
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,990
There were a few men, but those came with women.

71
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,520
There were no single man, much less old man like me.

72
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,510
I felt like I had ended up in the wrong place."

73
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,630
Quote end.

74
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,990
So all the movie theaters in postwar era were

75
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,950
very much-- the movie theater in post war era

76
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:22,780
include the many female spectators, not only male spectators.

77
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,870
And most of the spectator was young people.

78
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,230
So you can imagine the atmosphere of these movie theaters in those days,

79
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:39,850
very active, and young, and most of the young boys and girls gathered there.

80
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:47,350
So you can imagine that some kind of these culture, movie culture, film,

81
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:54,430
movie culture was immersed in many different small movie theaters.

82
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,050
And you can also imagine the relationship

83
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,480
between the film and the spectators in those days.

84
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,150
But I'm going to explain, some kind of similar interaction

85
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:13,990
was also immersed in some different categories

86
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,620
of entertainment in postwar Tokyo in those days.
