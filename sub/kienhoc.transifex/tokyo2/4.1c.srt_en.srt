1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,200
Throughout the 1960s, Tokyo was always under construction.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,130
Many new buildings were constructed and roads were widened.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:21,190
At the same time, many rivers and canals were buried.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:28,050
And old districts and towns were demolished and gentrified.

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,180
So after the 1970s, Tokyo has transformed

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,630
to a very different city from the Tokyo until the 1950s.

7
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,140
Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964 was the defining moment

8
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,690
that marked the start of this continuing redevelopment process.

9
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,920
This is Yoyogi National Gymnasium, including

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,480
swimming pool and basketball court.

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,830
The construction was started in 1963 and finished in September 1964,

12
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,560
just one month before the Olympic Games opened.

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,120
Architecture was designed by Kenzo Tange.

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:20,750
And this architecture became landmark around Shibuya, Harajuku, and the area.

15
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,510
This is Aoyama Street, originally connected

16
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,320
between Aoyama military ground, Yoyogi military ground, and Komazawa

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,800
military ground.

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,480
But just before Tokyo Olympic Games, the road was widened

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:45,340
and many redevelopment projects were started alongside with this road.

20
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:52,860
So today, this road became the most fashionable street

21
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,840
in Tokyo and also Japan.

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,070
This road connects Akasaka, Aoyama, Harajuku, and the Shibuya area.

23
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,360
All of these areas are most fashionable area in Tokyo and Japan today.

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,110
This is Kasumigaseki Building which was constructed in 1968.

25
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:21,680
These was first skyscraper in Japan and tallest building until 1970.

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,380
This building became landmark in Kasumigaseki, Toranomon, and Nagatacho

27
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,920
area.

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,110
And this is western Shinjuku.

29
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,610
This was a huge redeveloped area in Shinjuku.

30
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:44,710
This redevelopment process was started from 1971 and finished the 1990s.

31
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,660
This area includes Keio Plaza Hotel and Sumitomo Building and Mitsui

32
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,090
Building and Nomura Building and so on.

33
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,500
All of these buildings were huge skyscrapers,

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,860
so this area became one of the major business centers in Tokyo and Japan

35
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,730
after 1980s and '90s.

36
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,620
So all of this process continued from 1960, 1970, and still today.

37
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,970
Especially after the late 1980s, Roppongi Hills

38
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,570
became one of the most impressive and powerful examples

39
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,170
of this redevelopment.

40
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,290
The redevelopment process of Roppongi Hills

41
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:36,450
continued almost 20 years, from the late 1980s to 2000.

42
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,200
Many documentary programs featured this redevelopment process.

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,940
Next film is one of the very impressive and interesting documentary

44
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,520
films broadcasted from NHK in 1974.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,110
This program was directed by Hiroshi Aida, one

46
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,570
of the famous and important TV directors in NHK,

47
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,150
and also produced by Toshiki Kudo.

48
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,810
This programs used the map of Tokyo with census and statistical data

49
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,700
to visualize the transformation of Tokyo after the 1970s.

50
00:04:14,700 --> 00:05:02,350


51
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,790
[APPLAUSE]

52
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:43,500


53
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,970
Mori Building's redevelopment project in Roppongi Hills was finished in 2003.

54
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:58,710
So after that, Roppongi Hills became the very famous landmark

55
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:04,330
in Roppongi, Akasaka, Aoyama, and all around these areas.

56
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,120
But large-scale redevelopment in Tokyo after 1980

57
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,840
was not limited to Roppongi Hills project.

58
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,740
There were some other also very large-scale redevelopment projects

59
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,565
in Tokyo.

60
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:26,760
One of the most important tendencies of these projects

61
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,250
was all of these projects was concentrated

62
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,500
in South Downtown area in Tokyo.

63
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:43,530
You can see examples of these projects in Shiodome or Marunouchi or Ebisu

64
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,320
or Shinagawa.

65
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:55,370
All of this redevelopment was done in south of Tokyo, not north.

66
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:02,010
And after the late 1980s or 1990s, these huge redevelopment

67
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,980
was moved to Waterfront area.

68
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:15,130
Waterfront area became the most massive and most huge

69
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,220
redevelopment area after the 1990s.

70
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:26,660
The program which we watched also featured the process of redevelopment

71
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,000
in Waterfront area.

72
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,390
The program was broadcasted in the early 1970s, so we can understand

73
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:43,090
or we can see the landscape before these huge redevelopments occurred

74
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,565
in Waterfront area.

75
00:07:44,565 --> 00:08:56,620


76
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,150
The huge-scale redevelopment in Waterfront area

77
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,790
is still continuing today.

78
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,150
The process started in 1989.

79
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:14,700
And in the 1990s, the Rainbow Bridge and many new transportation

80
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,090
systems and broadcasting station and new museum and other kind

81
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,550
of office building were constructed in these areas.

82
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:33,530
So nowadays, Waterfront area are very large and very huge

83
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,570
business center in Tokyo.

84
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:43,260
So all of these areas in Waterfront or South Downtown area

85
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,900
were redeveloped from 1960 and 1970 and 1980s.

86
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:56,190
But what happened in northern Tokyo, because in northern Tokyo,

87
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:02,390
in prewar period, there are many poor districts.

88
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:08,800
We already discussed the location of these urban poor people.

89
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,490
Some of the urban poor district was concentrated in Ueno and Asakusa area.

90
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,220
And these districts moved to north and east,

91
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,380
beyond Sumida River and Arakawa River.

92
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,440
So just after Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923,

93
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,420
many urban poor districts were distributed

94
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:40,040
in northern and eastern Tokyo, like this map.

95
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,740


96
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:53,020
And in war period, exactly this area were damaged by bombing

97
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,390
by American Air Force.

98
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:05,320
So all of these northern and eastern areas were burned out by bombing.

99
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,220
After the war, Hideaki Ishikawa and some of other people

100
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:18,520
tried to reconstruct especially Green Belt area, including

101
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,130
these northern and eastern areas.

102
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,280
But their project was in vain, not realized.

103
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,940


104
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,960
So roughly speaking, there are two different centers

105
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,480
in Tokyo, Downtown North and Downtown South.

106
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,900
In prewar period, especially until 1920 or '30s,

107
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,600
the center, cultural and economic center, in Tokyo

108
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,950
was basically located in north and east, in Asakusa, Ueno, Ginza.

109
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,315
And all of these areas were the center of Tokyo.

110
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:01,800


111
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,000
But these areas were damaged by war.

112
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,780
And also it is a little bit difficult to have

113
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:19,710
a huge or large-scale redevelopment in Olympic Games and after that.

114
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,990
So in postwar era, especially in the 1960 and 1970s,

115
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,340
many of the new redevelopment process occurred

116
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:37,360
in south and west areas, south and west downtown areas in Tokyo.

117
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,200
Olympic stadium and large park and TV stations and so on,

118
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,760
all of these new facilities and building was

119
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,790
concentrated in south and west downtown areas in Tokyo.

120
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,550
And after that, these facilities or these redevelopment process

121
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,560
moved to Waterfront area.

122
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,360
So such kind of geography in Tokyo was very

123
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,890
important to consider or to visualize the Tokyo after 1945.

124
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:23,050
And we need to remind us the south and west

125
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,580
and Waterfront downtown area were quite different

126
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,610
from north and east downtown area historically

127
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,190
and culturally in postwar Tokyo.
