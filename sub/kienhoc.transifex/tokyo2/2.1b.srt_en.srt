1
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:07,830
In the late 19th century, the great number of immigrants

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,570
moved from European countries and Asian countries toward the United States.

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:20,910
The number of immigrants in the U.S. expanded, especially after the 1880s.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,690
This is the number of the immigrants in the United States

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,770
from the middle of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century.

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:37,760
And you can understand how rapidly this number increased after the 1880s

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,730
until 1910.

8
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,060
Throughout these 30 or 40 years, the number of immigrants in the U.S.

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,750
expanded and changed the culture of the cities and their structure very much.

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,630
This is an image of immigrants who moved from Hamburg

11
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,960
to New York on the deck of their ship.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,900
The huge number of people were crowded, and many of the people

13
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,176
were German or Polish and so on.

14
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:13,510
In the immigration office people rushed, like this.

15
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,520
And people were waiting to immigrate into the United States

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,530
so this number of people-- huge numbers of people--

17
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,560
entered into the United States from New York or San Francisco,

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,640
and they moved around the different cities in this country.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,940
Some of the big cities expanded their population, like Chicago.

20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,700
This is the population of Chicago.

21
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,160
So after the 1880s, the number of the population in Chicago

22
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,270
increased very rapidly.

23
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:02,320
Until the early 20th century, the population was raised to almost or more

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,470
than three million so Chicago became a huge metropolis

25
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,470
in the early 20th century.

26
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:19,000
It was in this situation where the New Chicago School of Sociology emerged.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,390
This is the first generation of urban sociologists in the 20 century.

28
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,020
The leader of this school was Robert Ezra Park.

29
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,030
He maintained Chicago can be considered as a sociological

30
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,190
laboratory with its huge number of immigrants

31
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,360
and the diversity of these immigrants.

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,620
From his perspective, the city is a state of mind,

33
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,980
a body of customs and traditions, and a body

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,400
of organized attitude and peoples' sentiment.

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,570
So in order to understand this state of mind,

36
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:05,020
urban sociology can appropriate some of the important methodology

37
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:13,010
of anthropology, because they apply the anthropological methodology

38
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,840
toward urban migrants and dwellers.

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,850
I can quote from his book-- very famous book-- written in 1925,

40
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,940
but originally the article was written in 1916.

41
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:35,860
And this article was declaration of the emergence

42
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,520
of the new urban sociology in the 20 century.

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,850
Quote, "Anthropology, the science of man,

44
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,600
has been mainly concerned up to the present

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,240
with the study of primitive peoples.

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,690
But civilized man is quite as interesting an object of investigation,

47
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,500
and at the same time, his life is more open to observation and study.

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,430
Urban life and culture are more varied, subtle, and complicated,

49
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,306
but the fundamental motives are in both instances the same.

50
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:15,940
The same patient methods of observation which

51
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,779
anthropologists like Boas or Lowie have expended on the study of the life

52
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:27,380
and manners of the North America Indian might be even more fruitfully employed

53
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,800
in the investigation of the customs, beliefs, social practices,

54
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:43,270
and general conceptions of life prevalent in Little Italy on the lower

55
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,346
North Side in Chicago."

56
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,080
Quote end.

57
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,540
So in this manner, the students or graduate students

58
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:02,340
under Robert Ezra Park started to do very intensive ethnographic research

59
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,360
in downtown Chicago.

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,220
These Chicago urban ethnographies include, for example, The Hobo

61
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,920
by Nels Anderson and Ghetto by Louis Wirth and The Jack-Roller

62
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,050
by Clifford Shaw and Taxi-Dance Hall by Paul Cressey.

63
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,980
All of these books were classic masterpieces

64
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:33,590
written by early or the first generation of urban sociologists in Chicago.

65
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,160
For example, The Hobo, written by Nels Anderson,

66
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,600
was an ethnographic study about the people

67
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,610
who didn't have a home or family or a permanent residence,

68
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,470
because a hobo is a tramp wandering from one city to another city.

69
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:59,860
And those people gathered in a place called Hobohemia, and in this place,

70
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,390
many different hobo or such kind of the moving people gathered.

71
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,610
Nels Anderson started his research with his small money and stayed there.

72
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,810
And he did a participant observation with those kind of hobo people.

73
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,450
On the other hand, The Taxi-Dance Hall, written by Paul Cressey,

74
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:31,950
was an ethnography about the dance hall where the professional dancer danced

75
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:37,220
with the customer with a ticket which was

76
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,690
bought by the customer with his money.

77
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:48,250
And with each dance, the customer gave his ticket to the dancer,

78
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:56,250
and the dancer got some kind of money with this ticket.

79
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,480
So Paul Cressey observed the triangular relationship

80
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:09,340
between the customer and dancer and the manager in the dance hall.

81
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,330
In many urban ethnographies, like The Hobo, Taxi-Dance Hall,

82
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,880
and The Jack-Roller and others, the Chicago School of the Ethnographer

83
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:27,260
focused on peoples' behavior patterns in very high density areas.

84
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,890
After this research by Chicago ethnographers,

85
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,560
they tried to rewrite the conditions of the population concentrations

86
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,000
with the emergence of a particular pattern of culture.

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,210
They think the concentration of the population tended

88
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:52,730
to emerge a particular pattern of the culture, in the city especially.

89
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,610
Louis Wirth theorized this relationship in his article

90
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,370
titled "Urbanism As a Way of Life."

91
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,350
In this article, he maintained, or he discussed

92
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,475
that the huge number of the peoples' concentration

93
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:15,200
were highly dense concentration in the city tended

94
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:24,720
to create the particular patterns of the urban life called urbanism,

95
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,740
or the particular pattern of the way of life called urbanism.

96
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,250
