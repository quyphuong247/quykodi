1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,120
Tokyo has been the place where the knowledge

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,730
industry and cultural industry are so much concentrated.

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,620
In case of newspaper companies, 38% percent

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:26,020
of all employees in this industry are concentrated in Tokyo.

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:35,400
Also, in case of broadcasting stations, 34% of whole employees in this industry

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,110
are concentrated in Tokyo.

7
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,390
So broadcasting or newspaper are almost or more than 1/3

8
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:52,590
of whole employees of the industry are concentrated in this city of Tokyo.

9
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:01,760
Also in case of the publishing company, 67%

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,010
of whole employees in this district, in this industry,

11
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,280
are concentrated in Tokyo.

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,800
So Tokyo is completely important for publishing industry.

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,110


14
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,310
In case of printing companies, 24% of whole employees

15
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,035
are concentrated in Tokyo.

16
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:30,490


17
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:40,570
And advertising companies, 55% of whole employees are concentrated in Tokyo.

18
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:46,060
So publishing, printing, and advertising--

19
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:53,890
in all these cultural industries, a huge number of employees

20
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,975
are concentrated in Tokyo.

21
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:58,970


22
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:08,280
So Tokyo is a huge city of knowledge industry and cultural industry.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,470
In case of students, in the university, if you

24
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,470
include three prefectures surrounding Tokyo-- Chiba Prefecture, Saitama

25
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:28,530
Prefecture, and Kanagawa Prefecture-- 40% of whole students in Japan

26
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:35,210
are living in this area, this metropolitan area.

27
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:41,030
So 40% of the students in Japan are studying

28
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,970
in the university in the metropolitan area around Tokyo.

29
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,160
This is also a huge number.

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,590
So in relation with the previous discussion I did in the previous unit,

31
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:03,410
Tokyo is, in some sense, the typical post-industrial city in Japan,

32
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:10,620
which include a huge number of the people who work in that knowledge

33
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:18,000
industry or cultural industry, and also who studied in universities.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,660
So the gaze from Tokyo is so powerful because

35
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,180
of the power of these knowledge industries.

36
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:33,870
So we need to consider the problem and limit and contradictions

37
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,990
and difficulties, and history, or histrical change,

38
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,550
about this vision in more detail.
