FRANK SCHULTMANN: We have come to the end

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,480
of the fifth week of the Introduction

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,930
to Project Management course.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,360
Before moving on to next week, it

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,020
would be useful to recap the key areas that we

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,730
touched on this past week.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,520
This week has focused on the identification

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,680
of your leadership skills, and how

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,350
you might use those to lead your team

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,430
and engage with internal and external stakeholders.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,190
We've highlighted that developing

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,930
effective communication skills provides

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,780
the foundation of which all project management

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,110
processes are built upon.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,630
Clear communication with your project team

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,060
enables them to fulfil the objectives of the project.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,880
And continual engagement with stakeholders

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,350
ensures that their expectations are managed appropriately.

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,130
Through the review of a couple of the scenarios,

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,910
we emphasised the importance of adapting your leadership style

21
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,500
to meet the needs of the situation you

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,520
are faced with at various stages during the project.

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,870
Being able to adapt to these demands

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,300
of diverse and challenging situations

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,340
that may arise during project delivery

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,945
provides you with an opportunity to be flexible in your approach

27
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:26,140
in ensuring project outcomes are met.

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,850
It is now time to turn our attention to the frequently

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,340
asked questions for this week.

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,000
Our first question for this week is,

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,960
is there one particular leadership style

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,120
I should adopt when managing a project?

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,940
There are different leadership approaches and styles.

34
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,510
So, it very much depends on your own personality and style.

35
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,090
What is, however, most important in leadership

36
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,240
is to be able to create trust and a common purpose

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,520
among the project team members.

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,360
You may also find that you need to use

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,640
different styles of leadership, depending

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,390
on the individuals themselves.

41
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,720
One of the most important skills as a project manager

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,970
is to be adaptable to managing and leading

43
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,810
in change environments.

44
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,640
That means that you will carefully

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,030
consider the individual resources and context

46
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,160
of a situation to shape your leadership style

47
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,730
and approach to reach objectives or outcomes.

48
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,080
This approach is known as situational leadership.

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,400
The next question is, what is the purpose for preparing

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,530
a stakeholder analysis matrix?

51
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,010
A stakeholder analysis matrix identifies and then categorises

52
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,350
all project stakeholders according

53
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,380
to their level of influence and level of interest

54
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,050
in the project.

55
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,390
It then serves to develop a stakeholder engagement plan

56
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,680
to appropriately plan communication strategies

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,060
and manage stakeholder expectations

58
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,400
throughout the project.

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,810
The objective is to ensure that unhappiness is identified

60
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,640
and addressed before it becomes a bigger issue affecting

61
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,240
overall project outcomes.

62
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,690
This is a confidential document and predominantly used

63
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,670
in large and complex projects.

64
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,950
The final question for this week is,

65
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,520
should I keep a record of communication

66
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,370
throughout the project lifecycle?

67
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,650
Record keeping is very important to meet

68
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,730
internal and external reporting, as well as legal and governance

69
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,190
requirements.

70
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,750
Communication, like any other aspect of project management,

71
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,310
needs to be planned.

72
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,800
Communication planning involves planning

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,630
for all the communication with project stakeholders.

74
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,520
A useful tool is using a reporting schedule.

75
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,940
It can help you identify the frequency

76
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,100
and types of information required

77
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,430
by different stakeholders.

78
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,200
To finish off this week, we might

79
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,770
take a minute to prepare you for next week's lessons.

80
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,480
Week six will focus on the closure of the project.

81
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,650
This is the last phase of the project lifecycle

82
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,410
where we bring everything together and ensure

83
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,740
the project's objectives are met.

84
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,600
The key issues we will be addressing next week are --

85
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,899
Were the original objectives of the projects delivered?

86
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,560
What do I need to measure?

87
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,920
Do I need to do anything differently?

88
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,620
How will I use feedback that has been given to me?

89
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,160
How do I give appropriate feedback?

90
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,660
And, do I understand the project management journey?

91
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,490
We'll talk all about that next week.

92
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,510
Remember to use the forum to full advantage

93
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,300
by involving yourself in the discussion.

94
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,287
See you next week.

95
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:48,787
