ROB LORENZUTTI: Risk can be multifaceted.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,110
It can be technical risk.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,360
It can be financial risk.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,580
It can be commercial risk, or it could be reputational risk.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,560
For example, if we get this wrong,

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,760
what does it do to the brand, to our reputation?

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,950
So there are tangible risks in the form

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,310
of budget overspend, schedule risk in terms of being late

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,620
on deliveries, etc.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,950
These are risks that can be easily quantified.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,070
But there's also the intangible, like reputation.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,990
An approach that I use for identifying risk

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,030
during the initiation and planning stages of a project

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,490
is I have my work breakdown structure.

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,430
I have my schedule.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,470
And I just walk myself through the project from start

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,360
to completion.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,600
And I ask myself, OK, we're doing this package of work

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,570
at this time of the project.

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,860
This is where we should be.

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,920
This is the maturity of the project.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,100
Consider all these factors, and just ask myself

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,430
the simple question, what could go wrong here?

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,620
And you will quickly identify more than enough risks.

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:25,300
And then the trick for the project manager is to define,

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,710
what could go wrong and how could I manage those risks?

27
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,375
How could I treat those risks?

28
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,180
Do I treat them by simply ignoring them,

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,610
by making a judgement that -- well,

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,200
it's low probability of occurrence,

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,090
or if it does occur, the consequences are trivial,

32
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,900
so I can ignore.

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,510
And to the other extreme where if this risk matures,

34
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,160
then it'll be catastrophic in terms of schedule, finances,

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,230
reputation, etc.

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,220
Having said all that -- and I may have given the impression

37
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,920
that this is the project manager's task alone,

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,700
nothing could be further from the truth.

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,370
It is so important to engage the project team members,

40
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,870
because when you look at it, they're

41
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,850
the people actually doing the work.

42
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,980
So they are as qualified -- if not more qualified than you --

43
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,090
for that particular scope of work to have a good

44
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,630
appreciation of what the issues and risks are,

45
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,590
as well as your stakeholders, lots of engagement.

46
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,920
So that approach, walking from cradle to grave of a project,

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,840
and you'll come out with a broad spectrum of risks,

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,070
which can then be taken for further analysis and treatment.

49
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,831
