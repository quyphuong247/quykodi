ROB LORENZUTTI: One of the first things that I do

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,710
in the execution phase is have a kickoff meeting --

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,270
very important to get the team on the same page,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,290
ensure that everyone has a shared vision.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:21,120
Because within a project itself, it's a microcosm of a larger

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,930
organisation.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,090
Any organisation you go into would have a culture,

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,530
a culture of values and how things are done within

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,955
the organisation.

10
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:34,250
And it's very important with a project execution,

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,020
is to have the right culture within the broader culture.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,150
One of the mechanisms, or the tools,

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,860
that a project manager has to establish the right culture --

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,840
to have the shared vision, to ensure that we're all

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,280
on the same page and we're working together

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,940
as a synchronised and integrated whole--

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,730
is in the form of project kickoff and have regular

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,480
communications and delegation of work.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,850
Key to that, once that is done, is the project manager

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,230
have the ongoing communication and the personal skills,

21
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,430
the performance management skills.

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,490
Project manager needs to not only have the technical skills,

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,130
whether they might be a finance background, an engineering

24
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,040
background, commercial, whatever.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,200
Very important, in addition to those so-called technical

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,000
skills, are the soft skills, communication -- in particular,

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,735
verbal and face-to-face communication with your team.

28
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,235
