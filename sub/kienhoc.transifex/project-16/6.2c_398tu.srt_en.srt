ROB LORENZUTTI: My approach to closing out

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,520
a project is to ask myself the question, well,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,610
have we done everything that we were expected to do?

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,140
Have all the project deliverables,

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,740
which have been defined in your project planning,

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,200
have those deliverables been delivered?

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,060
And not only have they been delivered,

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,900
but have they been delivered to the satisfaction,

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,580
to the acceptance of the customer?

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,010
It's not simply a case, well, I've

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,190
delivered a document or a widget or whatever.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,950
Has it met the requirements of the customer?

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,650
Have you satisfied all the obligations

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,025
that you made with your customer?

15
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:47,060


16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,400
There are also the cost accounts, or control accounts.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,160
In defining a project in terms of the work breakdown

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,200
structure, there's also the allocation

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,190
of funding for that work.

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,230
And one of the approaches to do that

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,810
and to manage that is concept of earned value management.

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,250
So what's called control accounts are established.

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,030
There's an allocated budget.

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,330
Earned value management is a tool or methodology

25
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,480
that a project manager can use to see how they're progressing.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,320
When you get to the end of a project,

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,630
have those control accounts been fulfilled?

28
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,590
And then have they actually been closed and all monies

29
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,900
and budgets been reassigned back to the company?

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,110
My approach to measuring project success

31
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,840
is not only just looking at the financial and the schedule

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,250
success.

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:51,300
Key to any endeavour is learning the lessons.

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,510
I'm not sure what the actual quote is,

35
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,000
but those who fail to learn from history

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,720
are condemned to repeat it.

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,490
That is especially the case for project management.

38
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,810
My approach to lessons learnt is not only just doing it as part

39
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,690
of project close out, I'd like to also schedule lessons learnt

40
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,320
activities during project execution at key milestones

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,070
of a project and ask ourselves, well,

42
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,610
this phase of work which we've just completed,

43
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,510
how well did we do it?

44
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,640
What went well?

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,930
What didn't go well?

46
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,610
What would we do different next time?

47
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,290
And having this pool of knowledge, which not only helps

48
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,110
yourself on an individual level, but it also

49
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,860
helps an organisational level, if those lessons are captured,

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,450
shared, and at times can be considered for improvement

51
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,600
in the business operation.

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,500
So measuring successful projects,

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,200
one of the key activities is lessons learnt --

54
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,630
learning the lessons for the future to set yourself up

55
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,140
for continued success.

56
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,639
