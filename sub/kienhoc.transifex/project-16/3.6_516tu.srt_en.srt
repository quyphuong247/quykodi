FRANK SCHULTMANN: We've come to the end

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,630
of the third week in the course, Introduction

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,770
to Project Management.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,750
Before moving on to the next week,

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,520
let's recap the key areas that we touched on this past week.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,090
We have explored in detail the second phase

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,800
of the project life cycle, which we refer to as planning.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,030
We emphasised the importance of the planning phase of the life

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,110
cycle, as it is the most important phase since failing

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,000
to plan usually means planning to fail.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,440
Planning properly and in sufficient detail

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,660
is essential to project success.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,080
We highlighted that the three key areas that

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,720
need to be planned in detail are the scope, scheduling,

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,330
and costing of the project.

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,280
It is encouraged that action planning

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,190
is used to help you determine the activities that

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,300
need to be completed by whom and by when

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,900
so that the main objectives of the project are met.

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,260
Through the review of a couple of scenarios,

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,140
we also observed how different project managers

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,060
approached the planning phase of their projects.

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,060
The use of project plans was highlighted in all areas

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,790
related to the project.

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,720
It is now time to turn our attention to the frequently

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,990
asked questions for this week.

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,810
The first question is what are subsidiary management plans?

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,710
Project management plans often include support documents,

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,620
called subsidiary management plans,

30
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,120
which include a communications management

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,330
plan, procurement plan, and quality management plan.

32
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,540
The next question is linked to how you might manage people

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,530
and events during this phase.

34
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,520
The question is what is a milestone log?

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,870
A milestone log is a document containing a set of milestones

36
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,660
that I included in your project.

37
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,890
A milestone is a scheduled event signifying

38
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,650
the completion of a major deliverable

39
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,760
or a set of related deliverables in the project life cycle.

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,310
Typically, the project will be divided into five to 10

41
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,040
major milestones.

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,740
Each milestone has a deliverable and a completion date

43
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,680
associated with it.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,790
The final question for this week is are the quality processes,

45
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,100
and do I need to apply them?

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,350
This process has identified the quality

47
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,690
standards and requirements applicable to the project

48
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,930
and how you might go about achieving them.

49
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,320
In other words, it identifies techniques and quality

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,720
assurance that will be used to check

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,140
that each deliverable has met the required quality

52
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,890
expectations.

53
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,070
You will need to apply quality processes

54
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,070
for your project, especially where the projects are

55
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,040
large and complex and external stakeholders are involved.

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,240
To end off, let's take a minute to prepare you

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,200
for next week lessons.

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,880
Week four will be on risk and risk management.

59
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,810
Identifying risk and putting plans in place

60
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,380
will help reduce and even mitigate them.

61
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,040
The key questions we will be answering next week

62
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,600
are what is a risk?

63
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,060
How do I identify risk?

64
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,380
What do I do once I have identified

65
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,920
the risks in my project?

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,340
And who is included in the risk management process?

67
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,070
We will talk all about that next week.

68
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,375
Remember to use the forum to full advantage

69
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,370
by involving yourself in the discussion.

70
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,460
See you next week.

71
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,073
