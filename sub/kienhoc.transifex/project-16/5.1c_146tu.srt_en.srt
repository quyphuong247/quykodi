ROB LORENZUTTI: Stakeholder identification

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,680
is sometimes self-evident.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,450
When you're in an organisation -- a mature organisation --

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,180
it's almost self-evident who the management and leadership

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,630
of the organisation is.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,770
But in a small organisation, or one that has got no formality

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,540
or much structure about it, knowing the stakeholders can be

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,659
quite a challenge.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,650
And it almost can be a little bit of guesswork.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,240
Again, it's tailored to the situation.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,130
It's tailored to the project itself.

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,880
And this is going back on the self awareness

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,620
and understanding what the project is about and the needs.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,060
Knowing all that will drive you to identifying

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,080
who the stakeholders are.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,980
Having constant dialogue with those stakeholders

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,870
may unearth also some unknown stakeholders.

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,420
It's an ongoing thing.

19
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,910
And one of the nine knowledge areas of the project management

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,530
book of knowledge is stakeholder management,

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,300
and is for good reason.
