DR. ANTON JORDAAN: When people think about project management,

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,660
they often have an image of large construction

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,760
projects, buildings, and machinery worth

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,720
millions of dollars.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,490
These type of projects represent project management

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,000
at a very high level.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,060
But in reality, project management

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,660
can be used in almost any setting.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,230
Everyone, from teachers, students, wedding planners,

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,710
through to office workers and do it yourselfers

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,240
can employ the core skills of project management

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,860
to help their day to day work run more smoothly,

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,580
and ensure a greater chance of success.

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,710
Almost every job requires a level of planning,

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,980
understanding of what and who is involved,

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,240
how long it should take, and what it's going to cost.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,710
Carefully managing each of these aspects

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,130
and understanding what success looks like

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,680
is exactly what project management is all about.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,920
This course has been designed to break

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,630
the stereotypical boundaries of project management,

22
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,760
to walk you through the core project management activities,

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,530
and give you the tools and confidence needed to manage,

24
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,010
lead, and communicate effectively

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,890
throughout the project life cycle.

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,520
Whether you are involved in construction, information

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,900
technology, corporate, or small business, or simply just

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,400
running your own home project, a sound knowledge

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,570

30
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,190
