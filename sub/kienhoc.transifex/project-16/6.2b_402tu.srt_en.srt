JOHN SING: The final step in any project

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,050
should be evaluation through reflection and feedback.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,016
So what is reflection?

4
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,390
This could be described as a look

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,230
back over the project to see what can be learned

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,870
and how these lessons might be applied to future projects.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,480
As part of this process, feedback

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,550
should also be obtained from the project team, the customer,

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,460
users, or any key stakeholders.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,229
The lessons learned and feedback process

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,140
forms part of what we would refer to as the project closure

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,410
phase.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,950
With many projects there are usually

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,500
areas that can be improved upon.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,660
However, stakeholders often want to move on quickly

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,670
once the project has been completed.

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,260
And if this happens, the opportunity

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,420
to capture lessons learned may be lost.

19
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,850
So what kind of feedback should a project manager seek?

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,780
Remember, you want to get robust feedback

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,370
and this means taking on board constructive feedback.

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,930
Team members need to feel comfortable

23
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,920
that their views and experiences on the project

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,260
will be sought and considered.

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,960
The project manager has options on how

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,650
this can be captured, via a questionnaire, online survey,

27
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,640
or a meeting where internal and external stakeholders can

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,100
provide honest and open feedback.

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,950
Perhaps you should consider these three questions.

30
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,340
Did I get to where I expected to be?

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,520
Did I get there the way I expected to?

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,840
And are all the stakeholders happy with the outcome

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,320
and the way it was achieved?

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,920
For completeness, the kind of information you are looking for

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,600
will include communication throughout our project life

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,919
cycle phases.

37
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,460
From a project manager's perspective,

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,730
you are seeking information to key questions more closely

39
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,780
related to critical success factors of time, quality

40
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,360
and cost.

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,040
The following sample of questions

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,190
can be asked by the project manager.

43
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,430
Were the project objectives achieved?

44
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,590
Did the projects stay within budget?

45
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,510
Did the team work well together?

46
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,040
Were the stakeholders kept informed

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,620
of the project progress?

48
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,270
Was the agreed project life cycle followed?

49
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,440
And were risks identified and managed effectively?

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,230
Remember, any feedback you receive

51
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,280
should be taken as constructive and viewed

52
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,330
as an opportunity for personal and professional growth,

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,800
and integrating any suggestions for recommendations

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,760
for your future projects.

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,370
Constructive feedback is one of the most effective ways

56
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,750
to keep improving your skills as a project manager.

57
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,730
We'll now hear from Rob who explains

58
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,110
how he deals with the handover and closure phase of a project.

59
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,679
