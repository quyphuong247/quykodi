STELLA BACHTIS: It is clear to see

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,180
that project management encompasses many areas

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,690
and industries.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,090
Perhaps you have realised that you, in fact,

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,780
are a project manager in an activity you are already

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,350
involved in.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,210
Over the next six weeks, we will be

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,510
working through the key areas of project management.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,950
To illustrate and help you apply skills of project management,

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,890
we will be referring to and following three scenarios.

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,850
We'll use these scenarios to take you

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,960
through each phase of the project life cycle.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,650
Our first scenario is based on Peter,

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,420
who was given an office-based project to manage

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,220
without having any previous knowledge or experience

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,250
in project management.

17
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,970
The second scenario is based on Janet, who is completing a DIY

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,420
project in her new home.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,550
And the third scenario is based on an events planner called

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,520
Anne.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,410
She runs a service-based business,

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,610
but all of her services require the same level of skills

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,490
and planning and execution.

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,670
You may see some similarities here

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,540
to situations you have been in or are now involved in.

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,970
As we work through the next few weeks,

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,130
we'll learn how each person can apply a project management

28
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,000
framework to deliver their individual projects

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,550
successfully.

00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,145
