ANTON JORDAAN: Risk forms an inevitable part of any project.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,860
Identifying, assessing, and planning for these risks

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,800
may not prevent all problems from occurring,

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,310
but should make your project run a little more smoothly.

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,780
Risk represents uncertainty.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,535
These could be events that may or may not occur,

7
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:28,660
but would impact on the achievement of your project

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,340
deliverables and overall project objectives.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,320
All projects are exposed to some degree of risk,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,320
because predicting the future with absolute certainty

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,720
is impossible.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,840
Things happen.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,380
However, project risk will vary as a result of, first,

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,100
the extent and duration of your project, the period of time

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,530
between the planning and execution phases,

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,170
the level of experience you and your team members

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,270
have by undertaking similar projects,

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,150
and the maturity of the technology being used.

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,590
The process of identifying, assessing and then responding

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,020
to risk is known as risk management.

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,400
Adequate planning for the preparation for risk

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,380
facilitates the reduction and possible elimination

23
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,780
of any risks.

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,090
Risk forms part of the execution phase

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,640
and requires continuous monitoring and review.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,470
You will need ongoing communication

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,460
with your team and engagement with your stakeholders

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,410
to identify and assess risks.

29
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,020
The key question here is, what risks

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,830
do I need to consider on this project?

31
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,890
Let's now explore the various issues in relation

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,020
to managing risks in a project.

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,520
