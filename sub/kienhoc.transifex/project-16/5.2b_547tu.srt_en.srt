00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:10,550
ANTON JORDAAN: Whether it's in person or via email,

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,450
with a supplier or a stakeholder,

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,550
effective communication serves as the very bedrock

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,980
of effective project management.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,980
Good communication supports team motivation

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,740
and gives the team a sense of purpose.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,375
Putting a well-coordinated communication process or plan

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:30,040
in place helps to further clarify objectives, roles,

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,030
and responsibilities.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,320
A good communication plan keeps stakeholders

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,600
informed and engaged and project teams motivated.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,900
Ineffective communication dramatically

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,450
increases the likelihood for misunderstanding, conflict,

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,170
and distrust in project delivery and is

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,970
ultimately to blame for more than half

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,710
of projects that fail.

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,310
So what methods of communication are

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,730
available for you to use in your project?

19
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,310
When considering various communication methods,

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,350
it is worth breaking this down into three distinct channels.

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,319
The first channel of communication

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,890
is an upward one, whereby the project manager communicates

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,080
with senior managers.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,970
This channel is specifically used for project managers who

25
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,370
are leading projects within larger organisations.

26
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,250
In this upward channel, key elements of communication

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,120
include issues, risks, and expectations of the project.

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,860
Effective methods of communication

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,330
might include weekly status reports, emails,

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,460
face-to-face meetings, or structured communication plans.

31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,960
So let's see if we can relate this to Peter's office project.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,230
Remember, Peter has a responsibility

33
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,240
to the management team within his organisation together with

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,930
local government, his project sponsor.

35
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,590
He will, in the first instance, need

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,340
to provide weekly feedback about progress on the project

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,830
to the management team.

38
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,020
In addition, he will need to keep management

39
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,350
informed of any unexpected challenges or problems that

40
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,720
may arise.

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,560
Apart from regular email updates on progress,

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,130
he should aim to provide project status updates

43
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,980
at fortnightly meetings.

44
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,419
The second communication channel is a lateral one.

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,140
It is through this lateral channel

46
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,990
that project managers communicate

47
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,470
with clients, suppliers, vendors, and contractors.

48
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,360
Common elements discussed using this channel

49
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,830
include resource needs, progress updates, budgets,

50
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,950
and schedule issues.

51
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,060
This is best done through one-on-one meetings,

52
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,270
phone calls, and email correspondence.

53
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,720
In the context of Anne's wedding planning project,

54
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,110
she communicates directly with a couple, who are her clients.

55
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,320
She also undertakes personal briefing sessions

56
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,300
with suppliers, such as the bakery,

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,790
supplying the wedding cake, the florist, and the venue manager.

58
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,460
This lateral channel of communication

59
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,670
is a form of collaboration between all

60
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,060
of the stakeholders.

61
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,020
Remember that Anne is under immense pressure

62
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,960
to have all of the planning done within eight weeks

63
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,030
for the couple to get married.

64
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,256
To this end, it is wise for Anne to set up

65
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:04,690
a schedule of weekly or twice-weekly communication,

66
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,290
either through telephone conversations or Skype meetings

67
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,400
with each of the stakeholders.

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,210
The third channel of communication

69
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,540
is directly with the project team.

70
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,290
This channel provides direction to the team,

71
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,220
highlights pending tasks, confirms delivery dates,

72
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,840
and schedules general team meetings.

73
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,760
It is advisable to hold routine meetings with your team

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,240
and keep up to date with regular verbal and email exchanges

75
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,700
to keep everyone on track.

76
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,360
Communication directly affects project performance.

77
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,150
So if you want a high performance team working

78
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,060
on a project, you need an effective communication

79
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,580
strategy to ensure you get the results you require.

80
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,370
Successful project managers typically

81
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,280
have excellent communication skills,

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,400
which include being able to present issues, listen,

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,670
and respond to feedback and to foster team harmony.

84
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,236
