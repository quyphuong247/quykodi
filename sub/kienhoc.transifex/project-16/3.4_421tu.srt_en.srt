ANTON JORDAAN: Costing is one of the triple constraint elements

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,850
we have previously referred to.

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,830
Typically when we consider undertaking

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,090
a DIY project, such as Janet's tiling project,

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,310
we are usually limited to the amount of money

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,740
that is available.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,090
As a result, we need to plan, manage, and control our project

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,080
costs, using a budget.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,380
This budget is a limitation or constraint.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,120
By constraint, we mean that we are

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,400
required to deliver our project within a predetermined amount.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,600
In order to prepare a budget, the first thing we need to do

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,860
is estimate the various costs that

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,090
will be incurred during the project

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,570
to complete the identified project activities.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,500
In project management terminology,

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,390
this exercise is referred to as developing a cost estimate.

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,290
And the accuracy of this will in part depend on past experience

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,460
in undertaking the same or similar type of projects.

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,680
In order to develop the cost estimate,

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,650
Janet would need to do the following.

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,680
Firstly, estimate the resources required

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,960
for the activity she will need to undertake in her kitchen.

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,070
These may be quantities of materials, which in her case

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,900
would be tiles and tile cement, equipment

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,823
such as a tile cutter, supplies, and additional human resources.

27
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:23,570
Hmm.

28
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,780
Would Ben help, perhaps?

29
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,760
After estimating resources, we would

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,870
need to estimate the duration of each of these activities.

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,510
Some may have an hourly, daily, or weekly rate, for instance.

32
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,420
Janet would need to hire the tile cutter for the duration

33
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,620
of the project.

34
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,750
Finally, Janet will need to prepare a cost estimate, based

35
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,650
on the best information available of the resources

36
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,560
she identified and the cost of their supply.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,361
Now, reflecting on the project, how

38
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:55,110
do you deal with the additional costs that

39
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,570
have come about through undefined activities

40
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,350
or the temptation to add more items to scope?

41
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,170
Where a budget has been fixed, we

42
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,610
would need to revisit the original scope and work

43
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,199
breakdown structure to consider the proposed change addition

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,200
and how it might impact on our schedule

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,510
and whether it is achievable.

46
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,390
If the scope change cannot be accommodated,

47
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,450
we essentially have two options.

48
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,900
We can seek additional budget support,

49
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,490
based on the impact of the cost estimate

50
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,920
that the change addition will have.

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,050
And if this is not possible, we would need to trade-off

52
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,430
by reducing scope on some of the existing

53
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,570
activities in the original scope, which is also

54
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,820
referred to as de-scoping.

55
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,400
This option usually results in a compromise of quality,

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,921
and as a result, is generally an unpopular choice.

57
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:44,421
