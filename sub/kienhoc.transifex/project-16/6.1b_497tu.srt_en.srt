00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,910
STELLA BACHTIS: Eventually, all projects come to an end.

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,770
And, hopefully, all agreed deliverables have been met.

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,330
It is important to manage the closure phase

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,430
to take the maximum benefit from the entire journey

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,680
and capture learning experiences gained.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,410
Closing out a project can involve a number of tasks.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,140
If you are a project manager in a smaller project,

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,960
you will generally be responsible for ensuring

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,530
that all tasks are completed and loose ends tied up.

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,910
For larger projects, many of these tasks

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,060
might occur simultaneously and require close coordination

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,040
and cooperation among key members of the project

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,060
team and other stakeholders.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,270
Some of the key elements relating to project closure

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,610
are the project wrap up, evaluating project success,

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,650
and capturing lessons learned.

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,290
First, in terms of project wrap up,

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,860
the major tasks are to ensure the project is

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,700
approved, handed over, and accepted by the customer.

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,520
This task is usually undertaken by the project

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,140
manager and the core team.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,270
Much of the formal handover work can be mundane and tedious,

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,920
and therefore motivation can be a problem.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,810
Keeping the team focused on the remaining closure

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,300
activities and delivery of the complete project

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,470
is often a challenge for the project manager.

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,770
Implementing the project wrap up process

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,270
includes several activities.

29
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,530
To assist with this activity, it might

30
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,960
be beneficial to develop a formal checklist to ensure

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,030
nothing is overlooked.

32
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,930
The checklist would typically consider obtaining project

33
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,090
acceptance, finalising and terminating resources,

34
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,240
de-establishing the team, capturing remaining costs,

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,170
and closing project related accounts,

36
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,450
and compiling a final project report.

37
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,020
The second element of key project closure

38
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,710
is to evaluate project success.

39
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,490
Evaluating project success is essential,

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,100
as it encourages changes in behaviour, practices,

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,990
and supports improvement in performance.

42
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,380
This process should include assessing, verifying,

43
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,590
and documenting project results.

44
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,030
It is also an appropriate time to turn to a performance

45
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,760
review of the project team.

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,310
In this instance the evaluation practices should emphasise

47
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,440
the team as a whole while minimising individual

48
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,120
performance.

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,460
The final project closure element

50
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,450
returns to capturing lessons learned

51
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,500
from completed projects.

52
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,400
Evidence suggests that capturing lessons learned

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,660
on past projects can be useful in applying to future projects.

54
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,960
Many organisations have expressed disappointment

55
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,840
at their inability to properly capture and utilise lessons

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,940
learned from project completions.

57
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,830
The reasons for this are generally as a result of a lack

58
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,970
of time available, the risk of it becoming a blaming session

59
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,400
if the project didn't go too well,

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,340
or a failure of the organisation to actually understand

61
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,760
and recognise the value of lessons learned.

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,950
In order to overcome these challenges,

63
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,410
the project manager will need to develop an effective approach

64
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,730
and offer support to ensure the lessons learned are identified,

65
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,440
utilised, and become a significant part

66
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,400
of the project and larger organisational culture.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,480
A final wrap up activity for the project manager

68
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,660
may be a project closure celebration.

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,760
Such a celebration is an opportunity to recognise

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,800
and reward the effort, the team, and key stakeholder

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,350
contributions.

72
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,471
