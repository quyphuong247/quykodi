STELLA BACHTIS: The closure phase of the project management

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,380
lifecycle brings us to an important stage

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,090
that some project managers neglect to complete fully.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,870
Closing a project requires you to review your decisions

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,800
in how you went about completing the project before handing over

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,650
to the stakeholders and obtaining feedback.

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,870
Reviewing your planning and the strategies and processes

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,400
you put into place to complete the project provides you

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,020
with important information on what went well

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,950
and what can be improved on in the next project you manage.

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,780
Taking the time to consolidate with your team

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,930
and any stakeholders at the end of the project

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,720
enables you to tie up any loose ends

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,310
and agree upon a time to take on any further activities

15
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,090
after handover, should the stakeholder require,

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,210
provided it is within the initial scope of the project.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,690
Handing over a project to the stakeholder

18
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,040
can be very rewarding, especially

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,730
since so much work has gone into initiation, planning,

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,830
and execution.

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,640
The hard work of the team and other stakeholders

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,940
should be acknowledged, and praise given,

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,150
to a job well done.

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,840
Showing appreciation to your team and other stakeholders

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,230
that enabled the execution of the project

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,970
lets them know that it was a joint effort

27
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,980
to complete the project.

28
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,270
Although the accountability lies with you as the project

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,030
manager, recognising the efforts of others makes for successful

30
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,410
teamwork and constructive feedback.

31
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,721
