ROB LORENZUTTI: Strategies I use for communication during

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:10,620
a project, is regular dialogue with the stakeholders,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,260
stakeholders being those external to the project itself,

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,940
which may be or obviously would be the customer,

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,750
but also the so called internal customer your senior management

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,240
or executive or people within the organisation who have

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,370
an interest in the outcome of the project.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,940
Regular dialogue with these people are very important,

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,960
because these people -- customers and other

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,580
stakeholders within your organisation --

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,720
they can help you for success - succeed in your project while

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,365
giving you the organisational support,

13
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:53,900
or they can actually either impede or constrain

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,040
your progress.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,110
For example, going back to planning and initiation

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,980
phases of a project where you might

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,510
have ill-defined projects, during project execution,

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,050
the poor requirement definition may and will come to a head.

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,840
And this is where communication is the key.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,410
Having a good relationship with your stakeholders and with

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,000
your team so that when -- not if, but when issues about

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
requirements change comes, you are in a position to be able

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,910
to manage that effectively and efficiently.

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,050
And communication skills is fundamental to that.

25
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,750
There are many tools available to the project manager.

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,860
And this has reflected -- these tools reflect the evolution

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,720
of technologies.

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,900
Since management has been introduced

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,130
as a formal of discipline in the 1950s,

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,910
in particular project management I mean,

31
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,880
there are many tools available to the project manager.

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:06,350
And they need to be selected and used judiciously.

33
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,130
Scheduling tools and valued management tools,

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,920
tools to develop your estimates for your projects,

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,120
tools to develop pricing -- a lot of these tools,

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,910
tools for managing risk.

37
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,320
And it could be as simple as using Microsoft Office

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,880
products, setting up a spreadsheet

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,850
to have your risk register identifying the risks,

40
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,370
identifying how you're going to manage those risks,

41
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,760
putting together some estimates as to what

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,790
is the consequences if this risk matures into consequence

43
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,310
in terms of costs, consequence in terms of schedule.

44
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,030
So it can be very straightforward.

45
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,860
It doesn't need to be complex.

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,040
The key is tailoring.

47
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,070
The key is understanding what you need

48
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,030
and having an appreciation of what's available in the market

49
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,430
and then apply that.

50
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:10,594
The tools for me are-- as a simple example, pen and paper.

51
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:12,010
If I want to write something, I'll

52
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,301
get a sheet of paper and a pen.

53
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,410
I use it.

54
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,330
That's my tool.

55
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,680
Done.

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,700
I use the tool.

57
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,250
The tool does not drive me.

58
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,010
And it's very important for the project manager

59
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,930
is that despite the wealth of tools and resources

60
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,550
that are available to ensure that the tools don't drive

61
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,550
the PM, the PM uses the tool to enable success.

62
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,107
