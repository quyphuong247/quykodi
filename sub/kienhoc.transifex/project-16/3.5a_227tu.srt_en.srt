JOHN SING: We talked about Janet's DIY project,

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,050
which was tiling her kitchen.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,215
However, we could expand this activity to building a house.

4
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,840
Planning to build a house is a good way

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,380
to demonstrate the application of the planning elements

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,660
and determining what is to be included.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,840
The key point here is thinking through the ideal ordering

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,330
of undertaking these activities.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,230
For example, a key activity is installing a roof.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,020
However, this can't be done until the wall

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,920
frames are installed.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,820
So a typical house build might go something like this.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,400
Preparing the lot, laying the foundations,

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,520
putting up the wall frames, now our roof frame can go up.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,300
Now our frame is up, we need to think

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,490
about installing the plumbing and wiring before completing

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,170
the interior walls.

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,710
Once this is done you could finish both the interior

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,650
and exterior of the house.

20
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,490
The correct sequencing of these activities

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,170
will also enable a development of the optimal time frame

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,079
for completion of the house.

23
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,870
Detailed attention to planning and managing

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,870
the necessary resources is required

25
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,200
to construct a house from its foundations

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,580
to completion, so that the keys to the house

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,550
can be handed over to the buyer upon completion.

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,240
And now let's use the home construction as an example

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,740
to apply the scope, scheduling and costing

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,604
in the planning phase of the life cycle.

31
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:24,103
