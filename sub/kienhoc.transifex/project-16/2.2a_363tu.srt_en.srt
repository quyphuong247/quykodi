DR. ANTON JORDAAN: The project management canvas

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,210
has been designed to help us understand the project

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,010
management process.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,330
Initiation is the first step of the project management life

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,760
cycle, and it is in this phase where

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,830
you need to determine the objectives and deliverables

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,720
of your project.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,510
A deliverable is usually considered

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,060
to be something tangible, to be provided at a specified date,

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,920
and is part of the overall project.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,710
Initiation is often the shortest, but a very important

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,490
phase, because you lay down the foundations of the project

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,500
at this point.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,040
It is in this phase you will need to address the following

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,600
issues.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,610
Is this a project?

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,030
What is the problem that I need to solve?

18
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,400
What do I need?

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,155
And what are my options?

20
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:55,030
Now let's see how we can make these questions

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,260
a little more tangible.

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,350
Start by clearly defining what a project is.

23
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,940
In other words, decide on what the project requires you to do.

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,570
Does it have a defined start and end date?

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,280
Building a house, completing an academic thesis,

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,750
or tiling a kitchen are all projects as

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,210
measured by this criteria.

28
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,030
Determine what the problem is that needs to be solved.

29
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,660
Usually a project has come about as a result of a problem that

30
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,850
has been identified.

31
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,000
So if for example, you are tiling a kitchen,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,720
the initial problem could be unattractive or chipped tiles

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,470
that need to be removed before you can then lay the new ones.

34
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,800
Consider the resources you need to undertake the project.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,510
This might include human resources, materials,

36
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,020
equipment, and anything else you need

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,470
to ensure you can complete the project within the set time

38
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,160
frame.

39
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,610
Take time to consider your options

40
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,520
in undertaking the project.

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,040
There are usually multiple ways to approach a project.

42
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,690
Consider different options of achieving the same outcome.

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,480
You may need to think about how you use or combine resources

44
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,290
to complete the project.

45
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,290
You can then set objectives to complete the task.

46
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,280
When you have sufficient clarity regarding these issues,

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,530
you will have a green light to move into the planning phase.

48
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,190
Remember, good initiation prepares you

49
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,445
for the planning phase of the project.

50
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:19,945
