DR. ANTON JORDAAN: Being a good project manager

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,340
requires a set of core skills to help you manage a project

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,310
efficiently and effectively.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,240
The manner in which you communicate and engage

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,060
with people, as well as your ability

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,240
to lead, plan, and solve problems,

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,850
are integral to achieving the outcomes of your project.

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,490
The following activity will help assess your current skills

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,590
against the five dimensions of successful people project

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,630
managers.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,300
These dimensions are leadership, communication,

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,440
dealing with uncertainty, problem solving, and planning.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,460
In the next activity, please respond to all the statements.

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,080
Now consider how you might respond to each statement

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,710
and then rank your responses using the scale provided.

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,250
Bear in mind there are no incorrect responses.

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,990
Your responses are not viewable by any other participants.

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's consider by way of an example.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,099
Under the leadership dimension a statement might be

20
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:04,390
you are usually comfortable functioning in a leadership

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,480
position.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,780
Now, think about a recent scenario

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,480
where you might have led a group or team of people

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,880
and then using the five point scale,

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,980
select the one option that you most closely associate with.

26
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,350
Once you have entered all your responses,

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,700
you will be provided with a graphic identifying

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,080
areas of strength and areas that you

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,620
would benefit from through further development.

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,800
Your result provides a representation

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,910
of your current skills measured against these five dimensions.

32
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,610
If you have a score of less than 75% in any of the areas,

33
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,090
we have provided some information and feedback

34
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,172
that should help you further develop these areas.

35
00:01:42,172 --> 00:01:44,380
The activity is designed to help you learn a bit more

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,070
about yourself and to assist with identifying

37
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,650
the areas of focus in your ongoing development

38
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,535
as a project manager.

39
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:53,035
