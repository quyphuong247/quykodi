DR. ANTON JORDAAN: The project management canvas

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,120
is a teaching tool that has been developed

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,300
to guide you through the project management life cycle.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,060
The process follows a distinct path

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,636
from the starting point, called initiation,

6
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:21,010
to the end of your project, which

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,730
is referred to as closure.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,570
So if you are ready, put your project management cap on,

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,340
and let's begin your project management journey.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,650
Where do we start?

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,650
Well, project management begins with initiation.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,880
This is often the shortest, but a very important

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,130
part of the journey, as it lays the foundation

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,374
for the rest of the process.

15
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,790
During this phase, you will need to consider the following

16
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,790
questions.

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,610
What is a project?

18
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,820
What is the problem that I'm looking to solve?

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,350
What do I need?

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,360
And what are my options?

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,660
Once you have adequately addressed these questions

22
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,220
and you are clear on what you need to do,

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,870
you will receive the green light to move on to the next phase.

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,720
The planning phase forms the longest and most important

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,660
stage of the project management life cycle,

26
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,020
as it requires detailed planning through scoping, scheduling,

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,080
and costing of your project.

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,940
Many problems that arise in projects

29
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,340
are the result of rushing through the planning

30
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,630
phase of the journey.

31
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,400
In this phase, you will need to address

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,850
the following key questions before getting the green light

33
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,870
to move to the next stage.

34
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,690
Key questions are how do you define

35
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,500
the scope of your project?

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,350
What planning needs to be done?

37
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,460
What resources do I need?

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,160
When does it need to be done by?

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,250
And finally, how much will it cost?

40
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,860
If your planning has been thorough,

41
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,940
you can proceed through the stage gate

42
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,140
into the execution phase.

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,500
Execution means that you are now ready to roll out or implement

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,790
your project.

45
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,930
To execute your project effectively,

46
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,830
you will need to identify, assess, and deal

47
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,750
with risk or any uncertainty that may present itself.

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,160
In addition, you will need to lead your team

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,470
to enable the execution of the project,

50
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,930
if you want it to run smoothly.

51
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,960
To achieve this, you will need to clearly communicate

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,169
the objectives of the project, and manage change.

53
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,540
Engaging stakeholders and managing expectations

54
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,450
is all part and parcel of the ongoing journey.

55
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,020
Important questions for this stage

56
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,030
are, what risks do I need to consider

57
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,680
when managing a project?

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,890
How do I engage and manage stakeholders?

59
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,830
As a leader, how do I motivate, communicate, and lead my team?

60
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,130
And finally, am I doing the project right?

61
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,410
Once you feel you have sufficient clarity

62
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,970
around these questions, you should receive the green light

63
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,720
to move through to the last part of the life cycle.

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,210
The final stage, closure, is wrapping up your project

65
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,470
and handing over the final outcomes to your stakeholders.

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,170
It is in this final phase that you

67
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,900
measure the success of reaching your project deliverables.

68
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,010
Receiving and considering feedback

69
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,400
is essential, so that you can take on board

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,810
any lessons learned in order to apply them to future projects.

71
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,271
