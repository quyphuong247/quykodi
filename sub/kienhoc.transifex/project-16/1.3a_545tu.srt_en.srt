00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:10,730
JOHN SING: It was interesting to view those different scenarios

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,760
on project management.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,810
As you can see, project management

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,750
transcends all industries.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,290
Projects can be large or small.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,000
They can be fairly simple and straightforward, or quite

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,010
complex and time consuming.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,180
You can initiate them yourself or you

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,960
can be given a project to complete

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,830
without having much experience.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,280
After viewing the video scenarios,

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,640
I hope you picked up on some of the themes that

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,930
were common to all.

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,970
Let's run through them to ensure that you

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,230
have understanding of the key features of managing a project.

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,380
Generally, there are four main characteristics of a project,

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,030
regardless of its size and complexity.

18
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,970
The first characteristic is that a project has a definite start

19
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,370
and end date.

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,570
It is a temporary undertaking within a fixed period of time,

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,490
whether this is one week or six years.

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,500
A project manager has to complete the project

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,070
within the specified amount of time.

24
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,220
The second key characteristic of a project

25
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,640
is that it achieves a goal or an outcome.

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,220
In other words, something is completed or achieved

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,610
by the end of the project life cycle.

28
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,010
In our examples, we saw that the end points

29
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,140
were the wedding, the workplace system,

30
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,660
and the tiling of a kitchen.

31
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,510
The third characteristic to consider

32
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,640
is that a project provides benefit or value

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,010
to the recipient.

34
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,770
In other words, what will the recipient

35
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,420
gain from the completed project?

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,380
Finally, a project requires an allocation

37
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,460
of resources that need to be skillfully used.

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,750
These resources will vary depending on the size

39
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,240
and complexity of the project.

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,850
And all projects will, in one way or another,

41
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,510
allocate and use resources to achieve their goals

42
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,090
or outcomes.

43
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,930
In addition, project management follows

44
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,350
a distinct linear process or journey,

45
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,410
which is known as the project management life cycle.

46
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,310
The life cycle has four phases.

47
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,310
The life cycle begins with initiation,

48
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,850
which is the starting point of any project.

49
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,440
It is usually the shortest phase but the most important,

50
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,460
because it sets up the foundation of the project.

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,090
It is in this phase that you flesh out

52
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,389
the project objectives, success criteria, and high-level plan.

53
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,480
Is also in this phase that you identify risks, stakeholders,

54
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,080
and your team.

55
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,890
The second phase of the life cycle is planning.

56
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,850
Planning is the primary function of any project manager

57
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,900
and requires you to undertake a rigorous process of developing

58
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,580
plans to ensure you achieve your project objectives.

59
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,460
The area that you will focus on in this phase of the life cycle

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,520
are scope, scheduling, and costing.

61
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,800
Phase three is project execution.

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,280
This phase is about completing specific deliverables that

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,100
are required to meet the scope and objectives of the project.

64
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,940
In this phase, assessing risk and implementing strategies

65
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,050
to reduce or mitigate risk is paramount.

66
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,830
This phase also focuses on being an effective leader

67
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,070
for your team and engaging your stakeholders in the execution

68
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,720
of the project.

69
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,310
The final phase of the project management life cycle

70
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,450
is the closure of the project.

71
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,840
It is in this phase that the outcomes are achieved

72
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,660
and the benefits of the completed project

73
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,690
are experienced by the stakeholders.

74
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,260
The closure of a project requires

75
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,134
you to obtain feedback from your stakeholders and your team.

76
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:10,634
