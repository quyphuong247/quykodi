ROB LORENZUTTI: Managing expectations is sometimes

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,700
driven by the project itself in terms of the deliverables that

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,140
are expected by the customer.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,700
And in some organisations, there are some expectations about how

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,630
projects need to be managed and reported.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,810
It's important -- and this is where it comes out also

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,030
in the planning stage of your project,

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,940
where a project manager is articulating the methods

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,440
of communication and the deliverables for the project,

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,350
including reporting deliverables.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,830
That approach is defined in the project plan,

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,740
and the requirements are very much driven

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,920
by the organisation.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,550
So it provides emphasis on the importance on understanding

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,740
what the project is about, understanding

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,030
your organisation, understanding the governance of that

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,010
organisation, understanding what the customer is needing,

18
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:08,800
understanding when those forms of communication are required.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,080
And they can be a combination of written as well

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,150
as verbal progress meetings, progress reports,

21
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:22,740
informal emails, a regular conversation by way of a phone

22
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,860
call, setting up regular meetings

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,560
or catch-ups with your team.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,200
There are many effective ways, and there's no

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,610
one-size-fits-all situation.

26
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,036
