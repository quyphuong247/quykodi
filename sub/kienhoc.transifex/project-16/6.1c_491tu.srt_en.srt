JOHN SING: Evaluating the progress of your project

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,070
during the execution phase is part

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,141
of your role as the project manager.

4
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:16,640
However, it has traditionally been one of the most neglected

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,740
areas of project management.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,460
For small and simple projects, this can be quite an easy thing

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,160
to achieve, especially if you are closely involved

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,040
with the project.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,680
If for example, we look at Anne's wedding project,

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,150
it is relatively easy for her to monitor and evaluate

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,570
the progress of each of the stakeholders involved

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,760
in delivering outcomes for the wedding.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,370
However, for larger projects, evaluating progress

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,710
can be more challenging and may require an agreed approach.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,000
How could you measure the success of a project?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,510
Measuring and reporting on project progress typically

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,450
involves deciding on what project information and data is

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,730
required to be collected, and how this information should

19
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,170
then be analysed and reported.

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,110
The information to be collected will usually

21
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,870
be based on what has been set as the important objectives

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,080
to be measured.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,700
For example, you will recall activity duration times,

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,020
resource usage, and actual costs, which

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,650
can then be compared with the planned times, resources

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,880
and budget.

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,930
There is often a focus on cost and schedule.

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,770
And therefore, as a project manager,

29
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,580
you may need answers to the following questions.

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,820
What is the current schedule and cost status for your project?

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,420
How much will it cost to complete the project?

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,040
And when will the project be completed?

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,370
If there are schedule slippages and/or cost overruns,

34
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,090
what will be the forecast at completion?

35
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,679
Are there potential problems that need to be addressed?

36
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,470
The first step in answering those questions

37
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,390
would be to take your work breakdown structure information

38
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,450
and planned schedule, and then develop a base line plan.

39
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,360
Simply put, this is a plan that defines

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,290
what the project manager hopes the project will look like.

41
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,550
It includes cost, time and goal factors

42
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,460
using reasonable estimates.

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,990
The base line plan provides guidance

44
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,160
in all stages of the project.

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,420
Some call it a road map to our project success.

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,050
As information is collected it can then

47
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,560
be compared with this base line plan.

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,430
Because plans seldom eventuate as expected,

49
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,760
it becomes important to understand and investigate

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,160
any differences from the plan, and then decide

51
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,370
if any action is necessary.

52
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,190
The timing of this work is important

53
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,800
as there needs to be sufficient time

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,670
to allow for early detection of any inconsistencies

55
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,010
and correction of any causes.

56
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,210
If differences from the base line plan are significant,

57
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,240
correction action would be required in order

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,770
to bring the project back in line

59
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,790
with the original or revised plan.

60
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,170
In some cases, project scope may have

61
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,210
changed, which will result in a change in the base line plan.

62
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,085
Measuring and reporting progress is important

63
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:46,360
but requires you, the project manager,

64
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,390
to think through what it is you are going to measure,

65
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,020
the information required, and your ability

66
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,460
to access that information.

67
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,079
