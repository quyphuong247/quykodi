1
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,060
This is Anne.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,270
She owns an events planning business.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,700
The events she plans and manages range from large scale product

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,590
launches to concerts in the park and require a lot of time,

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,600
organisation, effort, and resources in putting them

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,110
together and ensuring their success.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,040
Everything Anne does is driven by a schedule that

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,150
has to be strictly managed using a set budget and resources,

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,510
without compromising on the quality of the outcome.

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,440
Although stressful, she is driven

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,030
to make every event a success.

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,930
Anne is currently working on a wedding

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,350
and knows the key to success is ensuring

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,690
that the bride and groom are happy with everything

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,610
on their special day.

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,480
This usually takes about three months to plan.

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,090
But this time, she only has eight weeks.

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,030
The couple is in a rush to get married,

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,470
and they don't have a very clear idea of what they want.

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,630
The only thing they seem to be really clear on

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,489
is the date they have set and they don't want to change.

22
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,510
During the start of the process, Anne

23
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,700
likes to get as much information as possible about the couple

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,460
and what they want.

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,340
Apart from showing them examples of her previous work,

26
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,960
she also encourages them to give her details about how

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,820
they envisage their day to be.

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,100
Wedding planning is not just about finding

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,670
the right dress for the bride and the right venue

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,140
for the event.

31
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,540
It is also about setting small milestones and achievable goals

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,800
to accomplish everything that needs to be done

33
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,120
within the time frame given.

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,280
Among other things, Anne arranges table settings,

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,400
flowers, music, catering, and the wedding cake.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,480
Keeping the bride and groom involved every step of the way

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,520
helps keep them happy.

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,310
Anne has a mantra when it comes to running

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:55,060
any successful event-- failed communication, failed project.

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,958
