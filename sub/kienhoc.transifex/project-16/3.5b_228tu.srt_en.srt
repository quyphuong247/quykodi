STELLA BACHTIS: Following our house build example,

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,110
let's say you decide to try and manage this yourself.

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,170
Your thinking is to act as the project manager

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,530
and coordinate a number of smaller contractors,

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,770
like the plumbers, electricians, roofers, and bricklayers,

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,480
rather than contracting the whole job to one

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,920
large construction company.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,390
We need to start by being clear on what is in

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,090
and what is out of scope for our project.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,800
In order to do this, we have to be

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,670
specific about what it is we are setting out to do

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,110
and what the outcomes and benefits we are creating.

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,630
It is very easy to be tempted to start

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,940
adding additional features to a house, such as a swimming

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,200
pool, or even an additional bathroom that we never intended

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,760
at the initiation and planning stages.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,489
Any addition of an out of scope item

18
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,490
will not only delay completion of the project,

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,430
but could also result in a budget blowout.

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,810
Once we have identified the activities,

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,180
we also make an estimation of how long each task will take,

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,500
also known as the duration.

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,700
In the following activity, consider

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,860
the activities presented based on what you know from our house

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,480
build scenario.

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,060
Identify the activities that are in scope for a standard

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,650
build and arrange them in the order

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,850
you would go about undertaking them

29
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,344
in constructing your project.

30
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:39,844
