Professor Frank Schultmann: We've

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,600
come to the end of the first week in the course Introduction

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,860
to Project Management.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,680
Before moving on to the next week,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,910
let's recap the key areas that we've

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,230
touched on this past week.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,210
We introduced the concept of project management

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,210
and discussed how this can be applied

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,030
in almost any setting across diverse roles and activities.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,360
We characterised some of the elements that

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,760
are common to projects and considered whether you may have

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,540
previously undertaking activities that

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,070
could have been run as a project or have one on your hands

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,480
right now.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,060
We also reviewed a series of scenarios

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,730
where project management could be implemented

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,010
to ensure a better over end result with fewer

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,090
surprises along the way.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm always faced with interesting questions

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,850
from the students I teach and I would

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,540
like to share some of these with you.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,489
The first is around the difference between project

23
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,400
sponsors and project owners.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,840
The simple answer is that a project sponsor is a person

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,670
but gives permission for or approves a project that

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,290
needs to be completed.

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,950
In other words it may be your boss or your manager giving you

28
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,510
a project to complete.

29
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,400
A project owner is a person that initiates a project.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,090
As an example, if you independently

31
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,580
choose to start or do your own project,

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,010
you are the project owner.

33
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,980
Another question that I often get asked

34
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,320
is what is a high-level plan.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,510
Think about the high-level plan as the overview of key points

36
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,220
that define what the project is about.

37
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,710
Who will be involved in completing the project

38
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,960
and the key success factors.

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,050
I always tell my students that it

40
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,770
is a birds-eye view on the project, which

41
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,890
means that the project manager can have

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,550
a whole picture off the project before he or she starts

43
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,640
breaking it down to smaller achievable goals.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,030
It is also worth noting that high-level plan can

45
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,260
be referred to as a project brief or a project charter.

46
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,870
The final question for this week is where do I start.

47
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,530
This is an interesting question that

48
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,760
will be answered in more detail as you

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,770
progress through the course.

50
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,890
I always tell my students start with what you know

51
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,070
and then take time to figure out what

52
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,980
the problem needs to be solved.

53
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,760
Once you've figured that out, you

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,280
can then begin determining your options for move forward

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,090
and start planning.

56
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,720
To end off, let's take a minute to prepare you

57
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,000
for next week's lessons.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,330
Week two is the beginning of the project management life

59
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,630
cycle, which is also known as the initiation

60
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,990
phase of the process.

61
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,720
The key questions we will be answering next week

62
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,060
are-- what is my project?

63
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,780
What is the project problem and what do I need to solve?

64
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,720
Am I doing the right project?

65
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,140
And what are my options?

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,020
Remember to use a forum to full advantage

67
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,120
by involving yourself in the discussion.

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,240
See you next week.

69
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,147
