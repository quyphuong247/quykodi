ANTON JORDAAN: Effective risk management underpins

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,290
successful project delivery.

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,890
Because risk is related to uncertainty,

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,210
project risks always refers to a future event.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,910
So the time spent in the planning phase

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,370
thinking about possible risks and how

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,380
to deal with them will have a direct impact on your ability

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,550
to monitor and control risk during project delivery.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,580
Risks are present in all projects regardless

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,630
of their size and complexity and need

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,890
to be appropriately managed.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,260
Simply hoping that something untoward won't happen

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,700
isn't a good way to proactively manage risk.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,270
So what is the best approach to use to plan

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,380
a major risk in your project?

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,470
Well, the process that is most widely used

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,470
originates from an international standard on risk management

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,790
and consists of six key steps.

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,450
The first step is to understand the context of your project

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,849
and to confirm your project objectives, thereby

21
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,380
knowing what is to be achieved.

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,910
The second step is risk identification.

23
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,440
Risk identification entails the identification

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,280
of all risks that may impact on achieving your project

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,470
objectives.

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,410
It's always a good idea to include

27
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,060
some experienced stakeholders together with your project team

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,940
to help you identify potential risks.

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,240
The third step, in this process, requires you

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,140
to undertake a risk assessment.

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,080
This means that you will need to prioritise

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,970
the risks by assessing their severity using

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,510
a combination of both likelihood and the impact

34
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,470
that each risk may have on your objectives

35
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,210
should they eventuate.

36
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,310
Bear in mind, some risks might appear

37
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,990
to have a very low likelihood of occurring.

38
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,740
But if they do occur, the impact might be catastrophic.

39
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,417
The fourth step is to consider and plan risk responses.

40
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,500
This is the process where we develop risk response

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,050
strategies that will aim to address

42
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,910
the impact of major risks on the project objectives

43
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,110
and your success criteria.

44
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,760
Risks can be responded to in four ways.

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,390
Risk can be accepted.

46
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,680
Risk can be transferred to another party

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,070
such as a contractor or client.

48
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,540
Risk can be mitigated or reduced.

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,940
Or risk can be avoided.

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,120
Each of the specific risk responses

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,270
should correspond with the priority and potential impact

52
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,990
of the risk.

53
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,601
The fifth step requires you to monitor and review risks.

54
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:36,350
Here you'll need to monitor the risks that

55
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,580
have been identified to determine if they have occurred

56
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,960
or not.

57
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,120
If they have not yet occurred consider afresh

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,850
whether the likelihood and impact may have changed

59
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,240
since the last risk review.

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,850
Any new risks should also be identified at this point.

61
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,570
Remember, risk monitoring review is an ongoing process

62
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,710
not a once off tick-the-box activity.

63
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,350
The final step of the risk management process

64
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,120
is to communicate the outcomes to the relevant stakeholders

65
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,420
to assist their decision making.

66
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,490
So can this risk management approach be used

67
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,240
by organisations of all sizes?

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,720
Well, let's see if we can contextualise the process

69
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,950
by examining how risk may impact Ann's wedding planning project.

70
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,980
There's a whole range of issues that may impact

71
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,520
the event Ann is planning.

72
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,290
So she will need to identify and assess potential risks

73
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,660
and then consider appropriate risk responses.

74
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,440
Based on Ann's experience, she'll

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,830
already be aware of many of the typical risks that

76
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,870
are likely to occur such as unfavourable weather

77
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,090
on the day.

78
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,690
And then there are some risks that even an experienced event

79
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,450
manager like Ann would be difficult to anticipate,

80
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,590
such as the bride or groom getting cold feet

81
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,729
on the big day.

82
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,270
These are examples of different risks

83
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,050
for which Ann will need to identify, assess and develop

84
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,780
risk responses to.

85
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,480
By following the risk management process,

86
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,570
Ann is able to control, reduce, and possibly avoid

87
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,100
the impact of these risks through developing risk

88
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,860
contingencies or fallback options.

89
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,380
Although Ann is the wedding planner,

90
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,400
her business model relies on outsourcing

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,079
many of the activities that she is responsible for.

92
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,769
These outsourced activities include the making

93
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,730
of the wedding dress, arranging the catering,

94
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,430
making the wedding cake, the flower arrangements,

95
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,770
and all other decorations at the venue.

96
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,000
Managing suppliers and contractors --

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,320
also known as procurement -- therefore poses another area

98
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,440
of potential risk for Ann.

99
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,410
Whenever there is a dependence on external suppliers,

100
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,140
the possibility exists that one or more of these suppliers

101
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,860
may not fulfil the deliverables on time or at the specified

102
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,240
cost.

103
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,580
Ann's response might be to put some contingencies in place

104
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,170
in case one or more of these suppliers

105
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,650
do not complete their required deliverables on schedule.

106
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,660
A contingency example in this instance

107
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,400
might be bringing the due date forward

108
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,960
for suppliers, such as the wedding dress and the wedding

109
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,080
cake, to ensure they complete what

110
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,080
is required well before the actual date of the wedding.

111
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,780
It is wise for any project manager

112
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,870
to build in a buffer period to consolidate any external supply

113
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,900
deliverables before the date they

114
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,380
are required in the project.

115
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,530
This is even more so when the specific deliverable has

116
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,140
a knock-on effect, in other words, when one activity is

117
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,880
dependent on another being completed,

118
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,190
thus causing delays on the critical path.

119
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,000
Clearly, Ann will benefit by using a systematic approach

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,190
to ensure her risk management plan is sufficiently robust.

121
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,990
To wrap this up then, make sure you take enough time

122
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,240
to identify the risks in your project,

123
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,220
both those that you can and those that you cannot control.

124
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,560
Second, assess the likelihood and impact

125
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,120
of the risk occurring and the impact on your project

126
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,580
if the risk does occur.

127
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,360
And finally, put a strategy in place for each risk

128
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,520
by deciding whether you are prepared to accept the risk,

129
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,650
transfer the risk, reduce the risk,

130
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,606
or avoid the risk entirely.

131
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:08,106
