00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:10,010
ANTON JORDAAN: We have different strategies

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,320
we need to come up to respond to these risks.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
JOHN SING: That's right.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,449
So once you've now assessed the risks --

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,740
and it's always a good thing to maybe have some options

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,800
available.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,545
So you wouldn't necessarily always go

8
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:23,420
into straight away treating every risk

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,950
or reducing every risk that you identify.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,300
You have other options available.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,040
So again, if we turn back to Janet's project,

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,780
let's assume that the securing of the supply and the tiles

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,230
was deemed to be of a high risk, Janet then

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,729
might make the decision that she needs to respond to that risk

15
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:46,520
by doing something.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,000
She might need to contact the supplier much earlier on

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,410
and then engage with the supplier

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,755
to ensure that the tiles that she would like

19
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:55,010
have been procured and are actually sitting

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,070
in the store ready to go.

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,840
So that's a particular way of, I guess, responding or reducing

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,600
the risk that she's identified.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,690
So that's looking for a broad coverage of the risks

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,470
using some sort of aide-memoire, some sort of classification

25
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,090
scale to assist in that.

26
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,800
And I think we recall from Anne's project,

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,910
that once the risks have been identified,

28
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,754
we then move into assessing those risks, started

29
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:20,545
to consider the likelihood and consequence,

30
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:23,150
and coming up with is this a high risk,

31
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,024
is this a moderate risk, or a low risk?

32
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:28,940
I guess then it would be then moving to what's

33
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,250
going to be our response?

34
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,210
So what are some of the things that we'd

35
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,630
need to think about when considering how we would then

36
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,966
respond to the risks that we've identified and assessed.

37
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:39,715
ANTON JORDAAN: Right, so our risk response

38
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:43,620
is part of our strategy, our business strategy in terms

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,350
of dealing with these risks.

40
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,300
And typically there are four responses

41
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,940
to risks or risk responses.

42
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,370
We can, of course, accept the risk.

43
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,315
In Janet's case, for instance, she's

44
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:58,190
aware that she hasn't done this before, she's

45
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,870
taking a fair bit of pride that she's

46
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:06,200
going to lay these tiles as a one person project,

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,030
and she's prepared to accept that risk.

48
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,050
I think she seems to be pretty switched on,

49
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,580
so she'll go and do her research to ensure that she polishes up

50
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,210
on that, but she's prepared to accept the fact she hasn't done

51
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,340
this before and she'll accept the technical challenge

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,410
in terms of that.

53
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,520
Other than accepting the risk, risks can be transferred.

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,390
In Peter's case, for instance, he's part of a larger

55
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,940
organisation.

56
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,270
He's dropped into this thing in the planning phase.

57
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,300
He needs to manage a wide range of stakeholders.

58
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,840
He may decide to tap one of his colleagues on the shoulder,

59
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,830
someone else in his organisation who specifically deals with

60
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,040
stakeholder management, and transfer the risk onto this

61
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,590
person in order to reduce the risk to himself,

62
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,700
in terms of dealing with that.

63
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,680
Beyond that, risks could be avoided.

64
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,300
It may just be a case that in a project

65
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,640
where the risk is simply just too high to continue with.

66
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,115
And it would then be an option to say, it's too hard,

67
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,420
we're not going ahead, the risk will be avoided.

68
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,440
So actually Peter is in a pretty tight spot where he is.

69
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,500
He was just handed this project.

70
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,590
He wasn't part of the initiation phase,

71
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,520
and he's just been given this project

72
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,010
and he's got to run with it.

73
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,654
So this is a unique situation for him to be in.

74
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:38,820
JOHN SING: Yeah, absolutely.

75
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,232
And I guess now the expectation is

76
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:43,440
that he has to now deliver on this particular project

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,536
and meet the objectives.

78
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:45,910
And as you say, perhaps he didn't

79
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,730
have a lot of involvement in that early part of it.

80
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,260
So I guess one of the challenges that we've picked up when

81
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,120
you're in that situation and you have to do this in addition

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,270
to business as usual is to actually seek some sort

83
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,810
of formal recognition of the project internally within

84
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,820
the organisation.

85
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,810
And that again is identifying the internal stakeholders,

86
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,390
the key internal stakeholders to make that happen.

87
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,110
ANTON JORDAAN: Right.

88
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,310
So I think the overarching message really

89
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,160
here in terms of risk is that it's an ongoing process.

90
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,930
And it needs to be monitored and reviewed.

91
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,950
And particularly in Peter's case, these risks may change.

92
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,670
JOHN SING: So in terms of the process,

93
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,030
it's a flexible process.

94
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,320
We'd certainly be suggesting applying it

95
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,440
to the project setting, bringing it early on in the project life

96
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,940
cycle.

97
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,570
And you could see through Anne's project, Janet's project,

98
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,470
and Peter's project the application of that.

99
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,120
But we would certainly be suggesting

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,870
that it's beneficial to apply this process in all projects,

101
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,600
regardless of the size, the nature,

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,390
and the type of that project.

103
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,100
It's certainly going to be beneficial to your project

104
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,978
manager in achieving the outcomes for the project.

105
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:53,478
