FRANK SCHULTMANN: So, that brings us

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,550
to the end of week six, and the end of the Introduction

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,080
to Project Management course.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,990
It has been a real pleasure to engage

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,450
in this journey with you.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,960
And we hope that you have a clearer understanding

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,000
of the different steps that you need

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,470
to take when managing a project, no matter the size

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,320
or complexity.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,030
We started off by breaking the boundaries

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,520
of the stereotypical view of who project managers are.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,000
And hopefully, you concluded that you are already

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,390
have been involved in some kind of project,

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,450
or you have already managed a project without knowing.

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,000
We then introduced you to the project management canvas.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,600
And we navigated our way through the four phases of the project

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,030
management lifecycle.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,340
Namely, initiation, planning, execution, and closure.

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,720
You will recall how we emphasised that each phase is

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,850
an independent component and needs to be integrated

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,910
as part of the whole journey.

22
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,960
But more importantly, we stressed

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,840
that you need to be able to answer

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
the key questions within each phase

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,610
before moving to the stage gate and into the next one.

26
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,010
We also looked at the importance of developing leadership

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,120
and effective communication skills to lead a team

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,590
and engage with stakeholders as part of successful project

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,020
management.

30
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,720
To wrap up, consider a few key questions

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,780
when embarking on your project management journey.

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,720
What is the project?

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,490
How will you go about planning for project execution?

34
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,750
How will you engage with your team and other stakeholders

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,380
throughout the process?

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,820
And, what strategies will you put into place

37
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,680
to monitor and review the whole project management life cycle?

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,640
We look forward to seeing you again,

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,260
and please provide us with your thoughts, feedback,

40
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,720
and comments.

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,010
On behalf of the Introduction to Project Management team,

42
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,570
I thank you for being part of this experience.

43
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,382
