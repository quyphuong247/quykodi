JOHN SING: Throughout this course so far,

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,010
we have stressed the importance of good initiation

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,890
and even better planning to help you manage

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,110
your project successfully.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,920
Failing to plan properly and failing to identify and assess

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,720
risks adequately may result in the complete failure

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,130
of your project.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,720
From small DIY home projects to large complex construction

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,090
projects, project failure is not uncommon.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,930
Often times, project managers rush

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,370
through the process or risk identification

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,040
and risk management.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,290
Closely considering the likelihood and impact

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,100
of identified risks enables you, as a project manager,

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,800
to have a clearer picture of the project

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,480
as a whole and plan for those risks sufficiently.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,050
The extra time taken to identify risks and put together

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,040
a risk management strategy means less of this and more of this.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,390
Let's turn our attention to the next video

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,980
where we get first hand experience

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,891
and guidance from a project manager in the field.

00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:02,391
