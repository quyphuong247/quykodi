00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,870
STELLA BACHTIS: It is the role of the project manager

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,330
to manage and influence the expectations

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,660
of the various stakeholders.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,510
To effectively manage these stakeholders,

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,100
it is crucial for the project manager

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,730
to first determine who all the stakeholders are.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,840
Stakeholders, in this sense, will be all those people

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,470
and organisations affected by the project.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,780
Once we know who the stakeholders are,

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,880
we can determine what their concerns and needs might be.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,520
In doing so, we can understand what role

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,180
they may play in the project deliverables

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,640
and manage their expectations.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,690
For example, your project stakeholders

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,110
may include diverse groups, such as customers, suppliers,

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,500
contractors, and your project team.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,370
Your stakeholders may also have differing levels of interest

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,540
and/or influence over your project

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,170
and, therefore, may impact this in a positive or negative way.

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,610
As a project manager, it is important to try and identify

21
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,190
them and better understand their roles, interests,

22
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,040
and potential influences over your project

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,790
and then work out the most effective strategy

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,840
to communicate.

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,110
We generally classify stakeholders

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,210
as either internal or external to the project.

27
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,380
So who are the internal stakeholders?

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,070
Internal stakeholders are internal to the project

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,920
and will include you, as the project manager, your project

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,750
team, and your management team, if this is indeed

31
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,730
a larger project.

32
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,480
Internal stakeholders should have clearly

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,480
defined roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,140
that they need to fulfil.

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,230
Who then are your external stakeholders?

36
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,010
External stakeholders, on the other hand,

37
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,910
are outside of the project or organisation and typically

38
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,530
include an end user or customers of the project outcome,

39
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,980
as well as suppliers and contractors.

40
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,050
Engaging stakeholders and maintaining relationships

41
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,370
with them can be a time-consuming and ongoing

42
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,330
process but can certainly prove beneficial to your project

43
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,910
success if well managed.

44
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,810
Let's contextualise this to Peter's office project

45
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,900
and consider the stakeholders that he needs to engage

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,850
and communicate with throughout the project life cycle.

47
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,430
Peter has a diverse group of stakeholders

48
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,530
that he needs to consider.

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,410
The management team within the organisation,

50
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,370
as well as his project team, make up the internal

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,200
stakeholders that he needs to manage.

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,220
External to the organisation, Peter will need to engage with

53
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,470
the project sponsor, community organisations,

54
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,470
secondary schools, and local businesses that will support

55
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,660
the implementation of the system to help young people find

56
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,140
employment after school.

57
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,820
Peter will need to gain the support

58
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,260
of the external stakeholders.

59
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,280
So how might he go about doing this?

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,300
It's a good idea for him to begin the process of engagement

61
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,740
by meeting with the stakeholder groups

62
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,640
individually to understand their roles and responsibilities.

63
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,760
Holding this initial meeting will

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,590
allow him to communicate his expectations

65
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,860
and possible concerns.

66
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,020
Once he has clarity on who the stakeholders are

67
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,990
and their role in the project, he

68
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,080
can then schedule a joint meeting

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,690
with all of the stakeholders.

70
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,890
A group meeting provides an opportunity

71
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,050
for each stakeholder to understand

72
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,600
the roles and responsibilities of the other respective

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,190
stakeholders.

74
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,900
Peter can use this meeting to initiate trust-building

75
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,220
between stakeholders and develop cooperation and collaboration.

76
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,090
It's also worth remembering that this office project has

77
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,950
a one-year life cycle.

78
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,760
Therefore, engaging and communicating with stakeholders

79
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,390
should be a regular and routine occurrence

80
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,580
to maintain clarity of roles, responsibilities,

81
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,589
and deliverables.

82
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,410
Since Peter is fully accountable for the completion

83
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,730
of this project, he will need to consider

84
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,350
how he will deal with stakeholders should they not

85
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,910
fulfil their responsibilities or should any conflict

86
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,790
between the stakeholders arise.

87
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,302
