00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:09,470
STELLA BACHTIS: Let's take a closer look

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,270
at the initiation phase of the project management life

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,120
cycle using one of our animated scenarios.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,320
You'll remember Anne, the events manager.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,620
Let's deal with the first question.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,570
Is this a project?

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,620
In this scenario Anne is planning

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,910
a wedding for her clients.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,860
The bride and groom to be, who are her key stakeholders,

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,040
have provided Anne with the objectives

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,230
that need to be achieved together

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,000
with a number of deliverables.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,540
Moreover, there is a defined start and end date

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,820
to have the project completed.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,280
Therefore, from the outset, Anne can definitively

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,970
confirm that this is a project.

17
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,760
The second question that she needs to consider

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,560
is what is the problem or the challenge?

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,910
One of Anne's biggest challenges in this project

20
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,500
is to make a memorable day for the couple

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,080
without any issues within an eight week period.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,090
In taking a closer look at what Anne needs to achieve,

23
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,620
she will need to consider how she

24
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,180
will go about coordinating all the activities for this wedding

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,430
event.

26
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,430
The third question that needs to be dealt with is resourcing.

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,040
That is, what do I need?

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,600
Anne will need to consider all of the resources

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,520
that she needs to get the project rolling.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,390
This would include human resources,

31
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,480
suppliers, materials, and, most importantly, time.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,740
The last question that needs to be addressed in this phase

33
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,290
is what are my options?

34
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,710
Anne is an experienced event planner,

35
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,980
and therefore has various options to consider.

36
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,200
Before proposing these options, Anne

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,030
needs to be clear on what type of wedding the couple wants.

38
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,870
She can then suggest different options

39
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,600
on a range of venues, themes, flower arrangements, wedding

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,620
cakes, and wedding dresses.

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,420
Once she has explored all options,

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,690
she can then move forward.

43
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,130
The concept of exploring multiple options

44
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,360
in the initiation phase of a project

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,510
is to ensure that a range of possibilities

46
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,730
has been considered.

47
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,070
Too often the default setting is returned to "what is"

48
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,380
type of thinking, rather than going

49
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,080
beyond what currently exists and thinking more innovatively

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,520
about achieving project outcomes.

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,990
So what is the benefit of spending time

52
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,510
in this initiation phase of the project life cycle?

53
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,350
Well, if you don't have clarity in terms of who, what, when,

54
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,840
where, why, and how of the project

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,170
and rush into the next phase, you

56
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,680
will find yourself returning to initiation

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,110
and rethinking all of your options, which

58
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,880
will result in a waste of time, money, and resources.

59
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,690
Having a clear overview or high-level plan

60
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,390
allows you to move smoothly into the next phase

61
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,540
of planning without leaving any value on the table.

62
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,910
In the following video, you'll hear from Rob, a project

63
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,400
manager, who will talk us through his approach

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,578
to project initiation.

65
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:11,078
