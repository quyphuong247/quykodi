3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,440
Let me tell you a story that is disturbing,
but true.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,980
In the year 2000, a 40 year old man was arrested for possessing child pornography, and molesting his 8 year old stepdaughter.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:28,060
The man had no previous history of pedophilia, and he said that he was baffled and dismayed by what appeared to be a sudden turn in his sexual behavior.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,120
While he was awaiting his day in court, the
man began to complain of terrible headaches.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,540
A brain scan revealed a large tumor in his orbitofrontal cortex, the part of the brain known to control sexual impulse.

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,900
The tumor was removed, and, it turned out,
so were his pedophilic impulses.

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,480
But about a year later, those impulses returned.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,000
Another scan revealed that the tumor had returned
as well.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,660
So, a second surgery removed the tumor, and the pedophilic behavior diminished, this time for good.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,300
Now, here’s a question: Was that man’s
really horrible behavior a matter of free will?

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,600
Or was it determined – by what turned out
to be a medical condition?

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,720
Or was it neither?

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,020
Could it even have been both?

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:14,180
[Theme Music]

17
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,260
So far we’ve considered two metaphysical
positions regarding the freeness – or not

18
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,979
– of our actions: hard determinism and libertarian
free will.

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,360
If you’ve found both of them to be wanting,
well, compatibilism might just be for you.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,500
Compatibilists believe, somewhat like hard
determinists, that the universe operates with

21
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,979
law-like order, and that the past determines
the future.

22
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,659
But they also think there’s something different
about some human actions;

23
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,660
that some of the actions we take really are
free.

24
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,130
This view, known as soft determinism, says
that everything is actually determined,

25
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,980
but we can still call an action free when
the determination comes from within ourselves.

26
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,540
It’s like the difference between someone being pushed off a diving board, as opposed to jumping.

27
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,740
The result is the same – you end up in the water –
but it does look like the cause is different.

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,120
In case 1, the cause is the pusher, while
in case 2, the cause is the jumper.

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,540
Compatibilists say that in both cases, the action is determined – that is, it couldn’t not happen.

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:15,940
But when the action of an agent is self-determined – or determined by causes internal to herself – the action should be considered free.

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,400
This means that we might have moral responsibility
for our actions,

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,000
since the determination for some of our acts
can come from us alone.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,080
And this was something, you’ll recall, that
hard determinists seemed to have to give up.

34
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,170
But, it’s unclear how meaningful moral responsibility
really is, in this view.

35
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,960
After all, if we’re still determined, just by our own internal factors, then in what sense are we actually responsible?

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,030
Which brings us back to the man with the brain
tumor.

37
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,600
If a growth in your brain, which you have
no control over, causes you to have impulses

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,400
that you also have no control over – do
you act freely if you act on those urges?

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,420
Pedophilia-inducing brain tumors are, luckily, rare, but there are much more common cases that are similar.

40
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,180
For example, should we hold people who suffer from severe mental illnesses responsible for their actions?

41
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,860
After all, the causes of their actions are
internal to themselves.

42
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,780
So a compatibilist might be inclined to say
that they’re free.

43
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,860
Yet it seems wrong to blame someone who’s in the grip of, say, hallucinations in the same way that we’d blame someone who’s not.

44
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,460
What about someone who becomes flirty after
a few drinks?

45
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,450
Do we assign that behavior to the drinker,
or on the drinks?

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,980
The drinker’s actions are caused by factors
internal to themself – the alcohol, sure,

47
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,580
but also their body chemistry, how much they ate before drinking, and who knows how many other factors.

48
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,000
Last time, we learned about the Principle
of Alternate Possibilities, and the long-standing

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,660
belief that, in order for an action to be free, an agent has to have been able to do something other than what they’ve done.

50
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,980
But contemporary American philosopher Harry
Frankfurt challenges this idea, by arguing

51
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,100
that an agent could, in some cases, be morally responsible for things he does, even when he couldn’t have done otherwise.

52
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,710
We call these situations Frankfurt Cases,

53
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,510
which brings us to the Thought Bubble to explore
one in this week’s Flash Philosophy.

54
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,520
Suppose there’s a fervent supporter of the
Democratic party, and he comes up with a crazy

55
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,250
plan to make sure his party wins in the next
election.

56
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,319
He decides to abduct voters and plant devices
in their brains –

57
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,220
– something that, as far as I know, neither
party has tried yet!

58
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,709
Now, these devices are designed to remain
dormant unless a voter is going to vote Republican,

59
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,390
in which case it’ll activate, and compel
them to vote Democratic.

60
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,300
Now, suppose that you were one of the unlucky abductees, and you head to the polls with a device in your brain.

61
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,020
But, you’ve always been a lifelong Democrat, and device or no device, you have every intention of voting Democratic this time.

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,220
You enter the polling booth, vote a straight
Democratic ticket, and head home.

63
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,300
Since you never had any intention of doing anything other than voting Democratic, the device was never activated.

64
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,689
However, if you had decided to vote Republican,
you would have been prevented from doing so.

65
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:43,629
The Principle of Alternate Possibilities says you were not free in this case, because you couldn’t have done otherwise.

66
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:47,520
Even if you’d tried to vote Republican you
would still have voted for Democrats.

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,180
But, Frankfurt argues: You were still clearly
responsible for your vote.

68
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,020
You were responsible, because you did what you wanted to do, even though you could not have done otherwise.

69
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,040
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So what do you think?

70
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,140
Not about the next election – I mean, can you be responsible without being able to do otherwise?

71
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,020
If you wanted to watch Crash Course, and would’ve
watched it on your own,

72
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,600
but now it’s playing in class and you don’t actually have any choice, are you watching me freely?

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,840
Frankfurt Cases play on an intuition that many of us share – the idea that you’re responsible for actions you’ve chosen.

74
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,919
And your choice needs to come from within
yourself, rather than from outside factors.

75
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,090
But it’s unclear whether we can actually
separate internal factors from external ones.

76
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,099
A group of friends pressuring you to get high
is an external factor,

77
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,980
but your desire to conform, or maybe your desire not to care what others think of you, comes from within you.

78
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,080
Or does it?

79
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,060
Isn’t your personality – and how you respond to different situations – shaped by your parents, and friends, and earlier experiences?

80
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,169
Many think these kinds of examples reveal
deep problems with compatibilism.

81
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:50,869
If we can’t separate internal and external causes, maybe the answer is to simply say that actions are “more or less free.”

82
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:55,220
And how free they are depends on how many
internal factors are influencing us,

83
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,160
and how many external, and how much control we really
have over what we do.

84
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,120
This is the view taken by contemporary Canadian-American philosopher Patricia Churchland.

85
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,200
Churchland points out that, as social animals, we can’t help but hold people accountable, and assign either praise or blame for their actions.

86
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:17,260
But it also makes sense to think about how much, or how little, someone is in control of their actions, when assigning praise or blame.

87
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,280
After all, some actions are beyond our control,
like sneezing.

88
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,840
So I won’t blame you for sneezing, because
you can’t really control that.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,620
But I definitely will blame you for sneezing on my lunch, because you do have control over where you sneeze.

90
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,160
Likewise, I might blame you less for rude behavior when you’ve been drinking, as opposed to when you’re sober,

91
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,460
but I probably won’t let you completely off the hook, because, at least under normal circumstances, you had control over your decision to drink.

92
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:45,569
So, Churchland says, asking “Am I free?”
is really the wrong question.

93
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,149
Instead, we should be asking, “How much
control do I have?”

94
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:52,650
And the more control we have, the more responsibility
we also have.

95
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,479
This view lets us keep what we know about
the deterministic nature of the universe,

96
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,439
while also making sense of our subjective
feeling of freedom.

97
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,659
So really, “feeling free” really just
means “having control”

98
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:09,620
We know disturbances in the brain can undermine our control, from seizures and tics to the pedophilic impulses that developed in the brain tumor patient.

99
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,740
But we also know that our brains can be trained to develop control over many aspects of our behavior.

100
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,480
Like the way you used to just pee whenever your bladder was full, but now you’re able to control when and where you pee.

101
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,140
Congratulations on that, by the way.

102
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,460
But this means that we can choose to develop stronger levels of control over many of our actions,

103
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,420
which is what we do when we work to break
a bad habit, or ingrain a good one.

104
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:35,920
Now, libertarians will point out that being caused to do something by internal factors still keeps our actions from being truly free.

105
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,920
These folks won’t be satisfied with Churchland’s answer, because it says that every one of our choices is still determined by something.

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,480
So we can’t ever make an undetermined choice.

107
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,000
But today, whether determined or not, we talked
about compatibilism.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,280
We considered whether our internally motivated actions can be understood as free in a deterministic world.

109
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,300
We also talked about Frankfurt Cases.

110
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,860
And we looked at Patricia Churchland’s rejection
of the free-or-not-free dichotomy and her

111
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,240
focus on the amount of control we have over
our actions.

112
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,080
Next time we’re going to move into a new
unit, on the philosophy of language.
