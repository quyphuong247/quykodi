00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,830
Who is The Doctor? Is it this guy?
Or this one? How about him?

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,530
As any good Whovian knows, the answer is yes,
all of them.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,370
But, also, wait: No.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,420
In the show Doctor Who, each incarnation of
The Doctor has a completely different body,

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,280
different mannerisms, likes and dislikes and,
to some extent, memories.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,920
So… how are they all The Doctor?

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,580
Science fiction is great at giving us scenarios to grapple with that seem far-out and only barely possible.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,380
But when you think about it, the issue of Who is Who isn’t that much more clear-cut in real life.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,780
The fact is, you can take the same questions I asked about The Doctor, and ask them about anyone.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,880
Like…me. I mean, are these people any more similar
to each other…than these people?

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,240
Last time, we talked about identity – or basically, what makes an object the same over time.

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,220
And the concept can get more complex when we talk about our own identity, or the identity of others.

16
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,000
When talking about ships or trees, we might be willing to say yeah, ok, that’s just not the same thing it used to be.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,140
But when we’re talking about, say, me!

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,280
I have the strong belief that I’m the same person that mom and dad brought home from the hospital back in 1980.

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,420
I’m that same kid that cut his hand open
on that broken flower pot – I have the scar to prove it!

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,780
And there’s some guy in the future who’s still going to be me, even though he’ll be all stooped over,

21
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,100
and wrinkled, and gray.
At least, I hope.

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,560
And you probably think of yourself in the same way – that you’ll keep being the same person, from birth to death.

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,479
But, you could argue
– and some have –

24
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,079
that the only thing that really remains constant
about you your whole life is your name.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,760
And for some of us, even that changes!

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,540
Philosophers have struggled with the issue
of personal identity for a long time,

27
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,670
trying to find that special something – that
essential property –

28
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,050
that makes you you, the thing that preserves
your identity through time,

29
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,040
and through all the changes that come with
it.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Let’s take a look at some of ideas they’ve
come up with.

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,840
First there’s the Body Theory.

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,140
This is sort of the default position that
most people have

33
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,890
– and the assumption that Doctor Who messes
with so badly.

34
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,480
It says that personal identity persists over time because you remain in the same body from birth to death.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,420
Now, in a sense, that’s true – I don’t know anybody outside of, like, Freaky Friday that’s had a body transplant.

36
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,980
But, it’s not like you consist of all of the same, identical stuff that you had when you were born.

37
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,900
You’ve sloughed off and replaced your outer
layer of skin, for example, hundreds of times so far.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,560
Your red blood cells only live about 4 months
before they’re cycled out.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,080
Even your skeleton is constantly being remodeled.

40
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,550
So, kind of like the Doctor – or the Ship
of Theseus –

41
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,539
you’re constantly being replaced by new
physical versions of yourself.

42
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,779
And if you are your body, then how much of
you can change until you become a new you?

43
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:49,249
Can you get a haircut? What if you lose or
gain a lot of weight?

44
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,120
Or grow a beard? Or put John Travolta’s
face on your face?

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,000
Let’s go over to the Thought Bubble and explore the ideas of our bodies, and ourselves, with some Flash Philosophy!

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,719
20th century English moral philosopher Bernard
Williams proposed a thought experiment,

47
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,109
to make us consider where we think our personal
identity resides.

48
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:10,609
It goes something like this:
You and I have been kidnapped by a mad scientist.

49
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:15,111
He tells us that, tomorrow morning, he’s
going to transfer all of your mental content –

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,000
all of your beliefs, memories, personality,
everything – into my brain.

51
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,190
And then he’s gonna move all of my mental
content into your brain.

52
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,980
Presumably, this is how he earned the title
of mad scientist.

53
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,930
But he also tells us that, after the procedure
is complete

54
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,109
– and your mental content is in this body,
and my mental content is in yours –

55
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:37,790
he’ll give one of the bodies a million dollars,
and the other body will be tortured.

56
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,249
And he’s decided to let you pick which body
gets the torture and which one gets the cash.

57
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:48,069
What do you decide? Your answer should give you a clue about where you think your identity lies.

58
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,220
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

59
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,680
Now our friend John Locke didn’t cotton to the idea that the most essential aspect of a person is her body.

60
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,400
For Locke, the thing that makes you you is
the non-physical stuff – your consciousness.

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,559
But Locke recognized that we don’t maintain a single consciousness over the course of our entire lives.

62
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,040
We go to sleep every day, but, when we wake up, our conscious selves remember who we were the day before.

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,600
So Locke posited a Memory Theory of personal
identity.

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,540
He believed that your identity persists over time, because you retain memories of yourself at different points,

65
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,620
and each of those memories is connected to
one before it.

66
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,040
Now, we don’t remember every single moment – I mean, do you remember what you ate for lunch last Tuesday?

67
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,700
But you can probably remember a time when you did remember that – like, say, last Tuesday afternoon.

68
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,020
And if you can remember that version of yourself,

69
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,629
then you’re still connected to the Tuesday-at-lunch
person, through a chain of memory.

70
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:40,529
And this process can take us back a lot farther
than last Tuesday.

71
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,740
Locke said that if you can remember back to
your first day of kindergarten,

72
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,319
you maintain a memory link to that person.

73
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,150
Sure, your Mom also remembers that day, but
no one remembers it from the inside –

74
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,160
the butterflies in your stomach; the way your new shoes felt stiff after a summer of running barefoot.

75
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,660
That’s your memory, and since it’s yours, you must be the same person who experienced that memory.

76
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,300
The memory theory actually makes a lot of sense, but it’s got some problems of its own.

77
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,200
First off, no one remembers being born.

78
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,380
Now that’s not a bad thing, really – I mean, I imagine none of us would really want to recall that particular experience

79
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:15,539
– or the couple of years that we spent after
that, pooping in our pants.

80
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,200
But, if personal identity requires a memory, then none of us became who we are until our first memory,

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,840
which means we all lost at least a couple
years at the beginning.

82
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,550
What’s more,
if you’re committed to this view,

83
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,610
you have to accept that people stop being
the same person if they lose their memories.

84
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,970
So, say a person begins to suffer from dementia.

85
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,170
Once he’s lost the ability to remember his
past, does he stop being that person?

86
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,750
So the memory theory presents problems for
both the beginnings and ends of life,

87
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,270
but there’s also the issue of false memories.

88
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,639
Memory, after all, is notoriously tricky.

89
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,689
We know that a group of eyewitnesses are likely
to recount the same event very differently.

90
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:51,540
So, how do we know that the memories we have
are accurate?

91
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,800
And if they’re not – if things didn’t
actually happen the way you remember –

92
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,680
then how do those faulty memories influence
your identity?

93
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,590
Do they make you a partially fictional person?

94
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,919
So, at first, Locke’s theory seems to have
some advantages over the Body Theory,

95
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,379
because consciousness and memory persist through
your body’s physical changes.

96
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,090
But, after just a little interrogation, you
find that memory is pretty tenuous too.

97
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,110
Now, here’s the sixty-four-thousand-Altairian-dollar
question:

98
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,620
Does any of this really matter?

99
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,360
Like, who cares if there’s a you that persists
from your birth to your death?

100
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,300
Maybe all you feel like you need to know is that your self has to go to work and pay bills, and that’s plenty.

101
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,389
But the matter of personal identity isn’t
just a conceptual puzzle.

102
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,590
It’s also deeply important when you’re
thinking about how you should live your life.

103
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,569
For example, do you believe that you have
obligations to particular people in your life?

104
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:40,460
Well, if those people don’t persist as distinct identities, then your obligations might not either.

105
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,780
And the same goes for how people think about
you.

106
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,520
Your boss only has to give you the raise she
promised you,

107
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,090
if each of you remains the same person you
were when she made the promise.

108
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,660
In fact, if next Friday, you’re not the same person anymore, she doesn’t even have to pay you!

109
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,300
The fact is, we’ve all built our lives and
our society on the expectations that

110
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,960
individuals will continue to be who they are, unchanged – and those people expect the same thing out of you.

111
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,920
So now you can see…this really is your problem.
You expect a paycheck.

112
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,939
You expect people to keep their promises.

113
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,379
But as we learned back with Clifford and James
and epistemic responsibility,

114
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,759
you don’t just get to believe things without
reasons.

115
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,700
So if you think you deserve that paycheck,
you need to figure out why.

116
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,380
Today we talked about personal identity.

117
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,039
We considered the two main answers people give to the question of where your identity lies –

118
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,539
in your body, or in the connected memories
of your consciousness.

119
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,280
We found some pretty significant problems
with each of them,

120
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,920
and then we talked about why the persistence of identity is actually something you should care about!

121
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,420
Next time, we’ll return to this issue, to talk about whether you really need the idea of a “you” that persists over time.

122
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,060
If you still exist then, I hope you join me.
