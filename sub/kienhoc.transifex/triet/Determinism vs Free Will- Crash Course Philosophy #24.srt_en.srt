00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,480
Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that
you love your father.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,390
By which I mean, you want him to be alive.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,920
And let’s also assume that you don’t have any attachments to your mother that you might describe as... romantic.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,840
Well, guess who thought felt the same way about his parents? Oedipus.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,620
According to ancient Greek legend, when Oedipus
was born,

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,990
a prophecy foretold that he would kill his
father and marry his mother.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:36,510
So his father left baby Oedipus in the wilderness,
assuming he would die,

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,700
and the prophecy would then not come true.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,150
But instead, the abandoned baby was discovered
and raised by another family.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,330
As an adult, Oedipus learned of the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother.

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,930
So, not knowing he was adopted, he left his adoptive parents in order to avoid fulfilling that prophecy,

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,400
figuring that if he wasn’t near them, it
couldn’t come true.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,100
Lo and behold, as he was trying to flee his fate, Oedipus killed a stranger in a fit of rage,

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,079
who turned out to be the father he had never
met.

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,550
He then proceeded to marry the dead man’s
widow,

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,470
who was actually his mother, though he didn’t
know it.

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,880
Needless to say, this is a fate that, needless to say, any of us would like to avoid.

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,900
But for philosophers, the whole point of the story of Oedipus is: there is no escaping fate.

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:27,560
[Theme Music]

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,900
Are we free?

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,260
I mean, on the one hand, most of us have the
clear sense that we are.

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,260
We feel free.

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,300
We feel like we make all sorts of decisions that lead to both beliefs and actions that are wholly of our own choosing.

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,570
Like, I could do that.

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,140
I had oatmeal this morning because I felt
like it.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,780
This view – that humans are capable of entirely free actions – is known as libertarian free will.

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,860
And to be clear, libertarian free will is
nothing like political libertarianism.

30
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,980
Both views get their name from the word liberty,

31
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,480
but political libertarians are all about freedom
from government intervention,

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,480
while people who accept libertarian free will could be anything from political libertarians to socialists.

33
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,180
They just think that, metaphysically, we can
act freely.

34
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,890
So a lot of us figure that our thoughts and
actions are free.

35
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,760
But, most of us also believe that every effect
has a cause,

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,060
And that everything that happens now, in the
present,

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,020
is the necessary result of events that occurred
in the past.

38
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,390
This view is known as hard determinism.

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,910
And many of the people watching this probably
think that they believe in both things;

40
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,430
that many of your actions are free, and that
the world is governed by cause and effect.

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,050
But, it turns out, you can’t rationally
hold both views.

42
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,840
Because, traditionally, libertarians have defined free actions according to what’s known as the Principle of Alternate Possibilities.

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,410
That might sound like the plot device for
a sci-fi show,

44
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,390
but this principle says that an action is
free only if the agent

45
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,590
– that is, the person doing the thing –
could have done otherwise.

46
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,190
So, truly free actions require options.

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,340
Determinism, by contrast, doesn’t allow
options.

48
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,900
It holds that every event is caused by a previous
event.

49
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,959
Which means that an agent can never have done
anything other than what they did,

50
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,730
and therefore, they are never free.

51
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,900
But let’s look at these two options more
closely.

52
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,660
And also, let’s look at my breakfast.

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,040
Libertarianism says that my decision to eat
oatmeal this morning

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,820
wasn’t necessarily caused by anything that
happened before it.

55
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,680
Instead, it could have been the result of
non-physical events

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,570
– specifically, my own thoughts –
that originated right at that point.

57
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,380
I ate oatmeal because I decided to eat oatmeal!

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,489
End of story.

59
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,529
But libertarianism runs counter to what we
know about the workings of the physical world,

60
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,120
with one thing causing another.

61
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,160
So libertarians need a way to account for
their view.

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,440
One way they do that is by making a distinction between what’s known as event causation, and agent causation.

63
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,640
Event causation means that no physical event can occur without having been caused by a previous physical event.

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,800
So, many libertarians concede that the physical
world itself is deterministic.

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,270
Like, a baseball is flying through the air
because someone hit that ball with a bat.

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,580
But many libertarians also argue that there’s
such a thing as agent causation,

67
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,879
which says that an agent
– a being propelled by a mind –

68
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,610
can start a whole chain of causality that
wasn’t caused by anything else.

69
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,209
So, the person who hit the ball most likely
did so because they just decided to do it.

70
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,269
By this logic, agents have the ability to
affect the causal chain of the universe.

71
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:13,189
They can make stuff happen on their own.

72
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:16,269
But, many philosophers find this idea untenable.

73
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,820
Where would these free decisions, the ones that launch entirely new causal chains, come from, they ask?

74
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,240
Are they simply random?

75
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,270
What would compel an agent to make one decision,
and not another?

76
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,320
And if you can answer those questions – if you can explain what would cause an agent to act –

77
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,910
Then well, you’ve just reinforced the position
that actions are caused, rather than free.

78
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,070
The fact is, it’s pretty difficult to find
arguments that support libertarian free will.

79
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,320
The best argument in favor of it seems to be that it just feels an awful lot like we’re free.

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,699
And libertarians argue that we shouldn’t discount the legitimacy of our own personal, subjective experiences –

81
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,959
so if we feel so free, we should seriously
consider the possibility that we are.

82
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,940
That point has a certain intuitive appeal.

83
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,840
But if you can’t come up with an argument
to defend your feeling,

84
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,920
then good philosophical reasoning recommends
that you reject it,

85
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,780
or at least withhold judgment until you can
get some evidence together.

86
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,790
So now let’s see if the hard determinists
can do any better.

87
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,740
18th century French philosopher Baron D’Holbach said that none of our actions are actually free.

88
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,140
D’Holbach believed that everything that’s happening right now is the result of an unbroken chain of events.

89
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,860
Everything, he said, is the inevitable result
of what came before.

90
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,820
Including everything that we do!

91
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,800
Our actions are caused in the same way that, say, home runs are caused by bats hitting balls,

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,780
or tornadoes are caused by warm air systems
hitting cool air systems in the right conditions.

93
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,220
This means that humans and our actions are just part of the physical world, bound by its physical laws.

94
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,500
This belief is often explained through a view
known as reductionism.

95
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,120
Reductionism is the view that all parts of
the world, and of our own experience,

96
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,680
can be traced back – or reduced down – to
one singular thing.

97
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
So, for example, you see your mind as being
capable of making free decisions.

98
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,820
You think that what goes on in your head when you make a choice is not at all like bats and balls.

99
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,700
But, well, mental states are brain states,
or at least they’re tied directly to your brain.

100
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,580
And brain states are biological.

101
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,840
And biological states are physical states.

102
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,140
And the physical world – as we already said
– is deterministic.

103
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,720
There’s just no room for free will in this
picture.

104
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,150
We think we’re free - but we’re not.

105
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,280
And really, as scientific thinkers, why would
we assume that we are?

106
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,760
Why would we think that we’re any different
than everything else in the universe?

107
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,660
What would make us so special?

108
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,780
Libertarians are right that it’s really
hard to disregard the feeling of freedom.

109
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,620
If I didn’t choose to eat oatmeal this morning,
why do I feel like I did?

110
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,979
And what made me do it?

111
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,280
But hard determinists say that the difference
between the causes of human actions

112
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,170
and the causes of physical events
– like a bat hitting a ball –

113
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,150
is that our actions have all sorts of invisible
causes that happen in our brains.

114
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:48,200
Specifically, when beliefs team up with our desires and our temperament, they say, you get a deliberate human action.

115
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,380
Combine my belief that oatmeal is nutritious,
with my desire for healthy nourishment,

116
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,240
and the temperament that predisposes me to
enjoy warm, carby comfort foods,

117
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,480
and ta-da! – you get oatmealy breakfast!

118
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,850
Now, you might argue that those particular
beliefs, desires, and temperaments

119
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,690
might lead to any number of breakfast choices
– cream of wheat, maybe, or some granola.

120
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,810
But, if you dig deep enough, you’d see that
there are factors that rule out those options

121
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,550
– as well as every other option.

122
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,140
Maybe I’m a little worried about one of
my fillings coming loose,

123
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,680
so I’m shying away from the granola because
it’s too crunchy.

124
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,140
Or I just don’t think about cream of wheat
very often.

125
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,380
I mean, they don’t have very good brand
awareness anymore.

126
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,759
What even is cream of wheat exactly?

127
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,910
And the oatmeal is sitting right there in
front of me.

128
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,340
Or maybe I think briefly of making one of those quinoa breakfast bowls that are so hip right now.

129
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,500
But my lazy temperament, or my belief that
I’m running late,

130
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,720
pushes me to choose the 90-seconds-in-the-microwave
option.

131
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
See how it works?

132
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,550
All you have to do is change one factor

133
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,410
– a belief, desire, or temperament –
and you’ll get a different outcome.

134
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,280
Hard determinists argue that, just because
we can’t pinpoint the exact factors that

135
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,500
led us to an action, we could, in theory isolate
them –

136
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,060
if we knew enough about all the beliefs, desires,
and temperaments swirling around in our brains.

137
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,940
So, in this view, what we call “decisions” are really just the inevitable results of a bunch of mental stuff combining in just the right way.

138
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,500
And maybe it feels free.
But it’s not.

139
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,840
But hold up!
Isn’t there some way out of this?

140
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,960
Like, what if I have someone choose my breakfast
for me?

141
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,870
Or what if I fall back on randomness, by,
like, flipping a coin?

142
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,030
After all, if I just flipped a coin, then it wouldn’t look like that decision was made by beliefs, desires, and temperaments.

143
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,830
But, well, no such luck.

144
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,349
Because even if I thought I chose randomly,
my decision to flip the coin,

145
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,940
or who I asked to pick for me, was just as
determined as everything else.

146
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
And guess what!

147
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,100
If you’re getting angry right now about
me telling you none of your choices are free,

148
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,380
well, that anger was determined!

149
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,570
If you’re finding this whole topic confusing,
or boring yep – still determined.

150
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,849
You think you can just freely choose to stop
playing this video, but if you’re still

151
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,969
watching me, good news: that’s determined
too!

152
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,880
Determinists believe that you can’t help but feel and react the way you’re reacting right now.

153
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:48,360
You can think you’re choosing to act in
ways that conform to the character that you’ve

154
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:52,440
selected and shaped for yourself, but even
that “choice” is the result of all sorts

155
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,980
of already-determined factors about you and
your place in the world.

156
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,879
Hard determinism is tough to refute.

157
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,100
And it has some really uncomfortable implications.

158
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,760
It means the deeply held feeling most of us
have that we actually make free decisions?

159
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,060
Is just wrong.

160
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:09,759
And the whole concept of personal responsibility
is thrown out the window, too.

161
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,149
As D’Holbach put it, we’re all just “cogs
in a machine,”

162
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,029
doing what we were always meant to do, with
no actual volition.

163
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,449
Oedipus had to kill his dad and marry his
mom.

164
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:22,170
I had to eat the oatmeal.

165
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,720
And you? You just had to keep watching!
You couldn’t turn away!

166
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,800
Today we learned about libertarian free will
and it’s counterpoint, hard determinism.

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,720
Next time, we’ll see if some middle ground can be found between determinism and libertarianism.

168
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,580
And I sure hope there can be.

169
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,160
