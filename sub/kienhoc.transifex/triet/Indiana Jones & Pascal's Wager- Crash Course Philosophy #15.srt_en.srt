3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,990
Remember when you were little and your mom told you to eat your spinach so you’d grow up big and strong?

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,010
Or in college, when you set your clock ten minutes ahead, to fool yourself into getting to class on time?

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,530
We all engage in useful fictions – things that we choose to believe, because, they just make life easier.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,710
And when we do this, we are being pragmatists.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,600
Pragmatism is based on the theory that finding
true beliefs is

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,259
less important than finding beliefs that work,
practically, in the living of your life.

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,119
In this view, it doesn’t really matter whether
spinach actually helps muscle growth;

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,120
if eating spinach will improve your life, and believing that it’ll make you strong convinces you to eat it

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,740
– then it’s a useful belief, which is
all that matters.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,560
Pragmatism is relatively recent as philosophical
movements go.

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,710
But some of the most well-known American pragmatists

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,540
– like William James, and, I would argue,
Indiana Jones –

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,920
have an ideological ancestor in 17th century
mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,129
You can be a pragmatist about basically anything –

17
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,500
knowledge, spinach, metaphysics, ethics,
or whether it’s actually 11:30 right now or 11:40.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,860
But Pascal took a pragmatic approach to one of the biggest issues in philosophy: God’s existence.

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:20,300
[Theme Music]

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,460
Pascal was a theist, which, given his place
in history may not be all that surprising.

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,040
But what is weird is that Pascal’s argument for God’s existence had very little to do with whether God was actually real.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,100
Instead, it had everything to do with with
whether belief in his existence was practical.

23
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,660
This reasoning became known as Pascal’s Wager, and it’s really a gambler’s argument for religious belief.

24
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,500
Pascal’s thinking went like this:

25
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:45,579
Either God exists or he doesn’t, and reason
will never give us an answer.

26
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,900
So you must choose blindly to believe or not to
believe in God – you can’t abstain from choosing

27
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,420
If you choose to believe in God and he exists,
you get an infinite reward – heaven.

28
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,200
If you choose to believe in God and he doesn’t
exist, you’re not really out much.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,229
If you choose not to believe in God and he
doesn’t exist, you also don’t gain much.

30
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:08,560
If you choose not to believe in God and he
does exist, you get infinite punishment – hell.

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,549
Therefore, the smart bet is to put your
chips on God existing, every time.

32
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:17,460
Pascal argued that, if there is the slightest chance that God exists – even if that chance is low –

33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,919
only a fool would bet against his existence,
given that the stakes are so high.

34
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,279
In the face of incomplete information, Pascal
decided,

35
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:27,679
we should play the odds, and believe whatever
offers us the greatest benefit.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
It’s kind of brilliant, right?

37
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,800
But there are a couple of ways you could argue
against this.

38
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:34,059
You might say Pascal’s done the math wrong
– that choosing to walk the straight and

39
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:37,719
narrow in the service of an imaginary deity
actually does cost you something.

40
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,879
Like, you might miss out on stuff that you
would otherwise want to do –

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,939
like, sleeping in on Sunday mornings, or living a heavy-metal-rock-star lifestyle, or, I dunno, coveting stuff.

42
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,540
By this logic, you’d lose out if you abstained
from all of that in the name of something

43
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,010
that ended up not being real.

44
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,010
But Pascal, like William James, disagreed
with this line of reasoning,

45
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,650
because he saw great personal benefit in being
a believer.

46
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,120
He thought theists have better lives, not because God is blessing them as some kind of reward,

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,659
but because belief simply has inherent benefits –

48
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,780
like the security of feeling that the world
is ordered and meaningful…

49
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,800
That someone is always looking out for you…

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,140
That death isn’t the end.

51
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,940
Now, even if you agree that religious belief is comforting, you might still question Pascal’s motives.

52
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,040
Does believing in something because it’s
the safest bet really win you a ticket to heaven?

53
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,249
Doesn’t God want you to be less self-interested
when it comes to believing in him?

54
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:23,699
Well, not according to Pascal.

55
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,539
He thought how and why you choose to believe
doesn’t really matter, because the fact is,

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,360
God doesn’t care how he gets you, as long
as he gets you.

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,760
OK, so how do you will yourself into believing in something, just because it’s where the smart money is?

58
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,049
Easy! Pascal said you essentially brainwash
yourself into true belief,

59
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:42,909
so that what starts out as self-interest can
eventually grow into an honest conviction.

60
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,540
And you do this, basically, by walking the
walk and talking the talk.

61
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,430
Start going to church. Start praying.
Hang out with other believers.

62
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,720
At first it might seem weird and disingenuous, but over time, it’ll become an ingrained part of your belief system.

63
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,460
You know what it’s kind of like?
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

64
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,010
It’s probably pop-culture’s finest allegory
of pragmatic belief in action.

65
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,829
Throughout the whole Indiana Jones trilogy – I’m just gonna pretend the fourth one was never made –

66
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,519
Indy is painted as a pretty agnostic character.

67
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,439
He hunts religious relics for a living,

68
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,189
but the powers that those relics are said
to possess are just “hocus pocus” to him.

69
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:16,250
So, at the end of The Last Crusade,
(spoilers) Indy manages to find the Holy Grail,

70
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,889
in an ancient temple, after getting through
a bunch of booby traps.

71
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,019
And each trap is kind of a test of faith.

72
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,840
He has to know where to kneel, and how to
spell the name of God,

73
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,169
and he has to jump into an abyss with the
hope that he will somehow survive.

74
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,229
Indy ends up passing all of these tests.

75
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:35,580
But not because he suddenly stops being agnostic and starts believing in God – at least not that we know of.

76
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,780
Instead, he just does what he has to do.
He’s literally going through the motions.

77
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,220
There’s something about that, that would
make Pascal proud.

78
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,760
Because, to him, it would probably look like Indy was on the path to eventually, truly believing.

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,720
Now, some critics have pointed out that, when
it comes to a really usable belief system,

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,139
you’re gonna need morethan just: fake it
‘til you make it.

81
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,560
For example, maybe you were one of those kids, raised in a religious household, who was just never feeling it.

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,960
We all know people who were immersed in a
culture of religious belief from birth,

83
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,990
but end up to rejecting those beliefs as adults.

84
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,909
And for those people, trying to force yourself
to believe is not only ineffective,

85
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:10,479
it can lead to some pretty serious unhappiness
– the exact opposite of what a pragmatist wants.

86
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,900
So it might be that, for a pragmatist, the best advice for non-believers is that they just gotta live their lives.

87
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,020
Maybe they’ll find God and maybe they won’t,

88
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,080
but making yourself swallow it like medicine
doesn’t seem like the way to maximize belief.

89
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,440
OK, so Pascal said that we should believe
in God because belief is just practically useful.

90
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,560
But Soren Kierkegaard, the 19th century Danish
philosopher, went even further.

91
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,140
He adopted the famous tenant of fideism, stating:
“I believe because it is absurd to believe.”

92
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,599
Fideism is the school of thought that says
religious belief has to come from faith alone.

93
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:44,820
It says that stuff like arguments and evidence
actually kill what’s great about religion

94
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,710
– which is wonder and mystery.

95
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,970
Kierkegaard said that the fantastic thing
about belief in God is that it’s entirely irrational

96
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,919
– you can’t do it with your brain.

97
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,479
You have to take what he called the leap to
faith.

98
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,719
And, again, here I turn to Indiana Jones.

99
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:02,009
Remember when Indy faces his last test of
faith-slash-booby trap in the Last Crusade?

100
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,110
He has to try to make an impossible jump across
a scary dark pit to get to the Holy Grail.

101
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,509
There is no way he can do it – it’s suicide.

102
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,599
But, it turns out, there’s a bridge.

103
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,479
He can’t see it, but in order to find out
that it’s there, he has to take that step.

104
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,700
He has to take a chance on something that
defies all reason.

105
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,400
That’s what religion is all about, according
to Kierkegaard.

106
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:24,460
We jump and hope like hell that God catches
us.

107
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,550
And the only way to know, is to jump.

108
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,449
We have to surrender reason to get to truth.

109
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,569
Now, I hate to break it to you, but this is
the end of our unit on the philosophy of religion.

110
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:37,270
I’m interested to hear what you think about
that in the comments.

111
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,450
But before we go, I want to head to the Thought
Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

112
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,870
Our old friend Bertrand Russell once posited
the existence of a china teapot,

113
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,379
orbiting the sun somewhere between Earth and
Mars.

114
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,100
Let’s say that back on Earth there were a
bunch of Teapot-ists, people who argued that,

115
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,669
since we can’t disprove the teapot’s existence,
they were justified in believing in it.

116
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:01,159
Not only that, they constructed great buildings, erected statues, composed songs, held weekly services,

117
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,729
and appealed to the teapot for help in their
daily lives.

118
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:07,999
But everyone else thought the Teapot-ists
were ridiculous, because there was no evidence

119
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,830
to support their belief in the teapot.

120
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,550
For their part, the Teapot-ists just replied that none of the Ateapot-ists could prove that it wasn’t there.

121
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,700
Thanks, Thought Bubble! Aaand I’m sure you
can see where I’m going with this.

122
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,360
Pragmatism, or the leap to faith, might be
a solution to the problem of God’s existence,

123
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,420
if you’re not satisfied with any of the
other, more evidence-based arguments.

124
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,580
But believing something because it’s expedient

125
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,680
– or because it frees you from having to have
any reasons at all – can still have its risks.

126
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,660
After all, if we can leap to God, we can also leap to Russell’s teapot, or to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

127
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,840
Or, much worse, we could leap to particular
beliefs about God

128
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,860
– like that he wants us to deny rights to
certain kinds of people – or kill them.

129
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,659
These beliefs aren’t representative of the
views of most theists, but the problem is,

130
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:50,900
if you’re giving up on reasons and evidence,
all beliefs are philosophically equal.

131
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,280
We count on evidence and justification to help us adjudicate between beliefs, to decide what we value.

132
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,200
If you throw that out, and fall back on faith alone, the sum of your religious arguments is going to end up being:

133
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,840
I have faith in the things I choose to have
faith in.

134
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,159
And in that case, no one can tell anyone else
that their belief is wrong,

135
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:11,009
or dangerous, or unjustified, because you
can’t justify faith.

136
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,620
Today we’ve thought a bunch about about
religious pragmatism and Pascal’s Wager,

137
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,379
and we’ve also learned about fideism and
Kierkegaard’s leap to faith.

138
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,480
Next time we’re going to learn about existentialism, which is a movement Kierkegaard is considered to belong to.

139
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,800
But as we will see, existentialists can come
in many different flavors.
