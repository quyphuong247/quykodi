00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,280
A film for your philosophical consideration:
The Matrix.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,900
You gotta remember the, uh, the humans floating
in vats of KY jelly?

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,820
Tubes and wires keeping them alive, stimulating
their brains, to make them believe that they

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,660
were experiencing the real world – the world
we all think we know?

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,700
Well, almost-20-year-old spoiler alert here: some of
them come to find out that the real world was a

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,220
desolate wasteland, and the lives everyone thought they were living were just fabrications fed into their brains.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,920
A select few were ‘rescued’ from the illusion,
but some of them were so unhappy in the real

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
world that they chose to return to illusion.

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,159
But Neo -- and the others who chose to stay
and fight --- were the philosophical heroes

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,599
of the movie, choosing truth at the cost of
comfort and happiness.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,380
After watching The Matrix, you might’ve
found yourself wondering: Could this be true?

14
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:55,940
Could we possibly be stuck in a dream world
of someone else’s making, with no way to

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,489
tell that our “reality” isn’t real at
all?

16
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,499
If so, you’re not the first person to have
wondered about these things.

17
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:05,779
In fact, the original Neo? The guy who really
went into battle against the matrix of illusion,

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,359
in order to defend the Truth?

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,540
He was a 17th century mathematician. Named
Rene.

[Theme Music]

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,000
Last time, we talked about Plato, and his
belief that the ordinary reality of the material

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,659
world is only a shadowy approximation of Ultimate
Reality.

23
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:34,279
Socrates, meanwhile, who was widely believed to be the wisest man in Athens, fretted about how little he knew.

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,620
Philosophers spend a lot of time obsessing
about knowledge, wishing they knew more, and

25
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,200
worrying that they’re wrong about what they
think they know.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,929
They even, if you remember from the first
episode, have a fancy name for the study of

27
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,560
knowledge – epistemology.

28
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,670
The philosopher who gets the gold star for
taking this how-do-I-know-what-I-know paranoia

29
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,840
to astonishing levels is the early modern philosopher, scientist, and mathematician, Rene Descartes.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,479
When you watch The Matrix, you should congratulate the Wachowskis for giving us such a great sci-fi adventure story.

31
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,789
But you should also remember that the archetype
of the story actually has its roots all the

32
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,820
way back in the writings of Descartes, in
the early 1600s.

33
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,620
For a story like The Matrix to get off the
ground, the audience has to be willing to

34
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,560
entertain some level of skepticism.

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,240
And a skeptic is someone who questions whether
it’s possible to know anything with certainty.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,300
And Descartes was the mac daddy of all skeptics.

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,540
He was so skeptical, named a form of skepticism
after him – Cartesian Skepticism!

38
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,340
Why was Descartes so skeptical?

39
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,040
Well, he realized that many of the beliefs
he used to hold were actually false. We all

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,170
go through this; it’s part of what we call
growing up.

41
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,870
Learning the horrible truth about Santa and
the tooth fairy. That you can’t actually

42
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,940
buy everything you want and need for just $100.
That your parents don't really have all the answers.

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,040
But realizing that he used to believe things
that were false really got Descartes to thinking.

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,080
Because: When he believed those things, he
didn’t realize they were false.

45
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,760
So what if some of the things he still believed were also false, and he just hadn’t realized it yet?

46
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,140
How could he know that his beliefs were true?

47
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,849
Well, after a bit of a freak out, Descartes
realized that the only way to make sure he

48
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:05,269
wasn’t holding any false beliefs was to
disbelieve everything. At least temporarily.

49
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,959
He offered this as an analogy: Imagine you
have a basket of apples, and you’re concerned

50
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,689
that some of the apples might be rotten.

51
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:14,250
Since the rot could spread and ruin the fresh
apples, the only way to make sure there’s

52
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,159
no rot in the basket is to dump out all the
fruit, inspect each apple in turn, and return

53
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,120
only the fresh apples to the basket.

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,920
Knowing that, just like rotten fruit, a rotten idea
can spread and infect all the ideas around it,

55
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,800
Descartes up-ended the apple basket of
his beliefs and decided to start from scratch.

56
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,129
If he examined each possible belief carefully,
and only accepted those about which there

57
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,989
could be no doubt, then he’d know he was
believing only true things.

58
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,560
So, Descartes began the arduous task of examining
his beliefs one by one.

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,940
He started with empirical beliefs – things we come to know directly through the use of our senses.

60
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,959
And many of us think that our senses are the
most reliable source of information. If I

61
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,180
can see it, and hear it, touch it, taste it,
smell it, I must know it, right?

62
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,620
Not so much. Descartes pointed out that our
senses fail us all the time.

63
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,099
You rush to catch up to a friend and realize,
as she turns around, that your eyes played

64
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,340
some tricks on you, and you’ve just tapped
the shoulder of a perfect stranger.

65
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,450
Food tastes wrong when you’re sick. Drink
too much and you feel like the room is spinning.

66
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,219
Water that’s room temperature feels hot
when you come inside after playing in the snow.

67
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:17,979
The list goes on – you can probably think of countless times when your senses gave you faulty information.

68
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,180
And once you realize that, how can you ever
trust your senses again?

69
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,300
And for Descartes, disbeliever of everything,
iit got worse.

70
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,110
Have you ever had a dream so vivid you thought
you were awake?

71
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,820
You’ve probably had a dream that you were
dreaming, or dreamed that you woke up from

72
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,070
a dream, but in fact were still in the dream.

73
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,310
Not everyone has had these experiences, but
many of us have, and given that we don’t

74
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,770
always know that we’re dreaming while it’s
happening...

75
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,400
HOW DO WE KNOW WE’RE NOT DREAMING RIGHT
NOW?!

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,100
Maybe you just think you’re watching Crash Course,
but in fact, you’re cozied up in bed, dreaming about me.

77
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,800
Which, hey, like, who could blame you?

78
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,720
But really, when you think about it, can you
be SURE it’s not the case?

79
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,490
Now, you might be thinking, ok, sure, I probably
deceive myself from time to time, without

80
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,200
knowing I’m doing it. But dreams end. And
when I wake up, I realize that what I thought

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,080
I was experiencing was all in my head.

82
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,700
And the same is true for when my senses let
me down.

83
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Those are just temporary instances, isolated
to a particular situation. As soon as the

84
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,230
situation changes, I can realize that my experience
was false.

85
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,360
This quality – the ability to check in with
yourself and figure out that you’re experiencing

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,840
a deception – describes what Descartes called
local doubts.

87
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,940
Those are doubts about a particular sense experience, or some other occurrence at a particular point in time.

88
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,560
Step out of that point, and you can check
to determine if you’ve been deceived.

89
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,180
But what if ... EVERYTHING IS A DECEPTION?

90
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,070
What if everyone is experiencing the same
false reality, from birth until death? What

91
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,820
if nothing is as it seems, just like in The
Matrix?

92
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,380
This type of doubt, the kind you can’t step out of,
and thus can’t check, is called global doubt.

93
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,280
And it’s the subject of this week’s Flash Philosophy.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

94
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,020
Philosopher Bertrand Russell illustrated the
concept of global doubt with this troubling thought:

95
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,130
What if the universe was created just five
minutes ago?

96
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,090
In this scenario, known as the Five Minute
Hypothesis, the creator of the universe could

97
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,790
have designed many elements of the world to
make them appear “pre-worn,” so as to seem old.

98
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,400
From dinosaur bones – fashioned by the creator,
and planted for us to find, to that scar on

99
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,800
your knee – put there by the creator, along with
the pre-loaded false memory of how you got it.

100
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,620
It seems crazy, but there’s just no way
to prove that it isn’t the case.

101
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,540
The question for Russell was -- does it matter?
Descartes thought it did.

102
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,550
But as a good Catholic, he couldn’t fathom
a world in which God would plant globally

103
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,410
false beliefs in all of our minds.

104
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,370
So instead, he posited the existence of an
Evil Genius, whose purpose in life was to

105
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,710
deceive us, and who was clever enough to do it.

106
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,930
Descartes didn’t exactly think such a being
was likely to exist. But he realized there

107
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,680
was no way to rule out his existence. And
as long as an Evil Genius was possible, he worried

108
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,020
that we were all stuck. Stuck in a radical skepticism, in which we really cannot trust any of our beliefs.

109
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,640
Everything we believe, every sense experience, every thought, they could all have been put in our minds

110
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:01,400
by the Evil Genius, who created an illusory world so seamless, we’d have no way of detecting the illusion.

111
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,700
Just like the machines created for the characters
in The Matrix.

112
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,120
Descartes was at the point of despair.

113
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,160
But then...he realized something.

114
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,580
He had cause to doubt everything.

115
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,840
Everything EXCEPT the fact that he was doubting.

116
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,560
He knew he was doubting. He could be sure
of that.

117
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,200
And if he was doubting, then he must exist
– at least as a thinking thing.

118
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,280
After all, a doubt is a thought, and if there is thought, there must be a thinker having those thoughts.

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,360
So Descartes decided that he couldn’t know
that he had a body – what he believed to

120
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,300
be his body could’ve been part of the Evil Genius’ deception. But he must have had a mind,

121
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,060
or he couldn’t have been having these thoughts.
This was Descartes’s ah-ha moment.

122
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,300
In his book, Meditations on First
Philosophy, he declared:

123
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,800
Cogito ergo sum.
“I think, therefore, I am.”

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,940
It’s one of the most famous realizations
in philosophy – I cannot doubt my own existence.

125
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:58,100
I can doubt everything else, but I can’t
doubt I am, bare minimum, a mind having thoughts.

126
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,720
This was Descartes’ foundational belief,
the first belief he put back in his apple basket.

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,880
And from there, he figured he could
build back up to more certain beliefs.

128
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,900
Once he was certain that he was a thinking
thing, he began examining his thoughts.

129
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:15,280
And one of his most clear thoughts – what he called
a clear and distinct idea – was that God exists.

130
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,660
He gave an argument for this – which we’re
going to examine in a later episode.

131
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,320
But for now, take my word for it – it’s
got some problems.

132
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,880
And from there, he considered his beliefs about the physical world, and concluded that it, too, actually exists.

133
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,920
Ultimately, he determined, God wouldn’t
allow him to have clear and distinct ideas

134
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,579
that were false, without some way to detect
his own error. So, he concluded, the Evil

135
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:39,800
Genius is not actually fabricating lies that
consume our every waking moment.

136
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,939
Descartes managed to reason from “cogito”
all the way back up to having basically all

137
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,769
the beliefs he started with, back in his apple
basket.

138
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:52,720
Which is the story of how Rene Descartes, with the power of skepticism, defeated the threat of the Evil Genius.

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,360
Much like how Neo ultimately short-circuited the Matrix, though considerably less impressive to watch, I imagine.

140
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,560
He found certainty through his discovery of
the one belief that he simply couldn’t doubt

141
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,889
– his own existence as a thinking thing.

142
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,050
But, there is a lot of debate among philosophers
as to whether Descartes actually manages to

143
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,640
justifiably believe anything other than
that he exists as a thinking thing.

144
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,700
And we’ll talk more about that more next time.
