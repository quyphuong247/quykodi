3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,059
It’s about time that we had a serious talk
about religion.

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,429
The philosophy of religion is often confused
with theology, which makes sense, because

5
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:21,539
they both take God and religion as their subjects.
But theology starts by assuming that God exists,

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,060
and then figures out what follows. Or theology
might try to solve philosophical problems

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,230
that might arise from a belief in God. But
one thing that’s never on the table in theology

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,170
is simply not believing in God.
Atheism is not an option.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,710
This is what separates the philosophical
study of religion from the theological.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,639
Philosophers take nothing as a given – and that includes religious belief. Everything is on the table,

11
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:47,760
and everything needs an argument. So, no area
of belief is sacred, and that means even your

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,420
sacred beliefs are going to need to be examined,
and evidence will need to be given.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,729
Some people say religion is the one area where you don’t need arguments – that faith alone is enough.

14
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,219
But philosophers don’t take faith for an answer.

15
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,319
After all I might have faith that moon is made of green cheese. So what?

16
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:08,500
Faith is definitionally unprovable, which makes it,
from a philosophical perspective, not valuable.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,280
So, if you’re a theist, now’s the time to offer some justification for your beliefs.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,630
And if you’re an atheist,
it’s time for you to pay attention too.

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,149
No one’s off the hook – we all need to
pay attention to these arguments, because

20
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:21,929
religion is hugely important. Can you think
of many things that have been as influential

21
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:24,030
in shaping history than religious belief?

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:31,109
Probably not. So if we can get to the bottom
of it, we should.

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:40,619
I’ll get to God in a minute. But first I
want to go over a few other things that the

24
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,119
philosophy of religion is not:

25
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,210
It’s not about believing whatever your parents
taught you. Because that doesn’t prove anything

26
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,609
about the truth of a religious belief. If
how you were raised proved something about

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,170
religious truth, then every religion – and
therefore also no religion – would be true.

28
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,539
So, how you were raised can give you a reason
that you hold a certain belief, but it says

29
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,770
nothing whatsoever about its truth.

30
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,329
Philosophy of religion is also not the study
of the Bible, because you can’t use what’s

31
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,899
written in a book to prove the truth of the
book. You need outside evidence.

32
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,349
There's also a whole area of scholarship
devoted to understanding the Bible by considering

33
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:15,230
the time and place in which it was written.
And such study can be very helpful in understanding

34
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,370
certain things about religion.But it doesn’t help us here.

35
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,319
Philosophy of religion is also not religious anthropology or religious sociology or

36
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,379
psychological understanding of our reasons for religious belief. Those are all wonderful things

37
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,409
you can and should study, but they are not what we’re
studying here.

38
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,989
What we are doing is considering whether we can offer arguments in support of belief in God’s existence.

39
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,260
And a long time ago there was a man who argued that God's existence is provable.

40
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,950
11th century, French monk Anselm of Canterbury. He offered
a deductive argument for the existence of

41
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,049
God, based on what he understood to be the
nature of God’s being, or the definition

42
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:52,489
of God. Because the study of being is called
ontology, his argument, and others like it,

43
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:54,439
are called ontological arguments.

44
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,939
Now: What do you think God is like?

45
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:02,659
Long, flowing white beard, robe to match?
Nice guy, hard to reach on the phone?

46
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:07,239
Well, Anselm aimed a little bit higher. In
fact, he thought that God is, by definition,

47
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,810
The best possible thing we can imagine.
####In Anselm’s words, God is “that than which no greater can be conceived.” So what does that mean?

48
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,879
THE. BEST. THING.

49
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,069
Just try to think of the coolest, awesomest,
most amazing and wonderful thing you can imagine.

50
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:20,159
And whatever you’re thinking of, Anselm
said that God is better. He’s just the best.

51
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,239
In Anselm’s words, God is “that than which
no greater can be conceived.”

52
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,209
So what does that mean?

53
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,969
Well, it means God must exist, according to
Anselm.

54
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:32,569
After all, he pointed out, there are just
two ways in which something can exist.

55
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,989
Something can exist only in our minds
and be strictly imaginary -- like Santa, or unicorns.

56
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,469
Or it can exist in our minds but also in
reality, like pizza and horses --

57
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,800
something that we can imagine, but that’s also real.

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,299
Anselm pointed out -- and he does appear to
be right about this -- that any good thing

59
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,090
would be better if it existed in reality as
well as in our minds.

60
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,920
I mean: unicorns. They’re pretty great.
But wouldn’t they be better if they were real?

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,180
Or the perfect romantic partner: smart, funny,
hot, likes the same movies and games that you do?

62
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,340
Pretty rich? Would be pretty nice in your mind,
but EVEN BETTER if they actually existed.

63
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,220
Well Anselm thought so too. And from there,
he believed he could prove God’s existence.

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,920
Because, if we define God as the greatest
thing we can conjure up in our minds, the

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,640
only thing that could possibly be greater
than him would be – a real version!

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,740
And since we’re already imagining the greatest
thing possible, there can’t be anything better.

67
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,540
Therefore, God has to exist, both
in my imagination and in reality!

68
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,260
Anselm was sure that he had done it -- deductively proven God’s existence in a way that was immune to error.

69
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,320
Here it is, one more time, laid out as a philosophical
argument:

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,260
God is the greatest thing we can think of.

71
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,040
Things can exist only in our imaginations,
or they can also exist in reality.

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,340
Things that exist in reality are always better
than things that exist only in our imaginations

73
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,230
If God existed only in our imaginations, he
wouldn’t be the greatest thing that we can

74
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,220
think of, because God in reality would be
better

75
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,300
Therefore, God must exist in reality.

76
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,240
Anselm thought this was a tidy little argument.

77
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,480
But one of his contemporaries, a fellow French
monk named Gaunilo, wasn’t satisfied. He

78
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,750
suggested that we could run the same line
of reasoning to prove the existence of literally

79
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,760
anything we can imagine. He came up with an
argument with the exact same formal structure

80
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,100
as Anselm’s, to prove that a mythical Lost
Island exists. He proposed: The best island

81
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,670
I can imagine is one where I can swim and
relax on a tropical beach and ski down snow-covered

82
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,550
mountains all in one afternoon. I can imagine
it, so it must exist. Otherwise, it wouldn’t

83
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,680
be the best island – there would be one
better And that one would have to be real!

84
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,810
Basically, Gaunilo said, you could make the
same kind of argument to prove the existence

85
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,930
of whatever you wanted most -- but it wouldn’t
make it real.

86
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,500
Anselm responded to Gaunilo’s criticism
by saying he’d missed the point, that the

87
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,120
argument only works for necessary beings,
of which there is only one – God.

88
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,500
Folks, what we have right here is a classic example
of the fallacy known as begging the question.

89
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,540
A fallacy is a flaw in reasoning, something
that weakens or destroys an argument.

90
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,260
And when you beg the question, you assume the very thing you’re trying to prove with your argument.

91
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,770
By adding this idea of “a necessary
being” to his definition of God, Anselm

92
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,060
makes God’s existence a part of the definition
of God. A necessary being is one that must

93
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,740
exist, so Anselm’s response assumed the
very point of contention to be true – that God exists!

94
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,240
Other philosophers since Anselm have tried
to save his argument by tweaking it in various ways,

95
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,500
and dissenters have continued trying
to deflate them.

96
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,880
One of the most famous objections came hundreds
of years after Anselm’s time, from the 18th

97
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,000
century German philosopher Immanuel Kant.
Kant offered the point that, as he put it,

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,860
“existence is not a predicate.” A predicate
is just something that’s said of another object.

99
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,240
And Kant thought Anselm’s mistake
was in thinking that existence is something

100
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,200
that can be predicated upon a thing, or be
used as a defining characteristic.

101
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,100
For example, if a triangle exists, it necessarily has 3 sides. But it could be that no triangle exists at all.

102
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,600
Because the idea of existence
isn’t part of how we define a triangle.

103
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,120
Likewise, Kant would say, if God exists, then
he must be the greatest being we can imagine

104
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,750
-- but that doesn’t mean that he does exist.
Predicates add to the essence of their subjects,

105
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,920
Kant explained, but they can’t be used to
prove their existence.

106
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,840
British philosopher John Wisdom came up with
a thought exercise that sounds a lot like

107
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,980
like a debate over an ontological argument.

108
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,700
It’s called The Parable of The Invisible
Gardener, which brings us to this week’s

109
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,840
Flash Philosophy. Let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

110
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,060
Person A and Person B return to a garden after
a long absence, and notice that a few of its

111
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,290
plants are still thriving. Person A says,
a gardener must have been tending the garden

112
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,680
while they were gone. Person B doubts this
is true, so they agree to wait and see if

113
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,420
a gardener shows up. After some time passes,
they see no one, so Person A says:

114
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,680
“The gardener must be invisible!” So, they put
up traps and bring in bloodhounds to catch him.

115
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,000
When no one is found, Person A says the
gardener must be intangible as well as unsmellable.

116
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,130
To which “B” replies: “What’s the
difference between an invisible, intangible,

117
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,110
unsmellable, entirely undetectable gardener
... and no gardener at all?”

118
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,380
Thanks, Thought Bubble!
Can you guess who A and B are really talking about?

119
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,880
To give you a sense of just how long this
back-and-forth has been going on among philosophers

120
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,760
-- trying to either prove or disprove the
existence of God -- John Wisdom came up with

121
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,090
this parable in 1944 … nearly a thousand
years after Anselm and Gaunilo.

122
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,210
Today we introduced a new area of philosophy
– philosophy of religion. And we learned

123
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,320
about Anselm’s argument for God’s existence,
while also considering objections to that argument.

124
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,910
An important point to note here is that both
Gaunilo and Kant agreed with Anselm’s conclusion

125
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,480
– they also believed in God’s existence. They just thought Anselm’s argument didn’t prove it.

126
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,820
So remember, you can think an argument
fails, even if you accept the conclusion.

127
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,400
When this happens, you should look for a
better argument in favor of your conclusion.

128
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,440
This is exactly what Thomas Aquinas did,
and we’ll consider him next time.
