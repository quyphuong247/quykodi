1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,000
We’re living in a world of Black Lives Matter
versus All Lives Matter.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,280
A world where presidential elections hinge on
people’s views regarding the building of walls.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:21,580
And we should be open about the fact that issues like these – ones that involve our beliefs about sameness, equality, and difference – are sensitive, and can easily arouse our emotions.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,38
One topic that always comes up in these conversations
is discrimination.

5
00:00:25,39 --> 00:00:27,680
It’s one of those loaded words, packed with
negativity.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,640
Most people would probably tell you that discrimination
is bad.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,660
But, they probably do it, whether they realize
it or not.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,540
So, are they allowed to, morally speaking?

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,200
And do you do it?
How can you tell if you do?

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,400
Are there times when it’s OK to discriminate?
Maybe even necessary?

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,330
When you answer questions like these, it can
be hard to keep emotions from taking over.

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:56,890
So, it’s worth taking some time here, when our emotions are at an even-keel, and Reason is in the driver’s seat – right where Plato said it belongs – to think carefully about discrimination, and what it really means.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:07,230
[Theme Music]

14
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:12,700
Morality demands that individuals, acts, or states of affairs that are the same should be treated the same.

15
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,20
But we don’t always do that.

16
00:01:14,20 --> 00:01:22,300
Discrimination is the favoring of one group – or member of a group – over another group, or other member of it, in the absence of any morally relevant differences.

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,100
Morally relevant differences are things that
would actually justify unequal treatment.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:34,500
Like, if you work for an airline and you’re hiring a pilot, you can favor a person with sight over a blind person, because when the job is flying a plane, sight matters.

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,100
You’re not discriminating against a blind person because they’re blind, but because they are literally unable to do the job.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:49,240
And someone who looks like me would be a fairly awful candidate to go undercover with, like, the Haitian mafia, which means skin color can matter – although very rarely.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,20
So there are cases where we can see clear justifications for favoring members of one group over another.

22
00:01:54,20 --> 00:01:59,479
And there are plenty of equally obvious cases
where favoritism seems clearly unjustified.

23
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,710
But what about the not-so clear-cut cases?

24
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,660
What if there really are reasons why you might want to discriminate, but those reasons are relevant in one instance, and not another?

25
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,419
So let’s look at some tough cases.

26
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:18,320
Contemporary Australian philosopher Peter Singer offers the example of a restaurant owner who doesn’t want to hire an African American because his clientele is racist.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,160
He’s afraid that many of his customers will stop coming to his restaurant rather than be served by an African American.

28
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,340
So the restaurant owner himself doesn’t hold racist beliefs, but he worries the decision to be “color-blind” in hiring will harm his livelihood.

29
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,320
It might make us uncomfortable to admit, but in certain parts of the country, this restaurant owner’s concerns are not at all unfounded.

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,19
Or consider a woman who refuses to be treated by a highly qualified gynecologist, simply because he’s male.

31
00:02:43,20 --> 00:02:47,980
Now, what about a woman who refuses to be treated by a qualified gynecologist because he’s Asian-American?

32
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:55,720
Or say there’s an all-male company that hires a qualified woman over an equally qualified man, in the interest of fostering diversity in the workplace.

33
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,30
Or a bakery that refuses to make a Nazi-themed
cake for a customer who’s a white supremacist?

34
00:03:01,30 --> 00:03:04,400
Some of these cases you probably agree with,
some of them you probably don’t.

35
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,590
Your gut intuition might be to applaud the
bakery for refusing to make a Nazi cake.

36
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:17,850
But think about their reasons for turning down that job – probably a deep personal conviction that Nazi ideology is appalling, so they don’t want to contribute to its endorsement and celebration.

37
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,519
But what if instead of a Nazi cake, it was
a wedding cake for a same-sex couple?

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:29,460
And what if the owners of the bakery have a deep personal conviction that same sex marriage is appalling and they don’t want to contribute to its endorsement and celebration?

39
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,140
Do you support their refusal too?

40
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,270
Now, you might hold the view that we should
all have the freedom to do whatever we want.

41
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:41,260
Business owners can discriminate because of their personal convictions, or to maximize profits, or just because they’re straight-up racists.

42
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,260
The problem with this view is that it gives
a great deal of freedom to only some people

43
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,649
– namely, those in power, those who own
the businesses and control the money.

44
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,780
And the more freedom they have to act as they choose, the less freedom the people they’re discriminating against will have.

45
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:02,800
So if we actually want a country that’s free for all of its citizens, the freedom to act against some of our citizens is going to have to be held in check.

46
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,860
And that means reining in the freedom to discriminate.

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,359
Now, there’s obviously a lot of disagreement about when discrimination is ok and when it’s not.

48
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,380
Contemporary American philosopher Judith Jarvis
Thomson offers this rule of thumb:

49
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:22,620
Discrimination that favors a historically underprivileged class is more likely to be acceptable than discrimination that favors a historically privileged class.

50
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,820
The reasoning, she says, is that those who have historically been denied privilege could use the advantage.

51
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,400
So if a woman is getting hired over a man, well, that’s not a big deal, considering that men have been hired over women so many times in the past.

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:45,580
As long as a historically underprivileged group continues to suffer from the disadvantages of the past – even if those disadvantages are not currently being imposed on them – Jarvis Thomson says a little special treatment is OK.

53
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,431
Not everyone agrees with this view, however.

54
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,100
Like contemporary American philosopher Robert
Nozick, who we talked about last time.

55
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,400
After all, what if I happen to be a member
of a historically privileged class?

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,498
That’s not my fault.

57
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:59,960
So why should I have to be passed over for
jobs because of my gender and my pale skin?

58
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,460
Isn’t that also unjustified discrimination?

59
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,919
One response to Nozick is to argue that justice
isn’t always the same as being fair.

60
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,980
If I’m a white guy passed over for a job that
I’m qualified for, that sucks, and it’s unfair.

61
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,800
But the reason it feels unfair to me now is because I’ve reaped the spoils of white male privilege for so long.

62
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,400
When you’re already so far ahead, it can feel really bad to be held back and asked to wait for others to catch up.

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,000
But if we’re actually aiming at equality, that’s exactly what the people at the front are going to have to do

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,280
Now let’s go back to the gynecologist cases.

65
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,498
Many people’s intuition is that women should
be able to choose against male gynecologists,

66
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:38,840
because being examined by a man in such an
intimate way might make a woman feel uncomfortable.

67
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,679
Yet, many people might report the same level of discomfort being examined by someone of another race.

68
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,380
These cases tug at the feelings we have about our personal beliefs, and what happens when those private things butt up against the public sphere.

69
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,219
You might think that every individual should be free to choose – and choose against – doctors for whatever personal reasons she might have.

70
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:02,849
But, we should also consider what these discriminatory
mindsets are really based on.

71
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:12,39
The reason customers might not want an African American to bring food to their table is the same reason that a patient might not want to be examined by an Asian-American doctor – fear of the unknown.

72
00:06:12,40 --> 00:06:15,440
But we know, intellectually, that these fears
are unfounded.

73
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,160
Spend some time around people who are different
from you in a way that makes you uncomfortable,

74
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,659
and you realize that, despite those differences, there are actually a lot more similarities than there are differences.

75
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:31,480
So, the restaurant owner from Case #1 could allow his patrons to decide who they’ll be served by, and not give the African American applicant the job.

76
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,860
Or, he can say, this is my new employee, so if you want to eat here, you’re going to have to get over yourself and your racism.

77
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:45,500
And this might cost him some business, but, over time, his customers will get over themselves and probably be a little more accepting of other races as well.

78
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,80
Which is exactly what happened, by and large, when racial discrimination in hiring became illegal.

79
00:06:51,80 --> 00:06:55,479
It might seem unfair that a small business
owner should have to take on that fight, though.

80
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,680
Why is it his job to educate his racist clientele?

81
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,80
Likewise when it comes to discriminating against
customers, or job applicants.

82
00:07:02,80 --> 00:07:08,779
Is there a difference between a business being able to choose who they do or don’t hire, and who they do and don’t serve?

83
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,239
How do we balance this right – if it is one –
against a person’s right to be employed, and served?

84
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
One response is to say that people have a
negative right to employment, and to service

85
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,30
– that is, people can’t be stopped from
obtaining those things.

86
00:07:22,30 --> 00:07:27,70
But that does not entail a corresponding right
to this job, or to be served at this business.

87
00:07:27,70 --> 00:07:29,860
Like, we don’t all have a right to any particular
job.

88
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,680
And similarly, businesses don’t have to
serve everyone.

89
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,320
You don’t have a right to tickets to a sold
out concert.

90
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,240
And if there’s still a line at the ice cream stand when closing time rolls around, the business has a right to turn customers away.

91
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:45,549
So it seems like it matters why you’re being
denied the job or service.

92
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,828
Is there a morally relevant reason for the
discrimination?

93
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:50,240
Think back through the cases.

94
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,140
After reflecting on what we’ve talked about today,
has your response to any of those cases changed?

95
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,380
And if so, why?

96
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,289
It’s an issue that deserves your thought.

97
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:03,180
And if you share those thoughts in the comments,
please do so as kindly and thoughtfully as possible.

98
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,220
Today we learned about discrimination.

99
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,440
We talked through several hard cases, and
explored our responses to them.

100
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,800
We considered the views that everyone should
be free to discriminate if they want to,

101
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,210
that it’s never ok to discriminate in any
case,

102
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,400
or that discrimination should occur when it’s done to advantage a historically underprivileged group.

103
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,758
Next time, we’re going to talk about our
moral obligations regarding animals.
