3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,260
In your day-to-day life, you probably assume
a whole bunch of different identities.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,450
You might be a sister to your brother, a daughter
to your parents, a colleague to your co-worker.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,279
A mentor to the kids you teach.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,740
Or you might think of your identity as being based on your interests, your skills, or things like your gender or ethnicity.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,380
Whatever they are, I’ll bet that you think
of your identities as being pretty fixed.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,420
Stable. And you like ‘em that way.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,719
And if that’s the case, I’d like you to meet this guy: 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume.

10
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,640
Because, he says you’re wrong.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,030
Hume argued that the idea of the self doesn’t
persist over time.

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,210
He said there is no you that is the same person
from birth to death.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,340
He said the concept of the self is just an
illusion.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,070
This could be either liberating or terrifying,
depending on how you look at it.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,660
I mean, if you don’t have an identity, you
don’t have to worry about identity theft.

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:02,860
But what does it mean for my understanding of myself, and for the people I love, if there is no single, constant me?

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,900
If that’s the case, then the person I’m married to is literally not the person I fell in love with, or made those vows to.

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,160
Which would suggest that I don’t need to
keep those vows, and neither does she.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,080
And what about personal responsibility?

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,320
How can you hold someone accountable for their actions, if they’re not the same person now that they were before?

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,360
And how can you be responsible for something
that you did, if you’re always changing?

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,860
This is gonna get dicey.

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:36,300
[Theme Music]

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,640
If you joined me last time when we talked about personal identity, you’ll remember that we

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,820
considered two main possibilities for what might preserve “you” as the same person over time.

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,840
One approach was the body theory, the sort
of go-to view of things, which holds that

27
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,230
you remain “you” over time, because you
just occupy the same body from birth to death.

28
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,260
And the other was John Locke’s memory theory,

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,420
the view that your memories are what makes you the same person over time:

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,500
I’m me, because I remember being me in the
past.

31
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,140
But both of these models have some problems.

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,320
No matter how much we want the idea of permanent, persistent selves to be a thing, David Hume said that they just aren’t.

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,080
For him, it was really a no-brainer.

34
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,620
If having a certain identity means possessing
the same set of properties, he said, then

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,969
how could anyone really maintain the same
identity from one moment to the next?

36
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:25,140
I clearly don’t share all the same properties as my childhood self – or even my self before I shaved today –

37
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,840
so Hume would say that it’s silly to pretend
I’m still me.

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,209
But I feel like me.
So what did Hume think was going on?

39
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,289
Hume said that the so-called “self” is just a bundle of impressions, consisting of a zillion different things –

40
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:42,999
my body, my mind, emotions, preferences, memories,
even labels that are imposed on me by others.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,320
Think of a box – and say it’s marked “Hank” – and then put in that box everything that makes me who I am.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,120
My DNA, mannerisms, political leanings, my glasses, the relationships I have with others, the various roles I hold.

43
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,920
Then, you take away the box.

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,020
Hume’s point is, the “self” is just
shorthand for all the junk in the box.

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,280
And the fact that there is no box points out that there’s no single underlying thing that holds it all together.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,780
And meanwhile, some of the stuff in the bundle
goes away, and new stuff shows up.

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,219
So, if you look at the bundle that is me now,
and compare it with the bundle that my mom

48
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:14,819
and dad brought home from the hospital,

49
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,989
they would be almost completely different.

50
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,219
So Hume said we’re all just ever-changing
bundles of impressions that our minds are

51
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,430
fooled into thinking of as constant,

52
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,569
because they’re packaged in these fleshy receptacles that basically look the same from one day to the next.

53
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:32,329
To explore this some more, let’s bounce over to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

54
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:38,340
Contemporary British philosopher Derek Parfit, probably after watching a Star Trek marathon, posed this thought experiment.

55
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,080
Imagine a machine that breaks you down atom-by-atom, copies all of that information, and transmits it to Mars, at the speed of light.

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,020
Once that information gets to Mars, another machine uses it to re-create you, atom by atom,

57
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,020
using copies of the same organic stuff that
you were composed of here on earth.

58
00:03:54,020 --> 00:04:00,959
The person who wakes up on Mars has all the same memories and personality as you did – and that person thinks it’s you.

59
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,629
So here’s the question – is this space
travel?

60
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,060
Did you travel to Mars?

61
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,680
Is the transported person really you?

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,499
Or was a new being created that just happens to correspond to you, atom by atom, thought by thought?

63
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,519
Now, consider this: What if a new version of the machine is created, so that now, instead of destroying your body,

64
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:25,340
it can simply be scanned, and all the information can be re-created on Mars, but the you here on earth still exists.

65
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,820
Now did you travel?
Or were you just replicated?

66
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
If you’re here on earth, are you also on
Mars?

67
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,960
Wow…uh, yeah, thanks, Thought Bubble…
I think.

68
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,140
Parfit agrees with Hume that there isn’t
such a thing as personal identity over time.

69
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,530
So, he says, in either case, you didn’t
travel through space –

70
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,620
that’s just a new you that shows up on Mars, whether the old you was destroyed or still exists.

71
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,600
And you know what?

72
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,540
Even if you hopped on a spaceship and flew to Mars the old-fashioned way, it’d still be a new you that arrives,

73
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,540
because you would’ve experienced all sorts
of changes during the trip.

74
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,580
But the thing is, Parfit thought Hume missed
a really important point.

75
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,480
Even though there isn’t a singular you from
birth to death,

76
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,120
Parfit says that each of us has a psychological
connectedness with our selves over time.

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,420
Think about your life as being like a piece
of chainmail.

78
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,220
The mesh that is your personal identity is
made up of lots of separate chains,

79
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,600
and those chains intersect at certain points,
to make up the chain mail.

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,940
As you follow the timeline of one particular set of links, new links are being created that add to the chain.

81
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,320
And as time passes, the links that are farther
back in your past slowly start to drop off,

82
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,470
as they lose their psychological connection
to you.

83
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,940
So, when you stopped loving Dora the Explorer,
that link dropped away.

84
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,440
And when you discovered that you totally love
philosophy, a new link was created.

85
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,410
But some chains intersect with that other
chain, and they have links that persist for

86
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,770
a long time, like the love you have for your
parents.

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,590
So Parfit says that, sure, I’m not the same
person that I was in elementary school.

88
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,600
And I won’t be the same person when I die.

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:55,460
I’m not even really the same person I was when I started this sentence, because every experience changes us, at least a little.

90
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,280
But parts of me survive the passage of time, because they’re psychologically connected to my previous selves.

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,410
And survival is what’s important, for Parfit.

92
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,540
As long as enough of the elements of you persist,
you see yourself as relevantly the same.

93
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,400
But not for a whole lifetime. Parfit would say none of the you that existed at birth is still around –

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,740
your physical matter is almost all different, and you have no memory of that time, and your preferences have completely changed.

95
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,970
Baby You has not survived. But some of Last
Year You probably has.

96
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,890
And Parfit seems to have hit on an important
insight here.

97
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,620
Think about what you do when you catch up
with an old friend.

98
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,780
The first thing you do is ask what’s happened
since you last spoke.

99
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,000
What you’re doing, without really thinking about it, is recognizing that you both have changed.

100
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,540
If the changes are big, then your friend could
seem like a stranger at first.

101
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,800
So, when it’s someone you care about, you take the time to reacquaint yourself with this new person.

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,810
Because, you recognize the need to always
know the most updated version of that person.

103
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,470
But the opposite can also happen.

104
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:59,010
Think about that aunt you only see at Christmas, who still pinches your cheek and gives you a new American Girl doll every year.

105
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,470
She probably knew what you loved when you
were 10.

106
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,100
But she doesn’t know the current you.

107
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,040
The version of you she’s shopping for at
Christmas doesn’t exist anymore.

108
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,420
But since you rarely see each other, and you haven’t made the effort to know the new yous,

109
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,280
you’re both looking past each other in that painfully awkward way that makes holidays with relatives so special.

110
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,740
So now let’s think back to the question
we discussed earlier –

111
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,060
if I’m not the same me over time, how do I make sense of promises, obligations, and responsibilities?

112
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,270
Parfit’s theory gives us an answer! Your
degree of responsibility and obligation corresponds

113
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,970
to your degree of connection to the person
who made the promise or incurred the responsibility.

114
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,920
So, if you were a kindergarten bully who grew
up to be a totally sweet guy who would never

115
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,530
bully anyone, you don’t need to feel any
guilt.

116
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,030
You’re not that person anymore – you don’t
bear responsibility for his actions.

117
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,640
Likewise, if you and your childhood bestie pinkie-swore to be each other’s maids of honor when you grew up,

118
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,140
but now the two of you have nothing in common,
you’re off the hook for that promise.

119
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,720
Now about those marriage vows?

120
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,040
Well, a promise that lasts a lifetime doesn’t
really make sense, in Parfit’s view.

121
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,560
And there are actually people, using this line of reasoning, who argue that marriage contracts should be temporary,

122
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,620
with the option of renewal – kind of like
a cell phone plan.

123
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,560
But others have said that marriage vows can actually stay relevant, even after a lifetime of changes.

124
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,460
Over the years, you and your spouse both change,
and become different people.

125
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,420
But, these thinkers point out, you may be constantly reaffirming the promises you made on your wedding day.

126
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,540
So, a wedding vow isn’t a promise you made years ago, when you were a completely different person.

127
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,520
It’s a promise you made this morning, when you took out the trash and cleaned up the hairball the cat left on the rug.

128
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,870
Why is it always on the rug?

129
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,620
So clearly, we’re not talking about Batman, or science fiction, or hypothetical trips to Mars anymore.

130
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,660
We’re talking about how philosophy can teach you about yourself, and the people you care about,

131
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,240
and how you can continue to know them and
be close to them over time.

132
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,160
Today we continued our exploration of personal
identity, learning about Hume’s bundle theory

133
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,340
and Parfit’s theory of survival through
psychological connectedness.

134
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,940
Next time, we’re going to address a term
that we’ve been taking for granted throughout

135
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,040
this whole discussion: person.
