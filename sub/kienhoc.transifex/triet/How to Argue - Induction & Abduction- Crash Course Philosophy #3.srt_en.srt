00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,160
How do you know that aspirin will take care
of your headache?

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,280
Why do you really want to see the new Marvel movie,
even though you haven’t heard anything about it, good or bad?

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,600
Your ability to do things like predict how
a medication will affect you, or what movie

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,190
you might like, or even things like what the
perfect gift might be for your best friend,

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,430
or what’s the fastest way to get to campus
–- all of this stuff, you know through induction.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,740
Deductive arguments are great because they
give us certain answers.

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,980
But unfortunately, much of the world cannot
be summed up in a neat deductive proof.

10
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,429
Deduction requires a fair amount of general
information to give you a specific conclusion

11
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,420
that is, frankly, probably kind of obvious.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,420
So, philosophy -- and basically, you know, life as well --
require that you have other ways of reasoning.

13
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,600
In addition to knowing how one fact leads
to another, you also need to take what you’ve

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,889
experienced before, and use that to predict
what might happen in the future.

15
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:58,389
And you need to be able to rule out what can’t
be true, so you can focus on what can.

16
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:01,469
Through these kinds of reasoning, you’re
not only able to figure out stuff like how

17
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,129
to fix your headache, and why your roommate
might be acting weird. You can also come up

18
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,299
with better, more skillful arguments — and
counterarguments — which are some of the

19
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,609
most important maneuvers in the philosophical
game.

20
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:14,930
And maybe the best part is, you already know
how to use these techniques.

21
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,970
In fact, I bet you’ve used them this very
day. You know this!

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:29,210
[Theme Music]

23
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:35,010
If you possess any ability to really predict the
future, it lies in your ability to reason inductively.

24
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,400
Inductive reasoning relies on the predictability
of nature to reveal that the future is likely

25
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,020
to resemble the past, often in important ways.

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,479
For example, there’s tons of research to
support the knowledge that aspirin -- acetylsalicylic

27
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,179
acid -- is an effective treatment for pain,
like headaches.

28
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:52,119
And you probably have personal experience
with the effects of aspirin, too.

29
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:57,140
So, you believe that this aspirin tablet will
cure the headache you have right now, because

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,659
countless aspirin tablets have cured countless
headaches in the past.

31
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,319
Likewise, you want to see the new Marvel movie,
because you liked most of the other ones,

32
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,259
so you believe that they’ll continue to
deliver for you, entertainment-wise.

33
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,919
But it’s important to remember that, unlike
deduction, where true premises entail true

34
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,580
conclusions, inductive premises only mean
that the conclusion is likely to be true.

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,800
Inductive arguments don’t provide you with
certainty. Instead, they work in terms of probabilities.

36
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,180
And they’re useful for more than predicting
what’s going to happen. For example:

37
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,680
Most men in ancient Athens had beards.
Socrates was a man who lived in ancient Athens.

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,860
Therefore, Socrates probably had a beard

39
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,040
This is an inductive argument, because it
starts with what we already know – about

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,239
the grooming habits of ancient Athenian men,
and about the time and place in which Socrates

41
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,069
lived – and makes an educated guess based
on that information.

42
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,820
There’s no guarantee that the conclusion is correct,
but what’s known would seem to support it.

43
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,640
Reasoning like this is incredibly useful, which is
why it’s so common. But there’s also a problem.

44
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,129
The future doesn’t always resemble the past.
And every pattern has its outliers.

45
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,409
So induction always has the potential to produce
false results. Aspirin might not work on a

46
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:04,730
really bad headache. The new Marvel movie
might be awful. And, yeah, maybe a specific

47
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,629
guy in Athens had a beard but it’s possible
he didn’t!

48
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,429
While the world tends to work according to
predictable rules, sometimes those rules are violated.

49
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,910
And you know what you need when that happens?
A little Flash Philosophy. Off to the Thought Bubble.

50
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,160
Contemporary American philosopher Nelson Goodman
confronts the problems of induction, using

51
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,430
a thought exercise about a hypothetical substance
called grue.

52
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,280
According to Goodman’s scenario, grue is
anything that’s the color green before a

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,469
certain time, a time that we will call t.

54
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:34,529
And another property of grue is that, while
it’s green before time t, it’s blue after it.

55
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,129
Now, let’s assume that we’re living in
a time before t. T could happen a hundred

56
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,900
years from now or tomorrow, but we know that
all of the emeralds we’ve ever seen are green

57
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,659
So, inductive reasoning lets us conclude that
all emeralds are green, and will remain green

58
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:51,479
after time t -- since emeralds haven’t been
known to change color.

59
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,660
BUT! All emeralds are grue! Because it's not yet time t,
and they're green, which is part of the definition of grue.

60
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,780
So we have no choice but to conclude that
the emeralds will be blue after time t arrives.

61
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,049
Now we’ve got a problem. Because inductive
reasoning has led us to conclude that emeralds

62
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:11,230
will be blue after time t, but inductive reasoning
also tells us that they’ll remain green.

63
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,469
Goodman’s riddle reminds us that inductive
evidence can be flawed, or contradictory.

64
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:18,829
It can make you think that you can predict
the future, when of course you can’t.

65
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,820
So, there are times when you need to get at
the truth in other ways. Like by eliminating

66
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,060
what’s obviously not true, and considering
what’s most likely.

67
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,280
And for this, we turn our attention to one
of the most important philosophical figures

68
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,530
of 19th century England: Sherlock Holmes.

69
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,800
In chapter six of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The
Sign of the Four,” Mr. Holmes says, and I quote:

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,580
“When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever
remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”

71
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,620
This is probably the best, most succinct description
ever given of the kind of reasoning known as abduction.

72
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,720
Which I know, it sounds like we’re talking
about a kidnapping or something, but abduction

73
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,280
is a thought process sometimes described as
“inference to the best explanation.“

74
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,140
Abduction doesn’t reason straight from a premise to
a conclusion, as we’ve seen in deduction and induction.

75
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,980
Instead, it reasons by ruling out possible
explanations until you’re left with the

76
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,780
most plausible one, given the evidence. Consider
this:

77
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,280
Anna told you she failed her physics midterm.

78
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,740
Anna hasn’t been in physics class since
your teacher graded the exams.

79
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,440
Anna has been in sociology class, which meets
right after physics.

80
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,660
Anna dropped physics.

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,360
Now, with only these premises, we can’t
deductively or inductively prove our conclusion

82
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,720
– that she dropped physics.

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,520
But, it’s a justifiable conclusion, because,
given what we know, dropping the class is

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,400
the most plausible explanation of events.

85
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,870
We know she’s not sick – because she’s
still going to sociology – and we know she

86
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,470
had good reason to withdraw from the class,
because she was unlikely to pass.

87
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,040
Concluding that she dropped the course makes
the most tidy use of our information, without

88
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,600
leaving any loose ends. So let’s look at
another one:

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,030
You and your roommate ate sushi last night.

90
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,250
You both wake up with violent stomachaches.

91
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,340
You and your roommate ate some bad sushi.

92
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,390
The mere fact that you’re both sick doesn’t
prove that the sushi caused the sickness.

93
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,330
But, given that you both ate the same thing
and you both have the same symptoms – absent

94
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,280
other information, like that a stomach virus
is going around your dorm – the best explanation

95
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
is that the sushi caused your intestinal anguish.

96
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,100
Now, like induction, abduction doesn’t give
us certainty.

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,480
But it is a really useful way to get through
puzzling situations when you don’t have

98
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,070
clear evidence from the past to help you out.

99
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,180
Doctors use abduction a lot when they’re
diagnosing illnesses, and detectives of course

100
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,600
use it when piecing together evidence.

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,410
You probably use it pretty often too – just
beware, because abduction must be used carefully!

102
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,130
It uses only information you have at hand
-- that’s why doctors and detectives work

103
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,110
so hard to dig up more data, and re-create events from
the past, so they can help draw better conclusions.

104
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,250
All right, now that we’ve looked at some
argument types, let’s find out how philosophers

105
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,610
use arguments to interact with each other.

106
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,240
Because, philosophers don’t argue like other
people do.

107
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,440
It’s not like the conversation you have
around the dinner table about whether the

108
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,720
Patriots are better than the Seahawks, or
why plain M&Ms are superior to peanut, which

109
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,340
is clearly a preposterous position to take.

110
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,240
Philosophers hold each other to different,
higher standards.

111
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,650
They don’t teach each other get away with
saying, “I reject your argument because

112
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,410
I don’t like its conclusion.” Or, “That’s
preposterous, peanut M&Ms are so good.”

113
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,810
Instead, if you disagree with a conclusion,
you need to give reasons, just like the first

114
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,350
person did when they made their case.

115
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,390
Both people involved in this kind of exchange
are known as interlocutors, because we have

116
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,020
to name everything. The first one advances
an argument, and the second one can either

117
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,560
accept it, or offer a counterargument, which
is just what it sounds like – an argument

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,800
offered in opposition to another argument.

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,860
Think back to Socrates and the beard.

120
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,070
You think Socrates had a beard, and your reasoning
is that most men in his time and place had them.

121
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,050
I, however, think you’re wrong. So I give
you a counterargument.

122
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,920
Gorgias, a contemporary of Socrates, said
Socrates couldn’t grow a beard and that

123
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,550
he would sneak into barbershops and steal
discarded clippings to fashion fake beards

124
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,490
for himself. Therefore, Socrates didn’t
have a (real) beard.

125
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,530
And I just want to point out that this is
an actual philosophy conspiracy theory.

126
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,110
Gorgias was a real guy, who differed with
Socrates on many things, and the dispute was

127
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,860
said to have gotten personal.

128
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,760
According to accounts of the time, Gorgias
actually spread the rumor that Socrates wore,

129
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,360
like, a beard-wig, in an effort to shame and
discredit his rival. I mean, how could you

130
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,960
be a good thinker if you weren’t a good
beard-grower.

131
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,900
Gorgias’ gossip didn’t go over well with
everyone, and in this instance, let’s say

132
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,740
you are skeptical about it too.

133
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,280
So you counter my counterargument with a counter-counterargument.

134
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,840
Gorgias was known for being a gossip, and
for hating Socrates, and trying to make him

135
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,200
look bad. His fake beard tale seems wildly
unlikely. Therefore, we can’t take Gorgias’

136
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,880
statement seriously, so we should fall back
on the best information we have, which is

137
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,870
that most of the men in his time and place
had beards.

138
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,560
And as you can see, arguments of different
styles can be used in the same exchange.

139
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,220
Like, the original argument, about Socrates
probably having a beard, was inductive.

140
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,680
But this last counterargument is abductive.
And that’s fine.

141
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,280
Arguments are meant to be useful, so we don’t have
to use the same kind of reasoning when we argue.

142
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,900
This way of exchanging ideas through dialogue
was popularized by Socrates, and so has become

143
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,800
known as the Socratic method.

144
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,589
Socrates thought dialogue was the best way
to learn, and to get at truth.

145
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,759
And it’s important to note that, while philosophers
have a reputation for being an argumentative

146
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,219
lot, they don’t think of the Socratic method as
something that results in a winner and a loser.

147
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,449
Rather, it’s an exercise that brings both
interlocutors closer to the truth.

148
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:13,959
The goal of the philosopher is not to win,
but to find truth, so you shouldn’t be disappointed

149
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,099
if someone presents a counterargument that
you can’t find a response to.

150
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,300
When that happens, a good philosopher will
be grateful to their interlocutor for helping
