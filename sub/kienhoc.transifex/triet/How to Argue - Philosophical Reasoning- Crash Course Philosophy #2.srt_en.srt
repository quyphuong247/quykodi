00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,420
Aristotle once described humans as “the
rational animal.”

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,059
Well, actually, he said that “man is the
rational animal,” but we don’t have to

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,930
be sexist just because he was.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,420
And if you’ve ever gotten into an argument
with someone about religion or politics or which

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,460
Hemsworth is the hottest, then you’ve experienced
how irrational people can be about their opinions.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,620
But what Aristotle meant is that rationality
is our distinguishing characteristic – it’s

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,329
what sets us apart from the beasts.

10
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,790
And no matter how much you disagree with someone
about God or Obama or Chris Hemsworth, you

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,140
can at least grant that they are not beasts.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,380
Because, most of the time at least, people
can be persuaded. By arguments.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,140
You use arguments all the time -- in the comments,
at family dinners, with your friends -- you

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,030
probably just don’t think of them the same
way that philosophers do.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,970
When you try and convince your parents to
loan you the car, or when you’re talking

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,710
up Crash Course to your friends, you are using
arguments. Thanks, by the way.

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,400
Each time you tell someone to do or believe
something -- or when you’re explaining why

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,020
you do or believe something -- you are giving
an argument.

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,880
The problem is, the vast majority of people
aren’t really good at arguments.

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,720
We tend to confuse making a good argument
with, like, having witty comebacks, or just

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,810
making your points more loudly and angrily,
instead of building a case on a solid foundation

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,990
of logic. Which can be harder than it sounds.

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,000
But learning about arguments and strong reasoning
will not only make you a better philosopher,

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,440
it will also set you up to be a more persuasive
person. Someone who people will listen to.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,400
Someone who’s convincing.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,610
So, yeah, these skills are beneficial no matter
what you want to do with your life.

27
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,090
So you might as well know how to argue properly.

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:43,380
[Theme Music]

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,520
If you want to learn how to argue, then you
should probably start about 2400 years ago,

30
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,010
when Plato was laying out how reason can,
and should, function in the human mind.

31
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,280
He believed that we all have what he called
a tripartite soul – what you might think

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,439
of as your “self,” or your psyche, divided
into three parts.

33
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,630
First, there’s the rational, or logical
part of the soul, which represents cool reason.

34
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,900
This is the aspect of your self that seeks
the truth and is swayed by facts and arguments.

35
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,180
When you decide to stop eating bacon for two
meals a day because, as delicious as it is,

36
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,620
it’s bad for you, then you make that decision
with the guidance of the rational part of your soul.

37
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,330
But then there’s the spirited aspect, often
described as the emotional part of the self,

38
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,240
although that doesn’t really quite capture
it.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,920
The spirited soul isn’t just about feeling
-- it’s also about how your feelings fuel your actions.

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,640
It’s the part that responds in righteous
anger at injustice, the part that drives your

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,970
ambition, and calls upon you to protect others.

42
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,250
It gives you a sense of honor and duty, and
is swayed by sympathy.

43
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,130
So if you decide to stop eating bacon because
you just finished reading Charlotte’s Web,

44
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,860
and now you’re in love with Wilbur, then
you’re being guided by the spirited part of your soul.

45
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,849
But we share the next part of our soul with
other animals, be they pig, or moose, or aardvark.

46
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,810
The appetitive part is what drives you to
eat, have sex, and protect yourself from danger.

47
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,340
It is swayed by temptations that are carnal,
and visceral.

48
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,890
So at those times when you go ahead and just
EAT ALL THE BACON because it just smells so

49
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,069
dang good, the appetitive aspect of your soul
is in control.

50
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,830
Now, Plato believed that the best human beings
-- and I should point out here that Plato

51
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,950
most definitely did believe that some people
were better than others -- are always ruled

52
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,240
by the rational part of their soul, because it works
to keep the spirited and the appetitive parts in check.

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,680
People who allow themselves to be ruled by
their spirited or appetitive selves are base,

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,310
he believed, and not fully, properly human.

55
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,080
Now, most of us don’t buy into the concept
of the tripartite soul anymore -- or the idea

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,300
that some humans are less human than others.

57
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,900
But we do understand that we’re all motivated by
physical desires, emotional impulses, and rational arguments.

58
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,260
And philosophers continue to agree with Plato
that reason should be in the driver’s seat.

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,450
So, how do you know if you’re good at it?
How can you test your reasoning?

60
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,519
Well, let’s head over to the Thought Bubble
for some Flash Philosophy.

61
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,239
Throughout this course, we’re going to apply our
philosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments.

62
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,659
Because remember: Philosophers love thinking about
questions -- especially ones that don’t have ready answers.

63
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:04,239
So think of these exercises as philosophical
wind-sprints -- quick tests of your mental abilities.

64
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,200
And here’s a doozy, from 20th century British
thinker Bertrand Russell, one of the pioneers

65
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,060
of what’s known as analytic philosophy.

66
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,620
Say there’s a town in which all men are
required by law to be clean-shaven. This town

67
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,020
has only one barber, a man, who must follow
strict rules:

68
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,100
Rule number one: He must shave all men who
do not shave themselves.

69
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,919
Rule number two: He must not shave any man
who does shave himself.

70
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,519
It’s the nightmare of every libertarian and every
mustachio’d hipster. But here’s the question:

71
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,800
Does the barber shave himself?

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,080
Cause think about it: The barber only shaves
men who don’t shave themselves. So if he does

73
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,639
shave himself, then he must not, because the barber’s
not allowed to shave guys who shave themselves.

74
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,239
But, if he doesn’t shave himself, then he has
to be shaved by the barber, because that’s the law.

75
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,290
Russell came up with this puzzle to illustrate the
fact that a group must always be a member of itself.

76
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,300
That means, in this case, that “all men
who shave themselves” has to include every

77
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,900
guy who shaves himself, including the barber.

78
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,440
Otherwise, the logic that dictates the group’s
existence just doesn’t hold up.

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,340
And if the barber is a logical impossibility,
then he can’t exist, which means the reasoning

80
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,710
behind his existence is inherently flawed.

81
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,990
And philosophy doesn’t tolerate flawed reasoning.

82
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,440
So, how do we make sure that we’re ruled
by good, sound, not-flawed reason?

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,480
By perfecting the art of the argument.

84
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,620
An argument, in philosophy, isn’t just a
shouting match.

85
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,700
Instead, philosophers maintain that your beliefs
should always be backed up by reasons,

86
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,140
which we call premises.

87
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,419
Premises form the structure of your argument.
They offer evidence for your belief, and you

88
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,130
can have as many premises as you like, as
long as they support your conclusion, which

89
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,790
is the thing that you actually believe.

90
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,810
So, let’s dissect the anatomy of an argument.

91
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,520
There are actually several different species
of arguments. Probably the most familiar,

92
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,440
and the easiest to carry out, is the deductive
argument.

93
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,920
The main rule of a deductive arguments is: if your
premises are true, then your conclusion must be true.

94
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,100
And knowing that something is actually true
is very rare, and awesome.

95
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,840
So, here’s a boiled-down version of a good
deductive argument:

96
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,800
Premise 1: All humans are mortal.

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,860
Premise 2: Socrates is a human.

98
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,040
Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.

99
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,759
This kind of reasoning, where one fact leads
to another, is called entailment.

100
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,119
Once we know that all humans are mortal, and that
Socrates is a human, those facts entail that Socrates is mortal.

101
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,919
Deduction begins with the general – in this
case, what we know about human mortality – and

102
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,910
reasons down to the specific – Socrates
in particular.

103
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,990
What’s great about deductive arguments is
that the truth of the premises must lead to

104
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,479
the truth of the conclusion.

105
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,680
When this happens, we say that the argument
is valid – there’s just no way for the

106
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,460
conclusion to be false if the premises are
true.

107
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,840
Now check out this argument:

108
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,289
All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human.
Therefore, Socrates was Plato’s teacher

109
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:41,820
That argument is invalid, because nothing about human
mortality can prove that Socrates was Plato’s teacher.

110
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,699
As you might have noticed, there are plenty
of mortal humans who never taught Plato.

111
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:50,050
What’s interesting, though, is that this
argument does happen to have a true conclusion,

112
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,670
which leads us to another issue. And that
is:

113
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,090
Validity is not the same as truth.

114
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,860
All ‘valid’ really means is that if the premises
are true, then your conclusion can’t be false.

115
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,180
But that doesn’t mean that your
premises prove your conclusion to be correct.

116
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,740
Like, in the case of whether Socrates was
Plato’s teacher, the premises are true,

117
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,830
and the conclusion is true, but the argument
is still not valid -- because the premises

118
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,139
don’t in any way prove the conclusion. It
just happens to be true.

119
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:19,439
So, if your premises don’t guarantee the truth of your
conclusion, then you can end up with some really crappy arguments.

120
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,560
Like this one:
- All cats are mammals

121
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,780
- I’m a mammal
- Therefore, I’m a cat

122
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:27,940
As much as part of me would like to be my
cat, this is invalid because the conclusion

123
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,480
doesn’t entail from the premises…at all.

124
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,620
I mean, all cats are mammals, but all mammals
aren’t cats. Which means there are such

125
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,020
things as non-cat mammals, which I am just
one example of.

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,980
And it probably goes without saying, but you can
have a perfectly valid argument and still have a false

127
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,920
conclusion, if any of your premises are false.
For example:  - All humans have tails

128
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,860
- My brother John is a human
- Therefore, John Green has a tail!

129
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,720
The argument is totally valid! – Because the premises
entail the conclusion! The reasoning totally stands up!

130
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,920
It’s just that one of the premises is flawed.

131
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,740
Since I’m reasonably certain that John doesn’t
have a tail -- I’ve seen him in a bathing

132
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,270
suit -- this argument is not deductively sound.

133
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,970
And a deductively sound argument is one that’s
free of formal flaws or defects.

134
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,419
It’s an argument whose premises are all
true, and that’s valid, which means its

135
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,599
conclusion is guaranteed to be true.

136
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,870
So, sound arguments should always be your
goal.

137
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,140
The reason that deduction is prized by philosophers
-- and lots of other important kinds of thinkers

138
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,880
-- is that it’s the only kind of argument
that can give you a real certainty.

139
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,360
But it’s limited, because it only works if you’re starting
with known, true premises, which are hard to come by.

140
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,399
And for what it’s worth, deductive truths
are usually pretty obvious. They don’t tend

141
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,059
to lead us to startlingly new information, like the fact
that I’m not a cat, or that John doesn’t have a tail.

142
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:42,520
So instead of starting with premises that
are already certain, like deduction does,

143
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,260
you’re gonna have to know how to determine
the truth of, and your confidence in, your premises.

144
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,080
Which means you’re going to have to acquaint
yourself with the other species of arguments,

145
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,739
which we’re gonna do next time.

146
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:56,369
But today, we talked about the value of reason,
the structure of arguments, and we took a

147
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,379
close look at one kind of argument: deductive
reasoning.
