00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,390
What are you afraid of?
Spiders? Public speaking? The dentist? Calculus?

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,520
What about death?

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,980
How you feel about death has probably been shaped by your beliefs about whether or not there’s an afterlife

6
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,750
– and if there is, what it’s like.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,740
The ancient Egyptians believed that, at death,
your heart would be weighed against a feather,

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,109
to determine if it was fit to enter the underworld.

9
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,199
A heart heavy with mis-deeds would be fed
to a demon.

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,230
Christians may envision Saint Peter, waiting
at the pearly gates to welcome you into heaven,

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,420
unless your name doesn’t make his list.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,360
Imagine not only being turned away from the coolest club in town, but banished to the eternal torments of hell.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
As we learned in our discussions about the philosophy of religion, when the stakes are eternal,

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,240
it’s only reasonable to get a little nervous about what’s basically the Ultimate Final Exam.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,059
But if it makes you feel any better, many
philosophers have believed, and still believe,

16
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,399
that death is nothing to fear.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:05,520
[Theme Music]

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,200
In 399 BCE, Socrates was sentenced to death
for, among other things,

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,090
refusing to acknowledge the official deities
of Athens,

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,719
radicalizing youth, and generally honking
off the people in charge.

21
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,289
But even when he faced his own imminent death,
he remained calm and unafraid.

22
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:25,359
He was a philosopher, after all.
And fear was no match for his ability to argue.

23
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,509
Socrates didn’t think we could know if there’s
an afterlife or not,

24
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:30,600
but he thought there were really only two
possibilities.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,860
And as far as he was concerned, neither of
them was anything to be afraid of.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,860
Here’s his argument:

27
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,920
Either death is a dreamless sleep
Or death is a passage to another life

28
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:43,149
Dreamless sleeps are nice, not scary
(Socrates said he could use the rest)

29
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,429
And a passage to another life sounds good,
too,

30
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:48,500
because he’ll get to hang out with cool
people from the past who have already died

31
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,630
Therefore, either way, death is nothing to
fear

32
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,710
Socrates’ idea of the afterlife was Hades, which he seems to have pictured as being a lot like Athens,

33
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,069
except that no one had any physical bodies
– only disembodied minds.

34
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,509
And frankly he thought that sounded awesome,
because bodies can be a real pain;

35
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,590
they just need to be fed, and require rest.
Just, so much upkeep.

36
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,179
So, in the afterlife, Socrates imagined he’d
get to have endless philosophical conversations,

37
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,030
and continue learning new things, with the
greatest thinkers of the past.

38
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,400
And they wouldn’t have to take a break to
eat or sleep or pee!

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,040
Now, Socrates recognized that, although his favorite activity, philosophizing, didn’t require a body, some things do.

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,000
And if all of your favorite pastimes are physical,
you might find the afterlife disappointing.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,790
That’s why Socrates recommended spending
your life looking after your mind,

42
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,360
cultivating that part of you that you’ll
get to keep forever – if there’s an afterlife.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,470
If you do that, when the time comes for you
to die, you’ll actually see death as a benefit,

44
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,050
because you won’t be troubled by bodily
things, while your mind will be in top form.

45
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,540
But what if there isn’t an afterlife?

46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,580
What about that “dreamless sleep” that
Socrates spoke about?

47
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,290
Isn’t total annihilation of the self, like,
the scariest thing there is?

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,870
Ancient Stoic philosopher Epicurus didn’t
think so.

49
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,080
He lived about a hundred years after Socrates,
and he rejected belief in an afterlife altogether.

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,810
Instead, he said we’re just our bodies,
and nothing more.

51
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,829
But still, he still didn’t find death scary.

52
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:05,590
Here’s his argument.
Death is the cessation of sensation.

53
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,709
Good and evil only make sense in terms of
sensation.

54
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,110
So, Death is neither good nor evil.

55
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,180
Epicurus was convinced that things are only
evil, or bad, if they feel bad.

56
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,590
And he didn’t mean only physical feelings.

57
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,099
Anyone who’s ever had a broken heart will tell you that it’s a lot more painful, and harder to heal, than a broken leg.

58
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,300
But a broken heart is still a sensation – you
need a body to experience it – so as a materialist –

59
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,980
someone who believed that You equal Your Body
– death just meant nonexistence.

60
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,819
And there was nothing scary about that, because,
well,

61
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:38,319
there won’t be any you to have any feelings
about not existing!

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,060
Epicurus argued that fearing nonexistence is not only stupid, but it gets in the way of enjoying life.

63
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,959
You are alive, and experiencing sensations,
now.

64
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,989
So, he said, make those sensations as great
as possible,

65
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,500
and don’t worry about when those sensations
are going to stop! YOLO!

66
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,879
To help you understand Epicurus and his attitudes
about death a little better,

67
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,560
let’s head over to the Thought Bubble for
some Flash Philosophy.

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,549
Think about a hangover. If you haven’t had
one, imagine what they might be like.

69
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,430
Hangovers aren’t bad for you before you
get one, right?

70
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,329
In fact, the thing that comes before the hangover
is often quite pleasant, what with all the laughing,

71
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:13,159
and feeling uninhibited, and working up the courage to talk to that cutie from your calculus class.

72
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,679
No, the hangover is only bad while it’s
happening.

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,600
And true: It might be bad after it’s over, like, if it kept you from doing well on your calculus exam the next morning,

74
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,320
because you were too busy trying not to barf
in front of said cutie.

75
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,540
But the point is, if something is bad for you, it’s generally bad for you at a particular time, the way a hangover is.

76
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,780
But Epicurus said that death can’t be bad
for you at any time.

77
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,890
Because once it arrives, you’re gone!

78
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,530
The thing that eventually kills you? Yeah, that’s gonna be bad for you, before your death.

79
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,900
But that’s not death.

80
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,410
When you think about it, you and Death are
never present at the same time.

81
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,510
And if there’s no you when death is present, then there is no time in which death is bad for you.

82
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,460
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

83
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,720
So, things like hangovers and charley horses and movie spoilers are bad, because you’re there to experience them.

84
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:59,040
But as far as Epicurus was concerned, life
was like a night of drinking before a hangover,

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,480
which – inevitable as it is –
you will never actually experience.

86
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,820
Now, the 21st century has its own perspectives
on death.

87
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,340
And one might be best described as a kind
of philosophical FOMO.

88
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,940
Contemporary American philosopher Thomas Nagel
points out that some people dread death

89
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,600
because they’ll miss out on things that
they want to experience.

90
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,980
If you died right now, you’d never get to finish the video game you’re in the middle of,

91
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,320
or read the next George RR Martin book, or
see humans land on Mars.

92
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,380
Which would suck, yeah.

93
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,540
But think about it like this: Cool stuff was going on way before you were born. And you missed it!

94
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,180
I’m gonna make some assumptions about your
age here

95
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,320
and say that you weren’t listening when Orson Welles terrified the nation with the War of the Worlds.

96
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,180
You didn’t march on Washington.
You totally missed Woodstock.

97
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,000
So, Nagel asks: If you don’t feel some sort of deep sense of loss at what you missed before you were alive,

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,580
why should you feel loss at what you’ll
miss after you die?

99
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,180
Now, Nagel does point out that, if we believe
that life is essentially good,

100
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,960
then there is something to mourn when a life
is cut short.

101
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,840
Since humans can live, on average, for about
80 years,

102
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,080
someone dying at the age of 20 is a tragedy, because that person missed out on 60 possible years of good times.

103
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,600
But we should pause here to talk about what
you really value about life,

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,050
because that will also have an impact on what
you think about death in general,

105
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,800
or about the death of a particular person.

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,240
If you say that life is just always, inherently, good, then you’re said to place a high value on the sanctity of life.

107
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,130
It doesn’t matter what the content of that
life looks like, or what the person is like.

108
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,780
The fact that they’re alive is just good.
So, losing it would not be good.

109
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,690
But, if you think that quality of life is
what’s important,

110
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,960
then you’re going to want to distinguish between lives that are full of good experiences, and those that aren’t.

111
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,440
If you value quality of life, you don’t think that there’s something inherently valuable about merely being alive.

112
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,760
So in these terms, some deaths might actually
be positive or valuable –

113
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,430
like, if they bring about an end to a terrible,
painful existence.

114
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,970
Now, of course, it might make sense to be
afraid of dying itself,

115
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,200
because the process of dying can be painful and drawn out and involve saying a lot of difficult good-byes.

116
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,000
But maybe Socrates and Epicurus have convinced
you that fearing your own death is absurd.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,580
Well then what about the death of others?
Is it equally silly to fear the death of the people you love?

118
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:59,040
Probably so, say some philosophers, because
what you’re fearing isn’t actually death;

119
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,560
what you’re afraid of is being left behind,
alone, when a loved one dies.

120
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,640
And this is a good place to hear from ancient
Chinese Daoist philosopher Zhuangzi.

121
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,220
He lived about the same time as Epicurus, and believed that there’s no reason to fear the death of your loved ones.

122
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,300
He asked, why would you fear the inevitable?

123
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,500
We know death is going to happen, to everyone, and we also know that it’s a part of the life cycle.

124
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,240
And we don’t see any other part of that
cycle as being bad.

125
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,260
Wouldn’t it be silly, he said, if we mourned
the loss of our babies when they became toddlers,

126
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,160
or our children when they became teens?

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,410
We celebrate every other life milestone, with
birthday parties, bar mitzvahs, and graduations,

128
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,840
to mark the passage of time and the changes
that have come.

129
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,550
Sure, your parents might shed some tears when
they pack you off to college,

130
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,610
but they also knew that that day was going
to come –

131
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,060
when you would move away from them and onto
your own life.

132
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,830
So death, according to Zhuangzi, is just one
more change – why treat it differently?

133
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,510
Instead, he said, you should celebrate the
death of a loved one

134
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,900
just as you celebrated every other life change
that they experienced.

135
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,220
You should think of their death as a going
away party for a grand journey.

136
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,670
In his view, mourning can actually seem selfish.

137
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,720
When it’s time for the people you love to
move on, Zhuangzi said,

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,110
the last thing you should do is hold them
closer.

139
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,080
Today we talked about death.

140
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,040
We considered philosophical responses – from
Socrates, Epicurus, and Zhuangzi,

141
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,330
about whether it’s logical to fear your
own death, or the deaths of your loved ones.

142
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,860
And we talked about Thomas Nagel, death, and
Fear of Missing Out.
