3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,040
There’s an ancient Greek legend about a
ship that launched from the port of Theseus,

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,440
and sailed around the world.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,580
Probably not around the WHOLE world.
Just AROUND the world.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,160
During its journey, the ship encountered many
dangers.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,300
Storms ravaged its sails, which had to be
replaced.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,840
The floorboards gradually gave way, and had
to be changed out, one by one.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,020
Eventually, crew members decided that they liked the look of some island or another along the way, and stayed behind.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,520
And as the ship sailed on, more and more of
it – and its crew – was replaced,

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,960
until finally, not a single original plank
of wood, or hand on deck, remained.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,880
Now here’s the question: When the ship finally returned to Theseus, was it the same ship that left?

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,360
The answer – whether we can find it or not
– lies in the concept of identity.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,780
Philosophers describe identity as the relation
that a thing bears only to itself.

15
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,890
So, whatever makes a thing uniquely what it
is defines its identity.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,570
And if two things are identical, they’re
said to share an identity relation.

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,619
Now, whether two things are the same might
seem blindingly obvious.

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,079
But of course it isn’t.
Because: philosophy.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,460
The philosophy of identity can get pretty slippery, largely because, like the Ship of Theseus, things change.

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,079
And when they do, they eventually stop being
what they are, and become something else.

21
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,810
This goes not just for mythological ships,
but for all kinds of things.

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,359
Like, this mug can acquire a new identity.
And this money.

23
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:31,219
And you.
And even … Batman.

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:41,720
[Theme Music]

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,360
So, riddle me this:
Is Batman identical to Bruce Wayne?

26
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,229
And when I say “identical,” I don’t
mean that they just look alike.

27
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,259
I mean that they share the same identity – they’re
literally one and the same.

28
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,069
So, you might think the answer is yes –

29
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:00,500
Bruce Wayne and Batman are identical because everyone knows that Bruce Wayne is the man behind the cowl.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,520
Not only that, you might say: Bruce Wayne
is the very essence of Batman.

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,300
He saw his parents get killed in that alley.
He became the Dark Knight.

32
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,130
No one else could take his place.

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,560
But hold up.
People have taken his place.

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,520
It turns out that Dick Grayson, the original
Robin, has pinch-hit for Batman,

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,100
donning the cape and cowl to protect the streets
of Gotham in his boss’s absence.

36
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,270
And so has Police Commissioner Jim Gordon.

37
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,260
After Bruce Wayne was reported dead, he reluctantly
accepted the role himself.

38
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,580
Both of those guys have been Batman.

39
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,320
So if the person inside the costume doesn’t
make Batman Batman, then what does?

40
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,100
17th century German philosopher Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz came up with a principle

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,230
that might help us solve the puzzle of Who
Batman Is.

42
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,860
He called it the Indiscernibility of Identicals.

43
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,340
The idea is that, if any two things are identical,
then they must share all the same properties.

44
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,280
If Leibniz is right, then the Ship of Theseus became a new ship as soon as that first plank of wood was replaced.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,920
As soon as its parts were not all original,
then the ship suddenly acquired a new property.

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,120
And with a new property came a new identity.

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,520
So likewise, Bruce Wayne and Batman can’t be identical, because they have different properties.

48
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,040
Bruce Wayne, for example, has the property of being a millionaire playboy, but Batman doesn’t.

49
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,620
That guy is all business.

50
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,740
Meanwhile, Batman has the property of having
fought the Joker, but Bruce Wayne doesn’t.

51
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,360
And the different versions of Batman aren’t
identical to each other either.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,000
Because the person wearing the costume, even if it’s the exact same costume – which it usually isn’t –

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,580
is going to have different combat techniques,
and even, say, a different moral code.

54
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,960
So, is there a limit to how much something
can change, and still be the same thing?

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,840
Let’s head over to the Thought Bubble for
some Flash Philosophy.

56
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,280
Think about this little puzzler, originally offered by contemporary American philosopher Alan Gibbard.

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,320
A sculptor takes a lump of clay, and names
it Lumpl.

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,680
She then forms Lumpl into a statue, which
she names Goliath.

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,880
Are Lumpl and Goliath identical?

60
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,060
Our intuition might say yes, because they’re composed of exactly the same amount of the same physical stuff.

61
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,200
It’s been kneaded and molded into a different
shape, but still:

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,470
No part of Lumpl is not Goliath, and no part
of Goliath is not Lumpl.

63
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,870
But consider this: If we wreck the statue, and smush into into a big blob, Goliath is gone,

64
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,180
because part of what it means to be Goliath
is to be shaped like a statue.

65
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,000
But, Lumpl, being a lump, doesn’t have a
set shape.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,100
So it will remain, after Goliath has been
destroyed.

67
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,620
So on one hand, Gibbard observed, Lumpl and
Goliath seem to be identical,

68
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,359
because they’re the same exact thing, just
in different shapes.

69
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,360
But on the other hand, how can Lumpl and Goliath be identical, if one can exist while the other does not?

70
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,720
Thanks, Thought Bubble! One way to try and make sense of identity, and explain how an object endures over time,

71
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,389
is by making a distinction between what we
call essential and accidental properties.

72
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,709
Essential properties are the core elements
needed for a thing to be the thing that it is.

73
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:45,389
Accidental properties are traits that could be taken away from an object without making it a different thing.

74
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,349
Think about a dog.
A dog without a tail is still a dog.

75
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:53,189
Give him a shave, or a silly poodle doo, don’t
let it bark – you still have a dog.

76
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:56,669
So all those things are all accidental properties,
and they’re pretty easy to pick out.

77
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:59,919
But it can be really tough to find its essential
properties, the things that,

78
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,879
if they were absent,
would make the dog not a dog anymore.

79
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,020
And the more something changes, the harder
it can be to determine its identity.

80
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:09,389
A tree can lose its leaves and still be a
tree.

81
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,220
But if you cut the tree up and make it into
a bunch of notebooks, is it still a tree?

82
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,460
And if you think a notebook is not a tree, then at what point in the process did the tree lose its tree-ness?

83
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,080
Was it when it was cut down, and thus no longer
living?

84
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,840
Maybe.
But isn’t a dead tree still a tree?

85
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,620
Or did it happen when the dead tree was cut
into pieces, and was lying on the ground?

86
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,999
Did it make a difference when those pieces
were collected?

87
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,960
How about when they were ground up into pulp?

88
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,380
The tree stopped being a tree when its essential
property was lost.

89
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,600
But when exactly that happened depends on
your perspective.

90
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,150
Plus, many thinkers reject the concept of
essential properties altogether.

91
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,110
Existentialists, for example, deny the very
existence of essential properties.

92
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,370
And ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus famously said that you can’t step in the same river twice.

93
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,720
What he meant was: Nothing is identical to
itself because everything

94
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,089
– including both you and the river –
is changing all the time.

95
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,329
So not only is the Ship of Theseus a new ship
by the time it gets to Theseus,

96
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:03,091
but it was a new ship the first time anything
about it changed!

97
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,340
Now, it’s amusing enough to think about
whether ships and trees endure over time,

98
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,849
or what makes Batman Batman.

99
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:12,729
But, ultimately, why should you care? How
does this affect your life?

100
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,099
Well, if objects are important to you,

101
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:18,559
then you’ll want to know whether you have
the same object that you think you have.

102
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:22,930
And, when it comes to tangible stuff, we tend
to value persistent identity.

103
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,689
If you take $20 out of my wallet to buy lunch
and then stop at an ATM and replace it,

104
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:31,289
is the money you gave me identical to what
I had this morning?

105
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,900
If Nick breaks my favorite coffee mug here, and replaces it with a new one and I can’t tell the difference,

106
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,389
do I still have the same mug I started with?

107
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:41,080
What if your dog runs away while I’m house-sitting
for you,

108
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,629
and I replace your dog with a new dog so similar
that you can’t tell? Is it the same dog?

109
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,189
What’s the difference between the money
and the cups and the dogs?

110
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:55,059
Philosophers actually have a word that explains
why we think one $20 bill is the same as another,

111
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:58,539
but one corgi isn’t the same as her cosmetically
identical sister.

112
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,300
It’s fungibility – the property of being interchangeable with other objects of the same kind.

113
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,220
Most people think that money is fungible, because it’s just a place-holder for the value it represents –

114
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:10,389
and it’s the value that we really care about.

115
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,680
As long as there’s a $20 bill in my wallet
to buy me some nice Thai drunken noodles,

116
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,550
I really don’t care whether it’s the same
one I put there or not –

117
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,499
although I would like to know why you’re
digging around in my wallet.

118
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,979
Now the coffee mug … this one is interesting.

119
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:25,719
It seems like what matters here is why that
mug that Nick broke was my favorite.

120
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,820
If I loved it because it’s the perfect size and shape to fit in my hands, and it keeps my coffee warm,

121
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,060
then I’d probably be just as happy with
a new one.

122
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,940
So in that case, the mug appears to be fungible.

123
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,339
But if I love the mug for personal reasons –

124
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,060
like, say it was the first Crash Course Philosophy mug ever manufactured, or it was a gift from my Dad.

125
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,640
Then a new one, even if it’s cosmetically the same, wouldn’t mean the same thing to me.

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,120
Because it might be that what I care about isn’t the mug at all, but some sort of abstract idea behind the mug –

127
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:55,869
like my love for Crash Course, or the connection
between Dad and me.

128
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:59,850
In any case, I gotta ask, Nick just be more
careful when you’re around my stuff.

129
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,539
Today we’ve learned about different ways
of understanding identity –

130
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:07,499
including the Indiscernibility of Identicals,
and essential and accidental properties.

131
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,580
We thought about how change does and doesn’t affect identity, and what it means for a thing to persist over time.

132
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,580
And next time, we’re going to take what we’ve learned about identity, and apply it to personal identity –

133
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,480
thinking about what connects this guy to me.
