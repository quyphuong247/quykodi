3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,540
Nothing gets people talking like proving the existence of God -- just look at the comments on our last video.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,160
And that is what Anselm of Canterbury did.
He claimed, in the 11th century,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,460
to have come up with deductive proof of God’s existence, through what we now know as the ontological argument.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,060
And, if there was such a thing as a social
network of medieval Christian philosophers

7
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,050
back then, it was positively abuzz with the
news. For a long time. Because, almost 200

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,540
years later, Italian theologian and philosopher
Thomas Aquinas encountered Anselm’s argument.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,180
But, like many others, he just didn’t buy
it.

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,440
Aquinas did believe in God. It was just that,
as a philosopher, he felt that it was important

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,820
to have evidence for your beliefs. He knew
that if he was going to dismiss Anselm’s

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,270
argument, he’d need to come up with something
better. So, he set out to construct five arguments

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,360
that would prove God’s existence, once and
for all.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,160
Yeah, five. Apparently, he was concerned one
wasn’t going to do it, so he figured that,

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,400
out of five, one was bound to stick.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,390
His first four arguments are known together
as the cosmological arguments, as they seek

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,880
to prove God’s existence through what he
argued were necessary facts about the universe.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,080
So, in keeping with the method that we discussed
in our very first episode, we’re going to

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,420
examine these first four arguments of Thomas
Aquinas -- and really try to understand them.

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,220
And then we’ll consider their merits…
...and their weaknesses.

21
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:30,540
[Theme Music]

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,200
Maybe the most striking thing about the cosmological
arguments of Aquinas, at least to modern eyes,

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,229
is that some of them are firmly based in the
natural world. Even though he lived in a pretty

24
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:43,780
unscientific time, Aquinas argued for the
existence of God through his understanding

25
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,130
of science, and with the help of what he thought
was physical evidence.

26
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,310
For example, the first of his cosmological
arguments is known as the Argument from Motion.

27
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,150
In it, Aquinas observed that we currently
live in a world in which things are moving.

28
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:00,119
And he also observed that movement is caused
by movers -- things that cause motion. Aquinas

29
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,200
was convinced that everything that’s moving
must have been set into motion by something

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,480
else that was moving. By this logic, something
must have started the motion in the first place.

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,280
Otherwise, you’d be stuck in a philosophical
quandary known as an infinite regress.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,720
You get an infinite regress when, in a chain of
reasoning, the evidence for each point along

33
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,330
the chain relies on the existence of something
that came before it, which in turn relies

34
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,350
on something even further back, and so on,
with no starting point.

35
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,220
Basically, Aquinas thought the very idea of
infinite regress was absurd, logically impossible.

36
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,040
Because, it implied that any given series
of events began with…nothing. Or, more accurately,

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,060
never really began. Instead, it could have
been going on forever.

38
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,080
In the case of physical motion, Aquinas wanted
to trace the cause of the movement he saw

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
in the world all the way back to its beginning.
And he figured there MUST have been a beginning.

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,830
Otherwise, for him, it would be like watching
these blocks fall, and being told that nothing

41
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,670
ever pushed over the first block. Instead,
they had always been falling down forever,

42
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,860
backward into eternity. There must have been
a time when nothing was in motion, Aquinas

43
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,540
thought, and there also must’ve been a static
being that started the motion. And that being,

44
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,790
according to Aquinas, is God – the Unmoved
Mover.

45
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,550
So his Argument From Motion ran something
like this:

46
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,030
Objects are in motion
Everything in motion was put into motion by

47
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,630
something else
There can’t be an infinite regress of movers

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,300
So there must have been a first mover, itself
unmoved, and that is God

49
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,430
Now, the second cosmological argument
of Aquinas was a lot like his first one.

50
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,600
Here, he proposed the Argument from Causation, and it, too, sets out to avoid the problem of an infinite regress.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,140
But instead of it explaining the motion of
objects, it set out to explain causes

52
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,670
and effects, in general, all over the universe.

53
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,440
The argument went along these lines:
Some things are caused

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,780
Anything that’s caused has to be caused
by something else (since nothing causes itself)

55
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,280
There can’t be an infinite regress of causes

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,900
So there must have been a first causer,
itself uncaused, and that is God

57
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,879
Just like with the Argument from Motion, the
point here is pretty simple: Effects have causes.

58
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,259
If you think about how you wound up watching this
video, you can trace the line of causation back,

59
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,260
from moment to moment. If you think about it long enough, you can probably go pretty far back.

60
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,659
But Aquinas said, again: It can’t go back
forever. There had to be a First Thing that

61
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,560
started off the chain of causes and effects.
And that Thing is God.

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,060
Argument number three was the Argument from
Contingency. And we should step back and get

63
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,299
a little background for this one. In philosophy,
we often distinguish between necessary beings

64
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:22,599
and contingent beings. A contingent being is,
simply put, any being that could have not existed.

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,460
That includes you. Sure, you
do exist, but you could not have.

66
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,420
If you had never been born, the world would go on. And
yes, things would be different – we’ve

67
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,380
all seen It’s A Wonderful Life – but the
world would go on. Instead, your existence

68
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,600
is merely contingent on the existence of other
things. In your case, you only exist because

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,080
a certain sperm met a certain egg and swapped
some genetic information. You’re basically a fluke.

70
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,270
But what does that have to do with God? Well,
again, Aquinas believed that there had to

71
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,840
be something that prevented an infinite regress
of contingency. That would mean that the contingency

72
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,160
on which everything existed would just keep
going back in time. And we can’t have a

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,860
world where everything is contingent, Aquinas
said, because then -- by definition -- it

74
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,260
all could easily have never existed. So he
needed at least one necessary being –

75
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,400
a being that has always existed, that always
will exist, and that can’t not exist, in

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,030
order to get everything going. And that necessary
being is God.

77
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,230
Aquinas spelled out the reasoning of his Argument
from Contingency this way:

78
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,880
There are contingent things
Contingent things can cause other contingent

79
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,800
things, but there can’t only be contingent
things

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,830
Because that would mean that there’s an
infinite regress of contingency, and a possibility

81
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,870
that nothing might have existed
An infinite regress is impossible

82
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,930
So there must be at least one necessary thing,
and that is God

83
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,229
Let that marinate in your brain for a minute
while unpack the next argument.

84
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,620
This one is built on the idea that we simply need a measuring stick in order to understand the value of things.

85
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,020
Good/bad, big/small, hot/cold – none of
these concepts can exist in isolation.

86
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,759
If you go out for a walk and you see an animal,
and it’s like this big, that animal would

87
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,350
be on the small side if it turned out to be
a dog. But if it were a rat, that would be HUGE.

88
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,960
How do we know? Because we gauge the size
of things in terms of other things.

89
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,120
The same idea applies to more abstract concepts, like your grades. How do we know that an A is good?

90
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Because it’s at the top -- we know that there are grades lower than an A, but nothing higher.

91
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,150
And Aquinas thought that all of our value
concepts would just be floating randomly in

92
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,930
space if there weren’t some anchor – something
that defined the value of everything else,

93
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,170
by being perfect – and that, again, is God.

94
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,120
This is how Aquinas developed Number four,
known as Argument from Degrees.

95
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,449
Properties come in degrees
In order for there to be degrees of perfection,

96
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,979
there must be something perfect against which
everything else is measured

97
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,960
God is the pinnacle of perfection

98
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,610
Ok, so we’ve considered Aquinas’ four
cosmological arguments. But remember, that’s

99
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,650
only step one. The next, and equally important
step in philosophy, is critical evaluation.

100
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,920
So what do we make of ‘em?

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,660
As philosophers, if you think an argument
is flawed, it’s your job to try and figure out why.

102
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,200
And by and large, philosophers – theists
and atheists alike – have been relatively

103
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,350
unimpressed by these four, having found many
problems in them.

104
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,780
For one thing, these arguments don’t seem
to establish the existence of any particular god.

105
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,580
Even if the arguments are correct, it
doesn’t look like Aquinas gets us to the

106
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,979
personal, loving God that many people pray
to. Instead, we’re left with unmoved movers

107
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,600
and uncaused causers who seem to have little
in common with the God of Abraham, Isaac,

108
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,420
and Jacob ... the God who feels emotions, and
cares about his creation, and answers prayers.

109
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,819
Basically, this objection says that
Aquinas’ god is so far removed from the

110
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,910
god that theists actually believe in, that
it doesn’t help anything.

111
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,720
But maybe you’re happy just believing
someone’s out there. That’s fine.

112
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,860
But then how about multiple someones?

113
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,500
Because – guess what – Aquinas’ arguments
don’t rule out polytheism. There’s nothing

114
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,900
in any of his arguments to prove that God
isn’t actually, like, a committee. Aquinas’

115
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,979
cosmological arguments also don’t prove
the existence of a sentient God. So, it might

116
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,130
be an old guy with a beard. It might be six
old guys with beards. But it also might be

117
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,569
an egg, or a turtle, or just a big block of
stone.

118
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,360
These observations have made some philosophers
uncomfortable with Aquinas’ ultimate conclusion.

119
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,069
But there are two objections that are thought
by some to be real nails in its coffin.

120
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:56,970
The first is simply that Aquinas was wrong
in his insistence that there can’t be an

121
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,630
infinite regress of anything. Aquinas takes
it as a given that there had to be a starting

122
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,970
point for everything -- whether it’s the
movement of objects, or causes and effects,

123
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,040
or contingent beings being created. But it’s
unclear that this is true, or why it has to be true.

124
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,380
If infinite regress can be possible, then
Aquinas’ first two arguments fall apart.

125
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,830
But perhaps the most significant charge made
against Aquinas’ arguments is that they’re

126
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,250
self-defeating -- that is, they actually prove
themselves wrong.

127
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,560
For example: If Aquinas is right that everything
must have been put in motion by something else,

128
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,200
and everything must have a cause other
than itself, then it seems that God should

129
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,759
be subject to those same stipulations. And
if God is somehow exempt from those rules,

130
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,789
then why couldn’t other things be exempt
from them too? If they can exist without God

131
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,749
being responsible them, then we don’t need
God to establish things in the first place.

132
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:44,709
All right, I’ve given you a lot to think
about.

133
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,209
So before we close, let’s pause and remind
ourselves about a couple of things.

134
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:52,920
First, you can accept a conclusion but reject
an argument. So you might agree with Aquinas

135
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,640
that God exists, but think none of his arguments
prove it.

136
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,960
Second, if you disagree with an argument,
you don’t get to just say, “yeah, you’re wrong.”

137
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,160
You have to give a counterargument. What did Aquinas get wrong, and how can you do better?

138
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,940
Why are your reasons superior to his?
Remember, philosophy is a dialectic.

139
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,660
Yes, Aquinas has been dead for centuries. But he started a conversation. And you get to participate

140
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,860
in that when you engage with his arguments, and offer your own, either in an effort to help him out

141
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,420
– by fixing flaws in his arguments while preserving his conclusion – or by refuting his entire project.

142
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,280
This is what it means to do philosophy – to engage with arguments about stuff that matters.

143
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,020
And whether or not there’s a God seems to matter quite a bit, particularly in the lives of theists.

144
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,400
Today we’ve learned about cosmological arguments,
and considered four of them. Next time, we’ll

145
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,710
look at Aquinas’ fifth argument, the teleological
argument.
