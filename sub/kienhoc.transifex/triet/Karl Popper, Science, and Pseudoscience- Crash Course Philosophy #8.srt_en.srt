00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,970
Imagine being alive when Albert Einstein was
developing his theories of relativity.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,920
Or witnessing the birth of psychology, as Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis took over the scientific mainstream.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,080
The early 1900s was an amazing time for Western
science.

6
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,439
There was another figure on the intellectual
scene when these great minds were at work.

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,439
Young philosopher Karl Popper was born in
Austria -- Freud’s home turf -- but built

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,810
his career in Britain, giving serious consideration
to the new ways that these and other scientists

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,739
of the time were thinking about the world.

10
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,559
And after looking at different methods that
people like Einstein and Freud were using,

11
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,680
Popper came to understand that not all scientific
achievement was created equal.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,120
He ended up making an important distinction,
between science … and what he called pseudo-science.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,180
And in the process of doing this, he taught
us volumes about the nature of knowledge itself,

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,280
and how we can best test it, and challenge
it, to bring us closer to the truth.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:07,820

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,420
Emerging at roughly the same point in history,
Freud and Einstein both made predictions that

17
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,060
they hoped would help us better understand
our world.

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,070
Freud, concerned with the individual psyche,
predicted that our childhood experiences would

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,450
have a heavy bearing on who we grew up to
be.

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,490
Meanwhile, Einstein waited patiently for a
solar eclipse that could disprove his entire

21
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,520
general theory of relativity, depending on what it would reveal about how light travels through space.

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,740
And then there was Karl Popper, born in 1902,
who grew up to observe these predictions with

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,540
keen interest. As a young scholar, he learned
about the psychoanalytic theories of Freud,

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,790
and attended lectures given by Einstein himself
about the rules of the universe.

25
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,030
And he noticed that these great thinkers used
different methods.

26
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,060
For example, Popper observed that Freud was
able to make just about any data point work

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,390
in service of his theory. Freud could explain
a person’s intimacy issues both in terms

28
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,970
of not being hugged enough as a child, or
in terms of having been hugged too much. Meanwhile,

29
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,490
almost any behavior on the part of a female
could be explained in terms of penis envy.

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,540
Evidence to support Freud’s theories seemed
to be everywhere!

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,909
But Popper saw that Einstein was making a
different type of prediction.

32
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:16,290
Instead of looking backward, and using past
data to “predict” the present, he was

33
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,620
looking ahead, and predicting future states
of affairs. Einstein’s theory was truly

34
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,560
risky, Popper realized. Because, if the future
didn’t match his predictions, then his theory

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,780
would be conclusively disproven. If the results
of the solar eclipse in 1919 had been different,

36
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,180
general relativity would have been finished.

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,659
Freud, on the other hand, could always just
read the past differently, so as to maintain

38
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,810
some kind of confirmation of his theory.

39
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,140
Suddenly, Popper understood the difference
between the science that Einstein was doing,

40
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,040
and what Freud was doing, which Popper rather
snootily referred to as pseudo-science.

41
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,609
Now, whether psychology today is considered
a hard science or a social science or some

42
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:53,760
other kind might be debatable. But you won’t
find many mainstream thinkers who consider

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,680
it pseudoscience. But still, nearly a hundred
years ago, when Popper was reaching these

44
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,920
conclusions, no modern philosopher had really
characterized what “science” truly meant

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,560
-- and what the implications were for the
pursuit of knowledge.

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,030
The traditional understanding of the scientific
method, going all the way back to the ancient

47
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,709
Greeks, relied on the belief that, to look
at the world with a scientific eye is to observe

48
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,340
with no preconceived notions.

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,079
You simply look, see what you see, and then
develop hypotheses based on those observations.

50
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,439
So, you look at a swan, and you notice it’s
white. You look at another swan; it’s white too.

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,060
You look at enough white swans, and eventually
you form the hypothesis that all swans are white.

52
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,739
This is what Freud said he was doing: Observing
relationships -- but instead of it being between

53
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,819
the relationship swans and colors, it was between particular human phenomena and human behavior.

54
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,580
But Popper argued that everyone has preconceived
notions of some kind. We all start out with

55
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,719
a hunch, whether we admit it or not.

56
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,579
After all, what you decide to observe is determined
by what you already care about enough to observe

57
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,400
in the first place and the fact that you care
about it so much also means that you already

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,879
have some beliefs about it.

59
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,549
So, what does that tell us about Freud?

60
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:00,769
Popper became convinced that methods like his that only served to confirm beliefs were pseudo-science.

61
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:02,700
And they could be used
to prove anything.

62
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,500
Consider the existence of Santa Claus. If
I try to find evidence of Santa’s existence,

63
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,779
I’m going to find it, easily. The world
is filthy with evidence of Santa Claus! There

64
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:15,109
are presents under the tree on Christmas morning.
There’s the guy at the mall. And then there

65
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:21,109
are all those songs, and stories, and tv shows, and movies – they combine to confirm your belief in Santa.

66
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:26,580
But Popper would argue that it’s only by seeking to disprove Santa’s existence that you can demonstrate his unreality.

67
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,300
So the question is, when we begin to test a theory, are we looking to confirm it, or disconfirm it?

68
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,620
This is the key point, for Popper – science
disconfirms, while pseudoscience confirms.

69
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,580
He elaborated on this insight by establishing a series of distinct conclusions about science and knowledge.

70
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,500
First, he said, it’s easy to find confirmation
of a theory if you’re looking for it.

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Remember the presents under the tree? If
you’re looking for proof that Santa exists, you’re not

72
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,620
likely to keep searching for contradictory
evidence after that.

73
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,480
Second, confirmation should only count if
it comes from risky predictions – ones that

74
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,640
could actually destroy your theory. Because,
Popper observed that every good scientific

75
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,240
theory is prohibitive – it rules things
out.

76
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,570
This might sound strange, because no one wants
to be wrong, but Popper says that every false

77
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:14,540
belief we discover is actually good, because that gets us that much closer to believing only true things.

78
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,860
Next, Popper argued that the only genuine test of a theory is one that’s attempting to falsify it.

79
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,200
So, if you were to test for Santa’s reality, your method would require you to try to prove that he doesn’t exist,

80
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,820
rather than proving that he does. So, you stay up all night, waiting to catch him delivering his presents.

81
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,500
This is risky, because if the person who actually shows up to put presents under the tree is your Dad,

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,640
then you’ve destroyed the Santa hypothesis.

83
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,400
On a very similar note, Popper also pointed
out that irrefutable theories are not scientific.

84
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,240
If it can’t be tested, then your theory
doesn’t have much value.

85
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,700
Like, you can only confirm that Santa is real
by doing everything in your power to prove

86
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,000
that he’s imaginary, and then failing to
do so. So you need to be tugging on Santa

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,260
beards at the mall. You need to investigate
reports of Santa sightings, and other weirdoes

88
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,700
caught breaking into peoples’ houses through
their chimneys. If you want to be able to

89
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,990
really trust in your belief in Santa, in a
genuinely scientific way, you need to put

90
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,170
your belief to the test, in every way you
can imagine.

91
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:12,200
This is where Popper says that you have earned
the right to call a theory scientific.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,960
And finally, once you’ve disproven your theory, Popper said, you need to be willing to give it up.

93
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,740
I mean, you can still cling to the Santa myth, even after catching your Dad putting gifts under the tree,

94
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,420
by accepting his lie that Santa had dropped the gifts off earlier, and that he was just “helping.”

95
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,320
But, if you’re a scientist, you’re gonna
have to be willing to let your beliefs go.

96
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,360
Accept the evidence. Move on.

97
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,780
And this is the modern scientific thinking that we
accept today: Testable, refutable, falsifiable.

98
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,160
You don’t seek to prove scientific hypotheses
right, you only prove them wrong.

99
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,180
A lot of this might seem so obvious that maybe
you’re wonder why we’re talking about it.

100
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,560
But that’s how right Popper was – he
was one of those rare philosophers who actually

101
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,340
managed to hit on an idea so right that we don’t
even really argue about it anymore.

102
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,830
So, it sounds like I’ve been talking mainly
about science all this time. But Popper and

103
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,770
his insights actually tell us a lot about
knowledge, in the philosophical sense.

104
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,120
For Popper, knowledge was about probability
and contingency. We are justified in believing

105
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,080
whatever seems most probable given our current
data. And we should always be willing to revise

106
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,800
our beliefs in the light of new evidence. In other words, our belief should be contingent on the data themselves.

107
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,300
This wouldn’t have satisfied Descartes,
who was always concerned about certainty.

108
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,160
But Popper never thought that certainty was
possible in the first place. If anything,

109
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,180
he thought being certain of something
causes you to close your mind, and that’s

110
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,030
not what we want. Always remaining open to
the idea that your current beliefs might be

111
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,610
wrong is the best way to get ever closer to
truth.

112
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,860
So where does this leave us?

113
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,000
Remember, we started out trying to prove that
we know the things we thought we knew. But

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,870
you have to be open to the idea that your
beliefs might be false -- because that’s

115
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,150
the only way that holding onto them can really
mean anything. Otherwise, we’re all just

116
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,050
believing whatever we want, with no grounds
for adjudicating between beliefs.

117
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,280
You should keep that in mind, because that’s
the name of the game for the rest of this course.

118
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,120
You only get to believe the things
you have reasons for, and we’re going to

119
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,800
start with the area that is hardest for most
people – God. Hope to see you there.

120
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,340
Today you learned about Karl Popper, and his
insights into science, pseudoscience, and

121
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,920
knowledge -- which might best be summarized as science disconfirms, while pseudoscience confirms.
