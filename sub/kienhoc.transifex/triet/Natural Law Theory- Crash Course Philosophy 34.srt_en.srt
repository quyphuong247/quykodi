1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Thomas Aquinas was no dummy.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,980
Remember him? The Italian fella? Christian monk? Philosophical superstar of the 13th century?

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,600
Aquinas thought morality was important for everyone, and that being a good person was a vital part of God’s plan for each of us.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,460
But he knew that not everyone had been exposed
to the Bible, or had even heard of God.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,780
So, what bothered him was:

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:28,160
How could people follow God’s moral rules – also known as the divine commands – if they didn’t even know about the guy who made the commandments?

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,680
Aquinas just couldn’t believe that God would have expectations for us, if he didn’t also give us – all of us – a way to meet them.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,940
So, Aquinas’ theorized that God made us pre-loaded
with the tools we need to know what’s Good.

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,160
This idea became known as the natural law
theory.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,319
And there are a lot of versions of this theory
still circulating around today.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,940
But Aquinas’ original take on natural law is by far
the most influential, and the longest standing.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,80
How influential?

13
00:00:55,80 --> 00:01:04,940
Well, if you’re Catholic or a member of any of the major Protestant denominations, or were raised in any of those traditions, then you’re probably already familiar with how Aquinas saw the moral universe and your place in it.

14
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,20
Basically, God is awesome, and he made you,
so, you are awesome.

15
00:01:10,20 --> 00:01:13,179
It’s just important that you don’t forget
to be awesome.

16
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:23,680
[Theme Music]

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,159
We all want stuff, Aquinas got that.
And he said that it was OK.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,820
In fact, the theory of natural law is based on the idea that God wants us to want things – specifically, good things.

19
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:43,259
Aquinas argued that God created the world according to natural laws, predictable, goal-driven systems whereby life is sustained, and everything functions smoothly.

20
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,120
And as part of this natural order, God made certain things that were good for his various creatures.

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,280
Sunlight and water are good for plants.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,940
Meat is good for cats, and plants are good
for bunnies.

23
00:01:52,940 --> 00:02:00,60
And – because God is awesome – he instilled all of his creatures with an intuitive desire for the things that he designed to be best for them.

24
00:02:00,60 --> 00:02:04,680
The things that we’re designed to seek are known as the basic goods, and there are seven of them.

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,000
The first thing that all living things just naturally want, Aquinas said, is self-preservation – the drive to sustain life.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Aquinas thought God built all creatures with a survival instinct, and this appears to be pretty much true.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,640
I mean, we naturally avoid dangerous situations like swimming with hungry sharks, and when we find ourselves in danger, we don’t have to stop and ponder the options before getting ourselves to safety.

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,40
After preserving our own lives, our next most pressing basic good is to make more life – in other words, to reproduce.

29
00:02:32,40 --> 00:02:41,600
Some beings are able to do this on their own, but since we need to coordinate matters with a partner, God kindly instilled us with a sex drive, and made the process feel good, to make sure that we do it.

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,680
Thanks, God!

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,520
But once we manage to achieve our second basic good – reproduction – we need to educate those kids we just made.

32
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,110
For humans, that’s going to mean stuff like
school and lessons in morality.

33
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,300
But even non-human animals need to teach their
babies how to hunt and avoid predators.

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,340
Otherwise, the offspring they worked so hard to create aren’t going to survive long enough to reproduce themselves, which, of course, is the goal of everything.

35
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:12,400
And while these first goods seem to apply to a pretty wide swath of creation, some of the basic goods are just for humans, because of the particular kind of being we are.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,780
For instance, Aquinas thought we are built
with an instinctual desire to know God.

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,620
He believed we seek him in our lives, whether
we’ve been exposed to the idea of God or not.

38
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,660
Interestingly, the existentialist Jean-Paul
Sartre agreed with Aquinas on this.

39
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,100
He said we’re all born with a god-shaped
hole inside of us.

40
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,600
The tragedy, for Sartre, is that he was an atheist, so he believed this was an emptiness that could never be filled.

41
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Next, taking a page out of Aristotle’s book, Aquinas also said that humans are naturally social animals, so it’s part of our basic good to live in community with others.

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:52,459
While short periods of solitude can be good, he believed that we’re basically pack animals, and our desire for love and acceptance, and our susceptibility to peer pressure, are all evidence of this.

43
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,340
Now, since we naturally want to be part a pack,
it’s a good idea not to alienate our pack-mates.

44
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,560
So, basically, Aquinas said we recognize the
basic good of not pissing everybody off.

45
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,470
I mean, he didn’t actually say it that way.

46
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,920
But if he did, I’m sure it sounded a lot
better in Latin.

47
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,140
The point is, Aquinas said we feel shame and guilt when we do things that cause our group to turn against us, and that was another basic good.

48
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,320
And finally, Aquinas said we’re built to
shun ignorance.

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,740
We’re natural knowers.
We’re inquisitive, and we want to be right.

50
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:27,660
This is another trait we share with non-human animals, because knowledge promotes survival, and ignorance can mean starving to death or ending up as someone else’s dinner.

51
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,360
So these are the basic goods, and from them,
we can derive the natural laws.

52
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,960
We don’t need the Bible, or religion class, or church in order to understand the natural law, Aquinas said.

53
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,140
Instead, our instinct shows us the basic goods, and reason allows us to derive the natural law from them.

54
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,460
Right acts, therefore, are simply those that
are in accordance with the natural law.

55
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,258
So how does this whole system work?

56
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,190
Well, I recognize the basic good of life,
because I value my own life.

57
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,000
And that’s clear to me, because I have a survival instinct that keeps me from doing dangerous, stupid stuff.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,40
Then, reason leads me to see that others also
have valuable lives.

59
00:05:03,40 --> 00:05:06,220
And from there I see that killing is a violation
of natural law.

60
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,360
So, for each negative law, or prohibition, there’s usually a corresponding positive one – a positive injunction.

61
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,700
For example, ‘Do not kill’ is a prohibition, but there’s also a positive injunction that encourages us to promote life.

62
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:26,580
And I can take that positive injunction of promoting life to mean anything from feeding the hungry, to caring for the sick, to making healthy choices for myself.

63
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,780
And we could do the same thing with each of
the basic goods.

64
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:35,700
The basic good of reproduction leads to a prohibition, don’t prevent reproduction, which is why the Catholic Church has been opposed to birth control.

65
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,760
And the positive injunction there is: Do procreate!

66
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,640
Do all the procreating you want!

67
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,760
And if you think it through – using your God-given reason – you’ll be able to see how the other natural laws are derived from the basic goods.

68
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,80
But, of course, as with the Divine Command Theory, the theory of Natural Law raises plenty of questions.

69
00:05:52,80 --> 00:06:01,560
For example, if God created us to seek the good, and if we’re built with the ability to recognize and seek it, then why do people violate the natural law all the time?!

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:12,740
Like, if this is supposed to be something so intuitively obvious that even plants and non-human animals can manage it, why is the world so full of people-killing and offending others and folks who do everything but seek God?

71
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,240
Aquinas had two answers for this: ignorance
and emotion.

72
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,20
Sometimes, he said, we seek what we think is good, but we’re wrong, because we’re just ignorant.

73
00:06:21,20 --> 00:06:22,320
And yes, that happens.

74
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,520
I mean, there once was a time when cigarettes
were literally what the doctor ordered.

75
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,948
Back then, we thought we were promoting our
health, but we were actually hurting it.

76
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,870
No matter how awesome God made you, or your
desires,

77
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,29
you have to have some understanding of how to be awesome.

78
00:06:36,29 --> 00:06:40,149
But ignorance can’t account for all of the
stupid things we do.

79
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:45,760
Aquinas, again following Aristotle here, said that, even though we’re rational, we’re also emotional creatures.

80
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,480
And sometimes, we see what we should do, but emotion overpowers our reason, and we fail to do the things we know we should.

81
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,380
So, in those cases, we just kinda forget to
be awesome.

82
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,620
Now, as with the Divine Command Theory, Natural law gives us a handy answer to the grounding problem.

83
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,620
It tells us that morality is grounded in God,
that he created the moral order.

84
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:08,900
It also gives us a reason to be moral – following
the natural law makes our lives work better.

85
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,359
But while it seems to have a lot more going for it than divine command theory, natural law theory has its share of critics as well.

86
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,980
First of all, it’s not going to be super appealing to anyone who doesn’t believe in God.

87
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:24,140
You can tell me God set the world up according to natural laws, but if I reject that whole premise, there’s not a lot you can do to convince me.

88
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:30,200
Another objection comes from 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, in the form of what’s known as the is-ought problem.

89
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,500
And to investigate this, let’s pop over
to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

90
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,120
Hume said it’s fallacious to assume that just because something is a certain way, that means that it ought to be that way.

91
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,59
But that’s basically what natural law theory
does all day long.

92
00:07:44,60 --> 00:07:49,900
We look at nature and see that creatures have strong survival instincts, so from there we conclude that survival instincts are good.

93
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,20
But, are they?

94
00:07:51,20 --> 00:07:54,58
I mean, to me, yeah, because it helps me stay
alive.

95
00:07:54,60 --> 00:07:59,280
But my survival instinct could also cause me to do all sorts of things that look immoral to other people.

96
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,580
Like killing you and crawling inside your still-steaming body, tauntaun-style, to stay alive in a blizzard.

97
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,789
Not that I would do that, but just for example.

98
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:11,140
Likewise, we can observe the existence of sex drives and conclude that reproduction is good.

99
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,320
But, sexual drive is also used by bad people to excuse horrible immoral things, like committing sexual assault.

100
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,359
And for that matter, is reproduction always
good?

101
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,479
Is it something all beings have to do?

102
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,58
Am I sinning if I choose never to have children?

103
00:08:25,59 --> 00:08:26,789
And what about bodies that can’t reproduce?

104
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:30,628
Or people who don’t want to reproduce or
have partners that they can’t reproduce with?

105
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:31,680
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

106
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,959
As you can see, for all it has going for it, natural law theory can pretty quickly open some big ol’ cans of philosophical worms.

107
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,569
Which might be why 18th century German philosopher
Immanuel Kant thought we needed a better option.

108
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,360
Which we’ll consider next time.

109
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,860
Today, we learned about natural law theory,
as proposed by Thomas Aquinas.

110
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,300
We studied the basic goods and the way instinct and reason come together to point us to the natural law.

111
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:59,120
We also discussed some problems with the theory, in particular, the is-ought problem advanced by David Hume.
