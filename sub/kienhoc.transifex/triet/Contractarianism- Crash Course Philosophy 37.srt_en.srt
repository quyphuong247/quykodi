1
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,48
Imagine a world without rules.
Nothing is illegal.

2
00:00:06,49 --> 00:00:09,520
Nothing is immoral.
Everyone is absolutely free.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:17,240
This might sound like utopia to you, but according to 17th century British philosopher Thomas Hobbes, it would actually be your worst nightmare.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,640
Hobbes called this hypothetical time, with no rules
to govern our behavior, “the state of nature.”

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,20
And he described life there as “solitary,
poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”

6
00:00:28,20 --> 00:00:29,419
And he was probably right.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,400
The land of do-as-you-please sounds great – until you realize that everyone else is also doing as they please.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,980
That’s when you find out that you have an abundance of freedom, but you do not have any security.

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:47,319
Because, when everyone’s constantly watching their backs, whoever is the biggest bully will be able to dominate, simply by fear and aggression.

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:55,20
And even if you happen to be the biggest bully, life’s not going to be any better, because when enough weaker bullies get together even the strongest can be overthrown.

11
00:00:55,20 --> 00:01:00,820
So, this type of system – a sort of anti-system, without rules and without order – is a terrible way to live.

12
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,280
And Hobbes pointed out that rational people
would want to change the system.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,340
They’d trade in some of their natural freedoms, in exchange for the security offered by civil society.

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,640
The key to saving the world from chaos, he
said, was a contract.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:24,40
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:24,40 --> 00:01:27,960
Hobbes didn’t think there was anything deeply
real about morality.

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,639
It’s not written in the stars, or waiting to be discovered by reason, or handed to us on stone tablets by the divine.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,940
Morality, he believed, is not primitive, or
natural.

19
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:46,539
Instead, Hobbes proposed, anytime you get a group of free, self-interested, rational individuals living together, morality will just emerge.

20
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:53,960
Because free, rational, self-interested people realize that there are more benefits to be found in cooperating than in not cooperating.

21
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,669
Like, say I have an avocado tree growing outside
of my house.

22
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,670
I consider it mine, and I can take all the
avocados I want from it.

23
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,480
You have a mango tree, and you can take all
the mangoes you want.

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,960
But sometimes avocado-have-ers grow tired of avocados, and mango have-ers grow tired of mangoes.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,900
This might actually be a bad example because
is there any such thing as too much guacamole?!

26
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,939
But sometimes you just really want a mango
smoothie.

27
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,840
And in the state of nature – where there are no rules – the only way for me to get a mango is to steal it.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,40
And the same goes for you and my avocados.

29
00:02:22,40 --> 00:02:29,100
So we found ourselves living in a world where we steal from each other, which means that both of us are always on edge, and we see each other as enemies.

30
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,239
But remember, we’re rational,
so we find a better way.

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,100
We make an agreement.
We promise not to steal from each other.

32
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,780
And we promise to trade, avocados for mangos.

33
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,700
Now we have more security and a more interesting
diet.

34
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,679
What we have created is a contract – a shared
agreement – and suddenly, morality is born.

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,320
This view, espoused by Hobbes and followed
by many today, is known as contractarianism.

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,519
Contractarians say that right acts are those that do not violate the free, rational agreements that we’ve made.

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,640
And we make these agreements because we think
they’ll make our lives better.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,160
So basically, we trade in some freedom for the
benefits that come out of cooperative living.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,140
Avocado-for-mango contracts are pretty straightforward.

40
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,980
We both want something, and we make an explicit contract that we both believe will result in us being better off.

41
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,959
But some contracts aren’t so obvious.

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,720
We’re also bound up in a lot of implicit contracts – ones that we’ve never actually agreed to, but sort of find ourselves in.

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,340
For instance, natural born citizens of the United States never agreed to follow the law of the land.

44
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,340
Immigrants who become citizens do; they have to engage in an explicit contract as part of the citizenship process.

45
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,60
But for the rest of us, we are expected to follow all sorts of rules that we never agreed to follow.

46
00:03:39,60 --> 00:03:47,740
Now, if you try to explain to the cop who pulled you over that you never agreed to the speed limit, so you’re not bound to follow it, well, I’m pretty sure you’re gonna get a ticket anyway.

47
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,740
And that might seem really unfair to you.

48
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,940
But contractarians will tell you that it’s
not.

49
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,440
Because you reap all kinds of benefits from
being a part of this system.

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,180
You get to drive on safe roads, drink clean water, and if your house catches on fire, people will show up and do their best to put it out.

51
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:10,900
Rights imply obligations, by Hobbes’ thinking, so when you take from the common pot – by enjoying the goods that the system provides – you are also expected to pay in.

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:19,440
That’s what happens when you pay taxes, and when you show up for jury duty, and when you accept the punishment for violating the rules – even rules that you disagree with.

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,180
So, contracts are a pretty brilliant way for
making society not just survivable, but possible.

54
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:32,000
They save you from a situation that Hobbes described as a “war of all against all,” and puts you in this idyllic land where everyone cooperates.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,220
But can you really count on cooperation?

56
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,90
To explore that question, let’s head over
to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

57
00:04:39,90 --> 00:04:48,359
In the 1950’s, Canadian mathematician Albert W. Tucker formalized an idea that had originally been posed by American game-theorists Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher.

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,100
Since then, many versions of this dilemma
have been presented.

59
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,289
But Tucker’s scenario goes like this:

60
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,740
You and your partner in crime are both arrested
and put in separate rooms for interrogation.

61
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,320
The prosecution doesn’t have enough evidence
to convict you for your main offense.

62
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,930
The best they can hope for is to give you
each a year in prison on a lesser charge.

63
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,810
So, the prosecution offers you each a deal:
If you rat out your partner, they’ll let you go free.

64
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,900
But now you and your partner face a dilemma.

65
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,609
If you both remain silent, you know you won’t
get any more than a year in prison.

66
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:23,430
But if you’re enticed by the thought of doing no time at all – all you have to do is squeal, and you’ll go free while your partner does three years.

67
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,290
The problem is, enticed as you are by the offer, you know that your partner is thinking the same thing.

68
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,360
And if you each give up the other, then the prosecution will have enough evidence to send you both away for two years.

69
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,60
So now you think, no, it’s better to stay
silent.

70
00:05:37,60 --> 00:05:42,240
That way, you’ll only get the one year – as long as you can count on your partner to reason the same way.

71
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,529
But what if he doesn’t?

72
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,860
What if you stay quiet and
your partner’s the rat?

73
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,291
Well, that means you’re doing three long years,
while he gets away scot-free.

74
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,340
Facing that unpleasant prospect, if you’re both rational agents, you’ll be drawn to the conclusion that looking out for yourself is the best option,

75
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:03,400
because it carries with it the prospect of either zero or two years, rather than the one or three years that you might get if you stay silent.

76
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

77
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,849
The Prisoner’s Dilemma shows us some interesting
wrinkles in contractarianism.

78
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:15,40
Even though it was rational for both prisoners to squeal, they’d actually have been better off if they could count on each other to stay quiet.

79
00:06:15,40 --> 00:06:20,20
Cooperation pays, but only when you trust
your fellow contractors to keep their agreements.

80
00:06:20,30 --> 00:06:22,950
This is why a lot of defection occurs among
strangers.

81
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:30,99
Defection is where you break the contract you’re in – whether you agreed to be in it or not – and you decide to look after your own interests, instead of cooperating.

82
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,700
For example, the next time you’re driving
during rush hour, you’ll see rampant defection.

83
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,599
Instead of following the rules, waiting their turn, and merging when they’re supposed to,

84
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,360
people will speed down the shoulders and try to sneak up to the head of the merge lane – which ends up slowing down everybody.

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:52,380
But, you see much less defection among people who know each other, because when you flagrantly violate a contract among people you know, it comes with a heavy social cost.

86
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,540
There’s a special kind of moral outrage for somebody who freely makes an agreement they didn’t have to make, and then violates it.

87
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,600
Because, our whole society is built on the
trust that people will keep their word.

88
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,250
But, there’s another important part of this
theory – one we haven’t mentioned yet.

89
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,750
And that is: In order for a contract to be
valid, the contractors must be free.

90
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,380
You can’t force someone into a contract.

91
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,551
And the contractors must be better off in the system that the contract makes possible, than they would be outside of it.

92
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,940
Sure, there are probably some rules that don’t work in your favor all the time, but the system, overall, must make your life better than if you were on your own.

93
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,760
So contractarianism necessarily rules out
things like slavery.

94
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:37,420
Any given person will always be better off outside a system that enslaves her, so that type of system could never be legitimate, even if it’s agreed upon by the majority of the group.

95
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:44,760
And maybe you’ve noticed something else about this moral theory – something that’s distinct from, say, the divine command theory, or kantianism, or even utilitarianism.

96
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,219
With contractarianism, there is no morality
until we make it up.

97
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,819
There’s nothing fundamentally “real”
about it.

98
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:59,460
But it becomes real, as soon as you and I agree that it is, because once we agree to particular rules, they become real, and binding.

99
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,299
So in a way, contractarianism is the most permissive of the moral theories we’ve looked at.

100
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,880
Morality is determined by groups of contractors,
so whatever they agree to, goes.

101
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,400
Which means, of course, morality can change.

102
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,150
If, as a group, we change our minds, we can
simply modify the contract.

103
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,450
Which is what happens, explicitly, when we change laws, and implicitly, with shifting social mores.

104
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,400
But contractarianism is still pretty rigid
in some ways.

105
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,819
If you take on an obligation, you have a duty
to keep it.

106
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:34,299
This theory starts with the assumption that we get to choose what responsibilities we incur, so we’re all held to a high standard for keeping the agreements we choose to make.

107
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,280
Next time, we’re gonna conclude our unit
on moral theory with a look at virtue theory.

108
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,990
Today, though, we learned about contractarianism.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,640
We talked about Hobbes’ state of nature,
and the implicit and explicit contracts.

110
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,180
We learned about the Prisoner’s Dilemma, and
the benefits, and costs, of violating contracts.
