00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,600
What gives your life meaning?
God? Love? Money? Work?

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,040
Fanfiction? Football? Shopping? Sherlock?

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,820
You might have your own personal sense of
purpose in your life,

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,070
or maybe you’re hoping this course will
help you find one.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,930
Or you might believe that you were created with a certain essence as a human being, with a purpose given to you by God.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,360
Whatever the case is, no one would fault you
for wanting your life to have meaning.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,919
A sense of meaning is something that we all
crave – maybe even need.

10
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,460
And as we move out of our unit on the philosophy
of religion,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,890
we should spend some time talking about how
we understand our lives as being meaningful.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,579
Because when you think about it, a lot of us devote a ton of energy to the task of finding meaning in our lives.

13
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,449
Maybe you find it through religion, or by
fighting for social justice, or educating

14
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:49,420
others, or seeking beauty in artistic expression.

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,550
No matter how you do it, there’s a group
of philosophers, the existentialists,

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,190
who say that any, or all, of these things
can give your life meaning.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,030
But at the same time, they say: None of them
can.

18

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,650
As you know by now, philosophy is about the dialectic:

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,760
Someone puts forth an idea, and then someone else responds to it.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,480
Sometimes, the response comes right away.
In other cases, it takes thousands of years.

22
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,579
Way back in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle
took it as given that everything has an essence

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,840
– a certain set of core properties that are necessary,
or essential – for a thing to be what it is.

24
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,420
If those properties were missing, then that
thing would be a different thing.

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,220
For instance, a knife could have a wooden
handle or a metal handle – it really doesn’t matter.

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,460
But if it didn’t have a blade, it wouldn’t
really be a knife anymore.

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,079
The blade is the essential property of the knife, because it gives the knife its defining function.

28
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,030
Now, Plato and Aristotle thought that everything
has an essence – including us.

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,000
And they believed that our essences exist
in us before we’re even born.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,200
So by this thinking, part of what it means
to be a good human is to adhere to your essence.

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,600
Now, you may or may not know what your essence
is,

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,070
and you might be great at living up to your
essence, or you may be awful at it.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,789
But the important thing is that your essence
gives you a purpose.

34
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,039
Because you were born to be a certain thing.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,540
This belief, known as essentialism, was the standard view of the universe all the way up until the late 19th century,

36
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,560
and it’s still accepted by many people today.

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,300
But in the late 1800s, some thinkers started to challenge the idea that we are imbued with any essence or purpose.

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,640
German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, for
example,

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,520
embraced nihilism, the belief in the ultimate
meaningless of life.

40
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,920
But by the mid-20th century, the path had
been paved for

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,140
French thinker Jean-Paul Sartre to return
to the question of essence and ask:

42
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,280
What if we exist first?

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,340
What if we’re born without any hard-wired purpose? And then it’s up to us to find our own essences?

44
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,700
Well this became the framework for what we
now know as existentialism.

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,620
And its mantra is the claim that “existence
precedes essence.”

46
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,250
In other words, our existence – our birth
– happens first.

47
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,990
Then, it’s up to each of us to determine
who we are.

48
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,870
We have to write our own essence, through
the way we choose to live.

49
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,550
But we have no actual, predetermined purpose
– there’s no set path that we’re supposed to follow.

50
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,650
It’s hard to express how radical this idea
was at the time.

51
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,030
Because, for thousands of years, you didn’t
have to choose a path, or find your purpose.

52
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,160
God did it for you.

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,920
But it’s important to note that existentialism
is not synonymous with atheism.

54
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,890
Plenty of existentialists are atheists, but
some are theists, like Kierkegaard.

55
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,410
What theistic existentialists deny is any
sort of teleology –

56
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,700
that is, they refute the notion that God made the universe, or our world, or us, with any particular purpose in mind.

57
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,120
So, God may exist – but instilling you,
or your life, or the cosmos, with meaning

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,760
– that’s just not in his job description.

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,620
As a result, we are each born into a universe
in which we,

60
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,440
and our world, and our actions, lack any real,
inherent importance.

61
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,060
This is a fundamental component of existentialism.

62
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,510
And its adherents refer to it as “the absurd.”

63
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,950
You and I think of absurdity as something
that’s just silly, or preposterous.

64
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,040
But for existentialists, absurdity is a technical
term.

65
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,470
It’s how they describe the search for answers
in an answerless world.

66
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,330
We are creatures who need meaning, but we’re
abandoned in a universe full of meaninglessness.

67
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,540
So we cry into the wilderness, and get no
response.

68
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,230
But we keep crying anyway.

69
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,000
That, for an existentialist, is the definition
of absurd.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,480
Since there’s no teleology, the world wasn’t created for a reason, and it doesn’t exist for a reason.

71
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,100
And if there’s no reason for any of this,
then there’s also no absolutes to abide by:

72
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,069
There’s no cosmic justice, no fairness,
no order, no rules.

73
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:25,409
Now, existentialism has its roots in late-19th-century
thinkers like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.

74
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:28,340
But it really came into its own during and
after World War II,

75
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,449
as the horrors of the Holocaust led many people
to abandon any belief in an ordered world.

76
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:34,560
And who could blame them?

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,180
When Nazis became possible, meaning became
much harder to find.

78
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,600
But Sartre faced meaninglessness head-on, and explored one of the most agonizing aspects of existentialism.

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,240
Not the world’s lack of meaning.
But its terrifying abundance of freedom.

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,760
To most of us, freedom sounds pretty great. But Sartre thought that we are painfully, shockingly free.

81
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,600
After all, if there are no guidelines for
our actions,

82
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,699
then each of us is forced to design our own
moral code, to invent a morality to live by.

83
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,940
Sartre took this to mean that we are “condemned
to be free,” a fate that he found to be quite awful.

84
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,199
You might think that there’s some authority
you could look to for answers, Sartre said,

85
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,650
but all of the authorities you can think of
are fake.

86
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,370
You can do what your parents say, or your
church, or your government,

87
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,960
but Sartre said those authorities are really
just people like you,

88
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,380
people who don’t have any answers, people who had to figure out for themselves how to live.

89
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,819
So the best thing you can really do, he determined,
is to live authentically.

90
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,100
Sartre used this to mean that you have to accept the full weight of your freedom in light of the absurd.

91
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,100
You have to recognize that any meaning your
life has, is given to it by you.

92
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,369
And if you decide to just phone it in, and
follow a path that someone else has set

93
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:46,099
– whether it’s your teachers, your government,
or your religion –

94
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:50,919
then you have what he called bad faith, a
refusal to accept the absurd.

95
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,330
If you live by bad faith, you’re burying
your head in the sand

96
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,160
and pretending that something out there has
meaning – meaning that you didn’t give it.

97
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,220
Which brings us to this week’s Flash Philosophy.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

98
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,180
Sartre explained these ideas through an anecdote about one of his students, who faced a difficult decision.

99
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,560
This young man was at a crossroads in his
life.

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,520
He could join the military during wartime, and go off to fight for a cause that he believed in.

101
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,999
And he wanted to do this.
He thought it was right.

102
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,419
But he also had an elderly mother who was
all alone, except for him.

103
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,080
If he went to war, he’d leave her behind.
And that seemed wrong.

104
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,800
So he could stay with her, and let others
fight for justice. Or he could go off to war,

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,050
and leave his mother to herself, and likely
never see her again.

106
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,460
The young man felt a sense of duty to both his cause and to his mother, but he could only serve one.

107
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,800
Moreover, if he went to war, he’d be just
a very small part of a really big cause.

108
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,779
His contribution probably wouldn’t be great,

109
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:39,819
but he would be contributing to something
that would affect millions of people.

110
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:43,919
But if he stayed behind, he’d make an enormous
difference in just one person’s life.

111
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,870
Thanks Thought Bubble. So, what’s the answer?

112
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,909
Sartre said that the whole point of this young man’s decision was that no one could give him an answer.

113
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:55,489
In fact, there was no answer, until the man
chose one for himself.

114
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:57,600
No moral theory could help him decide,

115
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,750
because no one else’s advice could lead
him to a decision that was truly authentic.

116
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,840
So his choice – no matter what it was – was the only true choice, provided that he made it authentically,

117
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,840
because it was determined by the values he
chose to accept.

118
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,430
A lot of people think existentialism paints
a pretty bleak picture of the world.

119
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,210
In fact, the French philosopher and novelist
Albert Camus went so far as to say that

120
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,059
the literal meaning of life is whatever you’re
doing that prevents you from killing yourself.

121
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:26,490
But most existentialists would remind you
that the world, and your life, can have meaning,

122
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,449
but only if you choose to assign it.

123
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,940
If the world is inherently devoid of purpose, you can choose to imbue it with whatever purpose you want.

124
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,680
So, no one can tell you if your life isn’t
worth anything if you, say, don’t have children,

125
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,240
or don’t follow a lucrative career path, or achieve whatever standards your parents hold you to.

126
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,860
And this works not just on an individual scale,
but on a global one too.

127
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,800
If the world is going to have any of the things
most of us value

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,339
– like justice and order –
we’re going to have to put it there ourselves.

129
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,749
Because, otherwise, those things wouldn’t
exist.

130
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:58,409
So, a worldview that looks bleak to some,
may to others seem almost exhilarating.

131
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:03,460
Today I hope you enjoyed as much as I did learning about essentialism and its response: existentialism.

132
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,540
We talked about Jean-Paul Sartre and his ideas about how to find meaning in a meaningless world.
