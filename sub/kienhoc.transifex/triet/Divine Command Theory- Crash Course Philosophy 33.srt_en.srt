00:00:03,80 --> 00:00:10,140
The book of Deuteronomy, chapter 22, verse 11, says that people must refrain from wearing fabrics made of wool and linen mixed together.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,920
The First Epistle to Timothy, chapter 2, verse 9, prohibits women from wearing braids or gold chains.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,180
And Leviticus lays out restrictions against
tattoos and gossip, among other things.

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:26,259
For billions of people, the source of these edicts – the Bible – is the answer to the question of where morality comes from.

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,50
In a sense, that’s what the Bible is for.

6
00:00:29,50 --> 00:00:38,550
If your worldview tells you that that God is the creator of everything, it’s reasonable to believe that he’d also create a divine rulebook – a sort of owner’s manual for human morality.

7
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:48,730
And no matter who you think wrote that manual, many people feel that, in order for morality to really be binding – for it to be something we all have to adhere to – it can ONLY originate with God.

8
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,209
This is the oldest and most widely held ethical
theory in the world.

9
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,840
Philosophers call it Divine Command Theory:

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:05,100
the belief that what’s moral, and what’s immoral is commanded by the divine, whether it’s the “big G” Judeo-Christian God, or some other deity, or group of gods.

11
00:01:05,99 --> 00:01:10,880
People have been going to the gods to figure out how to behave since the start of recorded history – and for good reason.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,720
Just one benefit of the divine command theory
is its simplicity.

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,700
How do I know what to do?
Easy. Go ask God. Check the rulebook.

14
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,40
It also solves the grounding problem that
we discussed last time.

15
00:01:21,40 --> 00:01:26,560
Every ethical system needs some kind of foundation, and with the Divine Command Theory, it’s God. Period.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:35,560
But, as you can tell from those verses I just mentioned, there are a whole lot of things that most of us think are totally fine, but are actually, expressly forbidden by certain rulebooks – in this case, the Bible.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,230
And that raises a few questions.

18
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,789
For example, many observant Jews follow the
rule about not wearing wool mixed with linen.

19
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:45,490
But Christians don’t – most of them probably
don’t even know the rule exists.

20
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,910
And yet they consider other rules from the Old Testament – like the Ten Commandments – to still be binding.

21
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,950
So, why?

22
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,790
For that matter, why does First Timothy prohibit
women from having braids, but not men?

23
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:01,710
And if tattoos, smack-talk, and gold chains are forbidden, then, technically speaking, is all of modern culture a violation of God’s word?

24
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:08,630
Divine Command Theory addresses many of our biggest questions about right and wrong, which is why it’s the ethical theory of choice for much of the world.

25
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,210
But it also presents a true dilemma.

26
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:21,660
[Theme Music]

27
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,140
Over the millennia, there have been plenty of objections to the idea that morality comes from God.

28
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,420
One of the most devastating critiques – and one that philosophers still grapple with today – came from Plato.

29
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,420
He wrote an entire book about his problems with divine command theory, a dialogue called the Euthyphro.

30
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:43,920
The dialogue, like most of Plato’s works, stars his real-life teacher, Socrates, and Socrates’ main interlocutor-of-the-day, named Euthyphro.

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,299
The dialogue is set outside the Athenian courthouse, as the two men sit, awaiting their respective trials.

32
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,260
Socrates is preparing to defend himself against the charges that will ultimately lead to his death.

33
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,380
Among other things, he was accused of corrupting the youth of Athens and not having the right kinds of beliefs about the gods.

34
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,200
Meanwhile, Euthyphro is getting ready to bring
murder charges against his very own father!

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:14,660
Socrates is shocked to hear that Euthyphro is prosecuting his dad, and this gets the two into a spirited conversation about morality, and how we know what’s moral and what’s not.

36
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:22,640
Euthyphro is a divine command theorist, and he is certain that prosecuting his own father is the right thing to do, because he believes the gods have commanded it.

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,100
But, Socrates isn’t so sure.

38
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,470
And he asks a question that many believe still
hasn’t been adequately answered.

39
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,40
It’s now known as The Euthyphro Problem.

40
00:03:31,40 --> 00:03:34,250
The question Socrates asks can be framed something
like this:

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,180
Are right actions right because God commands
them?

42
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,850
Or are right actions commanded by God because
they are right?

43
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,140
This might not sound like much of a distinction at first, but these two scenarios are actually quite different.

44
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,279
In fact, many feel that, with this, Socrates
has presented us with a true dilemma.

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,320
A dilemma is a situation in which you’re forced to choose between two options, both of which lead to unpleasant results.

46
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,180
Philosophers have actually likened a dilemma to holding an angry bull by the horns – so the two unpleasant options are known as horns.

47
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,520
If you choose the first horn of Socrates’ dilemma, then you’re accepting the proposition that right acts are right because God commands them.

48
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,80
And this means that you’re accepting that God’s command alone is simply what makes something right.

49
00:04:14,80 --> 00:04:16,20
So, in this view, God makes goodness.

50
00:04:16,29 --> 00:04:19,789
And by extension, this suggests that anything
God commands is right.

51
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:26,400
And maybe you’re OK with that, because you believe that God only commands good things, like honoring your parents and not stealing or lying or killing.

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,739
But, if you know your Bible, you’ll remember that God does command killing when he feels like it.

53
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,880
For example, when he commanded Abraham to
kill his own son.

54
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:42,100
And some thinkers are bothered by the thought that morality could – at any moment – become totally different, depending on what God feels like commanding that day.

55
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:52,340
All it would take is a word from God, and we could be suddenly be living in some sort of ethical Bizarro World, where things that we currently think are horrible and cruel would instantly be considered good and righteous.

56
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,000
And this, it turns out, is the subject of this
week’s Flash Philosophy. To the Thought Bubble!

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,940
Here’s the set-up: You’re going about your day, minding your own business, when suddenly God shows up.

58
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,320
Or at least, he claims to be God.

59
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,180
And he sure seems like God to you.

60
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,120
He has nice, fresh breath and excellent posture and his iPhone is a version that’s not even out yet.

61
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,720
Like, this guy is God.

62
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,820
And he tells you that he’s changed his mind
about morality.

63
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,640
The 10 commandments are out, he says – or
rather, they’ve been reversed.

64
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,860
You are now commanded to kill, steal, commit
adultery, and so forth.

65
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:29,420
God says he understands that this is confusing, but he assures you that he knows best, and this has been part of his plan all along.

66
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,310
He was just waiting for humanity to be ready
for it.

67
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,350
So he instructs you to go forth and begin
carrying out his commands.

68
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,000
To do otherwise would be to sin.

69
00:05:38,10 --> 00:05:40,90
So, how do you process this information?

70
00:05:40,90 --> 00:05:42,359
Do you assume there must be something wrong
with your brain?

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,280
Or that something’s gone wrong with God?

72
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,299
Or do you obey?

73
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,440
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

74
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,60
This scenario is just one problem that comes with accepting the first horn of Socrates’ dilemma.

75
00:05:51,60 --> 00:05:55,440
It makes God’s commands – and the morality
that stems from them – arbitrary.

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,719
If God determines the rightness and wrongness of everything, just by saying so, then the entire concept of goodness and value becomes vacuous.

77
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,219
Because, it means that saying “God commands
what is good,” is really just saying,

78
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,520
“God commands what he commands.”

79
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,229
The idea of what’s “good” doesn’t
really mean anything anymore.

80
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,500
So, what about the second horn of the dilemma?

81
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,140
Does it make sense to say that God commands
things because they’re good?

82
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,840
Maybe this doesn’t seem like a problem,
but it means that God isn’t omnipotent.

83
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,679
Because there’s at least one thing – value
– that doesn’t stem from God.

84
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,640
Instead, someone or something else has created
it, and God just uses it.

85
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,340
So if you’re committed to the belief that God created literally everything – not just the physical world – then you’re going to have a hard time accepting this horn.

86
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,820
And then there’s another problem:

87
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,880
This view also means that something outside
of God in some sense binds him and his commands.

88
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,780
If there’s some standard of goodness that God has to stick to when making commandments, then that means there must be things that God can’t command.

89
00:06:50,780 --> 00:07:00,140
And if the ethical rules of the universe come from some source other than God, then why can’t we just go straight to that source, too, and figure out morality for ourselves, the same way God did?

90
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:09,960
Once you go down this road, you soon find that God and his religious texts must be superfluous – little more than moral CliffsNotes, a shortcut to understanding the original source of knowledge.

91
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,280
So maybe now you’re seeing why the Euthyphro
Problem has been around for thousands of years.

92
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,698
Whichever horn you choose, it presents serious
problems for the divine command theorist.

93
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,120
Either God is bound by a standard outside of himself, or God’s goodness doesn’t really mean anything.

94
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,720
The Euthyphro Problem has caused plenty of ethicists, including theistic ones, to reject divine command theory altogether.

95
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,580
But the theory has other problems, too.

96
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,20
Like, how do we know what God commands?

97
00:07:34,30 --> 00:07:36,739
This takes us back to the Bible verses I mentioned
earlier.

98
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:44,940
There are a lot of very explicit instructions – like about fabrics and hair braids and gold chains – that most Bible-reading theists don’t consider binding.

99
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,640
So how do we know which commands are binding, and which ones God retracted somewhere along the way?

100
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,960
Do we get to decide?

101
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,900
And if we do, how are those instructions still
commandments?

102
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,640
Wouldn’t they be more like recommendations?

103
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,919
I don’t know about you, but the Ten Recommendations
just doesn’t have the same ring to it.

104
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,640
A good moral theory is one that will generate answers to questions like these, and divine command theory seems to fall short in that regard.

105
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,500
So next time, we’re going to look at another moral theory that approaches things from a theistic perspective, but is immune to some of these problems.

106
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,660
For now, we’ve learned about divine command
theory.

107
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,980
And we discussed the dilemma presented by Plato known as the Euthyphro Problem, and considered both of its horns.
