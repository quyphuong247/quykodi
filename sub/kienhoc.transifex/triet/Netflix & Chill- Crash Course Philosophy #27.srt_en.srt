00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,040
How often do you actually think about the
things you say?

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,780
Like, what you’re literally saying?

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,320
That’s a seriously overused word, by the
way -- “literally.”

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,180
A lot of the time, people use it for emphasis
in ways that I consider pretty incorrect.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,880
Like, people will say “I’m literally dying of hunger!” because it’s been a few hours since lunch.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,740
But obviously they are not literally dying
of hunger.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,720
They’re just like hungry.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,340
Unless you’re our old friend Ludwig Wittgenstein, who believed that language had no intrinsic meaning,

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,300
literal meaning usually refers to the specific,
accepted meaning of a word.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,600
It’s the intended thing that a word is supposed
to stand for.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,000
So, unless you’re in the advanced stages of malnutrition and are at Death’s Freaking Door, then, no, you’re not literally dying of hunger.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,199
But we all say stuff that like that all the
time!

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,080
I mean, have you ever thought about how many of the things you say that are figures of speech, things that aren’t literally true?

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,620
Those figures of speech have other meanings, and most of the time, they mean stuff that we’d rather not put in literal terms.

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,220
Like, we all know what we’re not saying
when we say that someone “has a nice personality.”

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,031
Or if a lady announces she’s going to “powder
her nose.”

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,820
And of course there’s “Netflix and chill,”

20
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:16,680
which it turns out has very little to do with,
like, actually watching Netflix.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,820
We’ve already talked about how slippery the idea of meaning can be, as it changes depending on the time, or region, or linguistic community you’re in.

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:31,940
But that’s not even considering the fact that people don’t usually mean what they say, because we also speak in idioms, fragments, slang, and metaphors.

23
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,000
Which leads me to the question: how do we
manage to understand each other at all?

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,320
[Theme Music]

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,520
When it comes to how we know that something described as “bad” is actually good, or how we know that a reference to Netflix is really about sex,

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,260
we can thank 20th century British philosopher
Paul Grice.

27
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,909
He wanted to explain exactly how we can know
what is meant, rather than what is said.

28
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:06,159
And he described our ability to do this, through
a theory he called conversational implicature.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:13,300
Grice said, to really understand what goes on when we process meaning, we need to sort out the difference between what is said, and what is implied.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,020
What is said is the actual linguistic content,
the words that come out of the speaker’s mouth.

31
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,380
What is implied contains a whole lot more
than just the words that are spoken.

32
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,980
Implicature combines the actual words we utter,
with the context in which we say them.

33
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:34,640
And that context can include anything from past shared experiences, to social conventions, to things like facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures.

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,940
Now, in order for anyone to have a successful conversation, Grice observed that a few conditions had to be in place.

35
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,380
First, you have to be actually trying to communicate
with someone, and have a successful conversation.

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,640
If that’s the case, then Grice said that you’re adhering to what’s known as the cooperative principle.

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,720
This means that, whenever there’s ambiguity in what a speaker is saying, the audience should look for the most likely intended meaning of what’s being said, given the context.

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,200
So, even if the literal words don’t fit into the conversation you’re having, you should try to interpret whatever your interlocutor is saying, so that it makes sense.

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,860
Like, if you’re in your sister’s room having an argument, and she says, “there’s the door,” you can assume she’s not just randomly naming house parts.

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,220
She’s recommending that you walk through
that door and out of her space.

41
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,220
But the burden of understanding doesn’t
all fall on the audience.

42
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,480
Grice also laid out certain maxims, or communicative rules of thumb, which help speakers keep to the cooperative principle.

43
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,360
These maxims fall under four main types – quantity,
quality, relation, and manner.

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,280
There are two rules relating to quantity.

45
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,590
First, you should be adequately informative.

46
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,660
When your parents call you up at school, and they ask you how you’ve been, you probably say something along the lines of: “fine.”

47
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,460
Now, this might be technically accurate, but you’re not giving them the quantity of information they’re looking for.

48
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,260
What they really want to know is, are you going to pass math, and are you remembering to wash your sheets?

49
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,269
Stuff like that.

50
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,380
Second, we shouldn’t be more informative
than is required.

51
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,740
We’ve all met these people.

52
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,680
When you’re explaining to your teacher that
you missed class because you were sick,

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,900
you do not need to provide all of the gruesome
details about the nature of your diarrhea.

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,790
I mean, there really is such a thing as too
much information, people.

55
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,670
There are also two quality rules of communication.

56
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,700
First, we shouldn’t say things that we think
are false.

57
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,240
This includes people who are running for elected
office!

58
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,260
No one should just tell lies!

59
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,660
The second quality rule cautions us to refrain from making claims for which we we have insufficient evidence.

60
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,519
So if you see your significant other talking
to someone else in the hallway,

61
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,540
don’t go around telling everyone that they’re a cheating scumbag without first checking your facts.

62
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,680
Now, this isn’t to say people don’t break these rules all the time; some people lie more than they tell the truth.

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,890
But Grice’s point was, violating these rules
hinders successful communication.

64
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,270
Now, the next maxim is the rule of relation,
which tells us to say relevant things.

65
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:44,180
It’s what keeps us from going on a tear in the middle of the Super Bowl about the home worlds of our favorite members of the Legion of Substitute Heroes.

66
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,560
I’m look at you, Chlorophyll Kid.

67
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,060
And finally, there are four rules about the
manner in which we speak.

68
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,840
First, we should avoid obscure turns of phrase.

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,640
After all, this could come off as supercilious
and pedantic,

70
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,620
and might cause your interlocutor to be fractious.

71
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,040
The whole point of a conversation is successful communication, not showing off how big your vocabulary is.

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,560
Second, ambiguity should be avoided.

73
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,180
Keep your audience in mind when you use figures
of speech and slang.

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,980
The reason you don’t talk to your grandmother about your bae is because she’s not going to have any idea what you’re talking about.

75
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,240
Third, be brief.

76
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,430
Don’t give a ten minute explanation when
a one minute one will do.

77
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,190
And finally, be orderly.

78
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,790
Remember that time your mom recounted the
recipe for her famous meatloaf from memory?

79
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,290
And then when you tried to make it, you ended
up with whole onions and raw meat?

80
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,640
Mom assumed you were going to know that you needed to chop the onions and bake the loaf, but she didn't say that.

81
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,240
So, the rule of orderliness reminds us not
to miss steps when we’re communicating information.

82
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,130
Now, this might sound like a lot of rules,

83
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,500
but Grice believed that we already follow
these maxims when we engage in conversation.

84
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,770
Because, generally, when we communicate, we
want to be understood.

85
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:55,260
And – here’s the cool part – since everyone understands these unspoken rules, we can violate them from time to time, knowing that other people will get that we’re breaking the rules on purpose.

86
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,620
Why would we do that?

87
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,120
Well, because deliberately violating a maxim
is a good way to make a communicative point.

88
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
This is called flouting a maxim.

89
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,520
We flout the maxim of quality, for example,
when we use sarcasm.

90
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,770
Like, I’m sure that you’ve never experienced
sarcasm before!

91
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,580
And we flout the maxim of manner when we deliberately use $10 words to confuse or embarrass our interlocutor.

92
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,980
So, now that we know how to say what we mean without saying what we mean, it’s time to do things!

93
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,360
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble for some
Flash Philosophy.

94
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,360
In the 1950s, British philosopher J. L. Austin wrote a charming little book called How to Do Things with Words.

95
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,040
And in it, Austin observed that sometimes, words actually have the ability to change the world.

96
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,760
I don’t mean in the way that, like, Martin
Luther King’s words changed the world,

97
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,940
but in the sense that, in an instant, an act of speech can change a particular fact about the world.

98
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,580
When a wedding officiant says, “I now pronounce you husband and wife,” or “husband and husband,” or “wife and wife,”

99
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,340
that speech-act has the power to actually transform two single individuals into a married couple.

100
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,940
In that same way, parents have the power to determine their child’s name, simply by announcing it.

101
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,020
A president or head of state can create a
state of war, just by declaring it.

102
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,540
And by saying, “I promise,” we create
moral obligations.

103
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,320
We’re verbal animals, and we’ve allowed our reality to be shaped, in a very deep way, by words, and the value that we give them.

104
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:20,400
This isn’t something we think about a lot, but when you stop to reflect on it, it’s kind of incredible that words can actually create a bond, or dissolve it,

105
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,250
or that a speech-act can cause nations to
go to war.

106
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,060
But some of these examples require certain conditions to be met, in order for the utterance to work, or, in Austin’s words, to be felicitous.

107
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,620
Like, if one of the spouses-to-be at a wedding is underage, or already married, or is a dog, then pronouncing them married won’t make it true.

108
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,660
You also need a legally recognized officiant to do the pronouncing, which is also true of declarations of war and in conferring academic degrees.

109
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,240
But in other cases, like making a promise,
or joining a society, or naming a child,

110
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,260
anyone can change the world in this way, simply
with their words.

111
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,320
Performative utterances are interesting, because we normally think of sentences as simply conveyors of information.

112
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,400
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

113
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,849
It turns out, sometimes, these types of sentences
actually do things.

114
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,200
Today we talked about conversational implicature,
the cooperative principle,

115
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,449
and the four main maxims of successful communication, as laid out by Paul Grice.

116
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,510
We also learned about performative utterances.

117
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,450
And I would like to remind you that bananas
are chom choms.

118
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,259
Next time we’ll look at an area where the
philosophy of language and ethics meet,

119
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:23,669
by talking about the ways in which the power
of words can cause harm.
