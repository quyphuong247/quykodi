00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,380
We’ve spent quite a bit of time looking
at arguments for God’s existence.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,180
But we haven’t said much yet about this
God.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,900
Like, what’s he like? Is he a he?

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,929
Is he like strictly Marvel superheroes, or
is he more of a DC guy?

7
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:24,589
Does he prefer his salsa with or without cilantro?
I like corn!

8
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,720
Who’s his favorite Crystal Gem from Steven
Universe?

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,300
I guess those kinds of questions would only apply to a heavily personalized and anthropomorphic God.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,200
But the traditional picture of God – the
one accepted, and even assumed, throughout

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,010
Judeo-Christian tradition, up into modern
times – is what we might call an “omni-God,”

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,090
possessing particular divine attributes – the
characteristics believed to be held by God.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,440
Now let’s pause a moment to acknowledge
that this discussion is of one particular God,

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,400
the one who stars in Jewish, Christian,
and Muslim scriptures.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,960
Of course, lots of people believe in lots of other gods, and they all have attributes of their own.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,860
We’re focusing on this god because he’s the one
all these philosophers we’ve been studying

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,579
were talking about – he’s the one they
believed – or didn’t believe – in.

18
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,530
Philosophers like Augustine and Thomas Aquinas
– who were themselves influenced by the

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,580
writings of Plato and Aristotle – came up
with a general set of divine attributes that

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,810
are still widely held today among theists.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,470
And in this view, God is omniscient, which
means he knows everything that can be known.

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,000
And he’s also omnipotent, or all-powerful.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,880
He’s been said to be omnibenevolent, or
possessing perfect goodness.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,340
And he’s omnitemporal and omnipresent – meaning
he exists at all places and all times at once.

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,360
Now, it’s worth noting that none of these
attributes is actually mentioned in the Bible.

26
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,820
But philosophers like Aquinas reasoned that
they must be the case, if God is perfect.

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,490
And these philosophers took it as a given
that he is.

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,640
The problem is, a close investigation of these attributes reveals some rather tricky little puzzles.

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,200
No, I take that back.
They’re really, really, big puzzles.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:02,580
[Theme Music]

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,820
Can God create a rock so heavy he can’t
lift it?

32
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,860
– is just one of an infinite number of unanswerable
questions that can be asked about God.

33
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,200
Like, if God is omnipotent, he has to be able
to create something so heavy he can’t lift it.

34
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,980
Otherwise, his inability to create it would
mean there’s at least one thing he couldn’t do.

35
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,760
But then, he wouldn’t be omnipotent, because if he were truly all-powerful, he’d be able to lift anything.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,520
Quandaries like this come up all the time
when you consider the divine attributes.

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,840
And some of the questions that arise are
not only about God, but also about us.

38
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,969
For instance, if God knows everything, then
he also knows the future, right?

39
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:41,649
Which makes sense, if he’s also omnitemporal, because that would mean that he’s already in the future.

40
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:44,099
And also in the past.
And don’t forget the present.

41
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,020
But many theists also believe that God
gave us free will.

42
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,640
So, how can we be free, if God already knows what
we’re gonna do? In that case, are we really free?

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,020
Or is freedom just an illusion that he created for us, to make us feel like we’re in control?

44
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,790
What we’re seeing here is that, at least
on the surface, God’s traditional divine

45
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,120
attributes are internally inconsistent – meaning,
they can’t all be true at the same time.

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,690
And what do you do when you hold inconsistent
beliefs?

47
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,489
Well, if you’re being philosophically rational,
you either give some of them up, or you figure

48
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,810
out a way to understand them that makes them
consistent.

49
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,989
This is what a theist who believes in the
omni-God has to do.

50
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,080
Let’s think about the contradiction that
arises from believing the following propositions:

51
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,430
1) God is omniscient
2) Humans have free will

52
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,710
Is there any way to resolve this contradiction,
or do we have to surrender one of those beliefs?

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,950
One possible response is to say that knowledge
and causation aren’t the same thing.

54
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,170
So God might know that we’re going to do
something, without actually causing us to do it.

55
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,180
This actually makes sense,
if you think about it.

56
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,920
Imagine a person standing on a cliff looking
down on a train track that curves around a bend.

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,900
From her vantage point, the onlooker can
see that, just on the other side of the bend,

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,800
a person is stuck on the track as the
train approaches.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,420
Too far away to do anything, the onlooker
knows the accident will happen before it does,

60
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,000
but the fact that she knows it will happen
doesn’t mean that she caused it to happen.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,250
To use a less gruesome example, if God knew
you were going to eat an entire pecan pie

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,570
by yourself over the course of a lonely weekend,
that doesn’t mean that he caused you to do it.

63
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,840
That was all on you.

64
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,780
But wait. If God is omniscient, then he can’t
be wrong, can he?

65
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,959
Because if he was ever wrong, then there would
have been something he didn’t know.

66
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,759
So if God knew you were going to eat the whole
pie, then you couldn’t not eat the pie,

67
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,320
because if you decided not to at the last minute,
then you would have just proven God wrong,

68
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,919
thereby single-handedly stripping him
of his divine omniscience! Good job!

69
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,699
So the knowledge and power of God are, to
say the least, philosophically perplexing.

70
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,159
Now let’s consider another question about
God’s personal skill set: Can God sin?

71
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,940
If he’s omnipotent, it would seem that he
can, because he can do anything.

72
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,200
But if he’s omnibenevolent, or inherently
good, then it would seem that he can’t.

73
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,620
This doctrine, which says that God can’t
sin, is known as divine impeccability.

74
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,340
But if God is impeccable and incapable of sin,
then doesn’t that mean that he is not omnipotent?

75
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,480
After all, I can sin...easily.

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,780
I mean, gimme five minutes and I can
probably break two or three commandments.

77
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,520
Like, the ones about coveting stuff --
not the murdery ones.

78
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,870
But still, it seems kinda weird to think that
I can do something that God can’t.

79
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,509
Some people try to solve this particular puzzle
by saying that sin is necessarily a failure,

80
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:14,220
so therefore, a perfect being can’t do it.

81
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,420
Others say that, even though God might do
something that would be a sin if a human did it,

82
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,280
the idea of ‘sin’ simply doesn’t apply to God.
Perhaps because, given his omnibenevolence,

83
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,020
everything God does is inherently good.

84
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,840
Now, many philosophers find this solution troubling,
because it kinda makes God’s goodness vacuous.

85
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,169
After all, it basically means that saying
“God did a thing” would be the same thing

86
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:38,630
as saying “God did a good thing,” because
ipso facto, anything God does is good.

87
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,570
And if that’s the case, then his goodness
doesn’t have any real meaning.

88
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,600
Yet another possible contradiction presents itself in the belief that the omni-God is also a personal God.

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,740
Many people find it difficult to suppose that
God could be omnitemporal and omniscient,

90
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,360
yet still have a personal relationship with
his creatures.

91
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,800
It’s hard to understand how God could relate to us – or feel the way we feel –

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,180
if he doesn’t experience time as we do: If he
already knows what’s going to happen,

93
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,520
how could he ever be surprised,
or change his mind?

94
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,320
And if god is omnitemporal, is it even possible
that he could be moved to respond to our prayers?

95
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,810
Let’s look at this idea up close in this week’s
Flash Philosophy. To the Thought Bubble!

96
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,759
When people talk about praying for something
to happen, or to not happen, or are otherwise

97
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,910
making a request of God, they’re making
what are known as petitionary prayers.

98
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,710
When you pray in this way, you’re asking
God for something – to help you pass a test,

99
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,060
or to save a loved one who’s in danger,
or to make sure the Patriots win the game.

100
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,009
Contemporary American philosopher Eleanor
Stump argues that we have no reason to think

101
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,039
that asking God for something would actually
make a difference.

102
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,750
She thinks about it like this:
If God knows everything, including the future

103
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,620
– which he does, if he’s omniscient –

104
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,820
– and if God has the power to bring about any state of affairs – which he does, if he’s omnipotent –

105
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,030
– and if he always wants to bring about the best state of affairs – which he does, if he’s omnibenevolent –

106
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,410
– then God has already decided what’s going to happen in every single case. To everyone. Always.

107
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,420
So either your prayer is asking God to do
something he was already going to do, in which

108
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,680
case your prayer was kind of a waste of time.

109
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,449
Or your prayer is asking God to do something
he has already decided not to do, because

110
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:08,229
it wasn’t actually the best thing.
Sorry Patriots.

111
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,699
And in that case, even if God would change
his mind, based on your prayer, you wouldn’t

112
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,009
want him to, because it would actually make
things worse than they would’ve been if

113
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,509
you’d just let God do his thing.

114
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:19,789
In other words, if God knows what’s best,
why would you want to change his mind?!

115
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,460
Now, Stump suggests that there might be some
value in the asking, even if the prayer doesn’t

116
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,900
actually change what’s going to happen.
Maybe you agree with her.

117
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,569
But at this point, it should be clear just
how many problems there are in the divine

118
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:31,110
attributes, when you think about them. Thanks,
Thought Bubble!

119
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,660
Thomas Aquinas – the thinker who’s largely
responsible for the traditional divine attributes

120
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,199
we think of today – responded to these sorts
of puzzles by saying that all of this speculation

121
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,650
of What God Is Like is just analogical predication.

122
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,930
Basically, Aquinas said that we can’t
predicate, or assert, anything about God,

123
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,290
because he’s so far beyond our understanding.

124
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,400
When we speak of God, Aquinas said,
we never say anything that’s true.

125
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,520
Instead, we have to speak entirely in
analogies, because that’s all we can do.

126
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,540
So, God isn’t literally our father, for example, but we can understand his role for us as being father-like.

127
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,139
Because that’s as close as we can get to really understanding what what he is.

128
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,860
Or think of it this way: People in south Florida
might say it’s cold when the temperature

129
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,479
dips into the fifties, but in Alaska, it’s
not cold until it’s well below zero.

130
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,680
But both of those frames of reference are
more similar to each other than they are to

131
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,760
the cold that is absolute zero, which is about
negative 273 degrees celsius.

132
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,560
You might even say that absolute-zero cold and
negative 10-degree cold are not even the same thing.

133
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,740
But we use the one word – “cold” – to
describe them both, as a kind of analogical

134
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,740
way of talking about something that defies
our complete and personal understanding.

135
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,780
So, Aquinas basically said not to worry about
all of these puzzles, because none of these

136
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,800
things we say about God is more than an approximation
– a little analogue that our tiny little

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,269
minds can come up with, so that we can talk
about an infinite being.

138
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:52,939
Now, there are other thinkers, particularly
in modern times, who point out that none of

139
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:58,009
the traditional divine attributes is in the
Bible anyway. So, maybe God isn’t an omni-God.

140
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:01,860
Maybe he’s more like a superhero. He can
be way smarter than us, way more powerful

141
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,730
than us, way more good than us. But still
not perfect.

142
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,279
This seems like sacrilege to a lot of people,
but some philosophers argue that it’s more

143
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,290
compatible with the God of the Bible.

144
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,730
After all, in the Bible, we see God doing
very human things, like walking in the garden,

145
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,119
getting angry, being surprised, and changing
his mind.

146
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:22,359
So, it could be possible that God actually
does hate cilantro or is a big fan of Amethyst.

147
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,280
That’s the kind of stuff that we, as philosophers, get to ponder – kindly and thoughtfully in the comments.
