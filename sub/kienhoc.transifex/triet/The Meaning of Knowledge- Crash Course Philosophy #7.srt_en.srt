00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,240
You probably think you know a lot of things.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,840
But do you know what it means to know something?

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,070
We’ve spent quite a bit of time discussing
beliefs and knowledge, but we haven’t really

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,390
been specific about what we mean when we talk
about those things.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,640
Thankfully, philosophers love a good definition.
They have very specific and lucid ideas in

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,200
mind when they use terms like know or believe
or proposition or justification.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,240
And, about ten minutes from now, you too will know what you’re really saying when you use those words.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,900
But, just because these terms have been defined, doesn’t mean that philosophers aren’t still arguing over them.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,180
Because you know, that’s how philosophers
do.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,690
Their definitions might seem kind of obvious
at first, but the more you think about them,

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,420
the more nuanced they turn out to be.

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,879
Like, is having knowledge of something the
same thing as being correct?

15
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,299
Or, if you believe something to be true, and
it is true, does it matter if your belief in it is justified?

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,020
And can you be right about something without
really trying?

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,969
Answers to these questions and more await
you, as well as

18
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,349
cats!

[Theme Music]

20
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:16,680
So you’ve heard this already: Philosophers
love a good argument.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,509
But you’ve figured out by now that philosophers
argue in a different way than, like, kindergarten

22
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:24,079
kids, or Internet trolls, or other people
who confuse “arguing” with sniping back

23
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,119
and forth or just thinking up witty comebacks.

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,540
Nope. Philosophers have all kinds of rhetorical
devices at their disposal that they can use

25
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,789
to advance an idea, or call into question
the ideas of their interlocutors.

26
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,240
So in order to hold your own in a philosophical
debate, you’re gonna have to know the difference

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,560
between two things that sound like exactly
the same thing: an assertion, and a proposition.

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,100
And you’ll need to be able to tell whether
someone actually knows what they’re talking

29
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,509
about, or if they just believe what they’re
saying might be true.

30
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,749
For example: The sentence I’m saying right
now is an assertion. An assertion is a linguistic

31
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:58,450
act – either spoken or written – that
has a truth value. And despite what it might

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,130
sound like, truth value isn’t a measure
of how right something is. It’s just the

33
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,690
state of being either true, or false, or indeterminate.
All declarative sentences have truth values.

34
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,299
Declarations that assert something about the
past or present are either true or false.

35
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,980
And assertions about the future are indeterminate,
at least when they’re expressed, because

36
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,760
no one knows if they’re right or not yet.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,980
For example, I’m gonna assert that “This cat will pee on my desk before the end of the show.”

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,500
That assertion has a truth value, but it’s
indeterminate, because the show’s not over yet.

39
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,870
We’re just gonna have to wait and see.

40
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,870
Now, all of this contrasts with other kinds of linguistic acts, like questions, which don’t assert anything.

41
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,769
“This is a cat” is an assertion, as opposed
to “Is that a cat?,” which is a linguistic

42
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,629
act, but not an assertion.

43
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,750
But the substance of what you assert has a
name, too.

44
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,150
The content of your assertion is your proposition.
It’s the underlying meaning of what you’re saying.

45
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,180
So even though an assertion itself can change,
depending on say, what language it’s spoken

46
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,349
in, its meaning doesn’t change just because
its outer packaging does.

47
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:58,290
Like, “This is a cat” and “Este es un
gato,” both assert the same proposition.

48
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,930
And a proposition is true if it asserts a
claim that corresponds to reality.

49
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,689
The proposition when I assert “This is a
cat,” is true if the object of the “this”

50
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,689
is in fact a cat, and false if it is anything
other than a cat. Like, “This is a cat.”

51
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:14,790
It’s worth pointing out that attitude counts,
too, when you’re asserting something.

52
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,260
A speaker’s mental state toward the proposition
they’re making is their propositional attitude.

53
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,209
If I say, like, “This is a cat,” but I
actually believe it to be a rat and I’m

54
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,580
trying to fool you, then philosophers would
say that I have a propositional attitude of disbelief.

55
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,860
Whereas, if I think I’m speaking truthfully,
I have a propositional attitude of belief.

56
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,560
And of course, you’re not going to get very
far as a philosopher unless you understand

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,420
the classic definition of belief itself. Based
on the lingo you’ve learned so far today,

58
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,379
belief is just when you take a propositional
attitude of truth.

59
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:46,459
I believe that this is a cat, if I think it’s
true – that is, if my attitude is that the

60
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,519
assertion corresponds to reality. And even
if I’m wrong -- even if there were an aardvark

61
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,359
on my desk, or if there weren’t a cat on
my desk at all, which there isn’t anymore

62
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,579
-- if I really thought there was a cat on
my desk, that would just be my belief.

63
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:02,400
My propositional attitude, in other words,
is what determines if I have a belief.

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
What all this means is that I, like everyone
else, can have false beliefs. Simply thinking

65
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,359
something doesn’t make it correspond to
reality, which is what’s needed for truth.

66
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:14,569
But of course, the fun of arguing is showing
off what you know to other people, or at least

67
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,260
producing really clever evidence to support
your case.

68
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,700
So, this raises the question of what it means to actually know something, in the philosophical sense.

69
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,800
The traditional definition of knowledge is
that it’s a justified true belief.

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,020
Note that there are three separate components here.

71
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,280
So, I have knowledge that this is a cat if:
I first believe i’s a cat

72
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,610
And also that it is in fact a cat – that
is, my belief corresponds to reality and is

73
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,390
therefore true. And finally, I can be said
to have knowledge about this cat if my belief

74
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,540
is justified – meaning, I have some sort
of legitimate evidence to support my belief.

75
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,190
Now, we’ve already defined truth and belief.
Justification is simply evidence, or other

76
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,330
support, for your belief. If you remember
back to episode 2, you’ll recall that premises

77
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,230
offer justification for conclusions. And justification
can come in a variety of forms. Most often,

78
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,160
it comes about through testimony – just
taking someone’s word for it. Not all testimony

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,910
is strong, or trustworthy, of course. But
if it comes from someone who’s an expert

80
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,930
on the topic in question, you might consider
the testimony to be reliable.

81
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,610
And the fact is, most of what you know about
the world, you learned through testimony.

82
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,800
You took your teachers’ word for it when
they were teaching you stuff, and the same

83
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,020
goes for every book you’ve ever read and
every news report you’ve ever seen. They’re

84
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,860
all just forms of testimony, which you accepted as justification for your knowledge, and your beliefs.

85
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,280
But justification can come in other forms,
too. Another common type is first person observation

86
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,610
– information you acquire through your senses.

87
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,660
If I believe that a cat is a cat, because
I already have robust and well-informed beliefs

88
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,340
about cats, then, having had extensive experience
with them in the past, I’m identifying the

89
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,010
cat as a cat through my direct contact with
it

90
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,720
It looks, feels, acts like a cat. Ergo: cat!

91
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,300
But! Philosophy wouldn’t be any fun if the
key to knowledge were that easy, right?

92
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,460
Until American philosopher Edmund Gettier
came along in the 1960s, philosophers were

93
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,880
in pretty widespread agreement about the definition
of knowledge -- that it’s justified true belief.

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,300
Because, you can believe any old thing, but
in order to know something, it just makes

95
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,560
sense that you must also have evidence for
your belief, and it must be true. In other

96
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,430
words, you can have a false belief, but you
can’t have false knowledge. And if something

97
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,090
you thought you knew turns out not to be true, then the fact is, you never actually knew it, you just believed it.

98
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,940
And likewise, you might happen to hold a true belief, but if you don’t have any justification for it, if you

99
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,140
just accidentally happened to be right, which happens sometimes – that doesn’t count as knowledge, either.

100
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,430
Enter Edmund Gettier. Gettier wrote a short
but fabulously influential paper that turned

101
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,030
the standard understanding of knowledge upside
down.

102
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,550
He did this by proposing what came to be known
as Gettier cases – situations in which one

103
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,940
can have justified true belief, but not knowledge.

104
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,290
Which brings us to this week’s Flash Philosophy!
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

105
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,240
Here’s one of Gettier’s original cases.
Smith and Jones have both applied for the same job.

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,780
The president of the company told Smith that Jones will get the job. This counts as evidence;

107
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,500
the president of the company would seem to be a reliable source of this information.

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,000
Meanwhile, Smith counts the coins
in Jones’ pocket and sees that there are

109
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,000
ten coins in there. Smith then forms a belief,
based on his first person observational evidence

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,690
of the coins, as well as the testimony of
the company president.

111
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,560
He comes to believe that: The person who gets
the job has 10 coins in his pocket.

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,660
But, it turns out, the testimony of the president
was false, and it’s Smith, not Jones, who gets the job.

113
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,650
AND, it just so happens, unbeknownst to Smith,
that he also has 10 coins in his own pocket.

114
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,060
So, Smith has a belief – that the person
who gets the job has 10 coins in his pocket.

115
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,600
And that is justified – because he counted
Jones’ coins, and the president told him

116
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,890
Jones was getting the job. And his belief
also turns out to be true – the person who

117
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,490
got the job did have 10 coins in his pocket.

118
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,900
However, neither pieces of justification actually
pointed Smith to the right answer. The president’s

119
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,360
testimony was wrong, and the 10 coins that
he saw were in Jones’ pocket, not his own.

120
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,580
So it seems Smith simply lucked into being
right.

121
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,570
Gettier argued that we now have a case of
justified true belief that is not knowledge.

122
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,480
As he pointed out, you don’t KNOW something
if you simply stumbled into the right answer.

123
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,440
Thanks Thought Bubble, the philosophical world
was turned upside down by this idea, and philosophers

124
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,990
– loving a good counterexample – began
generating their own Gettier cases.

125
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,550
American philosopher Roderick Chisholm proposed
this one:

126
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,140
Looking across a field, you see an object
that looks like a sheep, and you form the

127
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,230
belief that “there is a sheep in the field.”

128
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,580
It turns out that the object you see is actually
a dog.

129
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,750
Yet, there is also a sheep, obscured from
your vision by a hill.

130
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,700
So, you have a justified true belief, but
the justification for your belief -- the object

131
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,830
that you saw – is not a sheep. You just
lucked into being right.

132
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,199
Once you understand how it works, it’s pretty
easy to generate Gettier cases of your own.

133
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:41,979
And many philosophers today think that Gettier successfully destroyed the “justified true belief” definition of knowledge.

134
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,199
But even though the 1960s might seem long
ago to you, remember: philosophers are in

135
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:50,540
the business of having millennia-long debates
about stuff. So it shouldn’t surprise you

136
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,439
that the philosophical debate about this is
still a-raging.

137
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:58,170
But if knowledge is not justified true belief,
then…whaaat is it?

138
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,389
Next time, we will look at one possible answer.

139
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:04,379
In the meantime, you learned about some of
the key concepts we use when discussing belief

140
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:09,509
and knowledge. You learned what defines an
assertion and a proposition, and that belief

141
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:13,730
is a kind of propositional attitude. We also
learned about forms of justification and the

142
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,090
traditional definition of knowledge, which Edmund Gettier just totally messed with, using his Gettier cases.

143
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:24,160
And the cat did not pee on my desk! Because
the cat was unable to spend any time at all

144
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,509
on my desk. So it turns out the assertion
that I made was false.

145
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:31,649
