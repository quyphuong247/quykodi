3
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:10,260
Why is the sky blue?

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,020
Which came first: orange the color or orange
the fruit?

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:20,060
And why is C3PO afraid of everything? Like, who decided it was a good idea to teach a droid to experience fear?

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,320
There are some questions that we ask ourselves,
either as kids, or adults, or both.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,869
They’re questions about weird, everyday
things, and they’re weird because most of

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,650
us don’t know the answers to them offhand.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,710
But most of the time, those questions turn
out to be pretty answerable.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,710
Like, for the ones I just mentioned, the short
answers are:

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,170
Because of the way photons interact with the
molecules in the atmosphere.

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,250
...the fruit;
And…uh…’cause that’s what George Lucas wanted.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,550
Maybe because 3PO’s a protocol droid, and
they need to be able to relate to humans.

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,200
Though, he could stand to turn his fear settings
down a notch.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,520
Now, as you know, philosophers have a soft
spot for questions that can never be answered.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,860
Most of the time, these puzzles make for great thought experiments – tests of our skills in logic and argument.

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,380
But there are some questions whose very lack
of an answer can be downright troubling.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,979
Unlike the occasional fluke of physics or bit of Star Wars trivia, there’s a part of us that really wants,

19
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:08,619
or even needs to have an answer to these things.

20
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:11,590
For the past month or so, we’ve been exploring
the philosophy of religion,

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:17,110
and we’ve been doing it mainly from a theistic perspective, looking into arguments that justify belief in God.

22
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,860
But one of the most persistent challenges to god’s existence is also the root of one of the most-asked,

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,840
but least answerable, questions that we, as
thinking beings, face.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,720
Why is there evil?

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:38,180
[Theme Music]

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,600
Evil comes in many forms.

27
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,780
And likewise, for philosophers, poses many problems, especially vis a vis the existence of god.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,020
First, there’s what’s known as the logical
problem of evil.

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,479
Like all rational people, theists can’t help but acknowledge that the world is full of evil.

30
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,419
And here, we’re understanding “evil” to be all manner of bad stuff – like, not just Hitler or Darth Vader or Moriarty.

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:03,630
It’s everything that’s in the vast spectrum of badness, from stubbed toes to plagues and everything in between.

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,570
Theists and atheists both agree that evil exists in this way. But they disagree about the next part.

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,739
Many theists believe in an omniscient, omnipotent,
omnibenevolent God.

34
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:18,079
But atheists argue that this creates a contradiction – a set of beliefs that can’t all be true at the same time.

35
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:22,319
Because, evil is bad, right – whether it’s stubbed toes or genocide or paper cuts or epidemics?

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,239
So, if there’s really an all-knowing God
out there, he knows about all the evil.

37
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,299
He might even know about it before it happens.

38
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:30,549
And if he’s all-powerful, he could stop
it.

39
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:33,040
And if he’s all-good, then he would want
to stop it.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,159
And yet he doesn’t. The evil continues.

41
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,349
Philosophically rational people shouldn’t
hold inconsistent beliefs,

42
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,369
so atheists argue that you’re going to have to give something up – and the thing to give up is God.

43
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:47,620
Some theists, however, take a different route.
They choose to give up one or more divine attributes.

44
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,629
They argue that maybe God isn’t powerful
enough to stop evil,

45
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,040
or maybe he’s not knowledgeable enough to
know about it,

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,020
or maybe he’s not even good enough to care
about stopping it.

47
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,340
That might sound weird to some of you,

48
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:00,649
but if you’ve ever heard someone say that
God is envious, or petty, or jealous,

49
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,080
that’s basically what they’re doing –

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,100
they’re acknowledging the possibility that
God is not actually good.

51
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:08,769
If you’ve ever checked out the Old Testament, there is a God there who has some anger issues –

52
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,169
one who’s not at all opposed to wiping out entire populations just because of some bad behavior.

53
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,230
Still, despite this scriptural evidence, many
theists are committed to God’s omni-attributes,

54
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,419
and are thus stuck with a problem. They
have to resolve the logical problem of evil

55
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,989
and find some way to explain why God would
allow evil into the world.

56
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,359
And if you can do that, then you are presenting
what is known as a theodicy.

57
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:33,659
A theodicy is an attempt to show that the existence of evil doesn’t rule out the possibility of God’s existence.

58
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,359
Yes, this is such a big deal that there’s
a word for it.

59
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:39,430
And the most popular theodicy is called The
Free Will Defense.

60
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,249
This argument holds that God maximized the
goodness in the world by creating free beings.

61
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:49,629
And being free means that we have the choice to do evil things – a choice that some of us exercise.

62
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:55,580
This theodicy says that God doesn’t create evil, but evil can’t be avoided without depriving us of our freedom.

63
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,280
And a world without freedom would be a worse
place overall.

64
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,329
This explanation preserves God’s goodness,
because he created the best possible world,

65
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:05,879
and also preserves his omnipotence and omniscience,
because,

66
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,439
although he does know about evil and could stop it, he has a good reason not to – to ensure our freedom.

67
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:15,809
The problem is, the free will defense really only really addresses what’s known as moral evil –

68
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:18,090
or the evil committed, on purpose, by humans.

69
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,010
Now, we’re certainly responsible for a lot of bad stuff, but you can’t blame us for everything.

70
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,860
We can’t be held responsible for the fact
that the plates of the earth sometimes shift,

71
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,990
causing destructive earthquakes, or that a storm might knock a tree over that falls onto someone’s house.

72
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,120
This type of evil – the stuff we’re not
responsible for – is called natural evil,

73
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,629
and the free will defense can’t resolve
natural evil.

74
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:41,409
Religion is one of those philosophical issues that can make it hard for us to consider anything objectively.

75
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:46,039
That’s where fiction comes in handy because
fictional stories can let us see how hypothetical

76
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,259
people deal with hypothetical situations.

77
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,580
And with that in mind, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble for some Flash Philosophy!

78
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,860
Let’s consider the case of Ivan, a good
Russian who decides to break up with God.

79
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,210
In the novel The Brothers Karamozov, 19th century Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky presents us with Ivan,

80
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,479
a man who claims to believe in God.

81
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,779
But Ivan finds the fact that God allows evil
to exist to be so unforgivable,

82
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,740
that he decides worshipping such a god would
be, just, unconscionable.

83
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,120
Ivan goes so far as to declare that he is
“returning his ticket” to heaven.

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,150
If the same God who allows evil – particularly
the suffering and death of children –

85
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,650
is also saving a cozy place in paradise for
Ivan, well, Ivan wants nothing to do with it.

86
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,150
So, his way out of the problem of evil is
to deny God’s goodness,

87
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,969
and to conclude that a bad God is not only
unworthy of his worship,

88
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:36,089
he’s also not someone Ivan wants to spend 
eternity with.

89
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:37,880
It’s like the ultimate un-friending.

90
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,740
Now, some readers have found Ivan’s decision
to be noble, and full of integrity.

91
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,280
After all, if you really think God is letting all of this bad stuff happen, why would you want to be on his team?

92
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:51,900
But other people think Ivan is being irrational – why condemn yourself to eternity in hell on principle?

93
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,909
For theists, it’s another question that
doesn’t have an easy answer.

94
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,340
Thanks, Thought Bubble! Now, unlike Ivan, a lot of people aren’t willing to give up their ticket to heaven.

95
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,460
So they need to work on a way to keeping believing in, and worshipping, God, even though evil is still a thing.

96
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,080
One way to do that, is to argue that good
can’t exist without its opposite.

97
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,819
The idea here is that you can’t understand
the concept of pleasure without pain.

98
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,400
We don’t know what it feels like to be warm
if we haven’t been cold.

99
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,830
We can’t understand the goodness of filling
our bellies if we’ve never been hungry.

100
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,340
But there’s also another way, though it
involves a little more work on your part.

101
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,680
20th century English philosopher of religion John Hick offered what’s known as the soul-making theodicy.

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,699
Unlike the traditional view that God created
a perfect world,

103
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:36,539
which we ruined through our own poor choices, Hick argued that God deliberately creates us “unfinished,”

104
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,240
and our earthly lives are designed to toughen
us up, in a sense, kinda like boot camp.

105
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:45,560
The harshness of life, Hick said, gives us
a robust texture and character that wouldn’t

106
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,219
be possible without an imperfect world.

107
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:52,349
Hick said that we’re not just God’s little
pets, and he’s not our benevolent owner,

108
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:55,259
whose sole job is to keep us in a safe, comfortable
environment.

109
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,519
Instead, he wants to build us, to train us,
into a particular kind of being.

110
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,580
So we need an environment that’s suited
to the sort of growth that he wants –

111
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,719
the sort that this world makes possible.

112
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:09,159
A lot of people find these and other theodicies
to be pretty compelling.

113
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:11,740
However, the problem of evil actually goes
a step deeper.

114
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,340
What we’ve been talking about so far is
the logical problem of evil.

115
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,520
This problem can be resolved, if we can explain
why there’s evil.

116
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,749
But there’s also the evidential problem
of evil.

117
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:25,689
This problem points out that we might be able
to explain why evil exists,

118
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:28,969
but we still can’t explain why there’s
so much evil in the world.

119
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:33,199
For instance, let’s say that it’s true that we really do need evil in order to understand goodness.

120
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,959
In that case, why can’t we understand the
contrast through some sort of low-level evil –

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,480
like paper cuts and head colds and having to work straight through our lunch hour every now and then?

122
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,560
I mean, slow, painful deaths from cancer,
and city-destroying hurricanes…

123
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,210
they don’t really add anything valuable
to our understanding of goodness. Do they?

124
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,360
If God were truly good, and if a negative
contrast were really needed in order for us

125
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,639
to understand the goodness of the world, then
why wouldn’t he give us just the very minimum

126
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,550
dosage of necessary to achieve that goal?

127
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,170
A counterargument might suggest that there’s always a good that corresponds to, and is proportionate to, any evil.

128
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,360
But empirically, such goodness is really hard
to find.

129
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,830
What good, for example, could possibly correspond
to the horrors of a genocide?

130
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,759
In cases like this, Hick’s soul-making doesn’t
seem to cut it.

131
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,139
You can’t really argue that “whatever
doesn’t kill us makes us stronger,” because,

132
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,099
sometimes, evil does kill us. A lot of us.

133
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:28,379
And sometimes it kills us before we have a chance to grow and learn from the suffering we’ve endured.

134
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,560
Despite these and other philosophical sticking points, a lot of people have found a theodicy that satisfies them –

135
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,510
one that they believe reconciles the apparent
evil in the world with God’s existence.

136
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,810
Others find all of these theodicies to be
flawed, and they reject God’s omni-nature,

137
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:47,200
preserving their belief in God by finding him to be less than perfectly powerful, or knowledgeable, or good.

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,980
Still others are convinced that the evil in the world is simply incompatible with the existence of a god,

139
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,970
or at least any god worth worshipping.

140
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,650
Wherever you end up, this is a problem that
needs to be grappled with.

141
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,700
And you’ll probably be thinking about it
long after this lesson has ended.

142
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,300
After all, today we have considered the biggest
problem in theism – the problem of evil.

143
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,120
We’ve thought about different theodicies
– or ways that we might reconcile the existence

144
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,959
of evil and the existence of god,

145
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,579
and we’ve explored whether those responses
are sufficient.

146
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,120
Next time, we’ll consider what kinds of justification we need to have for our religious beliefs.
