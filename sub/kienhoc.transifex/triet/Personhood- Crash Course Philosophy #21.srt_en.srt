00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:11,149
I bet you think you know a person when you
see one.

4
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:13,209
For example, I am a person, right?

5
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,189
But was I always a person?

6
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,920
Was Johann Strauss a person?
Or Freddie Mercury?

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,860
Are they still people?
What about a nine-month-old baby?

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,670
What about a fetus?
Or Chewbacca? Or C3PO?

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,779
To philosophers, ‘personhood’ is a technical
term.

10
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,980
‘Person’ doesn’t equal ‘human.’

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,580
“Human” is a biological term – you’re
human if you have human DNA. That’s it.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,739
But ‘person’ is a moral term.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,840
For a philosopher, persons are beings who
are part of our moral community.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,900
They deserve moral consideration.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,920
This distinction is really useful, but it
kinda complicates things.

16
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:48,609
Because there might be non-humans that we
think deserve moral consideration.

17
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,920
And there might be some humans who don’t.

18
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:54,229
But the determination of who’s a person
and who’s not, is tricky.

19
00:00:54,229 --> 00:01:00,849
And the slipperiness of what constitutes a person is at the core of almost every major social debate issue you can think of.

20
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:04,069
Abortion. The death penalty. Euthanasia.

21
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:10,220
Whether your passion is human rights or robots, science or sociology, you have to get to the bottom of personhood.

22
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:20,720
[Theme Music]

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,840
We’re gonna do something a little different
today and head straight into the Thought Bubble.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,580
Because I think there’s some Flash Philosophy that’ll help us a lot when we start thinking about what constitutes a person.

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,179
Is Superman a person?

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,320
I mean, if you encountered Superman on another planet, the question wouldn’t even cross your mind.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,860
The way he acts and talks certainly indicates
that he’s a person.

28
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,249
But Supes definitely isn’t human – he’s
Kryptonian.

29
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:48,020
He lacks human DNA, and is affected by the sun and by kryptonite in a way that humans are not.

30
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,679
So, calling him a human is incorrect.

31
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:54,739
But most of us would disagree with anyone
who wanted to deny him personhood.

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,560
Superman’s non-humanity is one of the reasons Lex Luthor hates him. And part of why we hate Lex Luthor.

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,480
Just because Superman happens to be from another planet doesn’t make him different in any moral way,

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,600
just like skin color doesn’t make a moral
difference among humans.

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,090
For the people who really know him – Lois
and Jimmy and Ma and Pa Kent –

36
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,799
there’s no question that Superman is a person.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,400
In fact, if anything, Superman might be more
of a person than Luthor is.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,320
Because Luthor is fueled by hatred and prejudice
and a lust for power.

39
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,560
He’s less deserving of moral consideration
than Superman.

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,440
So, if Superman is more of a person than Lex, then humanity definitely isn’t what makes someone a person.

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,040
So, yeah. Is Thought Bubble a person?
Bye-bye, Thought Bubble!

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,439
Now, there are plenty of candidates for non-human
persons.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,060
Aliens like Superman, as well as artificial intelligences like WALL-E, or Samantha from the movie Her.

44
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,820
Many people think some non-human animals are persons too – great apes like Koko are a good example.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,220
But is it possible to be human, yet not a
person?

46
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,000
Some people believe that fetuses, though clearly
human, are not yet persons.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,560
Others think that bodies in persistent vegetative
states,

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,140
or that have experienced a complete and irreversible loss of brain function, are no longer persons, either.

49
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,280
Still others argue that a human can surrender his or her personhood through grossly inhumane actions, like rape or murder.

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,519
Many careful thinkers disagree about what
personhood really is – where it starts and stops –

51
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,739
which explains why we disagree about abortion,
and euthanasia, and capital punishment.

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,820
And I’m sure no one in the comments will
be shouting their opinions on the matter at all.

53
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,860
But it seems to come down to this question:

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,280
What must one possess to be part of our moral
community, to be deserving of our moral consideration?

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,250
A contemporary American legal scholar named
John Noonan gives us one option

56
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,370
– he calls it the genetic criterion.

57
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,610
This view says you are a person if you have human DNA, and you are not a person if you don’t.

58
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,660
The virtue of this view is its simplicity. But its implications are so problematic that most philosophers dismiss it.

59
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,780
If all you need to be a person is human DNA, then like my mouth cells are persons. And so are corpses.

60
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,100
None of our favorite androids – or aliens,
like Superman – meet the genetic criterion,

61
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:04,750
even though they seem more like persons than,
like, you know some of my cells.

62
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:12,140
But American philosopher Mary Ann Warren offers five, more specific criteria that she believes, together, constitute personhood:

63
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,630
Consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated activity,
capacity to communicate, and self-awareness.

64
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,240
These five factors are known as the cognitive
criteria for personhood.

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,530
Warren argues that some humans just aren’t
persons, either not yet, or not anymore.

66
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,050
In her view, if a being is incapable of communicating,

67
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,230
isn’t aware of itself as a self, can’t
think, or move around on its own,

68
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:39,540
or isn’t conscious, then she says that’s not a being that we call a person, even if it happens to have human DNA.

69
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,600
Now you might have noticed that Warren’s
criteria definitely rules out fetuses.

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,760
But it also kind of rules out young children. Kids don’t become self-aware until at least 18 months.

71
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,580
So, Noonan’s criterion seems to allow some obvious non-persons into its definition, like the cells in my spit,

72
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,920
but Warren’s criteria may kick out of the personhood club some beings that to you, are clearly people.

73
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,280
Then maybe you’d find the social criterion
more palatable.

74
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,900
This view says that you’re a person whenever
society recognizes you as a person,

75
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,900
or whenever someone cares about you.

76
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,560
This one seems pretty intuitive. It says that
you matter, morally, when you matter to someone.

77
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,220
It allows for society’s understanding of
a person to change over time,

78
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,140
which seems good when we’re thinking about something like expanding rights to protect primates, for example.

79
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,180
However, if you think carefully about this
view, it also means that,

80
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,630
if no one happens to care for a particular
being, that being simply isn’t a person.

81
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,660
It would mean that fully rational, healthy, functioning adult human beings might not have personhood –

82
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,020
just because no one happens to care about
them.

83
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,800
And we probably want inclusion in our moral community to be something more than a popularity contest.

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,360
So, then there’s contemporary Australian
moral philosopher Peter Singer,

85
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,690
who says that the key to personhood is sentience,
the ability to feel pleasure and pain.

86
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:58,470
This criterion ignores the whole idea of species altogether, and instead looks at a being’s capacity to suffer.

87
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,800
This view says it’s wrong to cause unnecessary
pain to anything that can feel,

88
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,900
but if it can’t feel, well, we do no harm by excluding it from the group of beings that matter.

89
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,060
So, fetuses younger than at least 23 weeks are not persons, nor are humans in persistent vegetative states.

90
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,420
But any animal with a developed central nervous
system is a person.

91
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,720
Now, some people think that personhood is
a right,

92
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,440
a sort of ticket to the moral community that you forfeit when you violate the laws of society in a major way.

93
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,100
In this view, you can surrender your own personhood
through grossly inhumane actions.

94
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,460
This line of reasoning is one way that people
justify capital punishment.

95
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,430
Yes, killing people is wrong, they might say,

96
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,900
but if a criminal has surrendered their personhood
through their actions,

97
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,770
then they’re no longer a person anymore.

98
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,960
So we, as members of the State, would think
ourselves justified in killing them.

99
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,780
Now, so far we’ve been talking about personhood like it’s a toggle switch – you have it or you don’t.

100
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,940
But a more nuanced option is the gradient theory of personhood, which says it’s not all or nothing

101
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,680
– it’s more like a dimmer switch.

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,620
So, personhood comes in degrees, and you can
have more or less of it.

103
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,260
In this view, a fetus would slowly grow in personhood throughout pregnancy, as cognition develops.

104
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,050
So a 26-week old fetus would have less personhood
than a 34-week old fetus,

105
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,200
which would have less personhood than a newborn baby, who would have less personhood than a toddler.

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,800
And likewise, personhood can be lost as gradually
as it can be gained.

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,650
A lot of people think this is a reasonable
way to look at the issue.

108
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,280
For instance, you might think a fetus has some degree of personhood, and so deserves moral consideration.

109
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,020
But when the fetus is compared with its mother – a being with far more personhood, by this logic –

110
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,540
then the interests of the being with more
personhood gets more weight.

111
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,340
So, this doesn’t deny the personhood of either being, but it allows that some beings have more personhood than others.

112
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,140
This stuff is hard to talk about. But that’s why we’re talking about it. Because it merits your attention.

113
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,460
Not only does it matter now, as we’re studying
the concept of personhood for its own sake,

114
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,900
but the answers you give to these questions are going to be important later, when we’re studying ethics.

115
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,280
So give it a good long think and try to figure
out what you believe constitutes personhood.

116
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,200
As you consider the factors that you think are most important, be careful how you cast your net.

117
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,960
Make sure you include everyone you think should be included and exclude those you think should be excluded.

118
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,340
It’s harder than you might think.
Good luck.

119
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,340
Today we talked about personhood.

120
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,700
We considered several criteria – genetic, cognitive, social, sentience, and the gradient theory –

121
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,280
for determining what constitutes personhood.

122
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,680
And we explored how the definition of personhood
informs some important social debates.
