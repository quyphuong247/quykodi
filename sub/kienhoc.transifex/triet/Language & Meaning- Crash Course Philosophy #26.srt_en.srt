00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,320
What is a game?
Easy question, right?

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,980
You know what a game is – there’s basketball, Chutes and Ladders, Dungeon and Dragons, tennis, Wizard School!

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,120
But those are examples of games.
What I’m asking for is the definition of a game.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,500
Maybe, if you haven’t been keeping up with
Crash Course Games, you’d simply say that,

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,120
a game is a competition, with winners and
losers.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,970
But, what about a game like ring around the
rosie?

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,470
Does a game require at least two players?

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,411
No, there is literally a game called solitaire
solitaire.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,320
Maybe a game is just a thing you do for fun.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,480
But what about “who can stay quiet the longest”
–

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,120
the game that your parents used to use on
long car trips?

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,800
Or, like, Russian roulette?

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,820
Or The Game of Thrones, where you win or you
die?

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,620
When it comes to language, there’s a lot
to philosophize about.

15
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:48,029
But one question that philosophers of language
like to mull is the question of meaning.

16
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:52,380
What do words – like ‘game’ or ‘red’ or ‘banana’
What do they mean?

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,500
How do we know what they mean?

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,100
And who gets to decide?

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:06,660
[Theme Music]

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,860
Language is one of our most nuanced and powerful
tools.

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:17,760
It takes all of the stuff that’s swirling around in each of our lonely, isolated brains – all those thoughts – and transfers them into someone else’s brain.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,020
Which is really, fabulously cool.
It’s like telepathy!

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,640
But with the extra step of actually speaking
or writing.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,859
But, how do words – a collection of  sounds or written symbols – key into the mental concepts that we want to communicate?

25
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,080
The naive understanding of what words mean is just that they’re just whatever the dictionary says.

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,740
But we know that’s not totally true.

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,020
Think about the difference between words like ‘cat,’ ‘kitty,’ ‘mouser,’ and ‘feline’.

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:47,920
Early 20th century German philosopher Gottlab Frege helped parse out this difference by drawing a distinction between what he called sense, and reference.

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,680
The reference of a word is the object or concept
that it’s meant to designate.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,660
The reference of all these words is this.

31
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,760
Sense, on the other hand, is the way in which
the words tie us to the object or concept.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,660
So, while the reference of each of these words
is the same, they have different senses.

33
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,780
A kitty might be a baby cat, or sort of fancy
lap cat,

34
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,229
while a mouser might be a cat that lives in
a barn and kills rodents for a living.

35
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,030
So how do words get their meaning?

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,770
A definition is traditionally understood as whatever meets the conditions for both necessity and sufficiency.

37
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,240
A necessary condition is what’s needed – like, what must be present – in order for a thing to be a thing.

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,111
In order for X to be X.

39
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:27,140
A necessary condition of being a bachelor,
for example, is that you must be unmarried.

40
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,950
A sufficient condition is something that’s
enough for X to be X,

41
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,000
but it’s not required for that thing to
meet that definition.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,280
For example, being born in the United States is a sufficient condition for being an American citizen.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,960
But it’s not a necessary condition, because people who weren’t born in the US can still become citizens.

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,460
The long-standing view of definitions was that, if you can figure out both the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be X, then you’ll have your definition.

45
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,080
That is, you’ll have found the criteria
that exclude all non-X’s, but include all X’s.

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,320
If you’re following me.

47
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,820
But 20th century Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said this rigid concept of definitions doesn’t actually work.

48
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,040
For example, you just can’t define the word ‘game’ in a way that’s going to make everybody happy.

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,820
Any definition you give, someone’s going
to come up with a counterexample –

50
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,230
either some game that’s excluded by the
definition,

51
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,000
or something that the definition includes
that not everyone would agree is a game.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,780
It took Andre and entire 10 minute episode
to define games!

53
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,380
But the thing is, Wittgenstein said this doesn’t matter!

54
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,640
Because, everyone knows what a game is!

55
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,320
He pointed out that we learn and know the
meaning of words

56
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,610
by hearing the way other members of our linguistic
community use them.

57
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,870
We hear Candyland, rugby, and Cards Against
Humanity all referred to as games,

58
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,180
so eventually our brains piece together what’s
common between them,

59
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,200
in a recognition that Wittgenstein called
family resemblance.

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,560
You know how you can just see the relation
between people sometimes?

61
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,980
Rather than rigid definitions, Wittgenstein
said word meanings are so-called cluster concepts.

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,440
There’s no one element that everything in
the cluster has in common,

63
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,230
but they all share something with some other
members of the group.

64
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,190
It’s sort of like you have your dad’s
nose and your mom’s sense of humor,

65
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,250
and your sister has your mom’s eyes and
your dad’s athleticism.

66
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,310
You and your sister don’t really have much
in common, but you do both resemble both parents.

67
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,460
But it’s not like every concept in the cluster
is equal.

68
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,840
The ones that everyone would accept are the paradigm cases – you can picture them in the center of the
cluster.

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,240
And as you move to the outer edges you’ll get fringe cases, the ones that some people would include in the group but others would exclude.

70
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,960
Everyone will agree that football is a game, but there’s going to be some disagreement about things like,

71
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,860
I don’t know, knife fights, or how long
you can hold your breath under water.

72
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,680
And Wittgenstein said that’s fine.

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,500
Language is a living phenomenon, and like most living things, there’s going to be change and variation.

74
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,960
But who gets to decide what words mean, or
if a meaning is legitimate?

75
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,850
Here, Wittgenstein said, “meaning is use.”

76
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,180
In other words, as long as a linguistic community uses a word in a particular way, it has that meaning.

77
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,880
Watching the way words develop and change does suggest that Wittgenstein was onto something.

78
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
I mean, ‘mouse’ didn’t used to mean
that thing, but now it does.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,070
We make words up as we need them.

80
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,050
And at the same time, words also fall out
of use, or take on entirely new meanings.

81
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,270
Now, this view of language assumes that meaning
is tied to a particular linguistic communities.

82
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,330
And a community might, or might not, span
all of the speakers of that language.

83
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,139
Think about the regional differences in words that might be specific to your town, or school, or group of friends, or family.

84
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,180
And what about this: Do you and your best friend have code words – words that you use to talk privately, even when you’re in public?

85
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,840
Like, the two of you could be at a club, and
one of you would say to the other:

86
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,180
“That guy at the bar is a total shoehorn” and the other one would know exactly what you meant?

87
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,820
In that case, do those words, that have meaning
specific to the two of you,

88
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,980
really mean what you say they mean, even if
no one else agrees with you?

89
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,690
And what happens if the two of you forget
that meaning?

90
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,100
Is the meaning still there?

91
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,330
Or does it only exist as long as someone uses
the word that way?

92
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,380
Let’s bounce over to the Thought Bubble
for a bit of Flash Philosophy.

93
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,620
A linguistic community of two – like you
and your friend – seems fairly plausible.

94
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,840
But is it possible to have an entirely private
language?

95
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,320
Wittgenstein asked us to imagine that each
of us has a box, and inside each box is something.

96
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,620
We all refer to the thing in our box as ‘a beetle,’ but no one can see inside anyone else’s box, ever.

97
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,280
We all call our hidden thing a beetle, but we have no idea if the content of our boxes is the same.

98
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,220
Wittgenstein said there’s no way we can meaningfully use the word ‘beetle’ in this context,

99
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:23,140
because we have no way of verifying what others mean when they use the word, and they have no way of verifying what we mean.

100
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:28,140
This is meant to illustrate how it’s impossible
to directly communicate our subjective experiences.

101
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,360
We all use the word ‘red’ to refer to
the color we see when we look at a stop sign,

102
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,340
but I have no way of knowing if you’re actually
seeing the same thing that I’m seeing.

103
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,960
I don’t know if your pain feels like my
pain or your love feels like my love.

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,980
Our minds are like boxes.

105
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,000
No one else can see what’s inside.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,900
But here’s the thing: it doesn’t matter.

107
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,640
Because ‘beetle’ just means, ‘what’s
in the box.’

108
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,200
It could literally be a beetle, or it could
be a fox! In socks!

109
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,560
The point is, we don’t know if the color red in my mind is the same as the color red in your mind, because the color red is a beetle in a box.

110
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,080
It’s a label for what’s in our minds.

111
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,740
So language, Wittgenstein said, can’t refer
directly to an internal state,

112
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,540
like what it’s like to see the color red,
or to experience pain.

113
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,389
Instead, it can only refer to the aspect of
it that’s publicly observable by other people.

114
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:19,840
So, the word ‘pain’ isn’t the feeling of physical suffering, it’s jumping on one foot and cursing when you stub a toe.

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,480
It’s rubbing your temples when you have a headache – the observable behaviors that are associated with it.

116
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,100
Thanks, Thought Bubble!
Now I want to propose an experiment.

117
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,400
If use is meaning, you should be able to give
a word meaning by using it, right?

118
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,060
At least, if you can convince a linguistic
community to go there with you.

119
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,160
So let’s try it.

120
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,040
If every Crash Course viewer starts referring to bananas as chom choms, can we make it catch on?

121
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,900
Can we create meaning?!

122
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,600
We’ll have to stay tuned for the answer to that one, but in the meantime, we can think about what might happen.

123
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,460
And to do that, we need to make a distinction
between two different types of meaning.

124
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,300
When people communicate verbally, there’s speaker meaning, which is what the speaker intends when using a word.

125
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,480
And then there’s audience meaning, which
is what the audience understands.

126
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,180
Since the whole point of language is communication, our goal is for speaker meaning and audience meaning to match up.

127
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,500
But, as anyone who’s ever, like, had a conversation,
knows, this doesn’t always work out.

128
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,080
Like, Billy tells Bobby that he likes Sally.

129
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,600
Billy, the speaker, means that he likes Sally
as a friend.

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,139
Bobby, the audience, takes Billy’s statement
to be a profession of, like, you know, like-like.

131
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:29,020
So Bobby then goes and tells Sally that Billy like-likes her, when in fact Billy actually like-likes Suzy, and pretty soon, you know how it goes. Tears.

132
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,460
The point is, that even with a simple word
that we all think we understand, like ‘like,’

133
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,940
speaker meaning and audience meaning can fail
to connect.

134
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,360
When we get into more complicated or nuanced words, or when we try to invent a new word, like chom chom,

135
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,540
we’re likely to run into some pretty high-level
speaker-meaning/audience-meaning confusion.

136
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,260
But for now, we learned about meaning.

137
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:51,230
We talked about sense and reference, beetles
in boxes, and language games.

138
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,360
And we learned that bananas are called chom choms.

139
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,540
Repeat it with me: chom choms.

140
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,260
Never say bananas again.

141
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,550
Next time, we’re going to talk about another
linguistic concept – conversational implicature.

142
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,950
