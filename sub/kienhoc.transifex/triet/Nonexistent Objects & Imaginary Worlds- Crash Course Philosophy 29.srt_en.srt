1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Sherlock Holmes lives at 221C Baker Street.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,280
Santa Claus has eight reindeer.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,498
Harry Potter’s best friend is Draco Malfoy.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,300
If a zombie touches your skin, you’ll become
a zombie.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,40
I just made a series of assertions.

6
00:00:15,40 --> 00:00:16,759
They all make sense, generally speaking.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,290
They contain subjects and verbs and are grammatically
legit.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,80
But what is their truth-value?

9
00:00:21,80 --> 00:00:25,459
I’m sure you had some immediate reactions to some of them. Like, Harry and Draco? No.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,420
But how can an assertion be true or false,
if it’s about beings that are nonexistent?

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,560
How are we supposed to think about things that don’t exist in the real world, yet somehow seem to exist in our minds?

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,200
Part of why we can think about, and talk about, and even picture in our imaginations, things that have never existed, is because of language.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,620
Without language, the only stuff we’d really be able to communicate about would be physical objects –

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,559
because communicating would mostly consist
of pointing...maybe a little bit of grunting.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,140
But words allow us track to concepts – ideas we hold in our heads – even if they don’t correspond with anything in real life.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,300
And here, we find ourselves in a new realm:

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,928
where the philosophy of language bumps up
against aesthetics, the philosophy of art.

18
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,580
Because when we talk about nonexistent objects, we soon find ourselves talking about imaginary worlds –

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,360
worlds that don’t exist, but which language
has allowed us to conceptualize in our minds.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,480
And when it comes to discussing things like meaning and existence in these worlds, we need a slightly different set of philosophical tools,

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,660
because in these worlds, different rules often
apply.

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,370
And that’s because we make up those rules.

23
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,480
In the worlds that we imagine, there might
be life on other planets.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,950
Or the past as we know it might never have
happened.

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,840
Or maybe there are no laws of physics.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,220
It turns out, we can create entire universes
just with our minds.

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:46,720
[Theme Music]

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,140
When we first started to unpack the big ol’ steamer trunk that is language, we talked about the idea of reference.

29
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,950
The referent of a word is the object in the
world that the word tracks, or keys into.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,210
So, a referent of the word ‘cat’ is this
guy.

31
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,440
But what happens when there is no referent?

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,860
Like, what’s the referent of the word ‘jabberwock’?

33
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,310
And how can I determine the truth-value of
such a word – or the object it refers to?

34
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,440
Is it even possible?

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,660
I suppose it could be that, when we refer to non-existent objects, we’re just speaking nonsense.

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,840
But I’m almost positive that I really do
know a lot about things that aren’t real.

37
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,560
And I think of that information as facts – facts
that are true.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,60
Like, I know that Snow White hangs out with seven dwarves, and if you told me that there were eight, and that one of them was named Sloppy,

39
00:02:27,60 --> 00:02:28,890
I would know you were just wrong.

40
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,839
But where are those dwarves in the real world?

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,800
And how do I know how many there are?

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,740
And how could you be wrong about something
that doesn’t exist?

43
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,800
To parse this question some more, let’s head over to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy:

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,700
Here’s another assertion for you:
“The present king of France is bald.”

45
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:44,709
True or false?

46
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,940
Bertrand Russell said it’s false.

47
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,100
And it’s false even though this sentence actually has a couple of statements packed into it:

48
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,000
One, it asserts that there is a present king
of France and two, that he is bald.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,80
But, there is no present king of France – France
has a president, not a king.

50
00:03:00,80 --> 00:03:02,360
So the whole proposition ends up being false.

51
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,780
Since there’s no present king of France, Russell said, we can’t attribute any true statements to him.

52
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,460
It would be just as false to say that the present king of France has a ponytail, and a nice, bushy hipster beard, as to say he’s bald.

53
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,700
So this French king is a non-existent entity that’s falsely been ascribed an existence, simply through an error in our understanding of language.

54
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,859
And if you’ll recall, this is similar to what we encountered with the cats-and-tails conundrum, back when we were discussing the nature of reality.

55
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,560
If you say that “Every cat has one more tail than no cat,” that can be interpreted to mean that there’s such a thing as No-Cat.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,60
So, just like with the present King of France, a weirdness in our language makes no-thing look like some-thing.

57
00:03:38,60 --> 00:03:39,200
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

58
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,899
Now, Russell was sure that we can’t make any meaningful assertions about something that doesn’t exist.

59
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,900
But 20th century Austrian philosopher Alexius
Meinong had a different view.

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,800
Meinong was convinced that we can have meaningful thoughts about objects that don’t exist in reality.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,780
But, he said, in order to be able to speak meaningfully about something, it must, in some sense, have being.

62
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:06,660
So Meinong came up with an ontology – that is, a system of being – that was divided into three classes: absistence, subsistence, and existence.

63
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,600
And he posited that even non-existent things
could fit into this system.

64
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,890
First, he said, every possible object that
you can think of absists.

65
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,60
If you can think about it, it has absistence.

66
00:04:17,60 --> 00:04:25,640
This includes stuff that could never exist in real life – like unicorns, or the mythical Lost Island that our old monk friend Guanilo said would be the best place on Earth, if it were possible.

67
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,239
And inside the group of things that absist
is the smaller subset of subsistent objects.

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,360
These are things like numbers and theorems, that don’t manifest a physical existence, but they also don’t contain any sort of impossibility.

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,20
They’re just not physical things, so they
can’t be found anywhere in the world.

70
00:04:42,20 --> 00:04:43,280
They’re just concepts.

71
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,679
And finally, existent objects are those that are actually here in the physical world, like cats and smart phones and current French presidents.

72
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,500
So, existent objects have all three levels of being – they exist, they can be conceptualized, and they can be imagined.

73
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,520
Now, I should probably point out that many of Meinong’s contemporaries viewed him as something of a nutter.

74
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,780
He was trolled pretty hard by some of his contemporaries, who referred to his supposed realm of non-existent objects as Meinong’s Jungle –

75
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,260
a place where round squares wander around with the present king of France, hippogriffs, and never-ending gobstoppers.

76
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,270
And maybe you think Meinong’s Jungle is
a bunch of baloney too.

77
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,830
But you might also say there’s a difference between something like a round square, and something like Harry Potter.

78
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,380
Because, you might think that Harry Potter
is real, in some sense.

79
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,200
Like, you get that he’s fictional, but to
you he feels real.

80
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,440
So what about that?
Is that nonsense too?

81
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,660
Not necessarily.

82
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,120
Here’s one way that some aestheticians, or philosophers of art, make sense of what’s going on when we talk about fictional objects.

83
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,40
They begin by pointing out where, metaphorically
speaking, we talk about them.

84
00:05:40,40 --> 00:05:44,520
The domain in which we have a conversation,
is known as a universe of discourse.

85
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,539
And inside this universe, assertions can be
either true or false.

86
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,600
Our default universe of discourse is the actual
world.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,340
So in regular conversation, “Harry Potter is a wizard,” is a false assertion, just like “The present king of France is bald,”

88
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,159
because there is no Harry Potter, so he can’t
be a wizard.

89
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,340
There’s also no wizards.

90
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,460
But when we’re having a conversation about the world of Harry Potter, we’ve entered a different universe of discourse.

91
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:13,599
When our universe of discourse is the world of Harry Potter, “Harry Potter is a wizard” is a true statement, even though it’s false in the real-world universe of discourse.

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,100
And whether we know it or not, we use different universes of discourse all the time – not just when we’re talking fandoms.

93
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,320
Like, in the universe of discourse that is basketball, taking a few steps with a ball in your hand is called traveling, and is illegal.

94
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,240
But in the universe of discourse called football, taking steps with a ball in your hand is not called traveling and is perfectly legal.

95
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:41,540
So one way to solve the puzzle about the existence, and truth, of imaginary objects is to say that – in the case of Harry Potter – J.K. Rowling created a universe of discourse that is Harry’s world.

96
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,820
And that universe shares some things in common
with our world, but it has differences too.

97
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,500
In the real world, it is false that Harry Potter has a lightning scar on his head, because there is no Harry Potter.

98
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,300
But in the universe of discourse that is the world of Harry Potter, it’s true, because both Harry and his lightning scar exist.

99
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,320
So when we talk about fiction, we’re speaking within a particular universe of discourse, and our interlocutors know this – even if it’s not explicitly stated.

100
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,469
This lets us say things that end up being true, even though the truth doesn’t track to this actual world.

101
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,740
Now, things get a little weird when our universe of discourse is a fictional world that’s set inside of our real world, like House of Cards.

102
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,640
Frank Underwood is the president of the United
States, but, well, so is Barack Obama.

103
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,750
They both live in the White House and have
the same executive powers.

104
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,600
Unlike the universe of discourse to which Harry Potter belongs, the universe of House of Cards adheres to all of the rules of our world.

105
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,860
Thankfully, much to our credit as a species, we are great at distinguishing between universes of discourse.

106
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,680
We can distinguish between what’s canon
and what’s not.

107
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:44,540
We can fight passionately and knowledgeably about what might happen within fictional universes of discourse – like who would win in a foot race, Superman or the Flash?

108
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:53,280
And when you think about fictional realities where different universes of discourse meet – like DC/Marvel crossovers – you’re actually engaging in some pretty serious ontological ponderings.

109
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:02,599
You’re holding in your mind an incredible number of propositions that are specific to different universes, and figuring out exactly what would be true, if those universes were combined.

110
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,940
For instance, in a world where both ghosts and zombies exist, would it be possible for one person to become both, at death?

111
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:15,280
Our ability to understand – and play around with – fictional realities helps us think about other hypothetical realities too.

112
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,500
Like what will happen in the future, and what the implications might be of the different choices that we make.

113
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,320
So, treating nonexistent things as if they’re
real?

114
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,700
“Nonsense” probably isn’t the right
word for it.

115
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,940
Being able to create and conceptualize a universe
is a pretty amazing skill.

116
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,840
Today we talked about nonexistent and imaginary objects, and whether it’s possible to make true assertions about them.

117
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,209
We learned about Meinong’s Jungle and the
concept of a universe of discourse.

118
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,939
Bananas are chom choms.

119
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,750
Next time we’ll talk about objects of aesthetic
appreciation.
