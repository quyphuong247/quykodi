00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,020
We’ve spent a couple of lessons thinking
about how philosophers reason.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,820
Now it’s time to do some actual philosophy.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,600
And one of the most important hallmarks
of philosophical thought is that

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,980
you should never take things at face value.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,760
You should always be willing to accept that
there’s more to the world than meets the eye.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,480
Because, whatever truth seems obvious today,
might turn out to be not so true at all.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,950
It’s one of the more daunting pursuits in
philosophy -- pondering what’s really real,

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,820
as opposed to what you think is real, and
how you could ever know the difference.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,580
Fortunately, there are some guides who can help you on your journey, when you’re exploring the nature of reality.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,220
And you know who’s really helpful here?
Leonardo DiCaprio.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,480
I mean, I guess you could say that a lot actors can transport you to another reality if they’re good enough.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,720
But that’s not what I mean.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,859
I’m talking about Inception, that movie
where Leo plays a thief who steals ideas from

16
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,819
people by invading their dreams.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,239
A super-handy ability if you want to, say, steal corporate secrets from a CEO, or military plans from a head of state.

18
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,230
But after a while, it becomes hard for some
members of Leo’s team to tell the difference

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,100
between one dream and another, or to discern
dreams from reality.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,140
The whole film is populated with people who live
in a dream world, convinced they’re living real-life.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,640
To them, the dream is all there is – it
has become their reality.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,180
But from the perspective of those outside
the dream, who see their sleeping bodies,

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,290
the reality they’re chasing is simply false.

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,170
It’s a real cool premise for a movie. I
haven’t ruined it for you -- you can still

25
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,160
watch it. And the fact is, the same concept
has been around for thousands of years.

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,420
The basic question that Inception asks has
vexed philosophers all the way back to the

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,320
very roots of Western philosophy.

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,360
Is it possible that my current reality isn’t
real at all?

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,960
Before we had Leonardo DiCaprio to walk us
through this question we had Plato.

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:54,400
[Theme Music]

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,520
Around 2400 years ago, Plato wrote his famous
book, The Republic, in which he describes

32
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,560
-- probably better than anyone before or since
-- the nature of reality.

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,840
He does it by telling a story about prisoners who have been chained since birth in a dark cave, facing a blank wall.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,829
All kinds of people and objects pass behind
the prisoners, and a fire casts the shadows

35
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,739
of those things onto the wall in front of
the prisoners.

36
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,539
These shadow images are all the prisoners ever see, and they come to understand the shadows as reality.

37
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:25,140
Now just hold up a minute and imagine what
your view of the world would be like, if all

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,320
you’ve ever seen are shadows. You wouldn’t
know that there was anything more.

39
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,780
3D wouldn’t even be a concept for you.

40
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,290
The prisoners spend their whole lives understanding
only this shadow reality, until one day one

41
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,689
of them escapes from his chains, and crawls
into the daylight.

42
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:44,150
After spending a lifetime in fire-lit darkness,
the man is blinded by the sun at first.

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,930
But in time, he comes to see the things outside
the cave are far more real than the shadow

44
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,999
images that he once took for reality.

45
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:54,060
They have substance. They occupy an extra
dimension.

46
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,819
Think about how that would feel. To suddenly
realize that everything you believed just

47
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,579
minutes ago turned out to be merely faint
outlines of reality.

48
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,999
This is what happens to a lot of the
characters who inhabit the world of Inception:

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,260
Once they realize there can be multiple layers of reality, they never look at the world around them the same way again.

50
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,300
And for many of them, the
experience becomes intoxicating.

51
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,870
This is also what happens to Plato’s escaped
prisoner.

52
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,430
He goes back into the cave to tell his friends
the exciting news about what he’s found.

53
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,760
But the conversation doesn’t go the way
he thinks it will.

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,129
He expects them to be amazed by his discovery
-- he figures they’ll be as eager to join

55
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,180
him as he is anxious to get back.

56
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,029
But they all think he’s crazy. As far as
they’re concerned, he’s babbling about

57
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:36,930
some “higher reality” that they’ve never
seen, or heard of, or have any evidence for.

58
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,450
To make matters worse, going back into the
fire-lit cave, after being in the sunlight,

59
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,170
temporarily blinds the man again.

60
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,040
So, from his friends’ perspective, his journey
into the outside world has actually damaged him,

61
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,020
because now he can’t even see the shadow
images that were once his whole world.

62
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,659
Now, you don’t have to be Plato, or Christopher
Nolan, to dream this stuff up.

63
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:58,279
In fact, you might have experienced a diluted
version of this kind of reality-shock for yourself.

64
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,519
For example:
Do you remember your first teddy bear?

65
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,139
That bear was, philosophically speaking,
your only contact with,

66
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,320
and your only way of understanding,
the concept of a bear.

67
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:12,609
Then one day, you went to a zoo, or a wildlife refuge,
or a national park, and you saw an actual bear.

68
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,849
And suddenly you realized that your previous
understanding of ‘bear’ was way, way off.

69
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:22,260
Bears don’t have button eyes and little smiles made
of thread. They’re not soft. You couldn’t hug one.

70
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,700
The bear you spent your first years of life
snuggling with, was just a shadowy imitation

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,540
of the reality of bear-ness.

72
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,420
Now, check out this somewhat more mature example:

73
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,060
Maybe you were the first member of your tweeny
group of friends to discover the wonders of

74
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,040
romantic attraction. You might’ve felt like
your eyes were open to a whole new world that

75
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,890
your pals were still blind to.

76
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,950
And when you tried to explain to them what
had happened to you? And how you felt?

77
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,850
They probably thought you were crazy. And
the feeling was probably mutual.

78
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,580
And this is what our poor protagonist goes
through when he re-enters the cave.

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,310
So why does Plato tell us this story?

80
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,970
It’s not just about little a-ha moments,
like when we discovered that bears and boys

81
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,050
were not what we once thought they were. It’s
more than that.

82
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,830
Plato wants us to see that we, right now,
are prisoners in a cave.

83
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,260
Everything in our world is actually a mere
shadow of a higher reality.

84
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,030
Just as the man in the story once mistook
shadows for real things, we are currently

85
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,920
prisoners in a cave of our own.

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,130
But rather than mistaking shadows for the
material objects of the ordinary world, our

87
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:21,330
mistake is thinking that the material objects
of the ordinary world are the most real things.

88
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,830
In fact, Plato says, the physical world that we think is the most real, is actually a mere shadow of a higher truth.

89
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,980
If this surprises you, think about how many
beliefs were once accepted as absolute fact

90
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,230
– only to later turn out to be completely
false –

91
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,570
The shape of the earth. The idea that the
Earth was the center of the universe.

92
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,970
The belief that heroin, and tobacco, and lobotomies
were good for people.

93
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,380
Those so-called facts turned out to be far
from the truth.

94
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,710
So, there’s a lot packed into this little
story.

95
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,230
Plato is urging you to consider that the
world is not really as it seems.

96
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,490
And making a statement about philosophy.
Doing philosophy is hard.

97
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,630
Accepting that much of what you’ve always believed might actually be false can make you uncomfortable.

98
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,500
You might feel temporarily blinded.

99
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,260
You may learn just enough to know that your
old beliefs aren’t reliable, but you don’t

100
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,050
yet know enough to feel comfortable with these
new ideas, either.

101
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,220
What’s more, your old friends, who aren’t on this journey with you, might think you’ve lost your mind.

102
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,360
Or they might take you for an arrogant, pedantic
jerk who thinks they have all the answers.

103
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,230
But philosophy is also awesome.

104
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,620
Because, once you get through the growing
pains, you can see things in a new way, and

105
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,860
you can see through things that used to fool
you.

106
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,420
And that brings us to another puzzle. Consider
this argument:

107
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:33,060
No cat has 2 tails. Every cat has one more
tail than no cat. Therefore, every cat has 3 tails.

108
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,980
Now, you’re probably thinking, that’s just
clearly wrong. That’s not much of a puzzle.

109
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,950
I mean, the two premises sound right enough.
But the conclusion is … wha?

110
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,220
This puzzle exploits a strangeness in the
language that we use to discuss certain ideas

111
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,000
-- specifically the ideas of nothingness,
absence, or emptiness.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,440
In premise 1, ‘no cat’ refers to an absence
of cats.

113
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,270
Think about things with 2 tails, and none
of those things you think of are cats. Because

114
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,840
you probably can’t even think of anything
with two tails.

115
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,440
But in premise 2, the language tricks us into
understanding ‘No-Cat’ as an existent thing,

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,980
rather than an absence of a thing.
The way it’s phrased, No-Cat could conceivably

117
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,830
be that elusive creature that has 2 tails.

118
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,460
So this leads us to the conclusion that, if
the No-Cat has 2 tails, and every cat has

119
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,040
one more tail than it does, then every cat
must have 3 tails! Which is just wrong.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,720
And it takes a moment to understand the source
of our confusion.

121
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,560
The conclusion is faulty, because it mistakes the absence of something for the presence of something.

122
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,960
But it strikes us as plausible, on some level,
because language has duped us into considering

123
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,200
a reality where a creature called No Cat with
two tails is actually a thing.

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,220
Figuring out puzzles like this is kind of
like flipping a switch -- first you’re confused,

125
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,400
and then the cause of the confusion seems
obvious.

126
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,140
It’s just a matter of sorting through what’s
really real.

127
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,720
And Plato thinks philosophy is like that too
-- going from the darkness into the light

128
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,700
is both disorienting and rewarding.

129
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,610
It’s kinda too bad in this case, though.
Because: a cat with three tails? I’d kind

130
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,610
of like to see that. Though, to be honest
I’d mostly just like looking at any cat.

131
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,750
And with that, we wrap up this episode of
Crash Course Philosophy. Today we learned

132
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,890
about Plato’s famous Myth of the Cave, questioned
the relationship between appearance and reality,

133
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,590
and talked about the process of philosophical
discovery.

134
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,250
Next time, we’re going to disappear even
deeper into the hole of shadow and disbelief

135
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,890
– all in the hopes of eventually emerging
into the light.
