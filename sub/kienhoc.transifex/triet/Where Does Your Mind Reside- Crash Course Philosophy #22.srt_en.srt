3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,940
On September 13, 1848, a freak accident caused
an explosion

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,860
that drove an iron rod straight into the skull
of a worker named Phineas Gage.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,860
A metal rod almost as tall as he was went
through his skull – and he didn’t die.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,820
But, the Phineas from before the accident, and the one who lived after it, didn’t seem to have a lot in common, personality-wise.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,360
The Phineas with no hole in his brain was
a proper, hard-working gentleman.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,520
And the Phineas with the injured brain was,
uh, sort of a belligerent jerk.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,980
Phineas’ brain was changed – and his personality
changed too.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,280
This misfortune has provided lots of fodder
for researchers of psychology and neurology.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,670
But the case of Phineas Gage holds lessons
for philosophers too.

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,850
It provides us with some rare, hard evidence that a part of us that's historically been thought of as non-physical

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,839
– our personality – is actually, directly
affected by what happens to us physically.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,700
Which raises the question: Where does our
mind reside?

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:12,760
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,700
Now, not a lot of contemporary scientists would be all that surprised that an injury like the one Gage suffered could cause such a radical change.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,860
That's because the dominant view held in much of Western science is what we call reductive physicalism.

18
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,119
This is the view that the world is made only
of physical stuff, including us.

19
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,580
By this logic, everything about me, and you,
can be explained in terms of our bodies

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,280
– our brains, hormones, and neurotransmitters.

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,080
So if everything about Phineas’s personality
could be explained in terms of his brain,

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,480
it’s no shock that a radical change in his brain would bring about a radical change in his personality.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,720
This same belief is at work when a psychiatrist
prescribes antidepressants to a patient.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,880
Change the patient's brain chemistry, change
the patient's mood.

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,980
Now, physicalism may be the default scientific position, but remember, way back in episode 5,

26
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,720
our old friend Rene Descartes introduced us to cogito ergo sum – I think, therefore, I am.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,160
Descartes believed that he could cast doubt on the existence of his body, but not the existence of his mind.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,060
The fact that he could doubt one but not the other told him that he must be made of two different kinds of stuff.

29
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,540
This view, known as Substance Dualism, says that the world is made of both physical stuff and mental stuff.

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,000
Substance dualists say that minds are a separate, nonphysical substance that cannot be reduced to,

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,940
or explained in terms of, physical stuff,
like brains.

32
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,100
And in this view, some things – like God – are pure mind, and other things – like rocks – are pure matter.

33
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,750
But humans, well, we’re kinda special.

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,620
We’re the only kind of thing that combines both stuffs in one being – both body and mind.

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,720
What’s more, these two substances appear
to interact with each other inside of us.

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,630
This is called interactionism.

37
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,550
When I “make up my mind” to do something,

38
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,670
I have the power to compel my body to do as
I please –

39
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,190
to get up off the couch and make myself a
nice pb and j, for example.

40
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,660
What’s more, my mental states seem to have the ability to affect my physical states even against my will.

41
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,440
You ever notice how many people who are grieving or under a lot of stress, for example, often get physically sick?

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,600
Likewise, our bodies also appear to be able
to affect our minds.

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,340
Like when you’re so hungry you just can’t
focus on what your teacher is saying at all.

44
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,920
Or how a pure physical pleasure – like having a good cuddle with your cat – can pull you out of a bad mood.

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,660
Interactionists say that what's going on is that our two substances – minds and bodies – are interacting with each other.

46
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,260
But, if you think about it, this is actually
a pretty puzzling proposition.

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,120
How can a purely mental thing have any affect
on a purely physical thing?

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,420
The puzzle of how minds and bodies can interact with each other is known as the Mind-Body Problem.

49
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,300
This is the problem that makes us wonder:

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,650
How can my body have a separate entity called
a mind lurking inside of it –

51
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,070
controlling it, and being controlled by it?

52
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,940
What would tether my mind to this body in
particular –

53
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,400
why couldn’t my mind just go running off on its own, or take a dip into other bodies to see what it’s like in there?

54
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,300
Descartes’ answer, frankly, wasn’t all
that satisfying.

55
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,900
He said that the mind is tethered to the body at the pineal gland – located at the base of the brain –

56
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,320
and that all mind-body interactions are filtered through that portal, if you will, between the mind and the body.

57
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,540
But that really only pushes the problem back,
without solving it,

58
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,340
since the pineal gland is part of the physical
body.

59
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,480
Many modern philosophers of mind, seeing no
way to solve the mind-body problem,

60
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,600
have felt compelled to abandon substance dualism
altogether.

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,960
Some are happy to be physicalists, but others
are convinced that there are some parts of

62
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,870
human experience that simply can’t be boiled
down to brains.

63
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,300
To see what they think is being left out, let’s head over to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

64
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,560
Contemporary Australian philosopher Frank Jackson presents us with the thought experiment of Mary,

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,140
a woman who has spent her entire life in a black and white room, learning everything via a black and white television.

66
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,440
While locked in this room, Mary becomes a neurophysicist specializing in the science of color.

67
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,259
She learns everything there is to know about
light, optics, the physics of color,

68
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,979
and how it affects our sensory organs, but
she has never seen it for herself.

69
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,569
So here’s the question:

70
00:04:54,569 --> 00:05:00,220
When Mary finally walks out of the room and sees color for the first time, has Mary learned something new?

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,360
Jackson devised this thought experiment as
an argument against reductive physicalism.

72
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,580
Because, Jackson says, the qualitative experience of seeing a color – say, red – isn't the same as knowing facts about red.

73
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,960
If everything could be explained in terms of the physical, then when Mary finally saw red,

74
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,820
it wouldn’t have contributed to her understanding
at all.

75
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,550
It wouldn’t have told her anything that
she didn’t already know.

76
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,690
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

77
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,360
What’s missing from a physicalist account,
many argue, is what are known as qualia

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,349
– instances of subjective, first-person
experience.

79
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,900
Qualia are what it feels like to stub your
toe,

80
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,819
or take the first bite out of a slice of pizza,

81
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:38,320
or to learn that you have been deeply betrayed
by a trusted friend.

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,780
It’s what Mary is said to gain when she steps out of the room and sees color for the first time.

83
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,140
Physicalists respond to thought experiments like Jackson’s by arguing that they beg the question.

84
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,999
Begging the question, you'll recall, is a
philosophical fallacy in which the premises

85
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,939
assume the conclusion they’re supposed to
be proving.

86
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,020
Jackson’s thought experiment assumes that Mary learns something new when she steps out of the room.

87
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,880
But, if physicalism is true, and if she really
knows everything physical about color,

88
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,780
then of course seeing it for herself isn’t going to add to her understanding of it in any way.

89
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,380
Now, physicalists argue that their case is
making progress,

90
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,720
as we learn more and more about the physical
processes of the mind.

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,379
Well that’s not really satisfying, because
we want an answer, not a promissory note.

92
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:20,340
But, to be fair, physicalists have only been
at work for a few decades,

93
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,879
while dualists have been bashing their heads
against the mind-body problem for centuries.

94
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,490
But not everybody falls cleanly into either
the physicalist or the dualist camp.

95
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,800
The Mary case, and other arguments like it, convince some people that they have to maintain their commitment to dualism,

96
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,730
even though they can’t see a solution to
the mind-body problem.

97
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,490
Some of those people adopt a view called epiphenomenalism.

98
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:44,729
This view says that physical states can give rise to mental states, but mental states can’t affect physical states.

99
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,189
So by this thinking, your beliefs, desires,
and temperaments do exist,

100
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,340
but they have no power over anything physical
about you.

101
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,520
Which might sound kind of weird and unconvincing.

102
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,600
But then there’s contemporary British philosopher Colin McGinn, who advocates a view called mysterianism.

103
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,060
This says that the question of consciousness
is unsolvable by human minds.

104
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,909
It’s not that McGinn thinks we’re dummies.

105
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:08,699
He thinks humans are natural knowers – just
give us a problem and we can figure it out.

106
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:09,699
But not this.

107
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,259
The reason, he says, is that our brains are
compartmentalized.

108
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,129
The way we understand our mind is through
reflection.

109
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:17,370
It’s deeply personal and subjective.

110
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,860
But the way we understand our brains and bodies
is objective, and verifiable.

111
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,889
And those two modes of understanding just
don’t mix.

112
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,499
No amount of reflection could lead to any
claims about neurons firing,

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,960
and no amount of empirical research is going to give rise to what it’s like to see color through someone else’s eyes.

114
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,440
Our brains just don’t have a compartment that can piece together those different modes of evidence.

115
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,320
The mind-body problem hasn’t been solved,
and physicalism hasn’t been proven, because

116
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,120
both of those things require our brains to
do something they can’t do.

117
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
So what do you think?

118
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,740
Is your mind a separate substance, riding
around in your body until it dies?

119
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,129
Can the complicated thing that is you – that
thinks and feels and desires and hurts – be

120
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,180
reduced to a purely physical thing?

121
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,420
Did Mary learn something new?
Is it possible to know?

122
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,719
Well that is up to your mind to figure out.

123
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:06,689
Today we talked about theories about where
the mind resides.

124
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:10,509
We learned about reductive physicalism, substance
dualism, and mysterianism.

125
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,889
And next time, we’re going to think about
these issues some more,

126
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,259
with the help of some of my favorite kinds
of potential persons – robots!
