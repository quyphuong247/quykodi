00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,210
For generations, just about everybody in the
United States got vaccinations.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,740
And I’m sure there will be no conversation
about this in the comments.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,740
And as a result, diseases like measles were
all but eradicated.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,610
But in 1998, a study published in a scientific
journal linked vaccines with autism.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,360
Even though that study was later discredited,
ever since then,

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,009
a small but vocal subset of parents have refused
to vaccinate their kids.

9
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:35,600
Now, measles are back, as is whooping cough, mumps, and other diseases that were nearly wiped out.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,320
Children’s lives are being endangered because
some parents are acting on beliefs that have

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,150
no scientific evidence to support them.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,320
So, why am I talking about this on Crash Course
Philosophy?

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,110
Normally, when we talk about responsibility,
we’re talking about things that you do.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,950
But in philosophy, we sometimes face other
obligations.

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,130
Some philosophers have argued that we all
have epistemic responsibility –

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,930
that is, responsibility we have regarding
our beliefs.

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,320
Epistemic responsibility is an especially
interesting area of philosophy

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,970
because it’s where many of its sub-disciplines
overlap –

19
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,790
where epistemology brushes up against philosophy
of religion, which bumps into ethics.

20
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,380
And philosophers might argue that we live in a world that could probably use a lot more epistemic responsibility –

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,100
or at least, more people who understand what
it is.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,999
Anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, conspiracy
theorists.

23
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:19,659
The world is full of people who hold beliefs
without any evidence.

24
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,329
And not only that, they – like most of us
– encourage others to share their beliefs.

25
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:28,719
But over the past 200 years or so, philosophers have developed some pretty compelling responses to this phenomenon.

26
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,889
A few thinkers have come up with useful ways
of thinking about the beliefs we have,

27
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:36,630
and the harm they can cause, and what responsibilities
go along with having them.

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,370
Meanwhile, others have argued that we can
sometimes hold beliefs without any proof.

29
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,980
Not about vaccines, or global warming, or
the moon landing – but about God.

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:54,300
[Theme Music]

31
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,520
W.K. Clifford lived in England in the mid-1800s, where the only vaccine that existed was for smallpox,

32
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:03,569
and even that earned its share of scorn and
ridicule at the time.

33
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,149
But Clifford, who was both a mathematician
and a philosopher,

34
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,809
would probably have some very strong opinions
about today’s anti-vaxxers.

35
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:13,769
Because Clifford was one of the leading proponents
of epistemic responsibility of his time.

36
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:16,120
He most famously, and bluntly, put it this
way:

37
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:21,340
“It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.”

38
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,560
And instead of using vaccinations as an example,
Clifford told the story of a ship owner.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,580
He said, suppose there was a guy who owned a ship that he knew was old and decrepit and hadn’t been inspected in a long time.

40
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,540
That ship was scheduled to make a transatlantic voyage, and the owner worried that it might not make it.

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,340
But, overhauling the ship would be pricey
and time-consuming.

42
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,099
In time, the owner talked himself into believing
that the ship was seaworthy.

43
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,790
The ship set sail. Then it sank.
And hundreds of people drowned.

44
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,900
But, the owner? He collected insurance money from his loss, and no one blamed him for the tragedy.

45
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,720
Now, most people would agree that the shipowner was responsible for the deaths of the ship’s passengers.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,800
But Clifford went even further.

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,460
He argued that the owner would have been guilty even if the ship managed to make the trip safely.

48
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,459
Because: He was guilty of accepting a belief
without sufficient evidence,

49
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,739
and whether that actually leads to harm or not, he has still done wrong, epistemically and morally.

50
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,000
Now, you might argue, “Don’t I have the right to believe whatever I want, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone?”

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,180
Yeah, good question. Clifford argued that
there’s no such thing as a private belief.

52
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,940
Because: We all talk about our beliefs – some of us do it a lot – and it causes our beliefs to spread.

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,360
But even if you never vocalize a belief, it still influences the way you act and the way others perceive you.

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,480
So in this way, a belief can spread subtly,
insidiously, without a word being spoken.

55
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,289
Think about other kinds of beliefs that lack
evidence, for example sexist beliefs.

56
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,969
Imagine a modern day sexist in an American
university.

57
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,589
Most of these people are gonna know that actually expressing their sexist views isn't going to fly.

58
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:51,499
But a sexist’s beliefs, even if they’re
never overtly stated,

59
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:54,579
tend to show through in the ways they interact
with women and speak of them.

60
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:59,559
So, no matter what: You know them and you know their views and you know their views subtly influence others,

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,139
particularly if they’re a person in position
of authority or respect.

62
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,999
Since our views always have the potential
to harm others, W. K. Clifford argued that

63
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:11,119
we have an epistemic responsibility only to
believe things for which we have evidence.

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,800
And if you don’t have evidence, you’re
morally obligated to refrain from the belief.

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,139
Basically, you should withhold judgment until
you investigate the situation.

66
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,720
Let’s head over to the Thought Bubble to
explore this more with some Flash Philosophy.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,880
It’s Tuesday, and your teacher tells you
that, this week, there will be a pop quiz.

68
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,960
And she’s nice enough to even define for
you what she means by this:

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
A pop quiz, she says, is a quiz that you can’t
know is coming in advance.

70
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,700
You reason, however, that such a quiz is impossible,
so you never study for it.

71
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,900
Here’s your reasoning:

72
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,720
The quiz can’t be on Friday, because if
Wednesday and Thursday go by with no quiz,

73
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,470
then you would know it was coming on Friday, since that would be the last possible day. So Friday’s out.

74
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,730
But that means it can’t be on Thursday either,
because

75
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,340
by the end of class on Wednesday, you would
know the quiz would be happening the next day.

76
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,560
But since it can’t be on Thursday or Friday, it also can’t be on Wednesday, because that’s the only day left –

77
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,360
so you would know in advance that it was coming.

78
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,640
Now, any amount of rationalization that will convince you that you don't have to study might sound pretty sweet.

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,890
But, in this case, you’re probably going
to regret it.

80
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,350
Because, after all, if your teacher tells you there’s going to be a quiz, chances are, there is going to be a quiz.

81
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,550
The fact that you’ve constructed a brilliant mind game that proves that it won’t, isn’t going to make that quiz not happen.

82
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,260
So, beliefs about vaccines and shipworthiness may be irresponsible because of the danger they pose to others,

83
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,360
but this case demonstrates that irresponsible
beliefs can be damaging to you, as well.

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,560
Thanks,Thought Bubble! Clifford made a pretty
convincing case for epistemic responsibility.

85
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,140
And it’s worth pointing out that his beef wasn’t only with ship owners or kids who didn’t study.

86
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,760
One thing his arguments were meant to show is that religious belief is epistemically irresponsible.

87
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,420
Belief in a God whose existence can’t be
proven was simply “blind faith,” he said.

88
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,500
And blind faith leads a person to ignore other facts and arguments, causing them to live an unexamined,

89
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,140
unthoughtful life that Clifford described
as “one long sin against mankind.”

90
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,880
Unsurprisingly, this idea was met with some counterarguments.

91
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,720
Let’s hear from one of his interlocutors:

92
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,810
19th century American philosopher and psychologist
William James took issue with

93
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,590
Clifford’s thesis that it is immoral to
believe something with insufficient evidence.

94
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,450
James acknowledged that one of his beliefs that was most important to him – his belief in God – lacked evidence.

95
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,040
So he set out to demonstrate that certain
beliefs can be held, morally,

96
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,600
even if there’s nothing you can really point
to, to back them up.

97
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,300
Now, James recognized that it would be ridiculous to say it’s ok to believe in just anything you wanted.

98
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,370
So he narrowed down his claim to argue that,
when you adopt a belief, you have options.

99
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,320
And the nature of those options can basically determine the moral defensibility of the beliefs you end up holding.

100
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,320
Specifically, he said that the options you face when choosing a belief could be either live or dead;

101
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,410
forced or unforced;
And momentous or trivial.

102
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,530
You face a live option when you’re considering a belief that you could actually see yourself having.

103
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,000
For instance, maybe you’ve never had a pumpkin
spice latte.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,240
But you love pumpkin, and you love lattes,
and you love spice,

105
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,420
so you hypothesize that you would enjoy a
pumpkin spice latte.

106
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,460
That’s a live option for you – because you can imagine yourself believing that you’d like a pumpkin spice latte.

107
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,590
On the other hand, you probably can’t even
entertain the possibility that you’d enjoy,

108
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,670
like, a dog food spice latte.

109
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,610
Try as you might, you just can’t imagine
accepting that option as an actual belief.

110
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,360
So, that’s a dead option to you.

111
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,960
Now, a forced option is one in which, whatever you do, you’ve made a choice. You can’t not choose.

112
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,020
‘Stay in or go out,’ is a good example
of a forced option.

113
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,050
You have to do one or the other; you can’t
wait and decide later.

114
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,000
Because, as you wait to decide, you’ve stayed
in and thus, you have made your choice.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,800
But unforced options are those where you can
just opt out of choosing.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,300
If I let you pick peanut butter or ham and cheese, you can always just decide to have neither.

117
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,200
So your choice is an unforced option.

118
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,140
A momentous option is one that, if you choose it, stands the chance of radically changing your life for the better.

119
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,080
Accepting an opportunity to go to the International
Space Station, for example, could be momentous.

120
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,170
But the option to have French fries with your
burger would be trivial –

121
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,420
eat them, don’t eat them, either way –
not gonna make a huge difference in your life.

122
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,620
Now, James said that, if you’re considering whether to believe something for which there’s not sufficient evidence,

123
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,320
it’s permissible to still believe it – so long as it’s a live, forced, and momentous option.

124
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,000
And religious belief just happens to fill
all of those criteria.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,040
First, James said, believing in God is a live option for himself and a whole lot of other people.

126
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,490
He also argued that religious belief is a
forced option.

127
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,150
That’s because he didn’t buy the idea
that agnosticism was really a thing.

128
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,070
He figured that withholding judgment is the same as not believing – so you either believe in God, or you don’t.

129
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,980
Finally, James thought religious belief is momentous – it has the possibility to greatly improve your life.

130
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,420
So, he concluded that we are justified in believing in God in the absence of evidence through faith alone.

131
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,420
The problem is, if we’re justified in believing
in God in the absence of evidence,

132
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,990
then we’re also justified in believing that
it’s ok not to vaccinate our kids.

133
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,219
Because that, too, is an option that can be
described as live, forced, and momentous.

134
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,659
So unfortunately, philosophy can’t just make all of the baseless beliefs in the world go away.

135
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,700
But it can help you argue against those ideas
intelligently.

136
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,310
Today we have learned about epistemic responsibility.

137
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,180
Clifford says it is always wrong to believe
without sufficient evidence,

138
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,880
but James says there are some exceptions – namely,
religious belief.

139
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
Next time we will consider whether we can
gamble our way to belief in God – stay tuned!
