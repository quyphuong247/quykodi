3
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:14,840
Over the centuries, the effort to craft a perfect, bullet-proof argument for the existence of God has taken many forms.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,840
There was the ontological argument of Anselm. There were the four cosmological arguments of Aquinas.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,880
And they still have their supporters. But
many modern philosophers feel that they’re

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,090
simply too flawed -- too inconsistent with our scientific understanding of the universe -- to be convincing today.

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,900
But there was a fifth argument posited by
Thomas Aquinas.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,739
And it was popularized several hundred years
after his time -- in the late 1700s, by the

9
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,670
English Christian philosopher William Paley.
And this argument for God’s existence is

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,940
still around today, too. In fact, it’s one
of the most popular.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,900
It’s known as the teleological argument.
You may know it as Intelligent Design.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:58,180
[Theme Music]

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,880
To make his case for the existence of God, William Paley gave us what’s known as an argument by analogy.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,800
This form of inductive argument invites us
to consider a particular state of affairs

15
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,969
-- let’s just call it Situation A -- about
which we’re already likely to have certain

16
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,890
beliefs, and then likens it to Situation B,
with which we are less familiar.

17
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,090
The idea is that, in the interest of consistency,
whatever conclusions we’ve drawn about A,

18
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,800
we ought to draw about B as well.

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,439
You can make an argument by analogy about
anything, but Paley used it to talk about

20
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,520
God, in what’s known as the Watchmaker Analogy.
He asked us to imagine what we’d think if

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,659
we found a watch on the ground. Would we imagine that the watch simply appeared randomly, spontaneously,

22
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,469
on its own? Or would we see the complexity
of it, and notice that its parts seem to come

23
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:42,670
together in a particular way in order to accomplish
a goal? If so, wouldn’t we think that the

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,340
watch must have been made by someone, on purpose?

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,780
Paley was arguing that the teleology demonstrated
by a watch would lead us to conclude that

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,760
it was designed by an intelligent creator
with a particular end in mind.

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,360
Teleological means goal-oriented, or purposeful.

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,960
And we can easily pick out the teleologies
of man-made objects. Got a mug here, as an

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,020
example -- it was created with a particular
teleology in mind. It was designed to hold

30
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,039
a liquid without leaking. It’s got a handle
put here deliberately, in such a way that

31
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,819
human fingers could easily fit into it. And
its composition is such that it’ll keep

32
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,790
the liquid inside warm without burning the
hand that holds it.

33
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,720
We wouldn’t assume that a coffee cup would
simply come to be, exhibiting such perfect

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,190
design for its particular function, without
someone having created it that way on purpose.

35
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,239
So, in the same way that the teleology of
a cup implies the existence of a cup maker,

36
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,560
and that of a watch implies the existence
of a watchmaker, Paley saw teleology in the

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,030
world, and assumed from that, God’s existence.

38
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,350
He continued his analogy by comparing a watch
to a living organism.

39
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,180
Look at the complexity of the human body.
Heart and lungs working together, producing

40
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,750
sweat to keep ourselves from overheating,
transforming food into energy – we’re

41
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,930
just generally amazing all around.Look at
how elements of the natural world operate

42
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,170
according to complex laws that sustain a beautiful,
natural harmony. Paley said this couldn't possibly just

43
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,510
have happened, any more than the design of a pocket watch could just have happened.

44
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,040
There must be a designer.

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,680
If you accept this analogy, then you agree
with Paley that, just like the purposefulness

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,370
of a watch compels us to believe in a watchmaker,
the purposefulness of the world compels us

47
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,700
to believe in a worldmaker – God.

48
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,900
And you might think this is a fantastic argument. It might even be what motivates your own belief in God.

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,180
There are lots of people who say things like sunsets and babies show them that there must be a designer-god.

50
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,120
But some of you probably aren’t buying it
– and you know what to do!

51
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,420
Arguments are refuted by counterarguments,
so when you want to refute an argument by

52
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,099
analogy, you offer a disanalogy. Basically,
you demonstrate that Situation A and Situation

53
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:34,099
B are dissimilar enough that the analogy doesn’t
actually work.

54
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,940
So, to object to Paley, we have to identify
a way in which elements of the natural world

55
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,200
– like human bodies – are relevantly dissimilar
to watches. When we’re talking about a watch,

56
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,189
an objector might say, it obviously had a
creator. After all, we can take it apart and

57
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:50,180
see clearly how the gears fit together to
move the hands and keep time. But there’s

58
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,150
so much in the natural world that isn’t
understandable in the same way. For instance,

59
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,040
why would God have designed our eyes to have
a blind spot?

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,239
Paley responded that it doesn’t matter whether
we can understand how something was created.

61
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,040
The point is simply that it was. He might
point out, for instance, that I actually don’t

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,340
understand the inner workings of my phone.
But I still know it had a creator.

63
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,620
Whether or not I can understand how it
was created is beside the point.

64
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:15,879
Next objection: Some parts of nature seem
to be without purpose. A blind spot obviously

65
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,579
doesn’t have any function, and neither do
nipples on a man.

66
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,920
Paley’s response here was: Just because we don't know there's a purpose doesn't mean there isn't one.

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,420
But this is a problem, too, because his whole
argument for believing in God is that you

68
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,830
should look at the world and see purpose.
So if we see some things in the world that

69
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,760
are working great, and really seem to have
complexity and a definite use, and others

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,710
that don’t, that’s a flaw in his argument.

71
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,010
What’s more, the absence of any obvious
purpose in things can lead people to start

72
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,330
searching for purposes, and effectively make
them up. For instance, I could find a purpose

73
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,450
for this finger – I could use it as a nose-picker.
It would make a good one – it’s just the

74
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,680
right size to really get in there and dig around.
But was my finger designed to pick noses?

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,900
Probably not. 20th century British philosopher
Bertrand Russell made fun of this

76
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,470
purpose-finding tendency, by pointing out
that you could look at a bunny and form the

77
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,680
belief that God gave it a fuzzy white tail
so hunters would have something to shoot at.

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,460
The point is: If we're the ones inventing
purposes, rather than recognizing ones that

79
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,900
are inherently there, then we’re the real
creators of purpose in the world, not God.

80
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,440
Basically, if you believe that God made eyes
for seeing, then you also have to believe

81
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,960
that he designed fingers as nose-pickers,
and rabbit tails as bullseyes, and blind spots

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,210
as ways for us to get into car accidents.
So the counterargument here is: We don't get

83
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,100
to just pick and choose, and say God designed the stuff we want him to have designed, and not the other stuff.

84
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,980
Rather than searching for disanalogies, another
way Paley’s argument has been countered

85
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,060
is with an alternative explanation for Condition
B. Paley says bodies are purposeful, and from

86
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,720
there concludes that the purpose had to have
been put there by an intelligent creator.

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,020
But another explanation for how bodies came
to have the complexity and functionality they

88
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,210
have today, is natural selection and random
mutation. We can concede that the existence

89
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,080
of a designer-god helped make sense of the
origins the our world in a pre-scientific age,

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,800
but now we have a perfectly good scientific explanation for how the complexity of the world came about.

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,200
So, who needs a watchmaker when you have evolution
by natural selection?

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,460
Another objection to Paley’s case came from
18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume,

93
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,630
who pointed out that, if we’re to take the
analogy seriously, we’d need to conclude

94
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,840
that the creator that Paley posits seems to
make a lot of mistakes.

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,330
And not just blind spots.
Like, how about hurricanes?

96
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,800
Or why would he make our bodies with certain
tissues -- like in the breast, or prostate,

97
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,970
or colon -- that are so incredibly prone to
cancer? Why would he make umbilical cords

98
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,010
that could wrap around a baby’s neck? Why
would he make butterflies have to wait for

99
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,710
hours, immobile, for their wings dry as soon
as they come out of their chrysalis, making

100
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,170
them easy prey for predators?

101
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,010
Hume pointed out that the world is chock full
of stuff that looks cruel, ridiculous, impractical,

102
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,110
and contrary to life. A flawed world, he said,
implies a flawed creator.

103
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,790
Now, the development of evolutionary biology
over the past couple hundred years has taken

104
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,810
a pretty heavy toll on the teleological argument.
But it still has many supporters, and their

105
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,190
method of defending their view is a good model for the way the Socratic method is supposed to work.

106
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,920
When your opponents raise objections to your
theory, you need to either reject it, or modify

107
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,720
it in a way that responds to those objections.
So, supporters of the teleological argument

108
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,040
set out to modify – and strengthen – their
view.

109
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,640
Here are a couple of modern responses:

110
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,510
Contemporary British philosopher Richard Swinburne
gives us a modern teleological argument with

111
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,940
a twist of probability. He says that, even
if there’s another possible explanation

112
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,890
for the universe, we should go with the explanation
that’s most likely to be true. And he says

113
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,830
that it’s simply more probable that God
designed the world, than that it came about

114
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,400
through the pure chance of evolutionary processes.

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,060
Likewise, another class of modern defenses
of the teleological argument are collectively

116
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,600
known as Fine-Tuning Arguments. These arguments
accept the Big Bang and evolution as scientific

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,480
truths, but they maintain that, for the evolution
of life to occur, it’s most likely that

118
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,320
God set up the precise conditions that it required,
rather than them coming about by accident.

119
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,980
After all, if Earth were just a little closer
to, or farther from, the sun…

120
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,460
If the composition of our atmosphere was slightly
different…

121
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,960
If the content of our oceans was something
other than what it is …

122
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,650
Life would have never taken root.

123
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,330
A lot of people think these modernized arguments
have more going for them than Paley’s did.

124
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,020
This is partly because these types of teleologists
have moved from making assertions about certainty

125
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,100
to making claims about probability, which
seem easier to get right and to defend.

126
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,420
Objectors will counter by saying that the
problem with these arguments is, you can’t

127
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,810
really make a probability claim when you only
have a sample set of one. If we had multiple

128
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,940
Earths that we could examine, we could see
how likely any particular adaptation is, or

129
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,850
how unique the conditions for life are. Then
we would know if it were likely or unlikely

130
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,530
to happen without God. But we can’t know
that -- at least not now -- because we can

131
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,480
only access this one world, where we know
that things evolved as they did. Thus, the

132
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,780
counterargument goes, Swinburne and other modern teleologists are right to recognize that if

133
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,980
things were slightly different, then life maybe wouldn’t have evolved or would have evolved very differently.

134
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,200
But that is wholly different from claiming that
it’s unlikely to have happened in the first place.

135
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,759
So, today you learned about the teleological
argument, objections to it, and responses

136
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,459
to those objections, and the responses to
the responses to the objections.

137
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,040
But we’ve spent an awful lot of time talking
about God’s existence, so next time,

138
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,200
let’s consider what god is like if it exists.
