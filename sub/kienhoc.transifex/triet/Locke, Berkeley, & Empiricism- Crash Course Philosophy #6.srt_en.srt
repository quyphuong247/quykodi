00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,870
By the time we’re done today, I just might
have you questioning whether this apple is

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,660
real or not. Think I can’t do it? Gimme
about ten minutes! I might have you wondering

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,750
whether I’m a physical object or not.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,860
And the same goes for all of this stuff, and your
computer, and Nick behind the camera! And … you!

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,520
How? By unleashing the power of empiricism.

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:37,300
[Theme Music]

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,179
Last time, we learned about 17th century philosopher
Rene Descartes, and how he upended the apple-basket

10
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,460
that was his entire personal belief system,
and descended into a radical skepticism, only

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,700
to emerge with his conviction that: Cogito
ergo sum – I think, therefore I am.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,280
This one idea -- the fact that he was thinking
-- or really, the fact that he was doubting

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,910
-- allowed him to build back up, one by one,
more beliefs that he thought he could rely on.

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,780
But in the end, most of the beliefs that Descartes
ended up putting back into his intellectual

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,750
apple-basket had to do with the immaterial
world.

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,090
Like, he decided that he could believe that
he existed, as a thinking thing.

17
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,870
And he believed that God existed.

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,140
Ultimately, he lit upon the idea that some
of our thoughts are clear and distinct in

19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,530
a way that somehow guarantees their truth.

20
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,950
But, a lot of philosophers disagreed. They
argued that thinking on its own wasn’t enough.

21
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,469
Like, just because you’re thinking, doesn’t
mean that your thoughts correspond to material

22
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:31,549
reality in any reliable way.

23
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,430
Basically, Descartes’ philosophical opponents
thought that the Cogito was a dead end.

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,130
So here, we start to see a split between two
different understandings of how we can most

25
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,390
reliably get to the nature of reality, and
therefore truth. Both were responses to the

26
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,910
constant questioning that is skepticism. On
the one hand, there was rationalism.

27
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,780
And on the other: empiricism

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,620
Descartes, like Plato long before him, was a lover of reason. He met skepticism with rationalism.

29
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,740
He believed that the most real things in life were ideas -- propositions that can be known through pure reason.

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,920
Deductive truths, which we talked about before,
fall into this category. And mathematical truths do, too.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,670
But by contrast, empiricism is based on the
principle that the most reliable source of

32
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,670
knowledge isn’t our ideas, or our reasoning,
but our senses.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,910
Sure, we can know things through deduction
and basic logic.

34
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,080
But what actually leads us to truth, or at
least gives us our best shot at getting there,

35
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,630
are things like induction, and the scientific method -- ways of thinking that tell us about the material world.

36
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,900
Probably the most famous split among philosophers
between these two camps was the life-long

37
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,230
debate between Plato and Aristotle.

38
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,840
Plato was convinced that Truth resided in
the immaterial world of Ideas, while Aristotle’s

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,860
attention was focused firmly on the ground.

40
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,170
But what about in Descartes’ day? If he
was the original prototype of the navel-gazing

41
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,120
philosopher -- a living example of rationalist
thinking — then his foil was was the 17th

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,410
century English thinker John Locke. This is
where he was born.

43
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,290
Locke believed that we’re all born as a
tabula rasa, or a blank slate.

44
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,070
He argued that all knowledge is
obtained through experience.

45
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,240
He rejected the concept of innate ideas -- the
view that we’re born pre-loaded with certain

46
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,440
information, like what’s good versus what’s
bad, or what is the nature of God.

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,960
Locke thought that we are born knowing nothing.

48
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,220
And instead, all of our knowledge comes
to us through sense data.

49
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,420
But one place where Locke agreed with Descartes
was in the idea that, just because your senses

50
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,440
tell you something, that doesn’t mean you
can trust it.

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,900
After all, sometimes your senses give you
false information, like when you think you

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
see or hear something that’s just not there.

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,000
Descartes’ response to this, of course,
was to just throw out all sense experience

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
as an unreliable source of knowledge.

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,700
But Locke didn’t go that far. Instead, in
order to figure out whether the senses accurately

56
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,120
reflect the outside world, he introduced a
distinction between what he called the primary

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
and secondary qualities of all things.

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,460
Primary qualities are qualities that physical
objects themselves have. They’re not in

59
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,010
our minds, Locke argued -- they’re actually
in the stuff. These primary qualities include

60
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,840
things like solidity -- the density, weight,
and mass of an object. And also extension

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,400
-- the height, depth, and width that a certain
thing has. He also included figure, or the

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,980
shape of an object, as well as mobility, which
is this – whether it’s stationary or in motion.

63
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,740
So primary qualities, Locke said, belong to
the thing itself.

64
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:14,000
Take this apple. It weighs maybe 150 grams,
is the size of my palm, roundish, but firm,

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,480
with the slightest bit of give, and right
now it’s moving through the air.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,060
Those are its primary qualities.

67
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,860
But it has secondary qualities, too.

68
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,620
And by Locke’s standards, they are not real.
At least not in any objective, agreed-upon way.

69
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,840
They’re just in our minds. But they
get there through the primary qualities.

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,770
I’m talking about things like its color, taste,
texture, smell, and sound.

71
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,469
The secondary qualities of this apple are
its redness, and how it tastes and smells

72
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:42,539
and feels on my tongue and hand. Even how
it sounds when I bite into it.

73
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:46,090
Locke believed that the distinction between
primary and secondary qualities explained

74
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,849
the disagreements that we all have about our
perceptions of the outside world.

75
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:54,039
Like, we could measure this apple in a bunch
of ways and all agree on its primary qualities,

76
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,319
but its secondary qualities would no doubt
lead to some disputes.

77
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,289
Like, is it really red? What kind of red exactly?
Cardinal red? Or carmine red? It’s kind

78
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:05,400
of dark purple at the top -- or is it just
like a dark pink?

79
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,880
What about the sound it made? Would I call that
crunchy? Or crispy? Or...bite-y? It’s like, apple sound.

80
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
We could argue about that kind of stuff til
the cows came home.

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,139
But if we disagree about its primary qualities
– one of us is simply wrong. Because primary

82
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,919
qualities have nothing to do with you, or me. Instead they have everything to do with the object itself.

83
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,330
Locke’s reasoning was simple, even elegant,
extracting a lot of explanatory power out

84
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,409
of very few basic concepts. As a result, it
resonated with a lot people.

85
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:36,729
And one person it resonated strongly with
was the Irish philosopher George Berkeley.

86
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,300
He was moved by Locke’s empiricism and took
it seriously -- so seriously, in fact, that

87
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,090
ended up using Locke’s own logic against
him.

88
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,560
He basically took empiricism to its logical
conclusion, dismantling the whole process

89
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,159
of perception to the point that he had to
wonder whether anything existed at all.

90
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:57,559
Berkeley began by taking apart the distinction that Locke made between primary and secondary qualities.

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,080
Like, think about this apple again. How do
you know its shape?

92
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,979
Locke said that the apple’s shape, as a
primary quality, is immediately perceivable.

93
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,259
But Berkeley pointed out that you don’t
perceive some qualities of an object, while

94
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:12,059
totally disregarding others. Like, you can’t
detect an apple’s shape without first --

95
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,620
or at least without also -- detecting its color.
When you think about it, you can’t detect

96
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:19,240
any of the primary qualities without also
considering the secondary ones.

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,999
You can’t see a colorless apple.
You can’t feel a textureless apple.

98
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:26,659
In fact, if you try to strip away the apple’s
secondary qualities in an effort to get at

99
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:29,529
the primary ones, you end up with no apple
at all.

100
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,349
Try it: Close your eyes and imagine an apple
made of only primary qualities -- so, it has

101
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:38,039
a certain shape and a certain size, but it
doesn’t have any color or texture or taste.

102
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:38,960
You can’t do it.

103
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,400
You try to imagine it with no color, but really,
you’re probably imagining one that’s either

104
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,469
black or white or transparent -- the color
of what’s behind it.

105
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:48,990
And if you try to imagine it as having no
texture, you’ll find there’s still a texture

106
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,529
there – it’s just smooth.

107
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:54,759
Remember: Locke asserted that secondary qualities
are not objectively real. They can only be

108
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,770
subjectively perceived. But now, Berkeley
has shown that the two are inextricably linked

109
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,870
– you can’t have one without the other.

110
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,419
Which means that primary qualities can’t
be real, either. They, too, are just what

111
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,090
your mind makes of things.

112
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,430
So this led Berkeley to a startling conclusion:
There’s just no such thing as matter.

113
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,850
There can’t be! Instead, there’s only
perceptions.

114
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,300
Berkeley’s famous assertion --
his version of cogito ergo sum --

115
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,999
was esse est percepi:
“to be is to be perceived.”

116
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:28,529
In his opinion, there are no objects, only
perceivers – and even then, the perceivers

117
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:34,150
themselves don’t really have any physical
form. They’re just disembodied minds perceiving

118
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,099
things that aren’t really there.

119
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:38,689
A little bit terrifying when you start thinking
about it.

120
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:42,659
In Berkeley’s scenario, we’re all set
adrift in a world of nothing but thought.

121
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:46,659
What’s scary about it is this, if everything’s
just perception, then when the perception

122
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,080
goes away, there can’t be anything left.

123
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,900
So like, please, for the love of Pete, do
not turn away from your computer! If you stop

124
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,150
perceiving me, I stop existing!

125
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,379
But, what if maybe you don’t care about
me? Still, you’d better not go to sleep,

126
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,620
because as soon as you do, you’ll cease
to exist! Because, you won’t be able to

127
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,650
perceive yourself! The only guarantee that
you’ll continue to exist in your sleep is

128
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,120
to have a friend watch you when you’re sleeping. Which probably is a non-starter, for a number of reasons.

129
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,800
But in any case, the second your
friend blinks, you’re gone!

130
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,069
So in the end, Berkeley believed there was
only one thing that kept us --

131
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,939
and everything else -- from disappearing into oblivion.

132
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:23,419
God.
Berkeley believed that God was the Ultimate Perceiver.

133
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,810
God is always watching, with unblinking perception that holds objects in existence even when we’re not paying attention.

134
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,710
The tough thing about Berkeley is, we all
pretty much think he has to be wrong.

135
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,500
Very few of us are willing to give up our belief in the physical world — no matter who’s watching.

136
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,860
We are sensory animals!
We really need this apple to exist.

137
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,140
Next time, we’re going to take a side journey
into the world of knowledge. And then, in

138
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,680
episode 8, we’ll see if Karl Popper can
manage to get the physical world back for us.

139
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,690
Today we have learned about empiricism as
a response to skepticism. We talked about

140
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,120
John Locke and his distinction between primary
and secondary qualities. And we’ve seen

141
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,370
why George Berkeley thinks that distinction
ultimately falls apart -- leaving us with

142
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,210
literally nothing but our minds, ideas, and
perceptions.
