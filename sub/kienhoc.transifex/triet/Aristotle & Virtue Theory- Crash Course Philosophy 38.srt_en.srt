1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,840
Imagine a person who always knows what to
say.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:15,440
Who can diffuse a tense situation, deliver tough news gracefully, is confident without being arrogant, brave but not reckless, generous but never extravagant.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,720
This is the type of person that everybody
wants to be around, and to be like.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,40
Someone who seems to have mastered the art
of being a person.

5
00:00:23,40 --> 00:00:28,520
This may sound like an impossible feat, but Aristotle believed that, while rare, these people do exist.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,900
And they are what we all should aspire to
be: virtuous.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,100
And there's a whole moral theory based on
this idea of virtue.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,600
But unlike most of the moral theories we’ve discussed, virtue theory doesn’t spend a lot of time telling you what to do.

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,130
There’s no categorical imperative or principle
of utility.

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,770
Instead, virtue theory is all about character.

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:58,820
Rather than saying, “follow these rules so that you can be a good person,” Aristotle and other virtue theorists reasoned that, if we can just focus on being good people, the right actions will follow, effortlessly.

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,760
Become a good person, and you will do good things.
No rulebook needed.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,879
So, why should you be a virtuous person?

14
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,880
Because: eudaimonia.

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:17,460
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:25,500
Virtue theory reflects the ancient assumption that humans have a fixed nature – an essence – and that the way we flourish is by adhering to that nature.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Aristotle described this in terms of what
he called proper functioning.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,200
Everything has a function, and a thing is good to the extent that it fulfills its function, and bad to the extent that it doesn’t.

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,260
This is easy to see in objects created by
humans.

20
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,149
A function of a knife is to cut, so a dull
knife is a bad knife.

21
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,430
And a function of a flower is to grow and reproduce, so a flower that doesn’t do that is just bad at being a flower.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:55,460
And the same goes for humans – we’re animals – so all the stuff that would indicate proper functioning for an animal holds true for us as well – we need to grow and be healthy and fertile.

23
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,899
But we’re also “the rational animal,” and a social animal, so our function also involves using reason and getting along with our pack.

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:09,280
Now you might notice that some of this sounds like parts of natural law theory – Aquinas' theory that God made us with the tools we need to know what’s Good.

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,940
Well, Aristotle had a strong influence on Thomas Aquinas, so part of Aristotle’s thoughts on virtue ended up in natural law theory.

26
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,429
But for Aristotle, this isn’t about God’s
plan, it’s just about nature.

27
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:26,890
Aristotle argued that nature has built into us the desire to be virtuous, in the same way that acorns are built with the drive to become oak trees.

28
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,790
But what exactly does it mean to be virtuous?

29
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:36,179
Aristotle said that having virtue just means doing the right thing, at the right time, in the right way, in the right amount, toward the right people.

30
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,660
Which sort of sounds like Aristotle is saying
exactly nothing.

31
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,820
I mean, how vague can you be?

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,400
But according to Aristotle, there's no need to be specific, because if you’re virtuous, you know what to do.

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,560
All the time.

34
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,430
You know how to handle yourself and how to
get along with others.

35
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,90
You have good judgment, you can read a room,
and you know what's right and when.

36
00:02:55,90 --> 00:03:01,430
Aristotle understood virtue as a set of robust character traits that, once developed, will lead to predictably good behavior.

37
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,630
You can think of virtue as the midpoint between
two extremes, which Aristotle called vices.

38
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,359
Virtue is the just-right amount – the sweet spot between the extreme of excess and the extreme of deficiency.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,280
And this sweet spot is known as the Golden
Mean.

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,440
So let’s take a look at some particular
virtues, starting with courage.

41
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,780
What is courage?

42
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,739
To take a closer look at this, let’s head
to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

43
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,140
Walking home from a movie, you see a person
being mugged.

44
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,660
What is the courageous action for you to take?

45
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:38,660
Your impulse might be to say that a courageous person would run over there and stop the mugging, because courage means putting yourself in harm's way for a good cause, right?

46
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,20
Well, no.

47
00:03:40,20 --> 00:03:45,460
A virtuous person – in the Aristotelian
sense – would first take stock of the situation.

48
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:51,780
If you size up the mugger and have a good reason to believe that you could safely intervene, then that's probably the courageous choice.

49
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:02,400
But if you assess the situation and recognize that intervention is likely to mean that both you and the victim will be in danger, the courageous choice is not to intervene, but to call for help instead.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,360
According to Aristotle, courage is the midpoint
between the extremes of cowardice and recklessness.

51
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,160
Cowardice is a deficiency of courage, while recklessness is an excess of courage – and both are bad.

52
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,440
Aristotle said that you definitely can have
too much of a good thing.

53
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,680
So, being courageous doesn’t mean rushing
headlong into danger.

54
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,320
A courageous person will assess the situation, they’ll know their own abilities, and they’ll take action that is right in the particular situation.

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Part of having courage, he argued, is being able to recognize when, rather than stepping in, you need to find an authority who can handle a situation that's too big for you to tackle alone.

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,800
Basically, courage is finding the right way
to act.

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,820
And a lot of the time – but not all of the time – that means doing a thing that you know you’re capable of, even if doing it scares the pants off of you.

58
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,000
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
Aristotle thought all virtue works like this.

60
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,438
The right action is always a midpoint between
extremes.

61
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,749
So, there’s no all-or-nothing in this theory
– even honesty.

62
00:04:56,749 --> 00:05:02,489
In this view, honesty is the perfect midpoint between brutal honesty and failing to say things that need to be said.

63
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,720
Like, no one needs to be told that they have
a big zit on their face – they already know.

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,160
The virtue of honesty means knowing what needs to be put out there, and what you should keep quiet about.

65
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,580
And it also means knowing how to deliver hard
truths gracefully.

66
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,60
How to break bad news gently, or to offer criticism in a way that’s constructive, rather than soul-crushing.

67
00:05:20,60 --> 00:05:22,480
The virtue of generosity works the same way.

68
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,979
It avoids the obvious vice of stinginess,
but also doesn’t give too much.

69
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,820
It’s not generous to give drugs to an addict, or to buy a round of drinks for everyone in the bar when you need that money for rent.

70
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,400
The just right amount of generosity means
giving when you have it, to those who need it.

71
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,659
It can mean having the disposition to give just for the heck of it, but it also means realizing when you can’t, or shouldn’t give.

72
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:48,180
So now you can see why Aristotle’s definition of virtue was totally vague – where that Golden Mean is depends on the situation.

73
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,980
But, if you have to figure out what virtue is in every situation, how can you possibly ever learn to be virtuous?

74
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,900
Aristotle thought there was a lot that you could learn from books, but how to be a good person was not one of them.

75
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,380
He said virtue is a skill, a way of living, and that’s something that can really only be learned through experience.

76
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,840
Virtue is a kind of knowledge that he called
practical wisdom.

77
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,780
You might think of it as kind of like street
smarts.

78
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,20
And the thing about street smarts is that
you gotta learn ‘em on the street.

79
00:06:13,30 --> 00:06:15,390
But the good news is, you don’t have to
do it alone.

80
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,849
Aristotle said your character is developed
through habituation.

81
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,330
If you do a virtuous thing over and over again,
eventually it will become part of your character.

82
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:29,229
But the way you know what the right thing to do is in the first place, is by finding someone who already knows, and emulating them.

83
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:38,390
These people who already possess virtue are moral exemplars, and according to this theory, we are built with the ability to recognize them, and the desire to emulate them.

84
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,281
So you learn virtue by watching it, and then
doing it.

85
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:47,580
In the beginning, it'll be hard, and maybe it’ll feel fake, because you’re just copying someone who's better than you at being a good person.

86
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,320
But over time, these actions will become an
ingrained part of your character.

87
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,640
And eventually, it becomes that robust trait
that Aristotle was talking about.

88
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,159
It'll just manifest every time you need it.

89
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,940
That's when you know you have virtue, fully
realized. It becomes effortless.

90
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,640
OK but: Why?
What's your motivation?

91
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,820
What if you have no desire to be the guy who always says the right thing, or the lady who always finds the courage when it's needed?

92
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,920
Virtue theory says that you should become virtuous because, if you are, then you can attain the pinnacle of humanity.

93
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,160
It allows you to achieve what's known as eudaimonia.

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,580
This is a cool Greek word that doesn’t have
a simple English translation.

95
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:26,979
You might say it means “a life well lived.”

96
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,810
It’s sometimes translated as “human flourishing.”

97
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,319
And a life of eudaimonia is a life of striving.

98
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,259
It’s a life of pushing yourself to your
limits, and finding success.

99
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:43,60
A eudaimonistic life will be full of the happiness that comes from achieving something really difficult, rather than just having it handed to you.

100
00:07:43,60 --> 00:07:49,800
But choosing to live a eudaimonistic life means that you’re never done improving, you’re never to a point where you can just coast.

101
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,220
You’re constantly setting new goals, and
working to develop new muscles.

102
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,480
Choosing to live life in this way also means
you'll face disappointments, and failures.

103
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,340
Eudaimonia doesn’t mean a life of cupcakes
and rainbows.

104
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,119
It means the sweet pleasure of sinking into
bed at the end of an absolutely exhausting day.

105
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,380
It’s the satisfaction of knowing you’ve accomplished a lot, and that you’ve pushed yourself to be the very best person you could be.

106
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,860
This is morality, for Aristotle.

107
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,720
It’s being the best you can personally be, honing your strengths while working on your weaknesses.

108
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,420
And, for Aristotle, the kind of person who lives like this, is the kind of person who will do good things.

109
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,440
Today we learned about virtue theory.

110
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,840
We studied the Golden Mean, and how it exists as a midpoint between vices of excess and deficiency.

111
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,220
We talked about moral exemplars, and the life
of eudaimonia that comes with virtuousness.

112
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,900
Next time, we’re going to consider a tricky
little problem in ethics known as moral luck.
