1
00:00:03,60 --> 00:00:08,900
Justice is one of those things that people talk about all the time, without really being specific about what they mean.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,360
Activists talk about economic justice.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,559
Police and lawyers talk about criminal justice.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,20
Parents, teachers, and students talk about justice a lot, too, though they may never use that word.

5
00:00:18,20 --> 00:00:24,259
When there’s a fight on the playground, or you get a grade you think you don’t deserve, we find ourselves talking about what’s fair.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,960
And that is talking about justice.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,570
And we think we know what it is, but we probably
don’t – or at least, we don’t agree.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,560
Is justice about equality? Fairness? Getting
what we deserve? Or getting what we need?

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,620
Sometimes we talk about balancing the scales
of justice.

10
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,998
This goes back to an ancient Greek understanding
of justice as harmony.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,760
In this view, a just society is one in which everyone fulfills their roles, so that society runs smoothly.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,860
In that case, violating your place in the social order – even if it’s a place you don’t want to hold – is considered unjust.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:03,260
Other times, justice has been understood in a more utilitarian way, where a just society is one that tries to increase the overall quality of life for its citizens.

14
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,820
And for a political libertarian, a just society is simply one that allows its citizens to be maximally free.

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,820
So which is it?

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,460
Is justice buying a meal for someone in need?

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,369
Is it sending a criminal to jail?

18
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,560
Is it doling out rewards and punishments based
on merit?

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,900
The reason people talk about justice all the time is that it’s one of the most fundamental social, ethical, and moral principles we deal with every day.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,260
And in the end, what justice means to you personally, pretty much defines how you think society should work.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:42,680
[Theme Music]

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,920
You might have already noticed this, but when people talk about justice, a lot of the time, they’re really talking about stuff.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,500
Like, who has more stuff – whether that’s money, food, or access to services like healthcare and sanitation.

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,20
Who gets to decide who gets what?
And on what basis?

25
00:01:58,20 --> 00:02:05,600
The area of moral philosophy that considers these questions is known as distributive justice, and there are many different schools of thought here.

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,500
For example, some people believe that everyone should get the same kind and amount of stuff, no matter what.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
This concept is known as justice as equality.

28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,90
It sounds totally fair.

29
00:02:16,90 --> 00:02:19,340
But, is everyone getting the same stuff really
justice?

30
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,140
Because I need – or want – different kinds
and amounts of stuff than you do.

31
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,779
So, there’s also the idea of need-based
justice.

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,620
This says everyone shouldn’t get the same,
because our needs aren’t the same.

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,640
By this logic, justice is getting based on
what we need.

34
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,500
So those who need more, get more.

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:43,800
And some say that this makes sense, while others argue that it amounts to favoring some people over others, putting those who happen to not be in need, at a disadvantage.

36
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:53,540
And if that’s how you look at things, then you probably espouse some kind of merit-based justice, which says that justice actually means giving unequally, based on what each person deserves.

37
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,620
And you deserve stuff – or don’t – based
on what you’ve done.

38
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,880
So this view rewards hard work and punishes
trouble-makers.

39
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,760
Finally, there’s the very simple-sounding approach advanced by twentieth century American political philosopher John Rawls.

40
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,600
He argued that justice is fairness.

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,940
Any inequalities that exist in a social system, Rawls said, should favor the least well-off, because this levels the playing field of society.

42
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:24,980
This is a form of need-based justice that focuses specifically on making sure that everyone is actually in a position to achieve their basic needs.

43
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,480
Rawls reasoned that the world is full of natural
inequalities.

44
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,660
Think of all the things we talked about when
we discussed moral luck;

45
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,820
a lot of factors that will shape your life
are totally out of your control.

46
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,560
So Rawls’ sense of justice means correcting for those disadvantages that are beyond our control.

47
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Once again, there are some who argue that justice-is-fairness is actually unfair to those who have gotten the most – either through hard work, or because they happened to win life’s natural lottery.

48
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:55,99
20th century American philosopher Robert Nozick
disagreed with Rawls’ idea that justice-is-fairness.

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,739
And to demonstrate why, he posed this thought experiment, about professional basketball, which we will explore in the Thought Bubble with some Flash Philosophy.

50
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,420
Wilt Chamberlain was a wildly popular basketball
player when Nozick created this example.

51
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:14,920
So Nozick said: What if Chamberlain – probably the most famous athlete of his day – decided that he’d play only under certain conditions?

52
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,579
Suppose that Chamberlain decides that tickets for games he plays in should cost 25 cents more than games he doesn’t play in.

53
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,979
And what’s more, Chamberlain will be paid
$100,000 more than the other players.

54
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:33,000
Now, Chamberlain is really popular, so everyone knows that more people will show up to see a game he’s playing in, even if the tickets cost more.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,320
Since he is the draw, isn’t he entitled
to ask for more money than his teammates?

56
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,120
Nozick argued that we can’t – and shouldn’t –
try to even out the naturally uneven playing field here.

57
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,920
Sure, we start out with unequal amounts of
stuff.

58
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,400
But Nozick said, we’re each entitled to the stuff we have, provided we didn’t steal it or otherwise obtain it unjustly.

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,840
So, if you’re the world’s most famous basketball player, you are entitled to have, and want, more stuff, even if others don’t have it.

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,99
If Chamberlain’s awesomeness at basketball lets him amass a bunch of wealth, while other people go hungry, well, that’s not Wilt’s fault.

61
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,240
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

62
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,360
As you can see, there is a lot of disagreement
about what it means to distribute justly.

63
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,920
And this is an incredibly important topic, because a lot of what we argue about politically has to do exactly this with issue.

64
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:27,320
People who believe there are essential human rights, for example, argue that we’re simply entitled to have our most basic needs fulfilled –

65
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,80
things like having enough to eat, and being
able to go to the doctors when we’re sick.

66
00:05:31,80 --> 00:05:35,539
But not everyone believes it’s the government’s job to provide us with those things, if we’re not able to get them ourselves.

67
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,120
Those people might argue that your rights
are negative.

68
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,900
A negative right is the right not to be interfered with, not to be stopped from pursuing the things you need.

69
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,380
So in this view, I can’t prevent you from trying to fulfill your needs, but I don’t have to help you to fulfill them, either.

70
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,000
By contrast, you might believe in positive
rights.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,740
If you have a positive right to something, you are entitled to help in getting it, if you can’t get it yourself.

72
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,620
So, if you can’t afford a doctor, you have
a right to get assistance in affording one.

73
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,241
But notice that in this view, a right implies
an obligation.

74
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:12,741
Your rights – in this case, your right to see a doctor, even if you can’t afford one – might make obligatory demands on me, because I might end up helping to pay for it.

75
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:16,900
Of course, someone like Nozick would ask,
where would such a right come from?

76
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,49
How could I incur an obligation to help you,
just because I’m better off than you are?

77
00:06:22,50 --> 00:06:27,720
Sure, it might be nice if I helped, but it’s certainly not a duty, and no one should compel me to do it.

78
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,540
But that’s exactly what the government does when it takes taxes from those who have more in order to assist those who have less.

79
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:39,780
So you see what I mean: when people talk about taxes, and healthcare, and income inequality, they’re really talking about justice.

80
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,219
But of course, a lot of the time, justice
isn’t at all about stuff.

81
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:45,89
It’s also about punishment.

82
00:06:45,89 --> 00:06:50,389
Like most subjects, philosophers disagree about the most appropriate way to respond to wrongdoing.

83
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,89
One concept is known as retributive justice.

84
00:06:53,89 --> 00:06:59,820
This holds that the only way for justice to be satisfied is for a wrongdoer to suffer in proportion to the way he’s made others suffer.

85
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,99
This is your good old fashioned, Biblical,
eye-for-an-eye justice.

86
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,380
And in this view, punishment is supposed to hurt;
that’s the only way to “make things right.”

87
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,980
Historically, this would mean things like, if you cause physical harm to someone, your punisher must do the same thing to you.

88
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:21,360
Today, though, in the interest of being civilized, we tend to mete out the pain in terms of incarceration and fines, rather than straight-up tit-for-tat.

89
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,640
But still, just retribution is one of the driving
philosophical forces behind capital punishment;

90
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,000
the idea that there’s simply no way to right the wrong of taking a life, other than by taking the life of the life-taker.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,900
But utilitarians have other theories of punishment.

92
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:42,419
Rather than making wrongdoers suffer for suffering’s sake, these thinkers favor what’s known as welfare maximization.

93
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,880
In this view, there’s no good to be found
in vindictively causing pain to wrongdoers.

94
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,580
But some form of punishment is still in order.

95
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,539
So one option is rehabilitation.

96
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,240
Here, the approach is to give wrongdoers help, so they can learn how to get along in society and follow its rules.

97
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,420
The focus is often on education and, if needed,
therapy.

98
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:11,60
This is sometimes criticized as being paternalistic, because it carries with it the assumption that wrongdoers are in need of our help, that they don’t know any better, and that they need to be “cured” of some social disease.

99
00:08:11,60 --> 00:08:14,280
But another approach to just punishment is
deterrence.

100
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:22,280
For eons, people have assumed that punishment prevents a wrongdoer from committing further crimes, while also discouraging others from breaking the rules.

101
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,440
So, rather than making a wrongdoer suffer for what they’ve done, supporters of deterrence see punishment as being for the good of society as a whole.

102
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,960
Sometimes, we punish people to send a message
to other people.

103
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,560
One more approach to just punishment is the
concept of restorative justice.

104
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,159
Here, you must right your wrongs.

105
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,819
The focus is on making amends, rather than
making the wrongdoer suffer.

106
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,920
So if you make a mess, you have to clean it
up.

107
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,439
And if you hurt someone, you need to take
steps to try and make it right.

108
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,240
This is the logic behind assigning community
service to offenders.

109
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,540
The hope here is that the right approach to wrongdoing will lead to healing and growth, both for the wrongdoer and for the wronged.

110
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,980
It’s about restoration and forgiveness – basically
the polar opposite of the retributive approach.

111
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,260
So, take this advice: Give some thought to
your own views on these topics.

112
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:14,600
Because what you see as the right answer should shape the way you vote, how you spend your money, and the way you punish your kids.

113
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,760
You might discover that, upon reflection, you should change the way you’re doing some things.

114
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,920
Like I said, everyone talks about justice, but before you can, you really have to decide what it means.

115
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,900
Today we talked about various theories of
justice.

116
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,420
We talked about just distribution, and we
also considered different approaches to punishment.

117
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,939
Next time, we’ll talk about discrimination.

118
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,500
