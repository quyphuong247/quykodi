00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,939
Hi, my name’s John Green, this is Crash Course:
World History, and today we’re gonna talk about Africa.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,820
Mr. Green Mr. Green! We’ve already talked
about Africa. Egypt is in Africa, and you

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,509
haven’t shut up about it the entire course
-

4
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:13,410
Yeah that’s true, Me from the Past. But
Africa’s big - it’s like, super big - much

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,560
bigger than it appears on most maps, actually.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,589
I mean, you can fit India and China, and the
United States if you fold in Maine. All of

7
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:25,190
that fits in Africa! Like any huge place,
Africa is incredibly diverse, and it's a mistake

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,630
to focus just on Egypt. So today let’s go
here, south of the Sahara desert.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:38,500
[theme music]

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,740
First, let’s turn to written records. Oh, right.
We don’t have very many, at least not written

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,800
by Sub-Saharan Africans. Much of African history
was preserved via oral rather than written tradition.

12
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,488
These days, we tend to think of writing as
the most accurate and reliable form of description,

13
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:53,890
but then again, we do live in a print-based
culture. And we’ve already said that writing

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,410
is one of the markers of civilization, implying
that people who don’t use writing aren’t

15
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:01,218
civilized, a prejudice that has been applied
over and over again to Africa. But:

16
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,670
1. If you need any evidence that it’s possible
to produce amazing literary artifacts without

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,430
the benefits of writing, let me direct your
attention to the Iliad and the Odyssey, which

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,760
were composed and memorized by poets for centuries
before anyone ever wrote them down. And,

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,670
2. No less an authority than Plato said that
writing destroys human memory by alleviating

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,920
the need to remember anything.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,840
And 3. You think the oral tradition is uncivilized
but here you are listening to me talk!

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,228
But we do have a lot of interesting records
for some African histories, including the

23
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:30,789
legendary tale of Mansa Musa. By legendary
I mean some of it probably isn’t true, but

24
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,000
it sure is important. Let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,489
So there was this king Mansa Musa, who ruled
the west African empire of Mali, and in 1324-ish,

26
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:41,489
he left his home and made the hajj, the pilgrimage
to Mecca.

27
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:46,199
He brought with him an entourage of over 1000
people (some sources say 60,000) and, most

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,590
importantly, 100 camel loads of gold. I wish
it had been donkeys so I could say he had

29
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,909
100 assloads of gold, but no. Camels.

30
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,109
Right, so along the way Mansa Musa spent freely
and gave away lots of his riches. Most famously,

31
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:03,019
when he reached Alexandria, at the time one
of the most cultured cities in the world, he

32
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:08,699
spent so much gold that he caused runaway inflation
throughout the city that took years to recover from.

33
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,638
He built houses in Cairo and in Mecca to house
his attendants, and as he traveled through

34
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,739
the world, a lot of people - notably the merchants
of Venice - no, Thought Bubble, like actual

35
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:22,558
merchants of Venice - right - they saw him
in Alexandria and returned to Italy with tales

36
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:27,479
of Mansa Musa’s ridiculous wealth, which
helped create the myth in the minds of Europeans

37
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,539
that West Africa was a land of gold, an El
Dorado. The kind of place you’d like to

38
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:38,248
visit. And maybe, you know, in five centuries
or so, begin to pillage. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

39
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:41,090
So what’s so important about the story of
Mansa Musa? Well, first, it tells us there

40
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,680
were African kingdoms, ruled by fabulously
wealthy African kings. Which undermines one

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,790
of the many stereotypes about Africa, that
its people were poor and lived in tribes ruled

42
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:54,099
by chiefs and witch doctors. Also, since Mansa
Musa was making the hajj, we know that he was:

43
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,138
A. Muslim, and
B. relatively devout.

44
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,319
And this tells us that Africa, at least western
Africa, was much more connected to the parts

45
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,369
of the world we’ve been talking about than
we generally are led to believe. Mansa Musa

46
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,558
knew all about the places he was going before
he got there, and after his visits, the rest

47
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:13,378
of the Mediterranean world was sure interested
in finding out more about his homeland.

48
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:17,198
Mansa Musa’s pilgrimage also brings up a
lot of questions about west Africa, namely,

49
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,379
what did his kingdom look like and how did
he come to convert to Islam? The first question

50
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:23,128
is a little easier, so we’ll start with
that one.

51
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:28,149
The empire of Mali, which Mansa Musa ruled
until the extremely elite year of 1337, was

52
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,289
a large swath of West Africa, running from
the coast hundreds of miles into the interior,

53
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:37,438
and including many significant cities, the
largest and best-known of which was Timbuktu.

54
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,088
The story of the Islamization of the Empire,
however, is a bit more complicated. Okay,

55
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:45,019
so pastoral North Africans called Berbers
had long traded with West Africans, with the

56
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:49,849
Berbers offering salt in exchange for West
African gold. That may seem like a bad deal

57
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:54,548
until you consider that without salt, we die,
whereas without gold, we only have to face

58
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,489
the universe’s depraved indifference to
us without the benefit of metallic adornment.

59
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,709
That went to an ominous place quickly.

60
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:04,688
Right, so anyway the Berbers were early converts
to Islam, and Islam spread along those pre-existing

61
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:06,598
trade routes between North and West Africa.

62
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:09,718
Right, so the first converts in Mali were
traders, who benefited from having a religious

63
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:13,209
as well as commercial connection to their
trading partners in the North and the rest

64
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,098
of the Mediterranean. And then the kings followed
the traders, maybe because sharing the religion

65
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:21,060
of more established kingdoms in the north
and east would give them prestige, not to

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,519
mention access to scholars and administrators
who could help them cement their power.

67
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,899
So Islam became the religion of the elites
in West Africa, which meant that the Muslim

68
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:33,989
kings were trying to extend their power over
largely non-Muslim populations which worshipped

69
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,269
traditional African gods and spirits. In order
not to seem too foreign, these African Muslim

70
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:42,698
kings would often blend traditional religion
with Islam - for instance, giving women more

71
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,020
equality than was seen in Islam’s birthplace.

72
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,769
Anyway, the first kings we have a record of
adopting Islam were from Ghana, which was

73
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:52,519
the first “empire” in western Africa.
It really took off in the 11th century. As

74
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,799
with all empires, and also everything else,
Ghana rose and then fell, and it was replaced

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,329
by Mali. The kings of Mali - especially Mansa
Musa, but also Mansa Suleyman, his successor

76
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,758
- tried to increase the knowledge and practice
of Islam in their territory. So for example,

77
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,959
when Mansa Musa returned from his hajj, he
brought back scholars and architects to build mosques.

78
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,370
And the reason we know a lot about Mali is
because it was visited by Ibn Battuta, the

79
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,629
Moroccan cleric and scholar who kind of had
the best life ever. He was particularly fascinated

80
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:23,449
by gender roles in the Malian empire - and
by Malian women - writing, “They are extremely

81
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:31,098
beautiful, and more important than the men.”
Oh. It must be time for the open letter.

82
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:35,810
An Open Letter to Ibn Battuta: I wonder what’s
in the Secret Compartment today. Oh. I appears

83
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:41,480
to be some kind of fake beard... Movie magic!
Stan, why did you do this to me?

84
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
Dear Ibn Battuta,

85
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,620
Bro, I love twitter and my x-box and Hawaiian
pizza, but if I had to go into the past and

86
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,218
live anyone’s life, it would be yours! Because
you were this outlandishly learned scholar

87
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:57,668
who managed to parlay your knowledge of Islam
into the greatest road trip in history.

88
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:02,068
You went from Mali to Constantinople to India
to Russia to Indonesia; you were probably

89
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:06,539
the most well-traveled person before the invention
of the steam engine. And everywhere you went,

90
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:10,259
you were treated like a king and then you
went home and wrote a really famous book called

91
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,370
the Rihla, which people still read today and
also, you could grow a real beard and I'M

92
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,730
JEALOUS!

93
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,060
Best wishes, John Green

94
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,120
One more thing about Mansa Musa: There are
lots of stories that Mansa Musa attempted

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,160
to engage in maritime trade across the Atlantic
Ocean, and some historians even believe that Malians

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,780
reached the Americas. DNA investigation may one 
day prove it, but until then, we’ll only have oral tradition.

97
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,299
The Malian Empire eventually fell to Songhai,
which was itself eventually overthrown for

98
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,668
being insufficiently Islamic, all of which
is to say that - like China or India or Europe

99
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:43,448
- West Africa had its own empires that relied
upon religion and war and incredibly boring

100
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,889
dynastic politics. Man, I hate dynastic politics.

101
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,370
If I wanted to live in an ostensibly independent
country that can’t let go of monarchy, I’d

102
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,509
be like Thought Bubble and move to Canada.
Oh, come on, Thought Bubble, that’s not

103
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,169
fair. Shut up and take back Celine Dion!

104
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:57,560
All right, now let’s move to the other side
of Africa where there was an alternative model

105
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,028
of “civilizational” development. The eastern
coast of Africa saw the rise of what historians

106
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:04,959
called Swahili civilization, which was not
an empire or a kingdom but a collection of

107
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,560
city states - like Zanzibar and Mombasa and
Mogadishu - all of which formed a network

108
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,019
of trade ports. There was no central authority
– each of these cities was autonomously

109
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,748
ruled, usually, but not always, by a king.
But there were three things that linked these

110
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:20,960
city states such that we can consider them
a common culture: language, trade and religion.

111
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,418
The Swahili language is part of a language
group called Bantu, and its original speakers

112
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,908
were from West Africa. Their migration to
East Africa changed not only the linguistic

113
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:32,839
traditions of Africa, but everything else,
because they brought with them ironwork and

114
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,938
agriculture. Until then, most of the people
living in the East had been hunter-gatherers

115
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,479
or herders, but once introduced, agriculture
took hold, as it almost always does. Unless,

116
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,829
wait for it, you’re the Mongols.

117
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,728
Modern day Swahili, by the way, is still a
Bantu-based language, although it’s been

118
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:52,800
heavily influenced by Arabic. On that topic,
for a long time historians believed that the

119
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,949
East African cities were all started by Arab
or Persian traders, which was basically just

120
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,639
racist - they didn’t believe that Africans
were sophisticated enough to found these great

121
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,939
cities. Now scholars recognize that all the
major Swahili cities were founded well before

122
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,499
Islam arrived in the region and that, in fact,
trade had been going on since the first century CE.

123
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,300
But Swahili civilization didn’t begin its
rapid development until the 8th century, when

124
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,430
Arab traders arrived, seeking goods that they
could trade in the vast Indian Ocean network,

125
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,870
the Silk Road of the sea. And of course those
merchants brought Islam with them, which,

126
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,819
just like in West Africa, was adopted by the
elites who wanted religious as well as commercial

127
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,620
connections to the rest of the Mediterranean
world.

128
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,599
In many of the Swahili states, these Muslim
communities started out quite small, but at

129
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,320
their height, between the 13th and 16th century,
most of the cities boasted large mosques.

130
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,430
The one in Kilwa even impressed Ibn Battuta,
who of course visited the city, because he

131
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,418
was having the best life ever.

132
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:47,208
Most of the goods exported were raw materials,
like ivory and animal hides and timber - it’s

133
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:51,059
worth noting, by the way, that when you’re
moving trees around, you have a level of sophistication

134
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,109
to your trade that goes way beyond the Silk
Road. I mean, if you’ll recall they weren’t

135
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,850
just trading, like, tortoise shells and stuff
- not again!

136
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,240
Africans also exported slaves along the east
coast, although not in HUGE numbers, and they

137
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,860
exported gold, and they imported finished
luxury goods like porcelain and books. In

138
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,240
fact, archaeological digs in Kilwa have revealed
that houses often featured a kind of built-in bookshelf.

139
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,490
Learning of books through architecture nicely
captures the magic of studying history. Archaeology,

140
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,759
writing, and oral tradition all intermingle
to give us glimpses of the past. And each

141
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,679
of those lenses may show us the past as if
through some fun house mirror, but if we’re

142
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,799
conscious about it, we can at least recognize
the distortions.

143
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,259
Studying Africa reminds us that we need to
look at lots of sources, and lots of kinds

144
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:36,490
of sources if we want to get a fuller picture
of the past. If we relied on only written

145
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,909
sources, it would be far too easy to fall
into the old trap of seeing Africa as backwards

146
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:45,120
and uncivilized. Through approaching it with
multiple lenses, we discover a complicated,

147
