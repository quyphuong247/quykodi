00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,620
Hi there, I’m John Green, this is Crash
Course: World History and today we’re going

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,740
to talk about Islam, which like Christianity
and Judaism grew up on the east coast of the

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,408
Mediterranean but unlike Christianity and
Judaism is not terribly well understood in

4
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:17,399
the West. For instance, you probably know
what this is and what this is, you probably

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,109
don’t know what that is. Google it.

6
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:23,759
Mr. Green Mr. Green why do you think people
know so little about Islamic history?

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,450
Did you just ask an interesting non-annoying
question, me from the past? I think we don’t

8
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:32,019
know about early Islamic history because we
don’t learn about it, me from the past,

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,780
because we don’t learn about it, because
we’re taught that our history is the story

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:41,539
of Christianity in Europe, when in fact our
history is the story of people on the planet,

11
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,299
so let’s try to learn something today.

12
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:51,859
[theme music]

13
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:56,960
So in less than 200 years Islam went from
not existing to being the religious and political

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,639
organizing principal of one of the largest
empires in the world.

15
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:05,100
And that story begins in the 7th century CE
when the angel Gabriel appeared to Muhammad,

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,839
a 40-ish guy who made his living as a caravan
trader and told him to begin reciting the word of God.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,540
Initially, this freaked Muhammad out, as,
you know, it would—but then his wife and

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,800
a couple of other people encouraged him and
slowly he came to accept the mantle as prophet.

19
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,289
A few things to know about the world Islam
entered: First, Muhammad’s society was intensely

20
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,820
tribal. He was a member of the Quraysh tribe,
living in Mecca and tribal ties were extremely important.

21
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:33,089
Also, at the time, the Arabian peninsula was
like this crazy religious melting pot. Like

22
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,370
most tribal Arabs worshipped gods very similar to the
Mesopotamian gods you’ll remember from episode 3.

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,000
And by the time of Muhammad, cult statutes
of many of those gods had been collected in

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,040
his hometown of Mecca in this temple-like
structure called the Kaaba.

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,690
But Arabia was also a home for monotheisms
like Christianity and Judaism, even a bit

26
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:55,840
of Zoroastrianism. So the message that there
was only god wouldn’t have been like as

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,000
surprising to Muhammad as it was, for instance,
to Abraham.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,530
Also, and this will become very important,
the northern part of Arabia was sandwiched

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,030
between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian
Sassanian Empire—and you’ll remember,

30
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,080
those guys were always fighting. They were
like snowboarders and skiers, or like the

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,969
Westboro Baptist Church and everyone else.

32
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:19,629
At its core, Islam is what we call a radical
reforming religion—just like Jesus and Moses

33
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:25,049
sought to restore Abrahamic monotheism after
what they perceived as straying, so too did Muhammad.

34
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,200
Muslims believe that God sent Muhammad as
the final prophet to bring people back to

35
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:36,099
the one true religion, which involves the worship of,
and submission to, a single and all-powerful God.

36
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:40,229
The Quran also acknowledges Abraham and Moses
and Jesus among others as prophets, but it’s

37
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:42,359
very different from the Hebrew and Christian
bibles:

38
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,300
For one thing it’s much less narrative,
but also its

39
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,110
the written record of the revelations Muhammad
received—which means its not written from

40
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,209
the point of view of people, it is seen as
the actual word of God.

41
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:55,640
The Quran is a really broad-ranging text,
but it returns again and again to a couple

42
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,029
themes. One is strict monotheism and the other
is the importance of taking care of those

43
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,020
less fortunate than you. The Quran, says of
the good person

44
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,610
spends his substance—however much he himself
may cherish it—upon his near of kin, and

45
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,560
the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer,
and the beggars, and for the freeing of human

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,990
beings from bondage.

47
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,790
These revelations also radically increased
the rights of women and orphans, which was

48
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:22,590
one of the reasons why Mohammad’s tribal
leaders weren’t that psyched about them.

49
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,200
To talk more about Islamic faith and practice,
let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

50
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,769
The five pillars of Islam are the basic acts
considered obligatory, at least by Sunni Muslims.

51
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,439
First is the shahada or the profession of
the faith:

52
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,300
There is no god but god and Muhammad is God’s
prophet, which is sometimes translated as

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,790
“There is no god but Allah and Muhammad
is Allah’s prophet”, which tries to make

54
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:44,769
Muslims sound other and ignores the fact that
the Arabic word for god—whether you are

55
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,280
Christian or Jewish or Muslim—is Allah.

56
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,669
Second, salat, or ritual prayer five times
a day—at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset,

57
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,309
and late evening—which are obligatory unless
you haven’t hit puberty, are too sick, or

58
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,930
are menstruating. Keep it PG, Thought Bubble.

59
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,989
Third, sawm, the month-long fast during the
month of Ramadan, in which Muslims do not

60
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,239
eat or drink or smoke cigarettes during daylight
hours.

61
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,759
Since Ramadan is a lunar-calendar month, it
moves around the seasons, and obviously it’s

62
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,779
most fun during the winter, when days are
shorter, and least fun during the summer,

63
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,099
when days are both long and hot.

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,600
Fourth is zakat, or almsgiving, in which non-poor
Muslims are required to give a percentage

65
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,470
of their income to the poor,

66
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,680
and lastly hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that
Muslims must try to fulfill at least once

67
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,660
in their lives, provided they are healthy
and have enough money.

68
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,030
And there’s also more to understanding Islam
than just knowing the Quran. Like Judaism

69
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:41,979
with its Talmud, and Christianity with its
lives of saints and writings of Church fathers,

70
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,889
Islam has supplementary sacred texts, chief
among which is the hadith, a collection of

71
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,230
sayings and stories about the Prophet.

72
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,670
Thanks Thought Bubble. Oh, it’s time for
the open letter?

73
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,560
Magic.

74
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,459
An Open Letter to the 72 Virgins. Oh, but
first let’s check what’s in the Secret

75
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,519
Compartment. Huh, it’s Andre the Giant.
Did you know that Andre the Giant died a virgin-

76
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,839
is a fact that I made up?

77
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,099
Dear 72 Virgins,

78
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,400
Hey there, it’s me, John Green. Did you
know that not all hadiths were created equal?

79
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,319
Some sayings of the Prophet are really well
sourced. like for instance, a good friend

80
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:20,668
or a relative heard the Prophet say something
and then it ended up as a hadith.

81
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:23,409
But some hadiths are terribly sourced like,
not to be irreverent, but some of it is like

82
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:29,270
middle school gossip; like Rachel told Rebekah
that her sister’s brother’s friend kissed

83
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,409
Justin Bieber on the face.

84
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,199
And the vast majority of Muslims don’t treat
terribly sourced hadiths as scripture.

85
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,870
And the idea that you go to heaven and get
72 virgins is not in the Quran; it’s in

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,019
a terribly sourced hadith so it is my great
regret to inform you, 72 Virgins, that in

87
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,099
the eyes of almost all Muslims you do not
exist.

88
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,629
Best wishes,
John Green

89
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,319
One more thing about Islam: Like Christianity
and Judaism, it has a body of law. You might

90
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,168
have heard of it - it’s called sharia.

91
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:59,228
Although we tend to think of sharia as this
single set of laws that all Muslims follow,

92
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:03,680
that’s ridiculous; there are numerous competing
interpretations of sharia, just as there are

93
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,228
within any legal tradition.

94
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:08,459
So people who embraced this worldview were
called Muslims, because they submitted to

95
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,918
the will of God, and they became part of the
umma, or community of believers.

96
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:17,120
This would be a good moment for an Uma Thurman
joke, but sadly she is no longer famous. I’m

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,579
sorry if you’re watching this, Uma Thurman.

98
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:24,219
Being part of the umma trumped all other ties,
including tribal ties, which got Muhammad

99
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,780
into some trouble and brings us, at last,
back to history.

100
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,119
So as Muhammad’s following in Mecca grew,
the umma aroused the suspicion of the most

101
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,600
powerful tribe, the Quraysh.

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,729
And it didn’t matter that Muhammad himself
was born into the Quraysh tribe because he

103
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:41,069
wouldn’t shut up about how there was only
one God, which was really bad news to the

104
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:46,290
Quraysh tribe because they managed the pilgrimage
trade in Mecca, and if all those gods were

105
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,000
false, it would be a disaster economically.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,918
—although come to think of it, in the end the
Meccan pilgrimage business turned out just fine.

107
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,269
So the Quraysh forced Muhammad and his followers
out of Mecca in 622 CE, and they headed to

108
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:00,459
Yithrab, also known as Medina.

109
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:05,599
This journey, also know as the hijra, is so
important that it marks year 0 in the Islamic calendar.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,770
In Medina, Muhammad severed the religion’s
ties to Judaism, turning the focus of prayer

111
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:12,120
away from Jerusalem to Mecca.

112
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,340
Also in Medina, the Islamic community started
to look a lot more like a small empire than

113
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:19,589
like a church. Like, Jesus never had a country
to run.

114
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:23,250
But Muhammad did almost from the beginning.
And in addition to being an important prophet,

115
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,899
he was a good general and in 630, the Islamic
community took back Mecca.

116
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:32,179
They destroyed the idols in the kabaa, and
soon Islam was as powerful a political force

117
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,069
in the region as it was a religious one.

118
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,449
And it’s because the political and religious
coexisted from the beginning, that there’s

119
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,538
no separate tradition of civic and religious
law like there is in Christianity and Judaism.

120
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:42,079
very different from Judaism and even from
Christianity—which you’ll remember debated

121
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,538
very different from Judaism and even from
Christianity—which you’ll remember debated

122
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:42,579
for generations whether to be inclusive.

123
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:42,599
—and more importantly than separating Islam
from other monotheisms, that really separated

124
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:42,660
Islam from the tribalism in Arabia.

125
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,229
So then when Muhammad died in 632 CE, there
wasn’t a religious vacuum left behind: Muhammad

126
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:53,399
was the final prophet, the revelation of the Quran would
continue to guide the umma throughout their lives.

127
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,530
But the community did need a political leader,
a caliph. And the first caliph was Abu Bakr,

128
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:01,559
Muhammad’s father-in-law, who was not without
his opponents:

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,379
Many people wanted Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law,
to lead the community. And although he did

130
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:10,560
become the fourth caliph, that initial disagreement — to
radically oversimplify because we only have

131
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,839
ten minutes — began the divide between the
two of the major sects of Islam: Suuni and Shi’a.

132
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,789
And even today, Sunnis Muslims believe Abu
Bakr was rightly elected the first caliph

133
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:22,399
and Shi’a Muslims believe it should’ve
been Ali.

134
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,879
To Sunnis, the first four caliphs—Abu Bakr,
Umar, Uthman, and Ali— are known as the

135
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,149
Rightly Guided Caliphs, and many of the conservative
movements in the Islamic world today are all

136
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:38,299
about trying to restore the Islamic world
to those glory days, which—like most glory

137
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,408
days—were not unambiguously glorious.

138
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:44,580
Abu Bakr stabilized the community after Muhammad’s
death, and began the process of recording

139
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,910
the Quran in writing,

140
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:50,139
And started the military campaigns against
the Byzantine and Sassanian Empires that within

141
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:55,750
116 years would allow the Islamic Empire to
go from this to this.

142
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,860
His successor Umar was both an uncommonly
good general and a brilliant administrator

143
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,000
but like so many other great men, he proved
terrible at avoiding assassination.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,490
Which led to the caliphate of Uthman, who
standardized the Quran and continued both

145
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,379
his predecessor’s tradition of conquest
and his predecessor’s tradition of getting assassinated.

146
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,399
Then Ali finally got his turn at caliph, but
his ascension was very controversial, and

147
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,259
it ultimately led to a civil war.

148
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,220
Which eventually led to the emergence of Uthman’s
tribe, the Umayyads, as the dynasty ruling

149
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,700
over an ever-expanding Islamic Empire for
more than a hundred years.

150
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,399
It’s common to hear that in these early
years Islam quote spread by the sword, and

151
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,360
that’s partly true, unless you are — wait
for it —

152
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,759
the Mongols.

153
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,480
Actually, as usual, the truth is more complicated:Many
people, including the Mongols but also including

154
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,730
lots of people in Central and East Asia, embraced
Islam without any military campaigns.

155
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,259
And in fact, the Quran says that religion
must not be an act of compulsion, but this

156
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:54,799
much is true: The early Islamic empire was
really good at winning wars.

157
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,809
And situated as they were between two very
wealthy empires—the Byzantines and the Sassanians—there

158
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,099
was plenty to fight for.

159
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,509
First to fall was the Sassanians, the last
non-Muslim successor to the Persian Empire.

160
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:09,028
They were relatively easy pickings because
they’d been fighting the Byzantines for

161
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:14,539
like 300 years and were super tired. Also
they’d been recently struck by plague.

162
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:19,528
Plague, man, I’m telling you; It’s like
the red tortoise shell of history.

163
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:23,129
But in those early days they did pry away
some valuable territory like Egypt and the

164
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,970
holy land and eventually they got into Spain.

165
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,379
Where various Muslim dynasties would entrench
themselves until being expelled in 1492.

166
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,039
But as a good as they were at making war,
it’s still tempting to chalk up the Arabs’

167
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,490
success to, you know, the will of God.

168
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,700
And certainly a lot of the people they conquered
felt that way. Wars in this part of the world

169
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,709
didn’t just pit people against each other,
they also pitted their gods against each other.

170
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,778
So while the Islamic Empire didn’t require
its subjects to convert to Islam, their stunning

171
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:54,659
successes certainly convinced a lot of people
that this monotheism thing was legit.

172
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:59,750
Once again, John Green proving super hip to
the slang of today’s young’ns.

173
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,509
Also, you paid lower taxes if you converted,
and just as taxes on cigarettes lead to people

174
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:10,129
not wanting to smoke, taxes on worshiping your idols
lead to people not wanting to worship them anymore.

175
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:14,379
So in a period of time that was, historically
speaking, both remarkably recent and remarkably

176
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:19,319
short, a small group of people from an area
of the world with no natural resources managed

177
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,780
to create one of the great empires of the
world and also one of its great religions.

178
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:26,959
And that very fact may be why people of
Western European descent remain

179
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,080
largely ignorant about this period.

180
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,920
Not only were the Muslims great conquerors,
they spawned an explosion of trade and learning

181
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,639
that lasted hundreds of years.

182
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,838
They saved many of the classical texts that
form the basis of the “Western Canon”

183
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,920
while Europe was ignoring them and they paved
the way for the Renaissance.

184
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,829
While it’s important to remember that much
of the world between Spain and the Indus River

185
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,709
wasn’t Arabized, most of it was so thoroughly
Islamized that these days we can’t think

186
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,838
of the world we now call the Middle East without
thinking of it as Islamic.

187
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,339
Perhaps the greatest testimony to Islam’s
power to organize peoples lives and their

188
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:05,699
communities is that, in Egypt, 5 times a day millions of
people turn away from the Pyramids and toward Mecca.

189
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,100
Egypt, birthplace to one of the longest continuous
cultures the world has ever known, is now

190
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,139
the largest Arab country in the world.

191
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,960
Next week we’ll talk about the Dark Ages.
Spoiler alert: they were darkest in the evening.

192
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,740
Thanks for watching and we’ll see you next
time.

193
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,629
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

194
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:26,610
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself and our graphics

195
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,779
team is Thought Bubble.

196
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,259
Last week’s Phrase of the Week was “They
Might Be Giants”. If you want to guess this

197
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,569
week’s Phrase of the Week or suggest future
ones you can do so in Comments where you can

198
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,390
also ask questions about today’s video that
our team of historians will endeavor to answer.

199
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:42,389
Thank you so much for watching and as they
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.
