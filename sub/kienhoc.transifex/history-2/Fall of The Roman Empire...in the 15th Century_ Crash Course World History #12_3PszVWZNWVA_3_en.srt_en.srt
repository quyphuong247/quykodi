00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,880
Hi there, my name’s John Green; this is
Crash Course: World History, and today we’re

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,469
going to talk about the fall of Rome.

3
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:08,509
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green!
Who’s that pretty lady?

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,960
That lady, me-from-the-past, is Emperor Justinian.
We’ll get to him in a minute.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:21,089
[Theme Music]

6
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,000
How and when Rome fell remains the subject
of considerable historical debate—

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,100
but today I’m going to argue that the Rome
didn’t really fully fall until the middle of the 15th century.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,179
But first, let me introduce you to The Traditional
View:

9
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:35,318
Barbarians at the Gates.
My, don’t you look traditional?

10
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:37,309
If you want to be really technical about it,
the city of Rome was

11
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:41,518
conquered by bar bar bar barbarians in 476
CE.

12
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:45,198
There was a last Roman Emperor Romulus Augustus,
who ruled the empire for less than a year

13
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:48,408
before being deposed and sent into exile by
Odoacer,

14
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:51,329
who was some kind of barbarian- we don’t
know for sure.

15
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,448
Ostrogoth, Hun, Visigoth, Vandals;
they all looked the same to the Romans.

16
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:59,429
Rome had been sacked by barbarians before,
most notably by Alaric the Visigoth in 410-

17
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:02,850
Is it Uh-lar-ick or Uh-lair-ick?
The dictionary says Uh-lair-ick but

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,530
The Vampire Diaries say Uh-lar-ick so
I’m going to go with Uh-lar-ick.

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,978
But anyway, after 476, there was never again
a “Roman” emperor in Rome.

20
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:14,509
Then there’s the hipper anti-imperialistic
argument—

21
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,659
that’s nice, but if you really want to go
full hipster

22
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,090
you should probably deny that you’re being
hipst—

23
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,859
right, exactly—which goes like this:

24
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,509
Rome was doomed to fall as soon as it spread
outside of Italy

25
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,159
because the further the territory is from
the capital,

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,520
the harder it is to govern.

27
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,539
Thus imperialism itself sowed the seeds of
destruction in Rome.

28
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,679
This was the argument put forth by the Roman
historian Tacitus,

29
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:36,228
although he put it in the mouth of a British
chieftain.

30
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:39,509
That sounded dirty, but it’s not,
it’s all about context here on Crash Course:

31
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:46,040
"To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying
name of empire; they make a desert and call it peace.”

32
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,310
There are two ways to overcome this governance
problem:

33
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,299
First, you rule with the proverbial topaz
fist—

34
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,490
that’s not the proverb? Really, Stan?
It’s an iron fist? But topaz is much harder

35
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:59,559
than iron.
Don’t these people know their Mohs scale of mineral hardness?..

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
Regardless,
the Romans couldn’t do this because their

37
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,089
whole identity was wrapped up in an idea
of justice that precluded indiscriminate violence.

38
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,950
The other strategy is to try to incorporate
conquered people into the empire more fully:

39
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,149
In Rome’s case,
to make them Romans.

40
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,330
This worked really well in the early days
of the Republic

41
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,530
and even at the beginning of the Empire.
But it eventually led to

42
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,009
Barbarians inside the Gates.

43
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,810
The decline of the legions started long before
Rome started getting sacked.

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,209
It really began with the extremely bad decision
to incorporate Germanic warriors into the Roman Army.

45
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:35,598
Rome had a long history of absorbing people
from the empire’s fringes into the polity

46
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,399
first by making them allies and then
eventually by granting them full citizenship rights.

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,740
But usually these “foreign” citizens had
developed ties to Rome itself;

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,150
they learned Latin, they bought into the whole
idea of the aristocratic republic.

49
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,209
But by the 3rd and 4th centuries CE, though,
the empire had been forced to

50
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,769
allow the kind of riffraff into their army
who didn’t really care about the idea of

51
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:56,019
Rome itself.
They were only loyal to their commanders.

52
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,879
—And as you no doubt remember from the historical
examples of

53
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,328
Caesar, Pompey, Marius, contemporary Afghanistan—
this is not a recipe for domestic bliss.

54
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:07,170
So here is Rome,
stuck with a bunch of expensive and bloody

55
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,188
wars against Germanic peoples who were really
good at fighting

56
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:14,870
and then they had a great idea:
Why not fight with these guys?

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,079
So they essentially hired them
and soon the Roman Legions were teeming with

58
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,360
these mercenaries
who were loyal mostly to gold,

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,329
secondarily to their commanders,
and not at all to Rome

60
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,319
which is a place that very few of them ever
even saw.

61
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:30,199
I mean, why would they give a crap about the
health and well-being of the empire?

62
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,468
Am I allowed to say crap, Stan?
Nice.

63
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:36,789
This was of course a recipe for civil war,
and that’s exactly what happened with general

64
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:40,438
after general after general
declaring himself Emperor of Rome.

65
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,968
So there was very little stability in the
West.

66
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:48,989
For instance, between 235 and 284 CE, 41 different
people were either emperor or claimed to be emperor.

67
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,718
And after the year 200,
many of the generals who were powerful enough

68
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:54,280
to proclaim themselves emperors weren’t
even Roman.

69
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,609
In fact, a lot of them didn’t speak much
Latin.

70
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,719
Oddly enough, one of the best symbols of the
new face of the Roman Empire was sartorial.

71
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:04,000
Instead of the traditional tunic and toga
of the glory days of the Senate,

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,139
most of the new general-emperors adopted that
most practical and most barbaric of garments: pants.

73
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,479
Oh, which reminds me,
it’s time for the Open Letter.

74
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,800
An Open Letter to Pants:

75
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,280
But first let's see what's inside the secret compartment.

76
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,219
Oh, look, it's Rosie the Riveter! And she's wearing PANTS.

77
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,940
Dear Pants, Although you eventually became
a symbol of patriarchal oppression,

78
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,250
in your early days you were worn by both men
and women.

79
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,699
And in the days of the Roman Republic, they
hated you.

80
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,560
They thought you barbarous.
They thought that people wearing you was

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
the definition of people lacking civilization.

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,560
They ventured north and the wind blew up through
their togas

83
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,569
and lo and behold, they adopted pants.

84
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,449
And there’s a history lesson in that, pants,
which is that when people have to choose between

85
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,050
civilization and warm genitals,
they choose warm genitals.

86
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,770
Best Wishes,
John Green

87
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:00,579
And now a note from our sponsor:
Today’s episode of crash course is brought

88
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:03,269
o you by
the all-new Oldsmobile Byzantium,

89
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,069
mixing power and luxury in a way-
Really? Oldsmobile isn’t a company anymore?

90
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,139
And Byzantium is a place?
Are you sure?

91
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:12,959
So remember when I said the Roman Empire survived
til the 15th century?

92
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,719
Well that was the Eastern Roman Empire, commonly
known as the Byzantine Empire

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,690
(although not by the people who lived in it
who identified themselves as Romans).

94
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,910
So while the Western empire descended into
chaos,

95
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,520
the eastern half of the Empire had its capital
in Byzantium,

96
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,519
a city on the Bosporus Strait that Constantine
would later rename Constantinople,

97
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,879
thereby paving the way for
They Might Be Giants only mainstream hit.

98
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:42,879
Constantine had lots of reasons to move his
capitol east.

99
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,779
For one thing he was born in modern-day Croatia,
also he probably spoke better Greek than Latin,

100
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,879
and plus the eastern provinces were a lot
richer than the Western provinces and

101
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,159
from a looting perspective, you just
want to be closer to where the good warring is.

102
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,580
The enemies in the East, like the Persian
Parthians and the Persian Sassanians,

103
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,379
were real empires,
not just bands of warriors.

104
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:07,850
And no matter who you were in world history,
if you wanted to make a name for yourself

105
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,110
in terms of war,
you really needed to be up against the Persians.

106
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,590
EVEN IF you were—
wait for it—

107
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,599
the Mongols.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,020
Not this time, friends.

109
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,399
As the political center of the Roman Empire
shifted east,

110
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,540
Constantine also tried to re-orient his new
religion, Christianity, toward the east,

111
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,920
holding the first Church council in Nicaea
in 325.

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,480
The idea was to get all Christians to believe
the same thing-

113
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,860
that worked-
but it did mark the beginning of the emperor

114
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,610
having greater control over the Church.

115
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,379
That trend would of course later lead to tensions
between the church centered at Constantinople

116
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:41,269
and the one centered in Rome.
But, more on that in a bit.

117
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,930
To give you a sense of how dramatic this shift
was,

118
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,129
by the 4th century CE, Constantinople’s
population had soared

119
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:49,550
while Rome’s had gone from 500,000 to 80,000.

120
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,509
And although the Byzantines spoke Greek not
Latin, they considered themselves Romans

121
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,490
and if they did then we probably should too.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

122
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,310
There was a lot of continuity between the
old, Western Roman Empire,

123
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,009
and the new, Eastern one.
Politically, each was ruled by a single

124
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,310
(sometimes there were two, and once there
were four– but let’s forget about them

125
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,439
for now)
who wielded absolute military power.

126
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,449
War was pretty much constant as the Byzantines
fought the Persian Sassanian Empire

127
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,110
and then various Islamic empires.

128
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,480
Trade and valuable agricultural land that
yielded high taxes meant that the Byzantine

129
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,640
Empire was like the Western Roman Empire,
exceptionally rich,

130
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,370
and it was slightly more compact as a territory
than its predecessor and much more urban,

131
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,319
containing as it did all of those once independent
Greek city states,

132
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,269
which made it easier to administer.

133
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:38,779
Also like their Western counterparts, the
Byzantines enjoyed spectacle and sport.

134
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:43,259
Chariot races in Constantinople were huge,
with thousands turning out at the Hippodrome

135
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,740
to cheer on their favorites.

136
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,519
Big bets were placed and there was a huge
rivalry not just about sports

137
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,629
but also about political affiliations between
the two main teams,

138
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:53,879
the Blues and the Greens-
Thanks for putting us on the Greens, Thought

139
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,659
Bubble.
That rivalry was so heated that riots often

140
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,030
broke out between them.
In one such riot, an estimated 30,000 people

141
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,719
were killed.

142
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,080
Thanks Thought Bubble.
But perhaps the most consistently Roman aspect

143
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,469
of Byzantine society was that they followed
Roman law.

144
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,070
The Romans always prided themselves on being
ruled by laws,

145
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,129
not by men,
and even though that’s not actually the

146
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:17,790
case after the second century BCE,
there’s no question that the Eastern Roman

147
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,910
Empire’s codification of Roman laws
was one of it’s greatest achievements.

148
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,180
And much of the credit for that goes to the
most famous Byzantine Emperor,

149
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,759
at least after Constantine,
Justinian.

150
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,920
I like your brooch, sir.

151
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:37,100
In 533 Justinian published the Digest, an
800,000-word condensation of 1,528 Latin law books.

152
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,589
And to go along with this he published the
Institutes,

153
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,769
which was like a curriculum for the Roman
law schools that existed all through the Empire.

154
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:47,519
Justinian, incidentally, was by far the most
awesome of the Byzantine emperors.

155
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,620
He was like the David Tennant of doctors.

156
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,399
He was born a peasant somewhere in the Balkans
and than rose to became emperor in 527.

157
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,149
He ruled for almost 30 years and in addition
to codifying Roman law,

158
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:01,938
he did a lot to restore the former glory of
the Roman Empire.

159
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:05,478
He took Carthage back, he even took Rome
back from the Goths, although not for long.

160
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,399
And he’s responsible for the building of
one of the great churches in all of time—

161
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:13,419
which is now a mosque—
the Hagia Sophia or Church of Saint Wisdom.

162
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,110
So after one of those sporting riots destroyed
the previous church,

163
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,550
he built this,
which with its soaring domes became a symbol

164
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:22,120
for the wealth and opulence of his empire.

165
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,919
The Romans were remarkable builders and engineers
and the Hagia Sophia is no exception:

166
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,399
a dome its equal wouldn’t be build for another
500 years.

167
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,328
But you would never mistake it for a Roman
temple;

168
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:36,328
It doesn’t have the austerity or the emphasis
on engineering that you see, for instance, the Coliseum.

169
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:39,429
And this building in many ways functions a
symbol for the ways the

170
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:42,250
Eastern Roman Empire was both Roman and not.

171
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,490
But maybe the most interesting thing Justinian
ever did was

172
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,959
be married to his controversial Theater Person
of a wife,

173
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,919
Theodora.
Hey Danica, can we get Theodora up here?

174
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,299
Wow that is perfect. It’s funny
how married couples always look like each other.

175
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,479
Theodora began her career as an actress, dancer,
and possible prostitute before become Empress.

176
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,810
And she may have saved her husband’s rule
by convincing him not to flee the city during

177
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,498
riots
between the Blues and Greens.

178
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:08,870
She also mentored a eunuch
who went on to become a hugely important general-

179
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,899
Mentoring a eunuch sounds like a euphemism,
but it’s not.

180
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,970
And she fought to expand the rights of women
in divorce and property ownership,

181
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,490
and even had a law passed taking the bold
stance

182
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,589
that adulterous women should not be executed.

183
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:23,050
So, in short,
the Byzantines continued the Roman legacy

184
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:28,789
of empire and war and law for almost 1000
years after Romulus Augustus was driven out of Rome.

185
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:32,699
The Byzantines may not have spoken Latin,
and few of their emperors came from Rome,

186
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:38,309
but in most important ways they were Romans.
Except one REALLY IMPORTANT way.

187
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:40,649
The Byzantines followed a different form of
Christianity,

188
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:43,958
the branch we now call Eastern or sometimes
Greek Orthodox.

189
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,248
How there came to be a split between the Catholic
and Orthodox traditions is complicated –

190
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:48,959
you might even call it Byzantine.

191
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,328
What matters for us are the differences between
the churches,

192
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:53,258
the main doctrinal one being about the dating
of Easter,

193
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:57,240
and the main political one being about who
rules whom.

194
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,049
Did I get my whom right there, Stan?
YES!

195
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:03,169
In the West there was a Pope and in the East
there was a Patriarch.

196
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,389
The Pope is the head of the Roman Catholic
Church.

197
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,230
He sort of serves as god’s regent on earth
and he doesn’t answer to any secular ruler.

198
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,709
And ever since the fall of Rome,
there has been a lot of tension in Western

199
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,838
Europe between Popes and kings
over who should have the real power.

200
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:18,790
But in the Orthodox church they didn’t have
that problem

201
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:22,549
because the Patriarch was always appointed
by the Emperor.

202
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,519
So it was pretty clear who had control over
the church,

203
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,778
so much that they even have a word for it-
caesaropapism: Caesar over Pope.

204
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:33,818
But the fact that in Rome there was no emperor
after 476 meant there was no one to challenge

205
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,539
the Pope,
which would profoundly shape European history

206
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:38,879
over the next, like, 1200 years.

207
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,569
So I would argue that in some important ways,
the Roman Empire survived for a thousand years

208
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,049
after it left Rome,
but in some ways it still survives today.

209
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:50,628
It survives in our imagination when we think
of this as east, and this as west;

210
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:53,990
It survives in football rivalries that have
their roots in religious conflicts;

211
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,959
and it survives in the Justinian law code
which continues to be

212
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,508
the basis for much of civil law in Europe.

213
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,970
Next week we’ll talk about the emergence
of Islam over here...

214
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,090
How’d I do, Stan?
Well, you can’t win ‘em all.

215
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,120
Thanks for watching.

216
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,438
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller,

217
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,938
our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

218
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:16,360
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself and
our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

219
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,240
Last week’s Phrase of the Week was
“Aristotelian logic”.

220
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,799
You can guess this week’s Phrase of the
Week or suggest new ones in Comments,

221
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,419
where you can also ask questions that our
team of historians will endeavor to answer.

222
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:29,298
Thanks for watching, and as we say in my hometown,
Don’t forget to be awesome.
