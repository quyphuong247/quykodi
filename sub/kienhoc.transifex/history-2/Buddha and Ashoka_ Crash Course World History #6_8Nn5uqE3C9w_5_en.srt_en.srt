1
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:04,889
Hi, my name is John Green; you’re watching
Crash Course World History and today we’re

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:07,259
going to talk about India, which is hard because:

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,509
A. I only have 10 minutes...

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,500
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green!

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,539
Present John: I don’t have time for you
today, Me from the Past!

6
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:16,359
B. When we study history we tend to study
unified polities that we can label like “The

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,100
Roman Empire” or “China" or “Beliebers,”
and this emphasis on unity tends to:

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,500
C. lead to labels that mask a lot of historical
difference, like for instance “Europe,”

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,589
which is such a weird and nebulous word that
we don’t even know what it means. Plus:

10
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,159
D, no offense Europe, but there are not many
histories more complex than India, and...

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,908
E. a lot of what we know about Indian history
comes from British historians, who both used

12
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:38,899
and embodied the phrase “historical bias,”
all of which

13
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,009
F. makes it very unfortunate that we only
have 10 minutes. But we will do our best!

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,250
Okay, we’re gonna make this like Voldemort’s
soul and split up into eight parts.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:55,159
[theme music]

16
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,399
Part 1, The Vedas. So as you no doubt remember,
the Indus River Valley was one of the earliest

17
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,350
cradles of civilization, But that original
civilization basically disappeared sometime

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,900
after 1750 BCE. Then there was a long period
of Aryan migration, and by Aryans we do not

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,080
mean like prehistoric Nazis, we mean people
from the Caucasus who migrated down into the

20
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,250
Indo-Gag gig gag gi... Stan, can you just
spell it for me? Thank you.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,810
We know about these Aryans primarily because
they left behind religious texts, the earliest

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,530
of which is called the Vedas. The Vedas are
also the earliest texts of what will come

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,989
to be known as Hinduism, although it wasn’t
known as Hinduism then. And they’re responsible

24
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,519
for tons of stuff, but we only have 10 minutes
so let’s just cut to:

25
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,259
Part 2, The Caste System. The caste system
is one of India’s most enduring and fascinating

26
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,800
institutions. Let us read from one of the
Vedas about Purusha, the universe-pervading

27
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,509
spirit. When they divided Purusha, in how
many different portions did they arrange him?

28
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,600
What became of his mouth, what of his two
arms? What were his two thighs and his two

29
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:55,309
feet called? His mouth became the Brahmin,
his two arms were made into the Kshatriya;

30
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,640
his two thighs the vaisyas; from his two feet
the shudra was born.

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,390
So this section gives a divine explanation
for the caste system. Brahmins – who as

32
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,200
Purusha’s mouth speak to the gods are at
the top. Kshatriyas – from Purusha’s arms

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,949
became the warriors, as you no doubt know
if you’ve ever attended my gun show. Vaisyas

34
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,339
– the merchants and artisans who provide
money for the priests and the warriors came

35
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,560
from Purusha’s thighs. Because everybody
knows that the thighs are the money makers.

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,159
And the Shudras – are at the bottom. They’re
the feet, the laborers and farmers who are

37
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,889
the foundation of the social order. Also,
the rest of us stand on them.

38
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:30,369
The caste system becomes much more complicated
than this, but that basic division into 4

39
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,340
classes remains throughout much of Indian
history. In spite of the efforts of many reformers

40
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,759
whom we’ll be meeting in future episodes
of Crash Course. The Caste System is the foundation

41
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,939
for another big concept in Hinduism,

42
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:45,598
Part 3, Dharma. Dharma is basically one’s
role in life and society and it is defined

43
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,539
primarily by birth and by caste. The whole
idea is explained nicely by this passage from

44
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:53,560
the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna is talking
to the warrior, Arjuna. “Having regard to

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,870
your own duty also, you ought not to falter,
for there is nothing better for a Kshatriya

46
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,599
than a righteous battle.” The Bhagavad Gita
is a section of a much larger epic poem the

47
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,488
Mahabharata which tells the complicated and
long story of a war between two kingdoms.

48
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,520
And we can really see how important dharma
is in this passage because Krishna is basically

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,709
telling Arjuna that because he is a warrior,
a Kshatriya, he must fight. Even if he’s

50
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,879
bad at it – like for instance if he gets
killed – it’s still preferable to not

51
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,769
living his dharma. It’s better to be a bad
warrior if you’re a Kshatriya than to be

52
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,239
the world’s best baker. Basically, you’re
better off fulfilling your own dharma poorly

53
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,680
than doing someone else’s well. That leads
us to:

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,189
Part 4, Saṃsāra, Moksha, and Karma – there
are both personal and social reasons for doing

55
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:44,459
your dharma. Right, the social reason is obvious
that dharma and caste combine for excellent

56
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,300
social cohesion. You get the exact right number
of bakers and the exact right number of warriors.

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,650
We could stand in to implement this system
in the United States, actually, where everyone

58
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,019
knows we suffer from a shortage of electrical
engineers and a surplus of people who want

59
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,689
to be on reality TV shows. That would not
have happen in ancient India. But, say that

60
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,750
your dharma is to scoop animal dung your entire
life, why do you keep doing that when you

61
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,598
see other lives that at least appear to be
far more fulfilling?

62
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,848
That leads us to the concept of Saṃsāra,
or the cycle of rebirth often called reincarnation.

63
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:17,128
The basic idea is that when you die your soul
is transferred to another living thing as

64
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,278
it is being born. And if you fulfill your
dharma, things improve and you get re-born

65
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:24,478
into a higher being. You don’t have to scoop
elephant dung anymore.

66
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,859
But the ultimate goal is not to be re-born
as a Brahmin. The ultimate goal is to be released

67
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,949
from the merry-go-round altogether. And that
release is called moksha. The law that holds

68
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,228
all this together is Karma which is summarized
really nicely in the Aranyaka Upanishad. "The

69
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:43,968
doer of good becomes good. The doer of evil
becomes evil. One becomes virtuous by virtuous

70
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:46,759
action, bad by bad action."

71
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:50,859
The Upanishads, by the way, are later religious
texts that began as commentaries on the Vedas,

72
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,129
but later became sacred writings in their
own right. This is a really great way to organize

73
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,229
a social order from top to bottom. Everyone
has a role, and, because that role has a religious

74
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,300
dimension, society stays in balance.

75
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,879
But as a religion, Hinduism has a problem,
at least if you want to start an empire; everyone’s

76
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,520
path to “salvation” is individual. The
original Brahmins tried to set themselves

77
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,688
up as political leaders, but Hinduism doesn’t
really place a premium on worshippers obeying

78
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:16,489
their leaders. And if you are a leader trying
to make your subjects listen to you, that’s

79
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:18,339
kind of a bummer. Which brings us to:

80
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:22,019
Part 5, Buddhism. We can’t establish this
historically, but according to traditional

81
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:26,938
biographies, our story begins in the 6th century
BCE. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

82
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,559
So there was this prince, Siddhartha Gautama,
whose father kept him locked away in a palace

83
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:35,599
because a prophecy foretold that the family
would lose the kingdom if he ever left. But

84
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:40,308
as house arrests go, this was a good one:
Siddhartha had great food, great entertainment,

85
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,769
a hot cousin for a wife, etc.

86
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:47,939
But he suspected that there was more to life,
so he snuck out of the palace a few times.

87
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:54,439
On these travels, he encountered an old man,
a sick man, and finally a corpse. Having realized

88
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,059
the ubiquity of suffering, Siddhartha left
the palace, renounced the crown and sought

89
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:04,239
out all the holiest men to try to find out how it could
be possible that life would come to such a terrible end.

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,098
Eventually Gautama became an ascetic, fasting
and meditating for days at a time, hoping

91
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:14,468
to find enlightenment. And finally, after
meditating for about a month under a tree,

92
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:19,228
it came to him. Nirvana. No, not that one.
Yes, that one.

93
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:22,649
He finally understood the meaning of life
and began teaching it to people who would

94
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:28,149
become his disciples. He had become the Buddha,
which means teacher, and he taught the Four

95
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:29,869
Noble Truths. Which are:

96
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,439
1. All life is suffering.

97
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:39,979
2. The source of suffering is desire. Not
just sexual desire, but all wanting of stuff and prestige.

98
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,700
3. To stop suffering, you must rid yourself
of desire. This sounds simple enough, but

99
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:51,329
if you’ve ever been dumped by someone, you
know that it is not that easy to just stop desiring.

100
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:57,128
4. So how do you do it? By following the Eightfold
Path, which as you might suspect is a set

101
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,729
of eight prescriptions on how to live that
we don’t have time to talk about. Because,

102
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:04,908
oh wait look, Thought Bubble, you put some
learning in our learning so we can learn while

103
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,449
we learn. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

104
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,679
So as a religion, Buddhism involves a lot
of meditating and moderation and there aren’t

105
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:14,878
that many fun rituals, and if you’re a Buddhist
monk you don’t get to have power like most

106
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,960
holy people do; you have to renounce everything,
including your hair. And, yes, some of them

107
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,299
get to be kung-fu monks, but only in China,
where Buddhism eventually migrated and became

108
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,228
a religion with fun rituals and all kinds
of great stuff that Siddhartha Gautama probably

109
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:28,269
wouldn’t even have recognized.

110
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:31,818
But we’re not talking about fun populist
religion, we’re talking about old-school

111
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,588
ascetic Buddhism. Sure, you might be happy
and fulfilled if you follow the Eightfold

112
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,178
Path, but from everything we’ve learned
so far, it would appear that humans don’t

113
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:42,519
want to be happy and fulfilled or else they
never would’ve stopped foraging.

114
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,868
But Buddhism was very attractive if you were
a low-caste Hindu, because there is no caste

115
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:50,860
system. In theory, anyone who follows the
Eightfold Path and renounces desire can be

116
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,949
freed from suffering and achieve nirvana,
maybe even in THIS life. Instead of having

117
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,270
to get re-born for maybe millennia and knowing
that each time there is only a tiny chance

118
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:02,209
that you will end up something awesome, like
a honey badger. By the way...

119
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,509
Totally Tangential Part 6, Did you know the
game Chutes and Ladders has its origins in

120
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:09,240
ancient India? They call it Snakes and Ladders.
The ladders are steps forward on the path

121
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,990
to moksha, and the snakes take you away from
it. Which reminds me, it’s time for the

122
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,929
Open Letter.

123
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:23,718
That is very close to my head. Wow. But first
let’s see what’s in The Secret Compartment.

124
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:29,368
Oh look, it’s a golf club. Must be so I
can play Disco Golf.

125
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:31,219
An open letter to Chutes and Ladders:

126
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:39,120
Dear Chutes and Ladders,This is Disco Golf.
It’s a game of skill. My success at Disco

127
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,590
Golf is entirely dependent on whether I am
good at Disco Golf. Now, listen Chutes and

128
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,490
Ladders, I remember your game being awesome
when I was a kid, but I have a 2-year-old

129
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,620
son myself and I recently bought him Chutes
and Ladders and you know what happened the

130
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,779
first time we played? HE BEAT ME.

131
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:57,539
Chutes and Ladders, this is a child who regularly
refers to helicopters as heli-flopters. I

132
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,500
don’t want to say that he’s not my intellectual
equal, but I’m potty trained. You know why

133
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:06,269
he beat me? Because there is no skill involved
in Chutes and Ladders at all. It is completely

134
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:10,590
random and capricious and arbitrary and cold
– just like the universe.

135
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,639
I don’t want to play games that are like
the universe – I want to play games so that

136
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,279
I can forget what the universe it like.

137
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,939
Best wishes,
John Green

138
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,690
Okay, Part 7, Ashoka. Remember that for most
of Indian history, India it was not one unified

139
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,240
place. It was tons of different principalities
and city-states and everything else. But India

140
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,259
did experience indigenous political unity
twice, first under the Mauryan Dynasty in

141
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:36,220
the 3rd century BCE. And then again under
the Gupta Dynasty from the 300’s to the

142
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,560
500’s CE, but we’re not going to talk
about that because it bores me.

143
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,939
Right now, we’re interested in one particular
leader from the Mauryan Dynasty, Ashoka, because

144
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,380
Ashoka attempted to rule through quasi-Buddhist
principles. So Ashoka was initially a warrior

145
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,889
who ended up expanding the empire that his
grandfather started. And Ashoka experienced

146
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:57,299
this conversion to Buddhism after he saw his
own army devastate the Kingdom of Kalinga,

147
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:00,189
something I bring up primarily so that I can
say Kingdom of Kalinga.

148
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,530
Stan, is there anyway we can write a song
a song about that, like, Kingdom of Kalinga/

149
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,669
I’m sorry you got destroyed...

150
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:10,799
So, Ashoka built stupas, (stoopas?) Hold on...

151
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,179
HowJSay: Stoopah.

152
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,639
John: Could he have said that any more pretentiously?
Stupas.

153
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,039
So Ashoka built stupas, these mound-like monuments
to the Buddha, all over his kingdom to show

154
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,230
his devotion. And he also put up pillars throughout
his empire that proclaimed his benevolent

155
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,470
rule and said he was going to rule through
something he called dhamma, which according

156
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,300
to one of the pillars went like this: "proper
behavior towards servants and employees, respect

157
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:38,049
for mother and father, generosity to friends,
companions, relations, Brahmans and ascetics,

158
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:39,740
and not killing living beings."

159
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,470
So those are not individualistic goals like
we see in Hinduism; they’re relational goals,

160
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,090
like we’re gonna see next week when we study
Confucianism. And that’s one of the reasons

161
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,490
why Ashoka’s empire wasn’t actually very
Buddhist because ultimately Buddhism isn’t

162
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,450
that concerned with the order of the world.
Buddhism argues that the fulfillment of the

163
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,330
self will lead to the order of the world.
In the end, Ashoka’s empire didn’t outlast

164
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,860
him by much, and soon enough Buddhism declined
in India, almost to the point of extinction.

165
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,990
Part 8: The Big Finish. So as anyone who has
ever practices yoga knows, Hinduism is the

166
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,049
most flexible of all the world religions,
which is part of the reason it’s often described

167
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:15,349
as polytheistic. The belief that god(s) can
take many different forms makes it easy for

168
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,470
Hinduism to assimilate other religious traditions.
Which is exactly what happened with Buddhism.

169
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,080
In time the Buddha came to be worshipped as
another incarnation of one of the Hindu gods,

170
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,920
and not as a mortal teacher. So in the end, Hinduism,
rather than purging the Buddha, enveloped him.

171
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:32,929
So all this means that while Hinduism has
a tremendous amount of variety and flexibility,

172
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:38,519
its core tenets of samsara, karma, and the
caste system have provided a remarkable amount

173
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,259
of cultural and social unity to the Indian
subcontinent for millennia.

174
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:45,519
Fortunately for the Buddha, his teachings
migrated East to China. We’re gonna make

175
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,149
that same journey next week. I’ll see you
then.

176
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,819
