00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,798
Hi, my name is John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re going to

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:07,970
talk about The French Revolution. Admittedly,
this wasn’t the French flag until 1794,

3
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:11,279
but we just felt like he looked good in stripes.
As does this guy. Huh?

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,739
So, while the American Revolution is considered
a pretty good thing, the French Revolution

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,998
is often seen as a bloody, anarchic mess,
which...

6
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:20,928
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! I bet, like always,
it’s way more complicated than that.

7
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:24,618
Actually no. It was pretty terrible. Also,
like a lot of revolutions, in the end it exchanged

8
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:29,070
an authoritarian regime for an authoritarian
regime. But even if the revolution was a mess,

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,689
its ideas changed human history - far more,
I will argue, than the American Revolution.

10
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:42,539
[theme music]

11
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,799
Right, so France in the 18th century was a
rich and populous country, but it had a systemic

12
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:51,058
problem collecting taxes because of the way
its society was structured. They had a system

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,760
with kings and nobles we now call the Ancien
Régime. Thank you, three years of high school French.

14
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,820
And for most French people, it sucked, because
the people with the money - the nobles and

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,280
the clergy - never paid taxes. So by 1789,
France was deeply in debt thanks to their

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,259
funding the American Revolution - thank you,
France; we will get you back in World Wars

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,400
I and II. And King Louis XVI was spending
half of his national budget to service the federal debt.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,440
Louis tried to reform this system under various
finance ministers. He even called for democracy

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,689
on a local level, but all attempts to fix
it failed and soon France basically declared

20
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,739
bankruptcy. This nicely coincided with hailstorms
that ruined a year’s harvest, thereby raising food prices

21
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:32,199
and causing widespread hunger, which really made
the people of France angry, because they love to eat.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,659
Meanwhile, the King certainly did not look
broke, as evidenced by his well-fed physique

23
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,390
and fancy footwear. He and his wife Marie
Antoinette also got to live in the very nice

24
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,189
Palace at Versailles thanks to God’s mandate,
but Enlightenment thinkers like Kant were

25
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,828
challenging the whole idea of religion, writing
things like: “The main point of enlightenment

26
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:54,288
is of man’s release from his self-caused
immaturity, primarily in matters of religion.”

27
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,799
So basically the peasants were hungry, the
intellectuals were beginning to wonder whether

28
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,319
God could or should save the King, and the
nobility were dithering about, eating foie

29
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:05,889
gras and songbirds, failing to make meaningful
financial reform.

30
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,889
In response to the crisis, Louis XVI called
a meeting of the Estates General, the closest

31
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,009
thing that France had to a national parliament,
which hadn’t met since 1614. The Estates

32
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,340
General was like a super parliament made up
of representatives from the First Estate,

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,840
the nobles, the Second Estate, the clergy,
and the Third Estate, everyone else.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,360
The Third Estate showed up with about 600
representatives, the First and Second Estates

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,760
both had about 300, and after several votes,
everything was deadlocked, and then the Third

36
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,598
Estate was like, “You know what? Forget
you guys. We’re gonna leave and we’re

37
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,399
gonna become our own National Assembly.”

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,150
This did not please King Louis XVI. So when
the new National Assembly left the room for

39
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,400
a break, he locked the doors, and he was like,
"Sorry, guys, you can't go in there. And if

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,650
you can't assemble, how you gonna be a National
Assembly?"

41
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,349
Shockingly, the Third Estate representatives
were able to find a different room in France,

42
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:55,408
this time an indoor tennis court where they
swore the famous Tennis Court Oath. And they

43
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,908
agreed not to give up until a French constitution
was established.

44
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:03,060
So then Louis XVI responded by sending troops
to Paris primarily to quell uprisings over

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,039
food shortages, but the revolutionaries saw
this as a provocation, so they responded by

46
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,489
seizing the Bastille Prison on July 14th,
which, coincidentally, is also Bastille Day.

47
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,780
The Bastille was stormed ostensibly to free
prisoners - although there were only seven

48
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,019
in jail at the time - but mostly to get guns.

49
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,930
But the really radical move in the National
Assembly came on August 4, when they abolished

50
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,560
most of the Ancien Régime - feudal rights,
tithes, privileges for nobles, unequal taxation,

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,799
they were all abolished - in the name of writing
a new constitution.

52
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,799
And then, on August 26th, the National Assembly
proclaimed the Declaration of Rights of Man

53
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,469
and Citizen, which laid out a system of rights
that applied to every person, and made those

54
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:40,408
rights integral to the new constitution. That’s
quite different from the American bill of

55
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:43,798
rights, which was, like, begrudgingly tacked
on at the end and only applied to non-slaves.

56
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,500
The DoRoMaC, as I called it in high school,
declared that everyone had the right to liberty,

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,219
property, and security - rights that the French
Revolution would do an exceptionally poor

58
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,209
job of protecting, but as noted last week,
the same can be argued for many other supposedly

59
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,250
more successful revolutions. Okay, let’s
go to the Thought Bubble.

60
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,079
Meanwhile, back at Versailles, Louis XVI was
still King of France, and it was looking like

61
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,640
France might be a constitutional monarchy.
Which might've meant that the royal family

62
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,988
could hang on to their awesome house, but
then, in October of 1789, a rumor started

63
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,290
that Marie Antoinette was hoarding grain somewhere
inside the palace.

64
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,470
And in what became known as the Women's March,
a bunch of armed peasant women stormed the

65
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,550
palace and demanded that Louis and Marie Antoinette
move from Versailles to Paris. Which they

66
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,520
did, because everyone is afraid of armed peasant
women. And this is a nice reminder that to

67
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,659
many people at the time, the French Revolution
was not primarily about fancy Enlightenment

68
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,710
ideas; it was mostly about lack of food and
a political system that made economic contractions

69
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,219
hardest on the poor.

70
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,850
Now, a good argument can be made that this
first phase of the revolution wasn’t all

71
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,030
that revolutionary. The National Assembly
wanted to create a constitutional monarchy;

72
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,779
they believed that the king was necessary
for a functioning state and they were mainly

73
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,559
concerned that the voters and office holders
be men of property. Only the most radical

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,319
wing, the Jacobins, called for the creation
of a republic. But things were about to get

75
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,930
much more revolutionary - and also worse for
France.

76
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,240
First, the Jacobins had a huge petition drive
that got a bit unruly, which led troops controlled

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,740
not by the King but by the National Assembly
to fire on the crowd, killing 50 people. And

78
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,030
that meant that the National Assembly, which
had been the revolutionary voice of the people,

79
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,939
had killed people in an attempt to reign in
revolutionary fervor. You see this a lot throughout

80
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:31,120
history during revolutions. What looked like
radical hope and change suddenly becomes "The

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,040
Man" as increasingly radical ideas are embraced.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

82
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,210
Meanwhile, France’s monarchical neighbors
were getting a little nervous about all this

83
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:42,979
republic business, especially Leopold II,
who in addition to being the not holy, not

84
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,270
Roman, and not imperial Holy Roman Emperor,
was Marie Antoinette’s brother. I should

85
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:50,399
note, by the way, that at this point, the
Holy Roman Empire was basically just Austria.

86
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,589
Also, like a lot of monarchs, Leopold II liked
the idea of monarchies, and he wanted to keep

87
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:58,449
his job as a person who gets to stand around
wearing a dress, pointing at nothing, owning

88
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:03,279
winged lion-monkeys made out of gold. And who
can blame him? So he and King William Frederick II

89
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,799
of Prussia together issued the Declaration of Pillnitz,
which promised to restore the French monarchy.

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,319
At this point, Louis and the National Assembly
developed a plan: Let’s invade Austria.

91
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,990
The idea was to plunder Austria’s wealth
and maybe steal some Austrian grain to shore

92
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,730
up French food supplies, and also, you know,
spread revolutionary zeal. But what actually

93
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,210
happened is that Prussia joined Austria in
fighting the French. And then Louis encouraged

94
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:28,489
the Prussians, which made him look like an
enemy of the revolution, which, of course,

95
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,470
he was. And as a result, the Assembly voted
to suspend the monarchy, have new elections

96
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,410
in which everyone could vote (as long as they
were men), and create a new republican constitution.

97
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,000
Soon, this Convention decided to have a trial
for Louis XVI, who was found guilty and, by

98
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,589
one vote, sentenced to die via guillotine.
Which made it difficult for Austria and Prussia

99
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,369
to restore him to the throne. Oh, it’s time
for the open letter?

100
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,160
An Open Letter to the Guillotine. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment today.

101
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,660
Oh, there’s nothing. Oh my gosh, Stan! Jeez.
That’s not funny!

102
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,920
Dear Guillotine, I can think of no better example of
Enlightenment thinking run amok. Dr. Joseph Guillotine,

103
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,310
the inventor of the guillotine, envisioned
it as an egalitarian way of dying. They said

104
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,050
the guillotine was humane and it also made
no distinction between rich or poor, noble

105
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,340
or peasant. It killed equally.

106
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,899
You were also celebrated for taking the torture
out of execution. But I will remind you, you

107
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,829
did not take the dying out of execution. Unfortunately
for you, France hasn’t executed anyone since

108
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:31,649
1977. But you’ll be happy to know that the
last legal execution in France was via guillotine.

109
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:33,489
Plus, you’ve always got a future in horror
movies.

110
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,939
Best wishes, John Green

111
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:38,199
The death of Louis XVI marks the beginning
of The Terror, the best known or at least

112
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,459
the most sensational phase of the revolution.
I mean, if you can kill the king, you can

113
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,000
kill pretty much anyone, which is what the
government did under the leadership of the

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,920
Committee of Public Safety (Motto: We suck at
protecting public safety), led by Maximilien Robespierre.

115
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,230
The terror saw the guillotining of 16,000
enemies of the revolution including Marie

116
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,670
“I never actually said Let them eat cake”
Antoinette and Maximilien Robespierre himself,

117
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,710
who was guillotined in the month of Thermidor
in the year Two.

118
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:05,969
Alright, so while France was broke and fighting
in like nine wars, the Committee of Public

119
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,380
Safety changed the measurements of time because,
you know, the traditional measurements are

120
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:12,949
so irrational and religion-y. So they renamed
all the months and decided that every day

121
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,129
would have 10 hours and each hour 100 minutes.

122
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:19,159
And then, after the Terror, the revolution
pulled back a bit and another new constitution

123
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,800
was put into place, this one giving a lot
more power to wealthy people. At this point,

124
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,980
France was still at war with Austria and Britain,
wars that France ended up winning, largely

125
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,850
thanks to a little corporal named Napoleon
Bonaparte.

126
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,610
The war was backdrop to a bunch of coups and
counter coups that I won’t get into right

127
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,860
now because they were very complicated, but
the last coup that we’ll talk about, in

128
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,950
1799, established Napoleon Bonaparte as the
First Consul of France. And it granted him

129
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,629
almost unlimited executive power under yet
another constitution. And when he was declared

130
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:50,950
First Consul of France, Napoleon proclaimed
"Citizens! The revolution is established on

131
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,250
the principals with which it began. It is
over." By which he presumably meant that France’s

132
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,580
government had gone all the way from here
to here to here.

133
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,550
As with the American revolution, it’s easy
to conclude that France’s revolution wasn’t

134
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:06,279
all that revolutionary. I mean, Napoleon was
basically an emperor and, in some ways, he

135
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,089
was even more of an absolute monarch than
Louis XVI had been. Gradually the nobles came

136
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,509
back to France, although they had mostly lost
their special privileges. The Catholic Church

137
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:17,379
returned, too, although much weaker because
it had lost land and the ability to collect tithes.

138
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:21,789
And when Napoleon himself fell, France restored
the monarchy, and except for a four-year period,

139
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:27,849
between 1815 and 1870, France had a king who
was either a Bourbon or a Bonaparte.

140
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,980
Now, these were no longer absolute monarchs who
claimed that their right to rule came from

141
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,180
God; they were constitutional monarchs of
the kind that the revolutionaries of 1789

142
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,230
had originally envisioned. But the fact remains
that France had a king again, and a nobility,

143
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,070
and an established religion and it was definitely
not a democracy or a republic.

144
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,150
And perhaps this is why the French Revolution
is so controversial and open to interpretation.

145
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,549
Some argue the revolution succeeded in spreading
enlightenment ideals even if it didn’t bring

146
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,990
democracy to France. Others argue that the
real legacy of the Revolution wasn’t the

147
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,210
enhancement of liberty, but of state power.

148
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,980
Regardless, I’d argue that the French Revolution
was ultimately far more revolutionary than

149
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,779
its American counterpart. I mean, in some
ways, America never had an aristocracy, but

150
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,730
in other ways it continued to have one - the
French enlightenment thinker, Diderot, felt

151
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,960
that Americans should “fear a too unequal
division of wealth resulting in a small number

152
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,340
of opulent citizens and a multitude of citizens
living in misery.” And the American Revolution

153
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,889
did nothing to change that polarization of
wealth.

154
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:23,500
What made the French Revolution so radical
was its insistence on the universality of

155
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,379
its ideals. I mean, look at Article 6 of the
Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen:

156
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:32,299
“Law is the expression of the general will.
Every citizen has a right to participate personally,

157
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:38,659
or through his representative, in its foundation. It must
be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes.”

158
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:43,279
Those are radical ideas, that the laws come
from citizens, not from kings or gods, and

159
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,089
that those laws should apply to everyone equally.
That’s a long way from Hammurabi - and in

160
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,610
truth, it’s a long way from the slaveholding
Thomas Jefferson.

161
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,129
In the 1970s, Chinese President Zhou Enlai
was asked what the affects of the French Revolution

162
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:59,340
had been. And he said, “It’s too soon
to say.” And in a way, it still is. The

163
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,680
French Revolution asked new questions about
the nature of people’s rights and the derivation

164
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,069
of those rights. And we’re still answering
those questions and sorting through how our

165
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,460
answers should shape society today - must
government be of the people to be for the

166
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,600
people? Do our rights derive from nature or
from God or from neither? And what are those rights?

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,740
As William Faulkner said, “The past is never
dead. It’s not even past.” Thanks for

168
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,360
watching. I’ll see you next week.

169
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,320
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson,

170
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,030
the show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, our graphics

171
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,789
team is Thought Bubble, and we are ably interned
by Meredith Danko.

172
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:37,139
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Giant
Tea Bag"; if you want to suggest future phrases

173
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,500
of the week, or guess at this week's you can
do so in comments, where you can also ask

174
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,480
questions about today’s video that will
be answered by our team of historians.

175
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don’t Forget To Be Awesome.
