00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,360
Hi there my name’s John Green, this is Crash
Course World History and today we’re going

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,460
to talk about the Dark Ages, possibly
the most egregious Eurocentrism in all of history,

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,900
which is really saying something.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,310
(We’re Europe! The Prime Meridian Runs Through
us; We’re in the Middle of Every Map; and

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,730
We Get To Be a Continent Even Though Were
Not a Continent.)

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,530
But let’s begin today with a pop quiz:

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,030
What was the best year of your life, and what
was the worst year?

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,920
Mr. Green, Mr. Green: Best 1994, Worst 1990.

9
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,590
Oh, me from the past. It gets so much better,
and also so much worse.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,040
For worst year I’m gonna go with 2001; best
year 2006.

11
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,519
Alright now it’s your turn, dear pupils: share your
best and worst years in comments during the intro.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:50,500
[theme music]

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,479
Right, so what you will quickly find is that
your worst year was someone else’s best year.

14
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,829
So, too, with history.

15
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,039
The period between 600 and 1450 CE is often
called the Middle Ages in Europe because it

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,030
came between the Roman Empire—assuming you
forget the Byzantines—and the beginning

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,920
of the Modern Age.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,750
And it’s sometimes called the Dark Ages,
because it was purportedly unenlightened.

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,489
But was the age so dark?

20
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,890
Depends on what you find depressing.

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,340
If you like cities and great poetry, then
the Dark Ages were indeed pretty dark in Europe.

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,960
But if like me your two favorite things are
Not Dying From Wars and not dying from anything else,

23
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:25,170
the Dark Ages actually weren’t that bad—

24
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,430
at least until the plague came in the 14th
century.

25
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,360
And meanwhile, outside of Europe,

26
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,938
the Dark Ages were truly an Age of Enlightenment.But
we’ll get boring Europe out of the way first.

27
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:35,258
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,400
Medieval Europe had less trade, fewer cities, and
less cultural output than the Original Roman Empire.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,118
London and Paris were fetid firetraps with
none of the planning of sewage management

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,000
of places 5,000 years older like Mohenjo Daro
in the Indus Valley Civilization, let alone Rome.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,640
But with fewer powerful governments,

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,509
wars were at least smaller, which is one reason
why Europeans living in Medieval Times—

33
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,629
Uhh THOUGHT BUBBLE I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO
DO THAT.

34
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:06,040
Anyway, people in Medieval Times lived slightly
longer — life expectancy was 30 —

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,040
than Europeans during the Roman Empire — when life expectancy was 28.

36
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,539
Instead of centralized governments,

37
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:15,900
Europe in the middle ages had feudalism, a
political system based on reciprocal relationships

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,109
between lords, who owned lots of land, and
vassals,

39
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:23,669
who protected the land and got to dress up
as knights in exchange for pledging loyalty to the lords.

40
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:26,180
The lords were also vassals to more important
lords,

41
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,668
with the most important of all being the king.

42
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:30,239
Below the knights were peasants

43
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,769
who did the actual work on the land in exchange
for protection from bandits and other threats.

44
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,879
Feudalism was also an economic system,

45
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,968
with the peasants working the land and keeping
some of their production to feed themselves

46
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:44,938
while giving the rest to the landowner whose
land they worked.

47
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:48,918
The small scale, local nature of the feudal
system was perfect for a time and place where

48
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,359
the threats to peoples’ safety were also
small scale and local.

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,579
But of course, this system reinforces the status quo –

50
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:59,709
there’s little freedom and absolutely no
social mobility:

51
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,009
Peasants could never work their way up to
lords,

52
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,518
and they almost never left their villages.

53
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,480
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

54
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,218
One more point that’s very interesting from
a world history perspective:

55
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:12,959
this devolution from empire to localism has
happened in lots of places at lots of different times.

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,819
And in times of extreme political stress,

57
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:17,418
like after the fall of the Han dynasty in
China,

58
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:23,039
power tends to flow into the hands of local lords who
can protect the peasants better than the state can.

59
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,138
We hear about this a lot in Chinese history
and also in contemporary Afghanistan,

60
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,359
but instead of being called feudal lords,
these landlords are called warlords.

61
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,930
Eurocentrism striking again.

62
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,489
The other reason the Dark Ages are called
Dark

63
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,789
is because Europe was dominated by superstition

64
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:42,308
and by boring religious debates about like
how many angels can fit on the head of a pin.

65
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:43,248
And while there’s something to that,

66
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:46,180
the Middle Ages also saw theologians like
Thomas Aquinas,

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,629
who was quite an important philosopher,

68
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,748
And women like Hildegard of Bilgen,

69
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:54,908
who wrote all this important liturgical music and also
basically invented the genre of the morality play.

70
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:59,288
All that noted, things were certainly brighter 
in the Islamic world, or Dar al Islam.

71
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:00,818
So when we last left the Muslims,

72
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:04,968
they had expanded out of their homeland in
Arabia and conquered the rich Egyptian provinces

73
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:07,799
of the Byzantines and the entire Sassanian
empire,

74
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,459
all in the space of about 100 years.

75
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,118
The Umayyad Dynasty then expanded the empire
west to Spain and moved the capital to Damascus,

76
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:17,999
because it was closer to the action, empire-wise but still in Arabia.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
That was really important to the Umayyads

78
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:23,478
because they’d established this hierarchy in the
empire with Arabs like themselves at the top and in fact

79
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,128
they tried to keep Arabs from fraternizing
with non-Arab muslims throughout the Empire.

80
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,180
This of course annoyed the non-Arab Muslims, who were like,

81
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,579
“I don’t know if you’re reading the
same Quran we are, but this one says that

82
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:34,829
we’re all supposed to be equal.”

83
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:37,370
And pretty quickly the majority of Muslims
weren’t Arabs,

84
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,939
which made it pretty easy for them to overthrow
the Umayyads,

85
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:41,669
which they did in 750 CE.

86
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:44,668
Their replacements, the Abb(ah)sids, Abb(uh)sids? Hold On...

87
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,540
D’ahh, I’m right twice!

88
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,760
Right, so the Abbasids were from the Abb(ah)si or
the Abb(uh)-see family

89
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:55,609
which hailed from the Eastern and therefore
more Persian provinces of the Islamic Empire.

90
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,169
The Abbasids took over in 750 and no one could
fully defeat them —

91
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:02,759
until 1258, when they were conquered by — wait for it —

92
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,339
the Mongols.

93
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,679
The Abbasids kept the idea of a hereditary
monarchy,

94
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,110
but they moved the capital of the empire to
Baghdad,

95
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,150
and they were much more welcoming of other
non-Arab Muslims into positions of power.

96
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,060
And under the Abbasids,

97
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,228
the Dar al Islam took on a distinctly Persian
cast that it never really lost.

98
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:22,389
The Caliph now styled himself as a king of
kings,

99
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,788
just like the Achaemenids had,

100
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:26,829
and pretty soon the caliph’s rule was a
lot more indirect,

101
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:28,408
just like the original Persians’.

102
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:30,228
This meant that his control was much weaker,

103
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:35,029
and by about 1000CE , the Islamic Caliphate
which looks so incredibly impressive on a

104
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:38,619
map had really descended into a series of
smaller kingdoms,

105
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,259
each paying lip-service to the caliph in Baghdad.

106
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:44,759
This was partly because the Islamic Empire
relied more and more on soldiers from the

107
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,539
frontier, in this case Turks,

108
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,770
and also slaves pressed into military service,
in order to be the backbone of their army,

109
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:56,310
a strategy that has been tried over and over
again and has worked exactly zero times.

110
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,030
Which you should remember if you ever become
an emperor.

111
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:02,339
Actually our resident historian points out
that that strategy has worked--

112
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,748
if you are the Mongols.

113
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,689
More important than the Persian-style monarchy
that the Abbasids tried to set up was their

114
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:11,189
openness to foreigners and their ideas.

115
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:16,620
That tolerance and curiosity ushered in a golden age
of Islamic learning centered in Baghdad. The Abbasids

116
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,000
oversaw an efflorescence of culture unlike anything
that had been seen since Hellenistic times.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,480
Arabic replaced Greek not only as the language
of commerce and religion, but also of culture.

118
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,620
Philosophy, medicine, and poetry were all
written in Arabic

119
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,240
(although Persian remained an important literary
language.)

120
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,650
And Baghdad was the world’s center of scholarship
with its House of Wisdom and immense library.

121
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,519
Muslim scholars translated the works of the
Greek Philosophers including Aristotle and Plato

122
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,389
as well as scientific works by Hippocrates,
Archimedes

123
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,280
and especially the physician Galen.

124
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,039
And they translated and preserved Buddhist and
Hindu manuscripts that might have otherwise been lost.

125
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,460
Muslims made huge strides in medicine as well.

126
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:54,448
One Muslim scholar ibn Sina, wrote the Canon
of Medicine,

127
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:58,560
which became the standard medical textbook
or centuries in both Europe and the Middle East.

128
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
And the Islamic empire adopted mathematical
concepts from India

129
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,278
such as the zero, a number so fascinating
and beautiful

130
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:06,788
that we could write an entire episode about
it but instead

131
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:08,938
I’m just gonna write it a little love poem:

132
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,039
Oh, zero.

133
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:11,248
Pretty little zero.

134
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:15,889
They say you’re nothing but you mean everything
to mathematical history...and me.

135
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,918
Oh it’s time for the Open Letter?

136
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:23,500
An Open Letter to Science and Religion:

137
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,098
But first lets see what’s in the Secret
Compartment.

138
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:27,620
Oh, champagne poppers?

139
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,408
Stan, what am I supposed to do with these?

140
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,610
Dear Science and Religion,

141
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,879
You’re supposed to be so irreconcilable
and everything,

142
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,360
but not so much in the Abbasid Empire.

143
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,098
I mean, Muslim mathematicians expanded
math to such a degree

144
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:40,468
that we now call the base ten number system

145
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:43,629
and the symbols we use to denote it “Arabic
numerals.”

146
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,590
And religion was at least part of what pushed
all that learning forward.

147
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,448
Like the great philosopher Ibn Rushd argued
that

148
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:52,379
the only path to religious enlightenment was
through Aristotelian reasoning.

149
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,680
And Muslim mathematicians and astronomers
developed algebra

150
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,449
partly so they could simplify Islamic inheritance
law.

151
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,400
Plus they made important strides in trigonometry

152
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,329
so that people understand where to turn

153
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:03,168
when trying to turn toward Mecca.

154
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:05,459
You were working so well together, science
and religion,

155
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:10,058
but then like Al and Tipper Gore, just couldn’t
last forever.

156
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:13,519
Nothing gold can stay in this world, nothing
gold can stay.

157
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,099
Best wishes,
John Green

158
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,740
Baghdad wasn’t the only center of learning
in the Islamic world.

159
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,040
In Spain, Islamic Cordoba became a center
for the arts, especially architecture.

160
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,930
This is perhaps best exemplified by the Great
Mosque at Cordoba,

161
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,590
built by the Umayyad ruler Abd al-Rahman I
In 785-786 CE.

162
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,429
That’s right, this building,

163
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,389
still standing today and one of the most amazing
mosques in the world, was built in a year,

164
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,698
whereas medieval cathedrals typically took,
like, a million years to finish.

165
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:42,620
The Muslims of Spain were also engineers who
rivaled the Romans.

166
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,948
Aqueducts in Cordoba brought drinkable water
into the city,

167
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:49,069
and Muslim scholars took the lead in agricultural
science,

168
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,589
improving yields on all kinds of new crops,

169
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,569
allowing Spanish lives to be longer and less
hungry.

170
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:58,620
Everybody wanted to live in Spain, even the greatest Jewish philosopher, Maimonides,

171
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,139
wanted to live in Spain, but sadly he was
expelled and ended up in Alexandria Egypt.

172
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:07,240
There he wrote his awesomely titled defense
of rationality, A Guide for the Perplexed.

173
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,198
I’m translating the title, of course, because
the original text was written …in Arabic.

174
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,629
Meanwhile, China was having a Golden Age of
its own:

175
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:18,110
The Tang Dynasty made China’s government
more of a meritocracy,

176
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,490
and ruled over 80 million people across four
million square miles.

177
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,360
And they might’ve conquered all of Central
Asia

178
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,610
had it not been for the Abbasids, whom they
fought at

179
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,470
the most important Battle You’ve Never Heard
Of,

180
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,899
the Battle of the Talas River.

181
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,250
This was the Ali-Frasier of the 8th century.

182
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,839
The Abbasids won, which ended up defining
who had influence where with the --

183
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,350
with the Abbasids dominating to the west of
the river and China dominating to the east.

184
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,019
The Tang also produced incredible art that
was traded all throughout Asia.

185
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:50,019
Many of the more famous sculptures from the Tang
Dynasty feature figures who are distinctly not-Chinese,

186
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:52,519
which again demonstrates the diversity of
the empire.

187
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,899
The Tang was also a golden age for Chinese
poetry

188
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,278
with notables like Du Fu and Li Bo plying
their craft,

189
00:09:58,278 --> 00:09:59,958
encouraged by the official government.

190
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,979
And the Song Dynasty, which lasted from 960
to 1258,

191
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,800
kicked even more ass-it’s-not-cursing-if-you’re-talking-about-donkeys.

192
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,179
By the 11th century, Chinese metalworkers were producing as much
iron

193
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,699
as Europe would be able to produce in the
18th century.

194
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:14,059
Some of this iron was put to use in new plows,

195
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:15,659
which enabled agriculture to boom,

196
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,370
thereby supporting population growth.

197
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,278
Porcelain was of such high quality that it
was shipped throughout the world,

198
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:22,059
which is why we call it “china.”

199
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,719
And there was so much trade going on that
the Chinese ran out of metal for coins,

200
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,840
leading to another innovation – paper money.

201
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,740
And by the 11th century, the Chinese were
writing down recipes for

202
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,620
a mixture of saltpeter, sulfur and charcoal,

203
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,959
that we now know as gunpowder.

204
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,689
That becomes kind of a big deal in history,

205
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,079
paving the way, as it does,

206
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,809
for modern warfare and arena rock pyrotechnics,
and—

207
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,069
ohhhh, THAT’S WHY.

208
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,278
Not so dark after all.

209
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:52,999
Thanks for watching. We’ll see you next
week.
