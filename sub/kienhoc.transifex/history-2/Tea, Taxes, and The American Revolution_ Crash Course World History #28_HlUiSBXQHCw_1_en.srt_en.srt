00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,629
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History and today you aren't going to get

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:08,879
a blow by blow chronology of the American
Revolution, and you aren't going to get cool

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,510
biographical details about Thomas Jefferson
or George Washington. But you are going to

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,780
get me not wearing any pants.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,100
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Did you know that George
Washington might have had slave teeth

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,280
implanted into his jaw?

7
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:25,810
Yeah, I did, Me from the Past, and while it's
fun to focus on metaphorically resonant details,

8
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:29,729
what we're concerned with here is why the
American Revolution happened and the extent

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,429
to which it was actually revolutionary. Plus,
for the first time in Crash Course history,

10
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:38,079
I have a legitimate chance of getting through
an entire episode without butchering a single

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,118
pronunciation. Unfortunately, next week we
will be in France, and je parle français comme un idiot.

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:51,699
[theme music]

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,260
So, intellectual historians might put the
roots of the American Revolution earlier,

14
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,899
but I'm going to start with the end of the
7 Years War in 1763, which as you will recall

15
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,779
from last week was:
1. Expensive, and

16
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:07,450
2. A victory for the British, including British
subjects living in America, who now had more

17
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,618
land and therefore more money.

18
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:13,188
Right, so, in 1765 the British government
was like, “Hey, since we went into this

19
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:18,218
debt to get you all this new land, we trust
that you won't mind if we pass the Stamp Act,

20
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:22,838
in which we place a fancy stamp on your documents,
newspapers, playing cards, etc., and in return,

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,978
you give us money.”

22
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:27,739
Well, it turns out the colonists weren't so
keen on this, not so much because the tax

23
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:32,640
was high because they had no direct representation
in the parliament that had levied the tax.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,570
And plus, they were cranky about the Crown
keeping large numbers of British troops in

25
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,029
the colonies even after the end of the 7 Years
War.

26
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,478
And then the British government was like,
“You are inadequately grateful,” and the

27
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:44,298
colonists were like, “Shut up we hate you,”
and the British government was like, “As

28
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:48,780
long as you live under our roof, you live
by our rules,” and so on, but eventually

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,819
the British backed down and repealed the Stamp
Act. The repeal inspired a line of commemorative

30
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,159
teapots, thereby beginning America's storied
tradition of worthless collectible ceramics.

31
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,639
But, in the end, this only emboldened the
colonists when the British tried to put new

32
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:04,849
taxes on the Americans in the form of the
Townshend Acts. These led to further protests

33
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:08,669
and boycotts and most importantly, more organization
among the colonists.

34
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,339
The protests escalated: 1770 saw the Boston
Massacre, which with its sum total of five

35
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,400
dead was perhaps the least massacrey massacre
of all time, and in 1773, a bunch of colonists

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
dumped about a million dollars worth of tea
into Boston Harbor, in protest of British

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,099
government decisions that actually would have
made British tea cheaper. Oh it's time for

38
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:27,518
the open letter?

39
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,040
Ah... oh, that did not go well. An Open Letter
to Tea. But first, let's see what's in the

40
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:41,149
secret compartment today. Oh, it's a gigantic
teabag. Hm. Let's see what flavor it is...

41
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:42,699
Bitter tyranny variety!

42
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,810
Dear Tea,
Like all Americans who love justice and freedom,

43
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,098
I hate you. But I understand you're quite
popular in the UK where the East India Company

44
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:50,829
would periodically go to war for you.

45
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,730
But, what fascinates me about you, tea, I
mean, aside from the fact that people choose

46
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:57,539
to drink you when there are great American
refreshments available, like Mountain Dew,

47
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,169
is that even though you're stereotypically
English, you're not English. It's Chinese,

48
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:04,958
or Burmese, or Indian. No one really knows,
but it's definitely not English. You didn't

49
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,098
even have tea until, like, the 1660s. Posers.

50
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:10,500
Best wishes, John Green

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,250
So, The Boston Tea Party led to further British
crackdowns and then mobilization of colonial

52
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,840
militias and then Paul Revere and then actual
war, but you can hear all about that stuff

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,009
on, like, TV miniseries. I want to focus on
one of the ways that colonists protested unfair

54
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,949
taxation. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

55
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:29,259
As previously noted, the English Crown benefited
tremendously from the import of consumer goods

56
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:33,729
to the American colonies, and one of the most
effective ways American colonists could protest

57
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,578
taxation without representation was by boycotting
British products.

58
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,579
In order to enforce these boycotts, the protesters
created Committees of Correspondence, which

59
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,480
spread information about who was and was not
observing the boycotts. And these committees

60
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,878
also could coerce non-compliers into compliance
- which is to say that they were creating

61
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:53,408
and enforcing policy, kind of like a government
does.

62
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:56,449
The Maryland Committee of Correspondence,
in fact, was instrumental in setting up the

63
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,468
first Continental Congress, which convened
to coordinate a response to the fighting that

64
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:05,199
started in 1775. This was back when congresses
did things, by the way. It was awesome.

65
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,268
Anyway, the Continental Congress is most famous
for drafting and approving the Declaration

66
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,870
of Independence. No, Thought Bubble. That's
the Will Smith vehicle Independence Day. I

67
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,230
mean the Declaration of Independence. Right,
that one. It's not your fault, you guys are

68
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,819
Canadian. You've never declared independence.
Worth noting, by the way, that the congress

69
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:26,009
edited out more than a quarter of Jefferson's
original declaration, and he forever after

70
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:28,329
insisted they’d "mangled" it.

71
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:32,289
Anyway, I would argue the heavy lifting of
the American Revolution was already done by

72
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,300
the Declaration. In truth, by the time the
shooting started, most of the colonists were

73
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,290
already self-governing and had developed a
sense of themselves as something separate

74
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,040
and different from Great Britain - as evidenced
by these "Committees of Correspondence," which

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,710
functioned as shadow governments - eventually
reaching out to foreign governments, establishing

76
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:52,680
an espionage network, tarring and feathering
loyalists and royal officials which, by the

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,360
way is incredibly painful and dangerous to
the victim, and even recruiting physicians

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,020
to tell American men that drinking British tea would
make them weak and effeminate.

79
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,099
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

80
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,220
Now, despite all this, about 20% of colonists
remained loyal to Great Britain throughout

81
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,600
the war, especially in the major cities that
Britain occupied. Also lots of slaves continued

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,629
to support the British, especially after Britain
promised that any slaves who fought with them

83
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:14,579
would be freed.

84
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,719
And it's worth noting that while we generally
celebrate the Revolution and see it as a step

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,040
toward justice and equality, the people who
most needed the protection of a government

86
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,500
might have been better off and more free,
if Britain had won. Especially since Britain

87
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,240
ended slavery well before America did, and,
you know, without a civil war.

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,250
Also, even though most Americans had come
to see themselves as separate from Britain

89
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,930
before 1776, the British certainly didn't
see it that way. They continued to fight either

90
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,980
until 1781 or 1783, depending on whether you
calculate by when they actually gave up or

91
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,480
when the peace treaty was signed.

92
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,850
So you can't really say the American Revolution
was won before the fighting even started.

93
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,610
But the truth is, the American Revolution
and the war for independence weren’t like

94
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,439
this. They were like this.

95
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,360
So, here's what was pretty revolutionary about
the American Revolution: The colonists threw

96
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,420
off the rule of an imperial monarchy and replaced
it with a government that didn't have a king,

97
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,319
a radical idea in a world that didn't feature
many non-monarchical forms of government.

98
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,069
And, if you look at the explanations for the
revolution, especially those contained in,

99
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,699
like, the Declaration of Independence and
in pamphlets, like Thomas Paine's Common Sense,

100
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,659
there's definitely a revolutionary zeal that’s
informed by the Enlightenment. And that's

101
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,840
especially true if you focus on the idea of
liberty, as many of the pamphleteers did.

102
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,369
That said, if you look at the actual outcome
of the revolution, aside from the whole no

103
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,930
king thing, it wasn't that revolutionary.
Let's look, for instance, at two ideas central

104
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,389
to the revolution: property rights and equality.

105
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,879
So the Articles of Confederation gave the
government no power to tax, which had the

106
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,899
effect of making sure that people who had
property were able to keep it because they

107
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,279
never had to pay the government anything in
exchange for the right to own and use it.

108
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,389
And that's very different from taxation systems
dating all the way back to, like, Mesopotamia

109
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:49,430
and Ancient Egypt.

110
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,079
And it's probably not a coincidence that most
of the writers and signers of the Declaration

111
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,979
of Independence were men of property, and
they wanted to keep it that way. So, basically,

112
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,590
the white guys who controlled the land and
its production before the American Revolution

113
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,879
were the same white guys who controlled it
after the American Revolution.

114
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,819
And this leads us to the second, and more
important way that as a revolution, the American

115
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,079
one falls a bit short. So, if you've ever
studied American history, you're probably

116
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,669
familiar with the greatest line in the Declaration
of Independence: “We hold these truths to

117
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,509
be self-evident, that all men are created
equal.” Sorry, ladies.

118
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,550
And, you also may know that at the time those
words were written, a large segment of the

119
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,220
American population, perhaps as much as 30%,
were slaves of African descent who were held

120
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,540
as property and were definitely, 100% not
treated as equal to whites. In fact, the guy

121
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,260
who wrote those words held slaves, and was
fighting against a government who promised

122
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,670
to free any slaves who supported it.

123
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,360
Furthermore, women couldn't vote, and neither
could white men who didn't own enough property

124
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,449
- meaning that the government of, for, and
by the people was, in fact of, for, and by

125
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,469
about 10-15% of the people.

126
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,300
But here's the real question: Was the American
Revolution what the historian Jonathan Israel

127
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,650
called “a revolution of mind?” Did it
change the way we think about what people

128
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:08,669
are and how we should organize ourselves?
Addressing those questions will involve a

129
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,790
brief foray into the history of ideas. Let's
study the Enlightenment!

130
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,340
The Enlightenment was primarily a celebration
of humans' ability to understand and improve

131
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:20,159
the natural world through reason. The Enlightenment
had a number of antecedents, including the

132
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,820
European Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution,
but what made it special was that some of

133
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,199
its more radical proponents - like, Immanuel
Kant, for instance - went so far as to argue

134
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,789
that human reason rendered a belief in God
unnecessary and, by extension, proclaimed

135
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:36,990
that any belief in divine intervention or
a divine plan for humanity was just superstition.

136
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,829
Given that this was coming out of an overwhelmingly
Christian Europe, this was a pretty controversial

137
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:44,659
suggestion, and not all Enlightenment thinkers
would go that far. And more moderate Enlightenment

138
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:48,600
thinkers were also more willing to countenance
hierarchical social and political structures.

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,350
Like John Locke, a major Enlightenment thinker,
formulated his version of inalienable rights

140
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,949
as life, liberty, and property. And that's
much more traditional than arguing, for instance,

141
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:58,250
that property should be held communally.

142
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,958
And it's no coincidence that the more moderate
Enlightenment thinkers, like Locke and Adam

143
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,219
Smith, happened to be British, and the real
radicals were French. And the founders of

144
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,350
the United States, were far more closely linked
to those British Enlightenment thinkers than

145
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,879
to the French, who influenced the French Revolution,
which as we will see next week, goes swimmingly.

146
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,970
But even if the government that America's
revolutionaries came up with didn't overturn

147
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,490
privilege or tear apart the social order as
the French Revolution tried to do, it did

148
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,639
make significant changes. America made sure
that there would never be a formal nobility,

149
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,669
except for the Count of Chocula.

150
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:31,419
And, it recognized the equal rights of daughters
and widows, when it came to inheriting and

151
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:35,149
possessing property. Also, it created a world
in which future countesses could rehabilitate

152
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,389
their reputations in New York.

153
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,459
But, the real seismic change was that after
the Revolution, Americans came to view themselves

154
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:45,250
as equal to each other. And, in the context
of the 18th century, that was pretty radical.

155
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,610
"Ordinary Americans came to believe that no
one in a basic down-to-earth and day-in-and-day-out

156
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,079
manner was really better than anyone else.
That was equality as no other nation had ever

157
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,568
quite had it."

158
00:09:57,568 --> 00:10:01,360
And in the end, the ideas of the American
revolution - ideas about property and equality

159
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,850
and representation - are still hugely important
in shaping political discourse around the

160
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,528
world, and particularly in America. And by
America, I mean the United States. I'm sorry

161
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:14,549
Canadians and Mexicans and Central Americans
and South Americans. We're provincial, okay?

162
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:18,559
I mean, here in the United States, our Presidential
candidates must both know how to wear a suit

163
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,309
and how to bowl.

164
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:22,649
But the American Revolution also reminds us
- as the French one will next week - that

165
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:27,379
revolutionary ideas and values are not always
easy to live up to. Nothing challenges one's

166
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:31,709
belief in equality quite like becoming rich
and powerful. Indeed, rare is the revolutionary

167
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:36,399
who doesn't become, on some level, like Orwell's
pigs, insisting that while all animals were

168
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,769
created equal, some were created more equal
than others.

169
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:42,769
In short, if you're going to base your new
society on philosophy, you should try to found

170
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,799
it on ideals that are as inclusive and humanistic
as possible - because the people executing

171
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:53,159
those ideas will never be ideal. Thanks for
watching. I’ll see you next week.

172
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,578
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson,

173
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:00,649
the show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, our graphics

174
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,360
team is Thought Bubble, and we are ably interned
by Meredith Danko.

175
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,278
Last week's phrase of the week was "Historian
Feuds." If you want to suggest future phrases

176
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,259
of the week, or guess at this one you can
do so in comments, where you can also ask

177
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:13,379
questions about today's video that will be
answered by our team of historians.

178
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,649
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
