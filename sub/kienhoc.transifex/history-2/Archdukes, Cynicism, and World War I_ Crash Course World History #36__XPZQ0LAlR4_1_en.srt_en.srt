00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re gonna talk

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,620
about World War I. The so-called, Great War?

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,960
World War I wasn’t the most destructive
war, or the first total war, and it certainly

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:17,030
wasn’t - despite its billing - the war to
end all wars. But it was the war to change

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,780
all wars. World War I changed our outlook,
it normalized cynicism and irony, which, I

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,880
think you’ll agree, are kind of dominant lenses for
describing our world today. Basically, I’d argue

7
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,960
that World War I helped make possible everything from
The Simpsons to intentionally unattractive mustaches.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,000
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! are you referring to
me?

9
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:37,489
Oh, Me From the Past, you’re an embarrassment
to our family. Also to all our other selves.

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:46,590
[theme music]

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,519
Most people think of World War I as a tragedy
because it didn’t need to happen and didn’t

12
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:54,588
really accomplish much, except for creating
social and economic conditions that made World

13
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:59,600
War II possible. So when we talk about the causes of
the war, inevitably, we’re also assigning blame.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,159
The immediate cause was, of course, the assassination
in Sarajevo of the Austrian Archduke Franz

15
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,190
Ferdinand on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian Serb
nationalist named Gavrilo Princip. Quick aside:

16
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:14,620
It’s worth noting that the first big war
of the 20th century began with an act of terrorism.

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,480
So Franz Ferdinand wasn’t particularly well-liked
by his uncle, the Emperor Franz Joseph - now

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,719
that is a mustache! But even so, the assassination
led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,

19
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,969
whereupon Serbia accepted some, but not all,
of Austria’s demands, leading Austria to

20
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:32,989
declare war against Serbia. And then Russia,
due to its alliance with the Serbs, then mobilized

21
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:37,769
its army; Germany, because it had an alliance
with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing,

22
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:42,280
which Russia failed to do, so then Germany
mobilized its own army, declared war on Russia,

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,180
cemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then
declared war on France, because, you know, France.

24
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,660
Germany’s War plan, the Schlieffen Plan,
required that it invade France in the most

25
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:55,259
expedient way possible, which as you can see
is via Belgium, And Great Britain was a friend

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,580
of Belgium - I mean, as much as anyone can be a friend
of Belgium - and so they declared war on Germany.

27
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,700
So by August 4th, all the major powers of
Europe are at war with each other. By the

28
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:07,149
end of the month, Japan, honoring its alliance
with Britain, would be at war with Germany

29
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,938
and Austria as well. When all was said and
done, counting colonies and spheres of influence,

30
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:16,209
the world map would eventually look like this.
You’ll never guess who wins.

31
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,239
So there were many opportunities NOT to mobilize
and declare war, none of which were taken.

32
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,989
Some blame the web of alliances itself, which
is what Woodrow Wilson tried to fix with the

33
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:27,400
League of Nations. Some blame Russia, the
first big country to mobilize. Some blame

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,968
Germany for the inflexibility of the Schlieffen
Plan. Leninists claim war grew out of imperialism

35
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:35,530
and was fueled by capitalist rivalries; and
others claim it was a war between Germany’s

36
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,408
radical modernism and Britain’s traditional
conservatism.

37
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,848
But if I had to assign blame, I’d go with
the alliance system and the cultural belief

38
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:47,589
that war was, in general, good for nations.
War helped define who was "them" and who was

39
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,468
"us", and doing that strengthened the idea
of us. And before World War I, war was perceived

40
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:55,068
to be necessary and often even glorious.

41
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:59,248
The trench warfare on the Western Front is
most famous for its brutal futility - Great

42
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:04,199
Britain and France on one side, Germany on
the other, with no man’s land between. World

43
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,988
War I was a writer’s war, and there’s
a lot of metaphorical resonance in living

44
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,158
men digging holes where they would in time
die. The lines of trenches on the Western

45
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,929
Front covered only about 400 miles as the
crow flies, but because of the endless zigzagging,

46
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,879
the trenches themselves may have run as much
as 25,000 miles.

47
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,768
But the stalemate of trench warfare wasn’t
seen on every front. Especially at the beginning

48
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,590
of the war, there was a lot of offensive movement,
especially in the initial German strikes,

49
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,709
especially on the Eastern Front, the Germans
were pretty successful against the Russians,

50
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,650
who had a large but pretty hapless army. Also,
for those blessed few of you who sat through

51
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,859
all of Lawrence of Arabia, you’ll remember
that T. E. Lawrence’s exploits took place

52
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:41,829
in the context of World War I, with the British
battling the Ottomans.

53
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:46,409
This brings up an important point: World War
I featured combatants from around the world

54
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:51,858
- Britain’s army, especially, included soldiers
from India, Africa, Australia, New Zealand,

55
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:55,760
and Canada, who was just happy to be invited.
Africans served with the French, and for a

56
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,359
lot of these people, their experiences helped
build nationalist movements when survivors

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,780
returned home after the war.

58
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:05,429
That’s about as close as we get to a silver
lining. The war itself was incredibly destructive.

59
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,620
Over 15 million people were killed and over
20 million wounded. In France, 13.3% of the

60
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,259
male population between the age of 15 and
49 died in the war. The war also saw a lot

61
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,329
of civilians die, especially in the Ottoman
Empire where more than 2 million of the 3

62
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,530
million people killed were non-combatants.

63
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,529
But like so many other wars, World War I’s
most efficient killer was disease. Stupid

64
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:31,119
disease, always hijacking history. Dysentery,
typhus, and cholera were rampant, and otherwise

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,430
minor injuries would prove fatal when gangrene
set in. I mean, 25% of arm wounds among German

66
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,228
soldiers were fatal. And that’s not even
to mention the famous influenza epidemic that

67
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:46,019
broke out toward the end of the war, which
killed three times as many people as the war itself.

68
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,560
The main reason the war was so deadly was
the combination of new technology and outdated

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,839
tactics. While we may think about tanks, airplanes
and poison gas, all of which made their debut

70
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,649
in the First World War, the two most devastating
technologies were American: machine guns and

71
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,500
barbed wire. Attempting to march in lines
towards an enemy’s trench, soldiers of both

72
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,079
sides were mowed down by machine gun fire.

73
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,300
According to one German machine gunner at
the battle of the Somme in 1916, “The [British]

74
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,490
officers went in front. I noticed one of them
walking calmly, carrying a walking stick.

75
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,250
When we started firing we just had to load
and reload. They went down in their hundreds.

76
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,199
You didn’t have to aim, we just fired into
them.” At the Somme, the British lost 60,000

77
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,449
men in the first day of fighting. Remember
the old colonialist verse, “Whatever happens

78
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:35,020
/ we have got / the maxim gun / and they have
not”? Yeah, well, now everybody had machine guns.

79
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,519
One of the things we try to remember here
at Crash Course is that people both make history

80
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,889
and are made by it. World War I brings this
fact into stark relief because we know so

81
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,478
much about the soldiers who fought in it,
and how they wrote about the war really changed

82
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:49,568
our relationship with systemic violence.

83
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:54,180
For most soldiers, there was nothing glamorous
or heroic about this war. For the British,

84
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,240
for example, the trenches were two things
above all: wet and smelly. The dampness came

85
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,780
from the fact that the British trenches were
in the wettest part of Flanders. The smell

86
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,339
was mainly decomposing flesh. Nothing glorious
about that.

87
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:10,119
On the upside, soldiers were at least rarely
hungry, and there was a lot of food from home,

88
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,610
which is worth underscoring, because it reminds
us that home wasn’t very far away. Even

89
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,348
for the British, at their closest the front
was only 70 miles from England. They could

90
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:22,269
read newspapers from London one day later
than Londoners could.

91
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:26,620
While going “over the top” - Stan, no
puns in this episode! - Right, while going

92
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,050
“over the top” of the trench to cross
no-man’s land and attack the enemy trench

93
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,120
is what lights our romantic imagination, most
soldiers’ lives were dominated by the fear

94
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,280
of shelling. According to a journal published
by French soldiers: “There’s nothing more

95
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,538
horrible in war than being shelled. It’s
a form of torture that the soldier can’t

96
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:47,348
see the end of. Suddenly he’s afraid of
being buried alive... The man stays put in

97
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:51,779
his hole, helplessly waiting for, hoping for,
a miracle.”

98
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,438
Although soldiers then, as now, lived under
conditions it's difficult to imagine, there

99
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,819
was more than even the threat of death to
distress them. According to German officer

100
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:04,110
Ernst Jünger, it was not “danger, however
extreme … that depresses the spirit of men,

101
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,658
so much as over-fatigue and wretched conditions.”
And for most soldiers, especially the British

102
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:12,860
and French, the pay for their efforts was
pitiful. So why did they even keep fighting?

103
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,439
Duty, nationalism, loyalty to comrades, and
fear of being shot for desertion all played a role.

104
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,360
But so did alcohol. As one British medical
officer said: “Had it not been for the rum

105
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,590
ration, I do not think we should have won
the war.” Ernst Jünger also remarked on

106
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:28,989
the propensity of soldiers to drink their
troubles away: “Though ten out of twelve

107
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,449
had fallen, still the last two, as sure as
death, were to be found on the first evening

108
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,288
of rest over the bottle drinking a silent
health to their dead ‘companions’ ”.

109
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:45,930
Oh, it’s time for the open letter? Whew!
An open letter to alcohol. I wonder what’s

110
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,199
in today’s secret compartment.

111
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,360
Oh, shocking, it’s a golf club. And an actual
disco golf ball made by a crash course fan!

112
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,598
Dear Alcohol - oh, that’s...
Like disease, you’ve been a key figure in

113
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,709
human history, despite not actually being
a person, and for millennia, you’ve played

114
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:07,819
an important role in war, often helping soldiers
do their duty, often distracting them from it.

115
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:13,038
But here’s the thing, alcohol, in my experience,
which is extensive, if you need to be drunk

116
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,779
to do something, you should maybe not do the
thing. Unless of course, the thing is golf.

117
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,429
Best wishes, John Green.

118
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,759
So what did we take away from the so-called Great
War? Well, not much. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

119
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,439
The Treaty of Versailles, which ended World
War I, fixed the blame for the war on Germany,

120
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,750
which proved ruinous to the German economy
and destructive to its political institutions.

121
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,339
And unless you’re really nostalgic for totalitarian
communism, you’ve gotta say that World War

122
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,829
I was also a disaster for Russia, because
it facilitated the rise of the Bolsheviks.

123
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:46,789
The Russian Revolution had two phases. In
the first phase, called the February Revolution,

124
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:50,639
because get this, it occurred in February,
army mutinies and civil unrest forced the

125
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,558
overthrow of the Romanov dynasty which had
been in power in Russia since, like, forever,

126
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,339
to use a proper historian term.

127
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,459
The monarchy was replaced by a provisional
government led (eventually) by Alexander Kerensky,

128
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,879
which made the terrible decision to keep Russia
in the war, which led to the October Revolution,

129
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,610
so called because it happened in October,
in which Vladimir Lenin and his Bolsheviks

130
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,250
took over, famously promising the Russian
people “peace, bread, and land.” To which

131
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,679
the Russian people responded, “Hey, you
just named of our three favorite things.”

132
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,250
Lenin’s first big achievement was signing
a separate peace with Germany and getting

133
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,309
Russia out of the war, which was helpful to
him since he needed to fight a civil war that

134
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:32,179
wouldn’t end until 1922. This might’ve
helped Germany, too, except the US entered

135
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,859
the war on the side of the British and the
French.

136
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,820
Which led to another outcome of the war: increased
geopolitical influence for the U.S. The U.S.

137
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,690
was already becoming a major economic power,
and being able to avoid the destruction and

138
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,260
loss of manpower associated with World War
I certainly didn’t hurt. The war helped

139
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:51,399
catapult the U.S. from being a debtor nation
to a creditor one, and Wilson’s leading

140
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,799
role in the negotiations at Versailles – even
though he actually didn’t get what he wanted

141
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,059
– made America a big player on the world
stage for the first time. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

142
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,039
So just so we don’t get completely Eurocentric,
another major outcome of the war was the end

143
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,730
of the Ottoman Empire and the emergence of
the nation-state of Turkey. The rest of the

144
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,720
world saw some change too, but not much for
the better. In Africa, Britain took Germany’s

145
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,920
colonies, and even though Indians fought and
died in a higher percentage than Americans

146
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,059
in World War I, India didn’t gain any real
autonomy.

147
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,059
All these terrible outcomes led to a general
sense of disappointment in literary circles,

148
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:26,669
And this feeling of pointlessness and cynicism
was expressed by the writers of the “lost

149
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:30,750
generation.” It was a war full of loss:
Millions of people were lost. Traditional

150
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,379
ideals of war’s nobility and heroism were
lost as well: I mean, what is heroism when

151
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,059
you’re just sitting in a trench, waiting
to be blown up?

152
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:43,879
And after World War I, war might be necessary,
but it would never again be glorious. We see

153
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,600
this shift in the writing and art that emerged
from the Great War as artists transitioned

154
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,449
from romanticism to modernism. Think of Hemingway’s
The Sun Also Rises, which is about a men rendered

155
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:57,549
not noble but impotent by war. This dark,
cruel irony here - you go to war to become

156
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:03,519
a man and war takes away the organ often called
“your manhood” - that defined Hemingway’s

157
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,929
worldview. And it also defines ours.

158
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:08,888
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

159
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:12,690
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Meredith

160
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,769
Danko, our Associate Producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

161
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,149
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics
team is Thought Bubble.

162
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,539
Last week’s phrase of the week was "unless
you are the Mongols" (we brought it back for

163
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:25,599
you), if you’d like to suggest future phrases
of the week, or guess at this week’s, you can

164
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,379
do so in comments, where you can also ask questions
that will be answered by our team of historians.

165
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:34,399
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and, as we
say in my hometown, Don’t Forget To Be Awesome.
