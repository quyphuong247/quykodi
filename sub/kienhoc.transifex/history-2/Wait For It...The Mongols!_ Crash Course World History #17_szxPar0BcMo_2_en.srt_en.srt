00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,559
Hi I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re gonna discuss…

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,820
wait for it… THE MONGOLS.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,560
So you probably have a picture of the Mongols
in your head. Yes, that’s the picture: brutal,

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,160
bloodthirsty, swarthy, humorously mustachioed
warriors riding the plains, wearing fur, eating

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,039
meat directly off the bone, saying, "Bar bar
bar bar bar bar bar". In short, we imagine

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,410
the Mongol empire as stereotypically barbarian.
And that’s not entirely wrong.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,660
But if you’ve been reading recent world
history textbooks like we here at Crash Course

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,670
have, you might have a different view of the
Mongols, one that emphasizes the amazing speed

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,629
and success of their conquests — how they
conquered more land in 25 years than the Romans

10
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:44,759
did in 400. How they controlled more than
11 million contiguous square miles. And you

11
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,048
may even have read that the Mongols basically
created nations like Russia and even Korea.

12
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,459
One historian has even claimed that the Mongols,
“smashed the feudal system” and created

13
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:56,329
international law. Renowned for their religious
tolerance, the Mongols, in this view, created

14
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:01,239
the first great free trade zone, like a crazy
medieval Eurasian NAFTA. And that’s not

15
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:04,558
entirely wrong either. Stupid truth, always
resisting simplicity.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:13,340
[theme music]

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,100
So remember herders? We talked about them
back in episode one as an alternative to hunting

18
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,039
and gathering or agriculture. Here are the
key things to remember:

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,090
1. Nomads aren’t Jack Kerouac: They don’t
just go on like random road trips. They migrate

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,820
according to climate conditions so they can
feed their flocks.

21
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,559
2. Nomads don’t generally produce manufactured
goods which means they need to trade, so they

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,590
almost always live near settled people.

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,760
And 3. Because they live in generally live
close to nature and in harsh conditions, pastoralists

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,790
tend to be tougher than diamond-plated differential
calculus. Like, think of the Huns, or the

25
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,760
Xiongnu. Or the Mongols. Okay, Stan. That’s
enough. Back to me. Stan. I AM THE STAR OF

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,450
THIS SHOW NOT THE MONGOLS!!! Hi. Sorry about
that.

27
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,439
Right, so one last thing: pastoral people
also tend to be more egalitarian, especially

28
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,530
where women are concerned. Paradoxically,
when there’s less to go around, humans tend

29
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,530
to share more, and when both men and women
must work for the social order to survive,

30
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,439
there tends to be less patriarchal domination
of women. Although Mongol women rarely went

31
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,379
to war. I can’t tell your gender. I mean
you’ve got the pants, but then you also

32
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,699
have the floopity flop, so… That’s the
technical term, by the way. I’m a historian.

33
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,039
If you had to choose a pastoral nomadic group
to come out of central Asia and dominate the

34
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,638
world, you probably wouldn’t have chosen
the Mongols. Because for most of the history

35
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,049
we’ve been discussing, they just hung out
in the foothills bordering the Siberian forest,

36
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:27,389
mixing herding and hunting, quietly getting
really good at archery and riding horses.

37
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:30,849
Also, the Mongols were much smaller than other
pastoral groups like the Tatars or the Uyghurs.

38
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:34,328
And not to get like all Great Man History
on you or anything, but the reason the Mongols

39
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:39,840
came to dominate the world really started with one
guy, Genghis Khan. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,359
The story goes that Genghis or Chingus Khan
was born around 1162 with the name Temüjin

41
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:48,040
to a lowly clan. His father was poisoned to
death, leaving Temüjin under the control

42
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,989
of his older brothers, one of whom he soon
killed during an argument. By 19 he was married

43
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:57,528
to his first and most important wife, Börte,
who was later kidnapped. This was pretty common

44
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:01,408
among the Mongols, Temüjin’s mom had also
been kidnapped. In rescuing his wife, Temüjin

45
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:05,328
proved his military mettle and he soon became
a leader of his tribe, but uniting the Mongol

46
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:10,729
confederations required a civil war, which
he won, largely thanks to two innovations.

47
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:15,800
First, he promoted people based on merit rather
than family position, and second, he brought

48
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:20,899
lower classes of conquered people into his
own tribe while dispossessing the leaders

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,819
of the conquered clans. Thus he made the peasants
love him. The rich hated him — but they

50
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:29,098
didn’t matter anymore, because they were
no longer rich.

51
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:33,078
With these two building block policies, Temüjin
was able to win the loyalty of more and more

52
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,409
people and in 1206 he was declared the Great
Khan, the leader of all the Mongols. How?

53
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:42,019
Well, the Mongols chose their rulers in a
really cool way. A prospective ruler would

54
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,569
call a general council called a kurultai,
and anyone who supported his candidacy for

55
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:50,649
leadership would show up on their horses,
literally voting with their feet.

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,289
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green! But horses
don’t have feet they have hooves.

57
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:57,078
I hate you, Me From the Past. Also, NO INTERRUPTING
THE THOUGHT BUBBLE!

58
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,419
After uniting the Mongols, Genghis Khan went
on to conquer a lot of territory. By the time

59
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:07,579
he died in his sleep in 1227, his empire stretched
from the Mongol homeland in Mongolia all the

60
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,510
way to the Caspian Sea. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

61
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:13,370
So that’s a pretty good looking empire,
and sure a lot of it was pasture or mountains

62
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,230
or desert, but the Mongols did conquer a lot
of people, too. And in some ways with Genghis’

63
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,620
death, the empire was just getting started.
His son Ögedei Khan expanded the empire even

64
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,399
more. And Genghis’ grandson Möngke was
the Great Khan in 1258 when Baghdad, the capitol

65
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,609
of the Abbasid Empire, fell to the Mongols.
And another of Genghis’ grandsons, Kublai

66
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,980
Khan, conquered the Song Dynasty in China
in 1279. And if the Mamluks hadn’t stopped

67
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,960
another of Genghis’ grandsons at the battle
of Ain Jalut, they probably would have taken

68
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:46,199
all of North Africa. Genghis Khan sure had
a lot of grandkids… It must be time for the open letter.

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,480
An Open Letter To Genghis Khan’s Descendants.
But first, let’s check what’s in the secret

70
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,080
compartment today. Oh. A noisemaker and champagne
poppers? Stan, you know I suck at these. What's

71
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:04,120
all this for? Ohhh, it’s because it’s a BIRTHDAY PARTY!!
YAY. Happy birthday to Genghis Khan’s descendants.

72
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,319
How do I know it’s your birthday, Genghis
Khan’s descendants? Because every day is

73
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:14,129
your birthday. Because right now on the planet
Earth, there are 16 million direct descendants

74
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:19,909
of Genghis Khan, meaning that every day is
the birthday of 43,000 of them. So, good news,

75
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,730
Genghis Khan: Your empire might be gone, but
your progeny lives on. And on, and on, and

76
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,560
on. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,959
Best wishes, John Green

78
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,919
Unfortunately for the Mongols, those guys
weren’t always working together, because

79
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,300
Genghis Khan failed to create a single political
unit out of his conquests. Instead, after

80
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,300
Genghis’ death, the Mongols were left with
four really important Empires called Khanates:

81
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,970
The Yuan Dynasty in China, the Il-Khanate
in Persia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central

82
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,500
Asia, and the Khanate of the Golden Horde
in Russia.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,720
If you remember all the way back to the Hellenistic
period, this is similar to what happened to

84
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,240
another good general who wasn’t much for
administration, Alexander the Great. Also,

85
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,269
neither of them ever conquered India.

86
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:01,939
The Mongols succeeded primarily because of
their military skill. Genghis Khan’s army,

87
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:06,839
which never numbered more than 130,000 was
built on speed and archery. Just like this

88
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:10,649
guy. Mongol mounted archers were like super
fast tanks, compared to the foot soldiers

89
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:12,009
and knights they were up against.

90
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,189
But wait, all the military history nerds are
saying, once people knew that the Mongols

91
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:18,209
were coming, why didn’t they just hole up
in castles and forts? It’s not like the

92
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:25,079
Mongols had flying horses. EXCEPT THEY DID. They
didn’t? Stan, why are you always making history boring?

93
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,709
So the Mongols apparently didn’t have flying
horses, but they were uncommonly adaptable.

94
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:33,339
So even though they’d never seen a castle
before they started raiding, they became experts

95
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,519
at siege warfare by interrogating prisoners.
And they also adopted gunpowder, probably

96
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,329
introducing it to Europeans, and they even
built ships so they could attack Japan. That

97
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:43,459
might have worked, too except there happened
to be a typhoon.

98
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,449
Also, people were terrified of the Mongols.
Often cities would surrender the moment the

99
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,219
Mongols arrived, just to escape slaughter.
But of course, that only happened because

100
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,240
there were occasions when the Mongols, did,
you know, slaughter entire towns.

101
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,350
So with all that background, let us return
to the question of Mongol awesomeness. First,

102
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,000
five arguments for awesome.
1. The Mongols really did reinvigorate cross-Eurasian

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,839
trade. The Silk Road trading routes that had
existed for about 1000 years by the time the

104
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,209
Mongols made the scene had fallen into disuse,
but the Mongols valued trade because they

105
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:16,519
could tax it, and they did a great job of
keeping their empire safe. It was said that

106
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,419
a man could walk from one end of the Mongol
empire to the other with a gold plate on his

107
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,689
head without ever fearing being robbed.
2. The Mongols increased communication throughout

108
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:29,189
Eurasia by developing this pony express-like
system of way stations with horses and riders

109
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:32,959
that could quickly relay information. It was
called the yam system and also included these

110
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,989
amazing bronze passports, which facilitated
travel.

111
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,860
3. Another thing that travelled along the
Mongol trade routes was cuisine. For example,

112
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,850
it was because of the Mongols that rice became
a staple of the Persian diet. Which I mention

113
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,090
entirely because I happen to like Persian
food.

114
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:51,019
4. The Mongols forcibly relocated people who
were useful to them, like artists and musicians

115
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,500
and, especially administrators. As you can
imagine, the Mongols weren't much for administrative

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,730
tasks like keeping records, so they found
people were good at that stuff and just moved

117
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,870
them around the empire. This created the kind
of cross-cultural pollination that world historians

118
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,459
these days get really excited about.
And 5. The Mongols were almost unprecedentedly

119
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:11,769
tolerant of different religions. They themselves
were shamanists, believing in nature spirits,

120
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:15,979
but since their religion was tied to the land
from which they came, they didn’t expect

121
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,000
new people to adopt it and they didn’t ask
them to. So you could find Muslims and Buddhists

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,819
and Christians and people of any other religion
you can think of prospering throughout the

123
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,699
Mongol empire. And it’s that kind of openness
that has led some historians to go back and

124
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,229
re-evaluate the Mongols, seeing them as kind
of a precursor to modernity.

125
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,899
But there’s another side to the story that
we should not forget, so, here are five reasons

126
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,309
why the Mongols might not be so great.
1. Here is Genghis Khan’s definition of

127
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,709
happiness: “The greatest happiness is to
vanquish your enemies, to chase them before

128
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,000
you, to rob them of their wealth, to see those
dear to them bathed in tears, to clasp to

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,899
your bosom their wives and daughters." Off-topic,
but if that quote rings a bell, it might be

130
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,419
because Oliver Stone blatantly plagiarized
Genghis Khan in the movie Conan the Barbarian.

131
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:01,959
2. Is an extension of one. The Mongols were
seriously brutal conquerors. I mean, not uniquely

132
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,310
brutal, but still: the Mongols destroyed entire
cities, and most historians estimate the numbers

133
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:10,669
they killed to be in the millions.
3. Their empire didn’t last. Within 80 years

134
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:14,620
they’d left China and been replaced by a
new dynasty, the Ming. And in Persia they

135
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,409
blended in so completely that by the 15th
century they were totally unrecognizable.

136
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:23,389
I mean, they’d even taken up agriculture!
Agriculture, the last refuge for scoundrels

137
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,100
who want to devote their lives to working
instead of skoodilypooping.

138
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,480
4. They also weren’t particularly interested
in artistic patronage or architecture. I mean,

139
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,840
your palace may last forever, but my yurt
can go anywhere.

140
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,019
5. The Mongols were probably responsible for
the Black Death. By opening up trade they

141
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,129
also opened up vectors for disease to travel,
in the case of the Plague via fleas infected

142
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:45,740
with Yersinia pestis. And at least according
to one story, the Mongols intentionally spread

143
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,340
the plague by catapulting their plague-ridden
cadavers over the walls of Caffa in the Crimea.

144
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,080
While this primitive act of biological warfare
might have happened, it’s unlikely to be

145
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,450
what actually spread the plague. More likely
it was the fleas on the rats in the holds

146
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,610
of Black Sea ships that were trading with Europe. But
that trade only existed because of the Mongols.

147
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,899
All right Stan, one last time- cue the Mongol-tage.

148
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,309
So the Mongols promoted trade, diversity,
and tolerance, and they also promoted slaughter

149
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:16,939
and senseless destruction. And what you think
about the Mongols ends up saying a lot about

150
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,440
you: Do you value artistic output over religious
diversity? Is imperialism that doesn’t last

151
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,620
better or worse than imperialism that does?
And are certain kinds of warfare inherently

152
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,519
wrong? If you think those are easy questions
to answer, than I haven’t been doing my job.

153
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,159
Regardless, I look forward to reading your answers in
comments. Thanks for watching and I’ll see you

154
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:37,659
next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by
Stan Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

155
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:41,299
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our Graphics

156
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:44,750
Team is Thought Bubble. Last week's Phrase
Of The Week was "Hawaiian Pizza". If you want

157
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,350
to suggest future phrases of the week or guess
at this week's, you can do so in comments,

158
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,360
where you can also ask questions about today's
video that can be answered by our team of

159
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,050
historians. By the way, if you want to wear
your love for Crash Course there's a Mongols

160
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,539
shirt, link in the video info.

161
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:01,439
Thanks for watching Crash Course. Nobody can beat
Crash Course viewers. Well, except for the Mongols.
