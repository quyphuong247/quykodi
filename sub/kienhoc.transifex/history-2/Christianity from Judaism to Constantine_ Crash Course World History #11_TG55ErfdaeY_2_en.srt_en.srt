00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,040
Hi there my name’s John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk about Jesus.

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:09,539
So this is a Roman coin from around the time
Jesus was born in the Roman Empire, and it

3
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:14,250
calls Augustus, the emperor, the son of God.
So let’s just state at the outset that in

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,920
4 BCE, being the son of God, or at least being
the son of a god was not such an unusual thing.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,140
But a poor Jew being the son of God — that
was news.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:33,259
[theme music]

7
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:37,399
Any understanding of Christianity has to start
with Judaism, because Jesus was born a Jew,

8
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,959
and he grew up in the Jewish tradition. He
was one of many teachers spreading his ideas

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,710
in the Roman province of Judea at the time,
and he was part of a messianic tradition that

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,808
helps us understand why he was thought of
not only teacher but something much, much more.

11
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,409
Let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble
today.

12
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,879
The people who would become the Jews, were
just one of many tribal peoples eking out

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,540
an existence in that not-very fertile crescent
world of Mesopotamia after the agricultural revolution.

14
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,920
The Hebrews initially worshiped many gods,
making sacrifices to them in order to bring

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,099
good weather and good fortune. But they eventually
developed a religion centered around an idea

16
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,158
that would become key to the other great western
religions.

17
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,060
This was monotheism, the idea that there is
only one true god (or at least that if there

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,329
are other gods around, they are total lameoids).
The Hebrews developed a second concept that

19
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:26,208
is key to their religion as well: the idea
of the covenant, a deal with God.

20
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:30,999
The main man in this, the big macher was Abraham.
Not to make this too much of a scripture lesson,

21
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:34,670
but it’s kind of hard to understand the
Jews without understanding Abraham, or Abram

22
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,099
as he was known before he had his big conversation
with God. Recorded in Genesis 17: "When Abram

23
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:46,009
was ninety years and nine, the LORD appeared
to Abram, and said unto him, 'I am the Almighty

24
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,689
God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.'
" And I’m a make a covenant with you and

25
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:52,739
a bunch of cool things will happen like you’re
gonna have kids and your descendants will

26
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,668
number the stars and you can have all the
land of Canaan forever, it’s gonna be awesome.

27
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,728
I’m paraphrasing by the way, Thought Bubble.

28
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:02,489
So God promised that Abram would have kids
with his wife even though the dude was already

29
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:08,209
like 99, but there was a catch: "This is my
covenant, which ye shall keep, between me

30
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:14,480
and you and thy seed after thee; every man
child among you shall be circumcised." Keep

31
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,870
it PG-13, Thought Bubble.

32
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,520
Now that is asking a lot from a guy, especially
a 99-year-old geezer like Abram living in

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,310
a time before general anesthesia. But those
were the terms of the deal, and in exchange

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,199
God had chosen Abraham and his descendants
to be a great nation. From this we get the

35
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,869
expression that the Jews are the Chosen people.

36
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,110
Thanks for keeping it clean, Thought Bubble.

37
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,100
So, some important things about this god:

38
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,189
One, singularity. He — and I’m using the
masculine pronoun because that’s what Hebrew

39
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:42,780
prayers use — does not want you to put any
gods before Him.

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,449
He is also transcendent, having always existed
and he is deeply personal – he chats with

41
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:52,479
prophets, sends locusts, etc. But he doesn’t
take corporeal form like the Greek and Roman Gods do.

42
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,879
He is also involved in history, like he will
destroy cities, and bring floods, and determine

43
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,870
the outcome of wars, and possibly football
games. Stan, no! FOOTBALL games!

44
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,599
Probably most important to us today, and certainly
most important to Jesus, this god demands

45
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,379
moral righteousness and social justice. So,
this is the god of the Hebrews, Yahweh, and

46
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:15,490
despite many ups and downs, the Jewish people
have stuck with him for- according to the

47
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,710
Hebrew calendar, at least- over 5700 years.

48
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,000
And He has stuck by them too, despite the
Jews being, on occasion, something of a disappointment

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,318
to him. Which leads to various miseries, and
also to a tradition of prophets who speak

50
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,250
for God and warn the people to get back on
the right path lest there be more miseries.

51
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,800
Which brings us back to our friends, the Romans.
By the time that Jesus was born, the land

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,130
of the Israelites had been absorbed into the
Roman Empire as the province of Judea. At

53
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:43,969
the time of Jesus’s birth, Judea was under
the control of Herod the Great, best known

54
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,280
for building the massive temple in Jerusalem,
that the Romans would later destroy.

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,000
And by the time Jesus died, an expanded Judea
was under the rule of Herod Antipater. Also,

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,120
unhelpfully, known as Herod. Both Herods ultimately
took their orders from the Romans, and they

57
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,539
both show up on the list of rulers who are
oppressive to the Jews, partly because there’s

58
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:04,318
never that much religious freedom in an empire.

59
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:10,399
Unless you are, wait for it... The Mongols
[Mongoltage]

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,460
or the Persians. Also, they were Hellenizers,
bringing in Greek theater and architecture,

61
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:18,620
and rationalism. And in response to those
Hellenistic influences, there were a lot of

62
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,340
preachers trying to get the Jews to return
to the traditions and the godly ways of the

63
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,468
past, including the Sadducees, and the Pharisees,
and the Essenes, and the Zealots.

64
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:31,120
And one of those preachers, who didn’t fit
comfortably into any of these four groups,

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,389
was Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus was a preacher
who spread his message of peace, love and,

66
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:40,829
above all, justice, across Judea over the
course of his actually average-length life for his time.

67
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:46,019
He was remarkably charismatic, attracting
a small but incredibly loyal group of followers,

68
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,740
and he was said to perform miracles — although
it’s worth noting that miracles weren’t

69
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,538
terribly uncommon at the time.

70
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:56,199
Jesus’s message was particularly resonant
to the poor and downtrodden and pretty radical

71
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,430
in its anti-authoritarian stance. He said
it was easier for a camel to get through the

72
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,329
eye of a needle than for a rich man to get
to heaven, he said the meek were blessed,

73
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:08,028
that the last would be first and the first
would be last — all of which was kind of

74
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:13,168
threatening to the powers that be, who accordingly
had him arrested, tried and then executed

75
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:16,308
in the normal method of killing rebels at
that time: crucifixion.

76
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:20,860
Also, just to put this question to bed, the
Romans crucified Jesus, because he was a

77
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:28,120
threat to their authority. Later traditions saying that the
Jews killed Jesus? Very unfortunate, also, very untrue.

78
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,519
We’re not going to discuss Jesus’s divinity,
because:

79
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,459
1. This isn’t a theology class, and
2. Flame wars on the Internet make me so uncomfortable that

80
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,628
I have to turn to camera 2. Hi there camera
2, I’m here to remind you that

81
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,599
3. Fighting over such things, like fighting
over whether the proverbial cake is a lie,

82
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:46,748
rarely accomplishes anything, plus
4. What matters to us is the historical fact

83
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:52,449
that people at the time believed that Jesus
was the Messiah, the Anointed One, the son

84
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,210
of God. And they believed that he would return
some day to redeem the world.

85
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,378
Which leads us to two questions about Christianity:

86
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,908
First, Why did this small group of people
believe this? And second, why and how did

87
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:05,370
that belief become so widespread?

88
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,309
So why would people believe that Jesus was
the Messiah?

89
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:11,338
First. The Jews had a long tradition of believing
that a savior who would come to them in a

90
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:15,939
time of trouble. And Judea under the rule
of Herod and the Romans... definitely a time of trouble.

91
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,680
And many of the prophecies about this savior
point to someone whose life looks a lot like

92
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:24,699
Jesus's. For instance, Isaiah 53 says the
person will be misunderstood and mistreated,

93
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,639
just like Jesus was: “He was despised, and
rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted

94
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,579
with grief: and as one from whom men hide
their face he was despised; and we didn't respect him.”

95
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,519
And a lot of the prophecies like Daniel 7:14,
for instance, explained that when the Messiah

96
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,258
comes there will be this awesome, new, everlasting
kingdom. And that had to sound pretty good

97
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,588
to people who’d had their autonomy taken
away from them.

98
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:50,038
So some religious Jews saw Jesus in those
prophecies and came to believe either during

99
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,288
his life or shortly thereafter, that he was
the messiah. Most of them thought the new

100
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,598
everlasting kingdom was right around the corner,
which is probably why no one bothered to write

101
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:03,259
down much about the life of Jesus for several
decades, by which time it was clear that we

102
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,658
might have to wait a bit for this brilliant
new everlasting kingdom.

103
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:10,180
I should note, by the way, that the idea of
a messiah was not unique to the Jews at the

104
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,930
time. Even the Romans got in on the action,
for instance, the Roman poet Virgil wrote

105
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,288
of a boy who: “Shall free the earth from
never-ceasing fear, he shall receive the life

106
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:22,699
of gods, and see Heroes with gods commingling.”
Sound familiar?

107
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,889
But Virgil was writing about Emperor Augustus
in that poem, not Jesus, which points again

108
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:31,408
to the similarities between the two. Both
called sons of God. Both sent to free the

109
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:35,808
earth from never-ceasing fear. But one ruled
the largest empire in the world; and the other

110
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:39,979
believed that empire, and the world, needed
to change dramatically.

111
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:45,008
So why did the less wealthy and famous son
of God become by far the more influential?

112
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,629
Well, here are three possible historical reasons:

113
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,309
Reason #1: The Romans continued to make things
bad for the Jews. In fact, things got much

114
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:59,329
worse for the Jews, especially after they launched
a revolt between 66-73 CE, which did not go well.

115
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:03,220
By the time the dust settled, the Romans had
destroyed the Temple and expelled the Jews

116
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:06,829
from Judea, beginning what we now know
as the Jewish Diaspora.

117
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,680
And without a Temple or geographic unity,
the Jews had to solidify what it meant to

118
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,809
be a Jew and what the basic tenants of the
religion were. This forced the followers of

119
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:18,749
Jesus to make a decision: were they going
to continue to be Jews following stricter

120
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:22,460
laws set forth by rabbis, or were they going
to be something else.

121
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,658
The decision to open up their religion to
non-Jews, people who weren’t part of the

122
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:30,199
covenant, is the central reason that Christianity
could become a world religion instead of just

123
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,940
a sect of Judaism. And it probably didn’t
hurt that the main proponent of sticking with

124
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,880
Judaism was James, Jesus’s brother, who
was killed by the Romans.

125
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,830
Reason #2: Is related to Reason #1 and it’s
all about a dude named Saul. No, not that

126
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,820
Saul. Yes, Saul of Tarsus, thank you.

127
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,090
Saul, having received a vision on the road
to Damascus, became Paul and began visiting

128
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,040
and sending letters to Jesus followers throughout
the Mediterranean. And it was Paul who emphatically

129
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,319
declared that Jesus followers did NOT have
to be Jews, that they did not have to be circumcised

130
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,770
or keep to Jewish laws or any of that stuff.

131
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,029
This opened the floodgates for thousands of
people to convert to this new religion. And

132
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:08,319
the other thing to remember about Paul is
that he was a Roman citizen, which meant that

133
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,030
he could travel freely throughout the Roman
Empire. This allowed him to make his case

134
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,789
to lots of different people and facilitated
the geographic spread of Christianity.

135
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:23,089
Oh, it’s time for the open letter? Alright.
An open letter, to the fish.

136
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:28,860
But first, lets see what’s in the secret
compartment today. Oh, Stan. It’s my favorite

137
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,430
album Jesus Christ Superstar, finally available
in my favorite format, the cassette. Did I

138
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:37,949
color-coordinate my shirt to Jesus Christ
Superstar? Yes.

139
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,680
Dear Ichthys, So check this out: In the first
century when it was still super underground

140
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,259
and hipster to be a Christian, you were a
secret symbol of Christianity, used to kind

141
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,600
of hide from the Romans. Ichthys, the Greek
word for fish, was an acronym and it was a

142
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,820
super clever way to talk about religion without
anyone knowing that you were talking about it.

143
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,540
But you’ll never guess what happened - even
in places where it’s completely fine to

144
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:02,549
talk about Christianity now and to use, you
know, regular Christian symbols, like the

145
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:07,299
cross, you have had a huge resurgence thanks
to the plastic automobile decal industry.

146
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,740
I mean seriously, Ichthys, I haven’t seen
a comeback like this since Jesus.

147
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,299
Best wishes, John Green

And lastly, Christianity was born and flourished
an empire with a common language that allowed

149
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,519
for its spread. And crucially, it was also
an Empire in decline.

150
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,720
Like even by the end of the first century
CE, Rome was on its way down. And for the

151
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,120
average person, and even for some elites,
things weren’t as good as they had been,

152
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,299
if fact they were getting worse so fast that you
might have thought the end of the world was coming.

153
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,939
And Roman religion offered no promise of an
afterlife, and a bunch of squabbling whiny

154
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:42,660
gods - sorry if I offended adherents to Roman
religion, but seriously, they squabble. So

155
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:46,600
even though early Christians were persecuted
by the Roman Empire and sometimes fed to the

156
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,790
lions and other animals, the religion continued
to grow, albeit slowly.

157
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:54,870
But then as the Roman decline continued, Emperor
Constantine allowed the worship of Jesus and

158
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,419
then eventually converted to Christianity
himself. And then the religion really took

159
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:01,639
off. I mean, Rome wasn’t what it used to
be, but everybody still wanted to be like

160
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,169
the Emperor. And soon enough there was a new
son of God on coins.

161
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,149
Thanks for watching. See you next week.

162
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:10,919
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

163
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,929
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself and our graphics

164
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:16,289
team is Thought Bubble.

165
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:19,610
As only 62 million of you guessed last week,
the Phrase of the Week was "Chipotle Burrito";

166
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,259
if you want to guess at this week’s Phrase
of the Week or suggest future ones, you can

167
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:27,460
do so in Comments where you can also ask questions
about today’s video that will be answered,

168
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,150
hopefully, by our team of historians.

169
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:32,730
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.

170
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,159
Ow... again.
