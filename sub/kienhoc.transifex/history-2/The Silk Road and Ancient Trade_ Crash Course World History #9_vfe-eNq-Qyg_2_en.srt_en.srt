00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,819
Hi there, I’m John Green, this is Crash
Course: World History, and today we’re

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:10,679
gonna talk about the Silk Road, so called
because it was not a road and not made of silk.

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,080
So this is a t-shirt. It was designed in Belgium
and contains cotton from both Brazil and the

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,140
Texas, which was turned into cloth in China,
stitched in Haiti, screen-printed in the Washington,

5
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:24,349
sold to me in Indiana, and now that I am too
fat to wear it, it will soon make its way

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,670
to Cameroon or Honduras or possibly even back
to Haiti.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,150
Can we just pause for a moment to consider
the astonishing fact that most t-shirts see

8
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,439
more of the World than most of us do—

9
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:37,198
Mr. Green Mr. Green the t-shirt can’t see
the world because they don’t have eyes—

10
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:40,960
Look, me from the past, it’s difficult for
me to isolate what I hate most about you because

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,448
there is so much to hate.

12
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:46,170
But very near the top is your relentless talent
for ignoring everything that is interesting

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,429
and beautiful about our species in favor of
pedantic sniveling in which no one loses or

14
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:51,819
gains anything of value.

15
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,639
I’m gonna go put on a collared shirt because
we’re here to tackle the big picture.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:03,240
[theme music]

17
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:07,840
So the silk road didn’t begin trade, but
it did radically expand its scope, and the

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,040
connections that were formed by mostly unknown
merchants arguably changed the world more

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,370
than any political or religious leaders.

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,640
It was especially cool If you were rich, because
you finally had something to spend your money

21
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,539
on other than temples. But even if you weren’t
rich, the Silk Road reshaped the lives of

22
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:27,959
everyone living in Africa and Eurasia, as we will
see today. Let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble.

23
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,858
As previously mentioned, the silk road was
not a road. It’s not like archaeologists

24
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:36,009
working in Uzbekistan have uncovered a bunch
of yield signs and baby on board stickers.

25
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:39,459
It was an overland route where merchants carried
goods for trade.

26
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,280
But it was really two routes: One that connected
the Eastern Mediterranean to Central Asia

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,299
and one that went from Central Asia to China.

28
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,259
Further complicating things, the Silk Road
involved sea routes: Many goods reached Rome

29
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:52,599
via the Mediterranean,

30
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:57,390
and goods from Central Asia found their way
across the Pacific to Japan and even Java.

31
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,748
So we shouldn’t think of the Silk Road as
a road but rather as a network of trade routes.

32
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:06,078
But just as now, the goods traveled more than
the people who traded them: Very few traders

33
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,719
traversed the entire silk road: Instead, they’d
move back and forth between towns, selling

34
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,090
to traders who’d take the goods further
toward their destination, with everybody marking

35
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,860
up prices along the way.

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,400
So what’d they trade? Well silk, for starters.
For millennia, silk was only produced in China.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,990
It is spun from the cocoons of mulberry tree-eating
worms and the process of silk making as well

38
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,010
as the techniques for raising the worms were
closely guarded secrets, since the lion’s

39
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,500
share of China’s wealth came from silk production.

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,849
The Chinese used silk as fishing line, to
buy off nomadic raiders to keep things peaceful,

41
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:41,829
and to write before they invented paper.

42
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,260
But as an export, silk was mostly used for
clothes: Silk clothing feels light in the

43
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,479
summer and warm in the winter, and until we
invented $700 pre-distressed designer jeans,

44
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,959
decking yourself out in silk was the #1 way
to show people that you were wealthy.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,800
Thanks, Thought Bubble. But the silk road
wasn’t all about silk.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,380
The Mediterranean exported such cliched goods
as olives, olive oil, wine, and mustachioed plumbers.

47
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:09,560
China also exported raw materials like
jade, silver, and iron. India exported

48
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,039
fine cotton textiles; the ivory that originated
in East Africa made its way across the Silk Road;

49
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,979
And Arabia exported incense and spices and
tortoise shells. Oh, god, it’s a red one,

50
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,390
isn’t it? It’s just gonna chase me, I
just--- Ow.

51
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,219
Up until now on Crash Course we’ve been
focused on city-dwelling civilizational types,

52
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,319
but with the growth of the silk road, the
nomadic people of Central Asia suddenly become

53
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,349
much more important to world history.

54
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,769
Most of Central Asia isn’t great for agriculture,
but it’s difficult to conquer, unless you

55
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,630
are, wait for it -- The Mongols.

56
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,960
It also lends itself fairly well to herding,
and since nomads are definitionally good at

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,840
moving around, they’re also good at moving stuff from
Point A to Point B, which makes them good traders.

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,479
Plus all their travel made them more resistant
to diseases.

59
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,979
One group of such nomads, the Yuezhi, were
humiliated in battle in the 2nd century BCE

60
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:03,560
by their bitter rivals the Xiongnu, who turned
the Yuezhi king’s skull into a drinking cup, in fact.

61
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,680
And in the wake of that the Yuezhi migrated
to Bactria and started the Kushan Empire in

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,659
what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan.

63
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,439
Although silk road trading began more than
a century before the birth of Jesus, it really took

64
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,319
off in the second and third centuries CE, and the Kushan
Empire became a huge hub for that silk road trade.

65
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,000
By then, nomads were being eclipsed by professional
merchants who travelled the silk roads, often

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,920
making huge profits, but those cities that had been
founded by nomadic peoples became hugely important.

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,240
They continued to grow, because most of the
trade on the Silk Road was by caravan, and

68
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,100
those caravans had to stop frequently, you
know, for like food and water and prostitutes.

69
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,250
These towns became fantastically wealthy:
One, Palmyra, was particularly important because

70
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,769
all of the incense and silk that travelled
to Rome had to go through Palmyra.

71
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:48,759
Silk was so popular among the Roman elite
that the Roman senate repeatedly tried to ban it,

72
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,459
complaining about trade imbalances caused by the
silk trade and also that silk was inadequately modest.

73
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:59,639
To quote Seneca the Younger, “I see clothes of silk,
if materials that do not hide the body, nor even

74
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,039
one's decency, can be called clothes,”

75
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,009
he also said of the woman who wears silk,
“her husband has no more acquaintance than

76
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,879
any outsider or foreigner with his wife's
body."

77
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,399
And yet all attempts to ban silk failed,
which speaks to how much,

78
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,279
even in the ancient world, wealth shaped governance.

79
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,319
And with trade, there was a way to become
wealthy without being a king or lord who takes

80
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,019
part of what your citizens produce.

81
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,579
The merchant class that grew along with the
Silk Road came to have a lot of political

82
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:30,079
clout, and in some ways that began the tension that we
still see today between wealth and politics. Whether

83
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:36,560
it’s, you know, corporations making large donations
or Vladimir Putin periodically jailing billionaires.

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,100
Mr. Putin, I just want to state for the record that I did
not mean that in any way, I was -- Stan wrote that joke.

85
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,260
Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter.

86
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,500
An Open Letter to Billionaires:

87
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,360
But first, let’s see what’s in the Secret
Compartment today. Oh, it’s some fake silk;

88
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,720
the stuff that put real silk out of business.

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,340
Dear Billionaires, I’ve wrapped myself in the finest of
polyester so that you will take my message seriously.

90
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:03,609
Here at Crash Course we’ve done a lot of
research into our demographics and our show

91
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,790
is watched primarily by Grammar Nazis, Muggle
Quidditch Players, People Who Have a Test

92
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,280
Tomorrow, and Billionaires.

93
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,870
I have a message for you Billionaires: It
will never be enough. You’re relentless

94
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,319
yearning is going to kill us all.

95
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,790
Best wishes,
John Green

96
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,919
Speaking of billionaires, the goods that travelled
on the Silk Road really only changed the lives

97
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:27,049
of rich people. Did the Silk Road affect the
rest of us? Yes, for three reasons.

98
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,780
First, wider economic impact. Relatively few
people could afford silk, but a lot of people

99
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:34,099
devoted their lives to making that silk.

100
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,020
And as the market for silk grew, more and
more people chose to go into silk production

101
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,339
rather than doing something else with their
lives.

102
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,929
Second, the Silk Road didn’t just trade
luxury goods. In fact, arguably the most important

103
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,280
thing traded along the Silk Road: ideas.

104
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,219
For example, the Silk Road was the primary
route for the spread of Buddhism.When we last

105
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,020
saw the Buddha’s Eight-Fold Path to escaping
the cycle of suffering and desire that's inherent

106
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,399
to humans, it was beginning to dwindle in
India.

107
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,239
But through contacts with other cultures and
traditions, Buddhism grew and flourished and

108
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,000
became one of the great religious traditions
of the world.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,420
The variation of Buddhism that took root in
China, Korea, Japan, and Central Asia is known

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,168
as Mahayana Buddhism, and it differed from
the original teachings of the Buddha in many

111
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:19,649
ways, but one that was fundamental. For Mahayana
Buddhists, the Buddha was divine. (I mean,

112
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:24,000
we can—and religious historians do—fight
over the exact definition of divine, but in

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,399
Mahayanna Buddhism, there’s no question
that the Buddha is venerated to a greater degree.

114
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,599
The idea of Nirvana also transformed from
a release from that cycle of suffering and

115
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,460
desire to something much more heavenly and
frankly more fun, and in some versions of

116
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:42,339
Mahayana Buddhism, there are lots of different
heavens, each more awesome than the last.

117
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:45,919
Rather than focusing on the fundamental fact
of suffering, Mahayana Buddhism offered the

118
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,430
hope that through worship of the Buddha, or
one of the many bodhisattvas – holy people

119
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,870
who could have achieved nirvana but chose
to hang out on Earth with us because they’re

120
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,730
super nice– one could attain a good afterlife.

121
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,000
Many merchants on the silk road became strong
supporters of monasteries which in turn became

122
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,168
convenient weigh stations for caravans.

123
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:08,528
And by endowing the monasteries, rich merchants
were buying a form of supernatural insurance;

124
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:11,839
Monks who lived in the monasteries would pray
for the success of trade missions and the

125
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,679
health of their patrons. It was win-win, especially
when you consider that one of the central

126
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,280
materials used in Mahayana Buddhist rituals
is … silk.

127
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,159
And a third reason the silk road changed all
our lives, worldwide interconnectedness of

128
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:26,748
populations led to the spread of disease.

129
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:31,260
Measles and Smallpox traveled along it, as
did bubonic plague, which came from the East

130
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:37,360
to the West in 534, 750, and—most devastatingly—in
1346.

131
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,119
This last plague—known as the Black Death—resulted
in the largest population decimation in human

132
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:46,298
history, with nearly half of Europeans dying
in a four-year period.

133
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:50,758
A sizable majority of people living in Italy
died as did two-thirds of Londoners.

134
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,430
And it quite possibly wouldn’t have happened
without the Silk Road. If you were living

135
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:58,958
in London during the fourteenth century, you
probably didn’t blame the Silk Road for

136
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,719
your community’s devastation, but it played
a role.

137
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,459
If you look at it that way, the interconnectedness
fostered by Silk Road affected way, way more

138
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:11,318
people than just those rich enough to buy
silk, just as today’s globalization offers

139
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,259
both promise and threat to each of us.

140
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:18,139
Next week we’ll talk about Julius Caesar
and in what situation, if any, it’s okay

141
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,209
to stab your friend in the gut. Until then,
thanks for watching.
