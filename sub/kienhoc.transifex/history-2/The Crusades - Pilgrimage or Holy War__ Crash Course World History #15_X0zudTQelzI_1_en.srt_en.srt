00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,980
Hi there! My name is John Green; this is Crash
Course World History, and today we’re going

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,138
to talk about the Crusades. Ohhh, Stan, do
we have to talk about the Crusades? I hate them...

3
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:12,298
Here’s the thing about the Crusades, which
were a series of military expeditions from

4
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:16,208
parts of Europe to the Eastern coast of the
Mediterranean. The real reason they feature

5
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:22,579
so prominently in history is because we’ve
endlessly romanticized the story of the Crusades.

6
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:25,848
We’ve created this simple narrative with
characters to root for and root against, and

7
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:29,919
it’s all been endlessly idealized by the
likes of Sir Walter Scott. And there are knights

8
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:35,039
with swords and lion hearts... NO, STAN. LIONHEARTS.
Thank you.

9
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:43,899
[theme music]

10
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,100
Let’s start by saying that initially the
Crusades were not a “holy war” on the

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,960
part of Europeans against Islam, but in important
ways the Crusades were driven by religious faith.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,990
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Religion
causes all wars. Imagine no war —

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,829
I’m gonna cut you off right there before
you violate copyright, me-from-the-past. But

14
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,250
as usual, you’re wrong. Simple readings
of history are rarely sufficient. By the way,

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,040
when did my handwriting get so much better?

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,060
I mean, if the Crusades had been brought on
by the lightning-fast rise of the Islamic

17
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:14,618
empire and a desire to keep in Christian hands
the land of Jesus, then the Crusades would’ve

18
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:18,498
started in the 8th century. But early Islamic
dynasties, like the Umayyads and the Abbasids,

19
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:22,248
were perfectly happy with Christians and Jews
living among them, as long as they paid a

20
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,399
tax. And plus the Christian pilgrimage business
was awesome for the Islamic Empire’s economy.

21
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:30,079
But then a new group of Muslims, the Seljuk
Turks, moved into the region and they sacked

22
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,298
the holy cities and made it much more difficult
for Christians to make their pilgrimages.

23
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:38,699
And while they quickly realized their mistake,
it was already too late. The Byzantines, who’d had their

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,299
literal-asses kicked at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071,
felt the threat and called upon the West for help.

25
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,819
So the first official crusade began with a
call to arms from Pope Urban II in 1095 CE.

26
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:53,339
This was partly because Urban wanted to unite
Europe and he’d figured out the lesson the

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,130
rest of us learn from alien invasion movies:
the best way to get people to unite is to

28
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:02,030
give them a common enemy. So Urban called
on all the bickering knights and nobility

29
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,039
of Europe, and he saideth unto his people:
“Let us go forth and help the Byzantines

30
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,599
because then maybe they will acknowledge my
awesomeness and get rid of their stupid Not

31
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,919
Having Me as Pope thing, and while we are at it,
let’s liberate Jerusalem!” I’m paraphrasing, by the way.

32
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,319
Shifting the focus to Jerusalem is really
important, because the Crusades were not primarily

33
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,469
military operations; they were pilgrimages.
Theologically, Christianity didn’t have

34
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:28,159
an idea of a holy war – like, war might
be just, but fighting wasn’t something that

35
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,000
got you into heaven. But pilgrimage to a holy
shrine could help you out on that front, and

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,139
Urban had the key insight to pitch the Crusade
as a pilgrimage with a touch of warring on

37
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,139
the side. I do the same thing to my kid every
night: I’m not feeding you dinner featuring

38
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:46,599
animal crackers. I’m feeding you animal crackers
featuring a dinner. Oh, it’s time for the open letter?

39
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,919
An Open Letter to Animal Crackers.

40
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,620
But first let’s see what’s in the Secret
Compartment today. Oh, it’s animal crackers.

41
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,819
Thanks, Stan...

42
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,030
Hi there, Animal Crackers, it’s me, John
Green. Thanks for being delicious, but let

43
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,680
me throw out a crazy idea here: Maybe foods
that are ALREADY DELICIOUS do not need the

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,150
added benefit of being PLEASINGLY SHAPED.
I mean, why can’t I give my kid animal spinach

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,200
or animal sweet potato or even animal cooked
animal? I mean, we can put a man on Mars but

46
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,039
we can’t make spinach shaped like elephants?
What Stan? We haven’t put a man on Mars?

47
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,439
Stupid world, always disappointing me.

48
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,020
Best wishes, John Green

49
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:29,040
One last myth to dispel: The Crusades also
were NOT an early example of European colonization

50
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,800
of the Middle East, even if they did create
some European-ish kingdoms there for a while.

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,480
That's a much later, post-and-anti-colonialist view that
comes, at least partially, from a Marxist reading of history.

52
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,299
In the case of the Crusades, it was argued,
the knights who went adventuring in the Levant

53
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,810
were the second and third sons of wealthy
nobles who, because of European inheritance

54
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,360
rules, had little to look forward to by staying
in Europe and lots to gain – in terms of

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,340
plunder – by going to the East. Cool theory,
bro, but it’s not true. First, most of the

56
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,450
people who responded to the call to Crusade
weren’t knights at all; they were poor people.

57
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:05,549
And secondly, most of the nobles who did go
crusading were lords of estates, not their wastrel kids.

58
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,469
But more importantly, that analysis ignores
religious motivations. We’ve approached

59
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:13,500
religions as historical phenomena — thinking
about how, for instance, the capricious environment

60
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,108
of Mesopotamia led to a capricious cadre of
Mesopotamian gods. But just as the world shapes

61
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,008
religion, religion also shapes the world.

62
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,610
And some modern historians might ignore religious
motivations, but medieval crusaders sure as

63
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,610
hell didn’t. I mean, when people came up
with that idiom, they clearly thought Hell

64
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,110
was for sure. To the Crusaders, they were
taking up arms to protect Christ and his kingdom.

65
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,840
And what better way to show your devotion
to God than putting a cross on your sleeve, spending

66
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,258
5 to 6 times your annual income to outfit yourself
and all your horses, and heading for the Holy Land?

67
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,110
So when these people cried out “God Wills
It!” to explain their reasons for going,

68
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,979
we should do them the favor of believing them.
And the results of the First Crusade seemed

69
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:52,959
to indicate that God had willed it. Following
the lead of roving preachers with names like

70
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,029
Peter the Rabbit- Peter the Hermit? Stan,
you’re always making history less cool!

71
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:02,818
Fine, following preachers like Peter the Hermit,
thousands of peasants and nobles alike volunteered

72
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:07,978
for the First Crusade. It got off to kind of a rough start
because pilgrims kept robbing those they encountered

73
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,038
on the way. Plus, there was no real leader
so they were constant rivalries between nobles

74
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:16,399
about who could supply the most troops. Notable
among the notables were Godfrey of Bouillon,

75
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,019
Bohemond of Taranto, and Raymond of Toulouse.

76
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,079
But despite the rivalries, and the disorganization
the crusaders were remarkably — some would

77
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:26,769
say miraculously — successful. By the time
they arrived in the Levant, they were fighting

78
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:31,519
not against the Seljuk Turks but against Fatimid
Egyptians, who had captured the Holy Land

79
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,218
from the Seljuks, thereby making the Turks
none too pleased with the Egyptians. At Antioch

80
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:40,408
the Crusaders reversed a seemingly hopeless
situation when a peasant found a spear that

81
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:44,509
had pierced the side of Christ’s side hidden
under a church, thereby raising morale enough

82
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:50,319
to win the day. And then they did the impossible:
They took Jerusalem, securing it for Christendom

83
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,050
and famously killing a lot of people in the
al-Asqa mosque.

84
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,680
Now the Crusaders succeeded in part because
the Turkish Muslims, who were Sunnis, did

85
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,360
not step up to help the Egyptians, who were
Shia. But that kind of complicated, intra-Islamic

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,919
rivalry gets in the way of the awesome narrative:
The Christians just saw it as a miracle.

87
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,579
So by 1100CE European nobles held both Antioch
and Jerusalem as Latin Christian kingdoms.

88
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,259
I say Latin to make the point that there were
lots of Christians living in these cities before the

89
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:19,539
Crusaders arrived, they just weren’t Catholic -- they were
Orthodox, a point that will become relevant shortly.

90
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,218
We’re going to skip the second Crusade because
it bores me and move on to the Third Crusade

91
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:27,339
because it’s the famous one. Broadly speaking,
the Third Crusade was a European response

92
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:32,429
to the emergence of a new Islamic power, neither
Turkish nor Abbasid: the Egyptian (although

93
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:39,840
he was really a Kurd) Sultan al-Malik al-Nasir
Salah ed-Din Yusuf, better known to the west as Saladin.

94
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:44,370
Saladin, having consolidating his power in
Egypt, sought to expand by taking Damascus

95
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,699
and, eventually Jerusalem, which he did successfully,
because he was an amazing general. And then

96
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,559
the loss of Jerusalem caused Pope Gregory
VIII to call for a third crusade. Three of

97
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:57,650
the most important kings in Europe answered
the call: Philip "cowardly schemer" the Second

98
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:02,179
of France, Richard "Lionheart" the First of
England, and Frederick “I am going to drown

99
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,338
anticlimactically on the journey while trying
to bathe in a river” Barbarossa of the not-holy,

100
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:12,399
not-roman, and not-imperial Holy Roman Empire.
Both Richard and Saladin were great generals

101
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,068
who earned the respect of their troops.

102
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,598
And while from the European perspective the
crusade was a failure because they didn’t

103
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,128
take Jerusalem, it did radically change crusading
forever by making Egypt a target. Richard

104
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:27,770
understood that the best chance to take Jerusalem
involved first taking Egypt, but he couldn’t

105
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:32,649
convince any crusaders to join him because Egypt had
a lot less religious value to Christians than Jerusalem.

106
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:36,138
So Richard was forced to call off the Crusade
early, but if he had just hung around until

107
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,528
Easter of 1192, he would’ve seen Saladin
die. And then Richard probably could have

108
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:44,379
fulfilled all his crusading dreams, but then,
you know, we wouldn’t have needed the 4th Crusade.

109
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:48,158
Although crusading continued throughout the
14th century, mostly with an emphasis on North

110
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,519
Africa and not the Holy Land, the 4th Crusade
is the last one we’ll focus on, because

111
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,060
it was the crazy one. Let’s go to the
Thought Bubble.

112
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,360
So a lot of people volunteered for the fourth
crusade — more than 35,000 — and the generals

113
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:03,009
didn’t want to march them all the way across
Anatolia, because they knew from experience

114
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,580
that it was A. dangerous and B. hot, so they
decided to go by boat, which necessitated

115
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:12,269
the building of the largest naval fleet Europe
had seen since the Roman Empire.

116
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:17,718
The Venetians built 500 ships, but then only
11,000 Crusaders actually made it down to

117
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:22,439
Venice, because, like, oh I meant to go but
I had a thing come up... etc. There wasn’t

118
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,619
enough money to pay for those boats, so the
Venetians made the Crusaders a deal: Help

119
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:31,919
us capture the rebellious city of Zara, and
we’ll ferry you to Anatolia.

120
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,620
This was a smidge problematic, Crusading-wise,
because Zara was a Christian city, but the

121
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Crusaders agreed to help, resulting in the
Pope excommunicating both them and the Venetians.

122
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,959
Then after the Crusaders failed to take Zara
and were still broke, a would-be Byzantine

123
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:51,619
emperor named Alexius III promised the Crusaders
he would pay them if they helped him out,

124
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,899
so the (excommunicated) Catholic Crusaders
fought on behalf of the Orthodox Alexius,

125
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:01,129
who soon became emperor in Constantinople.
But it took Alexius a while to come up with

126
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:04,789
the money he’d promised the Crusaders, so
they were waiting around in Constantinople,

127
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:09,528
and then Alexius was suddenly dethroned by
the awesomely named Mourtzouphlos, leaving

128
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:12,679
the crusaders stuck in Constantinople with
no money.

129
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,979
Christian holy warriors couldn’t very well
sack the largest city in Christendom, could

130
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,570
they? Well, it turns out they could and boy,
did they. They took all the wealth they could

131
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,120
find, killed and raped Christians as they
went, stole the statues of horses that now

132
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,960
adorn St. Mark’s Cathedral in Venice, and retook exactly
none of the Holy Land. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

133
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,570
So you’d think this disaster would discredit
the whole notion of Crusading, right? No.

134
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,339
Instead, it legitimatized the idea that Crusading
didn’t have to be about pilgrimage: that

135
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,600
any enemies of the Catholic Church were fair
game.

136
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,930
Also, the fourth crusade pretty much doomed
the Byzantine Empire, which never really recovered.

137
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:51,399
Constantinople, a shadow of its former self,
was conquered by the Turks in 1453. So ultimately

138
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,350
the Crusades were a total failure at establishing
Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land long term.

139
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,740
And with the coming of the Ottomans, the region
remained solidly Muslim, as it (mostly) is today.

140
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,190
And the Crusades didn’t really open up lines
of communication between the Christian and

141
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,670
Muslim worlds, because those lines of communication
were already open. Plus, most historians now

142
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:12,849
agree that the Crusades didn’t bring Europe
out of the Middle Ages by offering it contact

143
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,409
with the superior intellectual accomplishments
of the Islamic world. In fact, they were a

144
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,379
tremendous drain on Europe’s resources.

145
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:22,360
For me, the Crusades matter because they remind
us that the medieval world was fundamentally

146
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,490
different from ours. The men and women who
took up the cross believed in the sacrality

147
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,049
of their work in a way that we often can’t
conceive of today. And when we focus so much

148
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:35,500
on the heroic narrative or the anti-imperialist
narrative, or all the political in-fighting,

149
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,470
we can lose sight of what the Crusades must
have meant to the Crusaders. How the journey

150
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,420
from pilgrimage to holy war transformed their
faith and their lives. And ultimately, that

151
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:49,779
exercise in empathy is the coolest thing about studying
history. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.

Whoah! Globe, globe, globe...
