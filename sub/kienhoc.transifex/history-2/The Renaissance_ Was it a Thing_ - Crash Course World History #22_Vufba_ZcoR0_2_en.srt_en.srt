00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,179
Hi, I'm John Green, This is Crash Course:
World History and today we're going to talk

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,710
about something that ought to be controversial:
The Renaissance.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,059
So you probably already know about the Renaissance
thanks to the work of noted teenage mutant

4
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:15,529
ninja turtles Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello,
and Raphael. But that isn't the whole story.

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:19,219
Mr. Green, Mr. Green. What about Splinter?
I think he was an architect.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:24,039
Ugh, me from the past, youíre such an idiot.
Splinter was a painter, sculptor, AND an architect.

7
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,859
He was a quite a Renaissance rat.

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:34,640
[theme music]

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,340
Right, so the story goes that the Renaissance
saw the rebirth of European culture after

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,800
the miserable Dark Ages, and that it ushered in the
modern era of secularism, rationality, and individualism.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,009
And those are all in the list of things we
like here at Crash Course.

12
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,339
Mr. Green. I think you're forgetting Cool
Ranch Doritos?

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,380
Yeah, fair enough.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,760
Then what's so controversial? Well, the whole
idea of a European Renaissance presupposes

15
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,640
that Europe was like an island unto itself
that was briefly enlightened when the Greeks

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,570
were ascendant and then lost its way and then
rediscovered its former European glory.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,519
Furthermore, I'm going to argue that the
Renaissance didn't even necessarily happen.

18
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,299
But first, letís assume that it did. Essentially,
the Renaissance was an efflorescence of arts

19
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,789
(primarily visual, but also to a lesser extent
literary) and ideas in Europe that coincided

20
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,940
with the rediscovery of Roman and Greek culture.

21
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,829
It's easiest to see this in terms of visual
art, Renaissance art tends to feature a focus

22
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:25,909
on the human form, somewhat idealized, as
Roman and especially Greek art had.

23
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,500
And this "classicizing" is also rather apparent
in the architecture of the Renaissance which

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,340
featured all sorts of Greek columns and triangular
pediments and Roman arches and domes. In fact,

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,760
looking at a Renaissance building you might
even be able to fool yourself into thinking

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,579
you're looking at an actual Greek building,
if you sort of squint and ignore the fact

27
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:44,899
that Greek buildings tend to be, you know,
ruins.

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,380
In addition to rediscovering, that is, copying, Greek
and Roman art, the Renaissance saw the rediscovery

29
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,810
of Greek and Roman writings and their ideas.

30
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,890
And that opened up a whole new world for scholars,
well, not a new world, actually since the texts

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,700
were more than 1000 years old, but you know
what I mean.

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,480
The scholars who examined, translated, and
commented upon these writings were called

33
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:05,059
humanists, which can be a little bit of a
confusing term, because it implies they were

34
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,830
concerned with, you know, humans rather than,
say, the religious world.

35
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,209
Which can add to the common, but totally incorrect,
assumption that Renaissance writers and artists

36
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,709
and scholars were, like, secretly not religious.

37
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,348
That's a favorite favorite area of speculation
on the Internet and in Dan Brown novels, but

38
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:23,759
the truth is that Renaissance artists were
religious. As evidence, let me present you

39
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:30,719
with that fact that they painted the Madonna
over and over and over and over and over and STAN!

40
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:35,000
Anyway, all humanism means is that these scholars
studied what were called the humanities.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,360
Literature, philosophy, history.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,760
Today, of course, these areas of study are
known as the so-called dark arts. What? Liberal

43
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,780
arts? Aw, Stan, youíre always making history less fun.
I WANT TO BE A PROFESSOR OF THE DARK ARTS.

44
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,960
Stan: The Dark Arts job is a dangerous position.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,019
Yeah, I guess that's true, so we'll
stick with this.

46
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,109
Right so here at Crash Course, we try not
to focus too much on dates, but if Iím going

47
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,609
to convince you that the Renaissance didn't
actually happen, I should probably tell you,

48
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:03,389
you know, when it didn't happen. So traditionally
the Renaissance is associated with the 15th

49
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,960
and 16th centuries. Ish.

50
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,200
The Renaissance happened all across Europe,
but weíre going to focus on Italy, because

51
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,229
I want to and I own the video camera. Plus,
Italy really spawned the Renaissance.

52
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:16,259
What was it about Italy that lent itself to
Renaissancing? Was it the wine? The olives?

53
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,968
The pasta? The plumbers? The relative permissiveness
when it comes to the moral lassitude of their

54
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:23,028
leaders? Well, letís go to the Thought Bubble.

55
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:26,878
Italy was primed for Renaissance for exactly
one reason: Money.

56
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,108
A society has to be super rich to support
artists and elaborate building projects and

57
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,730
to feed scholars who translate and comment
on thousand-year-old documents. And the Italian

58
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:38,569
city states were very wealthy for two reasons.

59
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:43,558
First, many city states were mini-industrial
powerhouses each specializing in a particular

60
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:47,739
industrial product like Florence made cloth,
Milan made arms.

61
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:53,560
Second, the cities of Venice and Genoa got
stinking rich from trade.

62
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,960
Genoa turned out a fair number of top-notch
sailors, like for instance Christopher Columbus.

63
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,300
But the Venetians became the richest city
state of all.

64
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,260
As you'll remember from the Crusades, the
Venetians were expert sailors, shipbuilders,

65
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:09,278
and merchants, and as you'll remember from
our discussions of Indian Ocean trade, they

66
00:04:09,278 --> 00:04:14,588
also had figured out ways to trade with Islamic
empires, including the biggest economic power

67
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,129
in the region: the Ottomans.

68
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,088
Without trading with the Islamic world, especially
in pepper, Venice couldn't have afforded

69
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,529
all those painters, nor would they have had
money to pay for the incredibly fancy clothes

70
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,418
they put on to pose for their fancy portraits.

71
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:33,490
The clothes, the paint, the painters, enough
food to get a double chin, all of that was

72
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,389
paid for with money from trade with the Ottomans.

73
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,509
I know I talk a lot about trade, but that's
because itís so incredibly awesome, and it

74
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,519
really does bind the world together.

75
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,240
And while trade can lead to conflicts, on
balance, it has been responsible for more

76
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,610
peaceful contacts than violent ones because,
you know, death is bad for business.

77
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,110
This was certainly the case in the Eastern
Mediterranean where the periods of trade-based

78
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,300
diplomacy were longer and more frequent than
periods of war, even though all we ever talk

79
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,939
about is war because it's very dramatic,
which is why my brother Hank's favorite video

80
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,110
game is called Assassin's Creed, not Some
Venetian Guys Negotiate A Trade Treaty.

81
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,060
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So here's another
example of non-Europeans supporting the Renaissance:

82
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,500
The Venetians exported textiles to the Ottomans.

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,430
They were usually woven in other cities like
Florence, and the reason Florentine textiles

84
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,449
were so valuable is because their color remained
vibrant.

85
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,740
That is because they were dyed with a chemical
called alum, which was primarily found in

86
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,460
Anatolia, in the Ottoman Empire.

87
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:34,419
So to make the textiles the Ottomans craved, the
Italians needed Ottoman alum, at least until 1460.

88
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:40,658
When Giovanni da Castro, Pope Pius II's godson,
discovered alum, in Italy, in Tolfa.

89
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:45,469
And he wrote to his godfather, the Pope: "Today
I bring you victory over the Turk. Every year

90
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,840
they wring from the Christians more than 300,000
ducats for the alum with which we dye wool

91
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,938
various colors, But I have found seven mountains
so rich in this material that they could supply

92
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:02,189
seven worlds. If you will give orders to engage
workmen, build furnaces, and smelt the ore,

93
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:07,919
you will provide all Europe with alum and
the Turk will lose all his profits. Instead

94
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,358
they will accrue to you."

95
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,580
So the Pope was like, "Heck yeah." More
importantly he granted a monopoly on the mining

96
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,589
rights of alum to a particular Florentine
family, the Medicis.

97
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,500
You know, the ones you always see painted.

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,908
But vitally, Italian alum mines didn't bring
victory over the Turks, or cause them to lose

99
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:30,168
all their profits, just as mining and drilling
at home never obviate the need for trade.

100
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:33,748
Okay, one last way contact with Islam helped
to create the European Renaissance, if indeed

101
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,139
it happened: The Muslim world was the source of
many of the writings that Renaissance scholars studied.

102
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,579
For centuries, Muslim scholars had been working
their way through ancient Greek writings,

103
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:47,359
especially Ptolemy and Aristotle, who despite
being consistently wrong about everything

104
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,259
managed to be the jumping off point for thinking
both in the Christian and Muslim worlds.

105
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,519
And the fall of Constantinople in 1453 helped
further spread Greek ideas because Byzantine

106
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,139
scholars fled for Italy, taking their books with them.
So we have the Ottomans to thank for that, too.

107
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,079
And even after it had become a Muslim capital,
Istanbul was still, like, the number one destination

108
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,438
for book nerds searching for ancient Greek
texts.

109
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,180
Plus, if we stretch our definition of Renaissance
thought to include scientific thought, there

110
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,780
is a definite case to be made that Muslim
scholars influenced Copernicus, arguably the

111
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,559
Renaissance's greatest mind.

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,019
Oh, it's time for the open letter? An Open
Letter to Copernicus.

113
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:29,060
But first, let's see whatís in the secret
compartment today. Wow, the heliocentric solar

114
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,499
system? Cool. Earth in the middle, sun in
the middle, earth in the middle, sun in the

115
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:37,749
middle. Ptolemy. Copernicus. Ptolemy. Copernicus.

116
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,689
Right, an open letter to Copernicus.

117
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,770
Dear Copernicus,

118
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,658
Why you always gotta make the rest of us look
so bad?

119
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:45,728
You were both a lawyer and a doctor? That
doesn't seem fair.

120
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:49,579
You spoke four languages and discovered that
the earth is not the center of the universe, come on.

121
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,500
But at least you didn't discover it entirely
on your own. Now, there's no way to be sure

122
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:55,509
that you had access to Muslim scholarship
on this topic.

123
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,419
But one of your diagrams is so similar to
a proof found in an Islamic mathematics treatise

124
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:02,218
that it's almost impossible that you didnít
have access to it.

125
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,840
Even the letters on the diagram are almost
the same. So at least I can tell my mom that

126
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,759
when she asks why I'm not a doctor and a lawyer and
the guy who discovered the heliocentric solar system.

127
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,478
Best wishes,
John Green

128
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,498
Alright, so now having spent the last several
minutes telling you why the Renaissance happened

129
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:19,960
in Italy and not in, I don't know, like India
or Russia or whatever, I'm going to argue

130
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,778
that the Renaissance did not in fact happen.

131
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:25,038
Let's start with the problem of time. The
Renaissance isn't like the Battle of Hastings

132
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,998
or the French Revolution where people were
aware that they were living amid history.

133
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:33,168
Like, when I was eleven and most of you didnít
exist yet, my dad made my brother and me turn

134
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:37,539
off the Cosby Show and watch people climbing
on the Berlin Wall so we could see history.

135
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,360
But no one, like, woke their kids up in Tuscan
village in 1512 like, "Mario, Luigi, come

136
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,560
outside. The Renaissance is here!"

137
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,619
"Hurry, we're living in a glorious new era,
where man's relationship to learning is changing."

138
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,679
"I somehow feel a new sense of individualism
based on my capacity for reason."

139
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,329
No. In fact, most people in Europe were totally
unaware of the Renaissance, because its art

140
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,930
and learning affected a tiny sliver of the
European population.

141
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:05,269
Like, life expectancy in many areas of Europe
actually went down during the Renaissance.

142
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:10,100
Art and learning of the Renaissance didn't filter down
to most people the way that technology does today.

143
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,899
And really the Renaissance was only experienced
by the richest of the rich and those people,

144
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,639
like painters, who served them.

145
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,379
I mean, there were some commercial opportunities,
like for framing paintings or binding books,

146
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,189
but the vast majority of Europeans still lived
on farms either as free peasants or tenants.

147
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,960
And the rediscovery of Aristotle didnít in
any way change their lives, which were governed

148
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,780
by the rising and setting of the sun, and,
intellectually, by the Catholic Church.

149
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:38,419
In fact, probably about 95% of Europeans never
encountered the Renaissance's opulence or art or modes of thought.

150
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:42,120
We have constructed the Renaissance as important
not because it was so central to the 15th

151
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:46,389
century. I mean, at the time Europe wasnít
the worldís leader in, anything other than

152
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:48,549
the tiny business of Atlantic trade.

153
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:53,620
We remember it as important because it matters
to us now. It gave us the ninja turtles.

154
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:57,899
We care about Aristotle and individualism
and the Mona Lisa and the possibility that

155
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,559
Michelangelo painted an anatomically correct
brain onto the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,

156
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,519
because these things give us a narrative that
makes sense.

157
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,259
Europe was enlightened, and then it was unenlightened,
and then it was re-enlightened, and ever since

158
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,039
it's been the center of art and commerce
and history.

159
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,740
You see that cycle of life, death, and rebirth a lot
in historical recollection, but it just isn't accurate.

160
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,919
So it's true that many of the ideas introduced to Europe
in the 15th and 16th centuries became very important.

161
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,799
But remember, when we talk about the Renaissance,
weíre talking about hundreds of years. I

162
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:33,149
mean, although they share ninja turtledom, Donatello
and Raphael were born 97 years apart. And the

163
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:40,319
Renaissance humanist Petrarch was born in 1304,
229 years before the Renaissance humanist Montaigne.

164
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,250
That's almost as long as the United States
has existed. So was the Renaissance a thing?

165
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:51,879
Not really. It was a lot of mutually interdependent
things that occurred over centuries. Stupid

166
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:56,049
truth always resisting simplicity. Thanks
for watching. I'll see you next week.

167
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:00,189
Crash Sourse is produced and directed by Stan Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson. The show is

168
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,410
written by my high school history teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphic team is Thought Bubble.

169
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:08,589
Last week's phrase of the week was Angry Birds. If you wanna suggest future phrases of the week or guess at

170
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,450
this week's, you can do so in comments where you can also ask question about today's video that will

171
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,009
be answered by our team of historians. 
Thanks for watching Crash Course. As we say in my

172
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,200
hometown, Don't Forget to Be Awesome.
