00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,459
Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World
History, and today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:08,640
nationalism, the most important global phenomenon
of the nineteenth century and also the phenomenon

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,859
responsible for one of the most commented-upon
aspects of Crash Course, my globes being out of date.

4
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,219
USS "R" not a country! [Explosion noise.]
Rhodesia? [Explosion noise.]

5
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:22,519
South Vietnam? [Explosion noise.]
Sudan with no South Sudan? [Explosion noise.]

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,579
Yugoslavia? [Explosion noise.]

7
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:29,799
Okay, no more inaccuracies with the globes.
Ahhh, the little globes!

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,539
This one doesn't know about Slovakia [explosion
noise],

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,658
this one has East-frackin' Pakistan [explosion
noise]

10
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,998
and this one identifies Lithuania as part
of Asia [explosion noise].

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,659
Okay, no more globe inaccuracies. Actually,
bring back my globes. I feel naked without them.

12
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:49,519
[theme music]

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,660
So if you're into European history, you're
probably somewhat familiar with nationalism

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,129
and the names and countries associated with
it. Bismarck in Germany, Mazzini and Garibaldi

15
00:00:57,128 --> 00:01:00,768
in Italy and Mustafa Kemal, a.k.a. Ataturk,
in Turkey.

16
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:04,819
But nationalism was a global phenomenon, and
it included a lot of people you may not associate

17
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,659
with it, like Muhammad Ali in Egypt and also
this guy [Lincoln].

18
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:11,799
Nationalism was seen in the British dominions
as Canada, Australia and New Zealand became

19
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,069
federated states between 1860 and 1901. I
would say "independent states" instead of

20
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:19,039
federated states, but you guys still have
a queen!

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,160
It was also seen in the Balkans, where Greece
gained its independence in 1832 and Christian

22
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,909
principalities fought a war against the Ottomans
in 1878. In India, where a political party,

23
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,390
the Indian National Congress, was founded
in 1885, and even in China, where nationalism

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,409
ran up against the dynastic system that had
lasted more than two thousand years.

25
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,670
And then, of course, there are these guys
[Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito], who in many

26
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,420
ways, represent the worst of nationalism,
the nationalism that tries to deny or eliminate

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,370
difference in the efforts to create a homogeneous,
mythologized unitary polity. We'll get to

28
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,939
them later, but it's helpful to bring them up now
just so we don't get too excited about nationalism.

29
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:55,959
Okay, so before we launch into the history,
let's define the modern nation-state. Definitions

30
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,700
are slippery, but for our purposes, a nation-state
involves a centralized government that can

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,439
claim and exercise authority over a distinctive
territory. That's the state part. It also

32
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,500
involves a certain degree of linguistic and
cultural homogeneity - that's the nation part.

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,020
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! By that definition, China was
a nation-state by, like, probably the Han dynasty.

34
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,099
Dude, Me From the Past, you're
getting smart! Yeah, it could be, and some

35
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:20,509
historians argue that it was. Nationhood is
really hard to define. Like in James Joyce's

36
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:24,158
Ulysses, the character Bloom famously says
that a nation is "the same people living in

37
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:28,658
the same place," but then he remembers the
Irish and Jewish Diasporas and adds, "or also

38
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:33,209
living in different places." But let's ignore
Diasporas for the moment and focus on territorially-bounded

39
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,150
groups with a common heritage. Same people,
same place.

40
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,520
So how do you become a nation? Well, some
argue it's an organic process involving culturally-similar

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,120
people wanting to formalize their connections; others
argue that nationalism is constructed by governments,

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,400
building a sense of patriotism through compulsory
military service and statues of national heroes.

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,498
Public education is often seen as part of
this nationalizing project. Schools and textbooks

44
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:59,039
allow countries to share their nationalizing
narratives, which is why the once and possibly-future

45
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,098
independent nation of Texas issues textbooks
literally whitewashing early American history.

46
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:08,369
Still, other historians argue that nationalism
was an outgrowth of urbanization and industrialization,

47
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,829
since new urbanites were the most likely people
to want to see themselves as part of a nation.

48
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:18,778
For instance, Prague's population rose from
157,000 to 514,000 between 1850 and 1900,

49
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:23,778
at the same time that the Czechs were beginning
to see themselves as separate from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

50
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,419
Which is a cool idea, but it doesn't explain
why other less-industrialized places like

51
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,419
India also saw a lot of nationalism.

52
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:34,219
The actual business of nationalization involves
creating bureaucracies, new systems of education,

53
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:38,900
building a large military, and often using
that military to fight off other nation-states,

54
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:43,638
since nations often construct themselves in
opposition to an idea of otherness. A big

55
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,249
part of being Irish, for instance, is not
being English.

56
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:51,388
So emerging nations had a lot of conflicts,
including the Napoleonic Wars, which helped

57
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,650
the French become the French, the Indian Rebellion
of 1857, which helped Indians to identify

58
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,919
themselves as a homogeneous people, the American
Civil War - I mean, before the Civil War,

59
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,669
many Americans thought of themselves not as
Americans, but as Virginians or New Yorkers

60
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:10,469
or Pennsylvanians. I mean, our antebellum
nation was usually called "THESE United States."

61
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:13,288
After, it became THE United States.

62
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:18,120
So in the U.S, nationalism pulled a nation
together, but often, nationalism was a destabilizing

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,000
force for multiethnic land-based empires.
This was especially the case in the Ottoman

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,819
Empire, which started falling apart in the
nineteenth century as first the Greeks, then

65
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:30,399
the Serbs, Romanians, and Bulgarians, all
predominantly Christian people, began clamoring

66
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,780
for and, in some cases winning, independence.

67
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:36,689
Egypt is another good example of nationalism
serving both to create a new state and to

68
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,279
weaken an empire. Muhammad Ali, who was actually
Albanian and spoke Turkish, not Egyptian Arabic,

69
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,579
and his ruling family encouraged the Egyptian
people to imagine themselves as a separate nationality.

70
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,339
But okay, so nationalism was a global phenomenon
in the nineteenth century, and we can't talk

71
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,330
about it everywhere, so instead, we're going
to focus on one case study: Japan. You thought

72
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,909
I was going to say Germany, didn't you? Nope.
You can bite me, Bismarck.

73
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,040
Japan had been fragmented and feudal until
the late sixteenth century, when a series

74
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,470
of warrior landowners managed to consolidate
power. Eventually, power came to the Tokugawa

75
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,780
family, who created a military government,
or bakufu.

76
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:12,369
The first Tokugawa to take power was Ieyasu,
who took over after the death of one of the

77
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,199
main unifiers of Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi,
sometimes known as "The Monkey," although

78
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,889
his wife called him - and this is true - "The
Bald Rat."

79
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,990
In 1603, Ieyasu convinced the emperor, who
was something of a figurehead, to grant him

80
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,400
the title of shogun. And for the next 260
years or so, the Tokugawa bakufu was the main

81
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,659
government of Japan. The primary virtue of
this government was not necessarily its efficiency

82
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,920
or its forward-thinking policies, but its
stability. Stability: the most underrated

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,650
of governmental virtues. Let's go to the Thought
Bubble.

84
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:44,250
The Tokugawa bakufu wasn't much for centralization,
as power was mainly in the hands of local

85
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,060
lords called daimyo. One odd feature of the
Tokugawa era was the presence of a class of

86
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,079
warriors who, by the nineteenth century, had
become mostly bureaucrats. You may have

87
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,000
heard of them: the samurai.

88
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,819
One of the things that made this hereditary
class so interesting was that each samurai

89
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:04,120
was entitled to an annual salary from the daimyo
called a stipend. This privilege basically paid them

90
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,959
off and assured that they didn't become restless
warriors, plaguing the countryside - that is, bandits.

91
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,500
We tend to think of samurai as noble and honorable,
but urban samurai, according to Andrew Gordon's

92
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,050
book A Modern History of Japan, they were
"a rough-and-tumble lot. Samurai gang wars

93
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,290
- a West Side Story in the shadows of Edo
Castle - were frequent in the early 1600s."

94
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,360
And you still say that history books are boring.

95
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,319
As with kings and lesser nobles anywhere,
the central bakufu had trouble controlling

96
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,329
the more powerful daimyo, who were able to
build up their own strength because of their

97
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:38,060
control over local resources. This poor control
also made it really difficult to collect taxes,

98
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,000
so the Tokugawa were already a bit on the
ropes when two foreign events rocked Japan.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,040
First was China's humiliating defeat in the
Opium Wars, after which Western nations forced

100
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,360
China to give Europeans special trade privileges.
It was a wake-up call to see the dominant

101
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,350
power in the region so humbled, but even worse
for the Tokugawa was the arrival of Matthew

102
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,400
Perry. No, Thought Bubble, Matthew Perry.
Yes, that one.

103
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:04,929
The Tokugawa are somewhat famous for their
not-so-friendly policy toward foreigners,

104
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,840
especially Western Christian ones, for whom the
penalty for stepping foot on Japanese soil was death.

105
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,379
The Tokugawa saw Christianity in much the
same way as the Romans had, as an unsettling

106
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:19,060
threat to stability. And in the case of Matthew
Perry, they had reason to be worried.

107
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,389
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So the American naval
commodore arrived in Japan in 1853 with a

108
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,079
flotilla of ships and a determination to open
Japan's markets.

109
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,000
Just the threat of American steam-powered
warships was enough to convince the bakufu

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,810
to sign some humiliating trade treaties that
weren't unlike the ones that China had signed

111
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,420
after losing the Opium Wars.

112
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,310
And this only further motivated the daimyo
and samurai, who were ready to give the Tokugawa

113
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,579
the boot. Within a few years, they would.

114
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,079
So what does this have to do with nationalism?
Well, plenty. First off, even though the Americans

115
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,279
and the Japanese didn't go to war... yet,
the perceived threat provided an impetus for

116
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,579
Japan to start thinking about itself differently.

117
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,339
It also resulted in the Japanese being convinced
that if they wanted to maintain their independence,

118
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,829
they would have to reconstitute their country
as a modern nation-state.

119
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:03,430
This looks a lot like what was happening in
Egypt or even Germany, with external pressures

120
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,900
leading to calls for greater national consolidation.

121
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,929
So the Tokugawa didn't give up without a fight,
but the civil war between the stronger daimyo

122
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,840
and the bakufu eventually led to the end of
the shogunate.

123
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,429
And in 1868, the rebels got the newly-enthroned
Emperor Meiji to abolish the bakufu and proclaim

124
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,199
a restoration of the imperial throne. Now
the emperor didn't have much real power, but

125
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,800
he became a symbolic figure, a representative
of a mythical past around whom modernizers

126
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,090
could build a sense of national pride.
And in place of bakufu, Japan created one

127
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,409
of the most modern nation-states in the world.

128
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,179
After some trial and error, the Meiji leaders
created a European-style cabinet system of

129
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,690
government with a prime minister, and in 1889,
promulgated a constitution that even contained

130
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,780
a deliberative assembly, the Diet, although
the cabinet ministers weren't responsible to it.

131
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:48,839
Samurai were incorporated into this system
as bureaucrats and their stipends were gradually

132
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,340
taken away. And soon the Japanese government
developed into, like, something of a meritocracy.

133
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,980
Japan also created a new conscript army. Beginning
in 1873, all Japanese men were required to

134
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,940
spend three years in the military. The program
was initially very unpopular - there were

135
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,360
more than a dozen riots in 1873 and 1874, in
which crowds attacked military registration centers.

136
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,278
But eventually, serving in the army created
a patriotic spirit and a loyalty to the Japanese

137
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,980
emperor. The Meiji leaders also instituted
compulsory education in 1872, requiring both

138
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,560
boys and girls to attend four years of elementary
school. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter?

139
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,200
An Open Letter to Public Education. But first,
let's see what's in the Secret Compartment today.

140
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,480
Oh, it's a graduation hat. Thanks, Meredith the
intern, for letting me borrow your graduation hat.

141
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,639
Dear Public Education, When you were introduced
in Japan, you were very unpopular, because

142
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,649
you were funded by a new property tax. In
fact, you were so unpopular that at least

143
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:48,419
two thousand schools were destroyed by rioters,
primarily through arson.

144
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:51,599
Stan, it doesn't look good when you bring
it in close like that. I look like a 90-year-old swimmer.

145
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,180
And even though public education has proved
extremely successful, lots of people still

146
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,620
complain about having to pay taxes for it,
so let me explain something.

147
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,700
Public education does not exist for the benefit
of students or for the benefit of their parents.

148
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,990
It exists for the benefit of the social order.
We have discovered as a species that it is

149
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,379
useful to have an educated population.

150
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,860
You do not need to be a student or have a
child who is a student to benefit from public

151
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,940
education. Every second of every day of your
life, you benefit from public education!

152
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,000
So let me explain why I like to pay taxes
for schools, even though I don't personally

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,580
have a kid in school. It's because I don't like
living in a country with a bunch of stupid people.

154
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,379
Best wishes,
John Green.

155
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:33,649
In Japan, nationalism meant modernization,
largely inspired by, and in competition with,

156
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,490
the West. So the Meiji government established
a functioning tax system, they built public

157
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,000
infrastructure like harbors and telegraph
lines, invested heavily in railroads and created

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,799
a uniform national currency.

159
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,939
But the dark side of nationalism began to
appear early on. In 1869, the Meiji rulers

160
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,040
expanded Japan's borders to include the island
of Hokkaido, and in 1879, they acquired Okinawa

161
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,639
after forcing its king to abdicate.

162
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,759
In 1874, Japan even invaded Taiwan with an
eye toward colonizing it, though they weren't

163
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,319
successful. And in these early actions, we
already see that nationalism has a habit of

164
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,040
thriving on conflict. And often, the project
of creating a nation-state goes hand-in-hand

165
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,379
with preventing others from doing the same.

166
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:13,470
This failure to imagine the other complexly
isn't new, but it's about to get a lot more

167
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,080
problematic, as we'll see next week, when we
discuss European imperialism. Thanks for watching.

168
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,500
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

169
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:26,059
We're ably interned by Meredith Danko and
our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

170
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:29,159
Raoul Meyer: Also, the show was written by
my high school history student, John Green,

171
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,379
and myself, Raoul Meyer.

172
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,519
John: Last week's phrase of the week was "bearded
Marxist." If you'd like to guess at this week's

173
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,909
phrase of the week or suggest future ones,
you can do so in comments, where you can also

174
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:40,299
ask questions about today's video that will
be answered by our team of historians. Thanks

175
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,959
for watching Crash Course, and as we say in
my hometown, don't forget to be awesome!
