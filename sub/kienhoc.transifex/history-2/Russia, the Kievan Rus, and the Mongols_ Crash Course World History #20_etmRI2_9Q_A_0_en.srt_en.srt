00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,690
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we're gonna talk

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,410
about Russia, which means we get to talk about
this guy again! We haven’t talked about

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,219
Russia much so far because one, it’s complicated,
and two, ya actually gavaryu pa ruski a little bit,

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,740
because I had some Russian in college, and that makes
it difficult to mispronounce things, which is my thing!

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,500
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Why’d you take Russian?

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,160
Well, because I had this big crush on a Russian major.
But, anyway, I’m sure I’ll still mispronounce everything.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:31,079
[theme music]

8
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,439
So, today we’re going to talk about persistent
stereotypes about Russia, and how Russia came

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,679
to take its current shape, a turn of events
we owe largely to the Mongols.

10
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,519
But before we discuss the Mongol conquest
of Russia, let’s discuss exactly what got

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,530
conquered. So before there was a Russian empire,
or even a Russian kingdom, there was the Kievan

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,120
Rus. We know Kiev was a powerful city-state,
but who exactly founded it is a subject of

13
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,038
debate. Most historians now believe that the
settlers of Kiev were Slavic people who migrated

14
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,530
from around the Black Sea. But there’s an
older theory that the settlers of Kiev were

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,280
actually, like, Vikings. That theory goes
that Vikings came down to Kiev from rivers

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,430
like the Dnieper and founded a trading outpost
similar to ones they’d founded in Iceland

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,980
and Greenland. Which is an awesome idea and
everything, but Russian, the language that

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,310
developed from what the Rus spoke, sounds
a lot more Slavic than it sounds, you know,

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,719
Swedish. To illustrate, here is a Swede fighting
with a Russian over who founded Kiev.

20
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:32,840
Right, okay, so trade was hugely important
to Kiev. Almost all of their wars ended with

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,560
trade concession treaties, and their law codes
were unusually devoted to the subject of commerce.

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,829
The Rus traded raw materials like fur, wax,
and also slaves — We’re not gonna venture

23
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,620
into the astonishingly intense etymological
debate over whether the word ''Slav'' derives

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,380
from the Latin word for slave because there's
nothing more terrifying and verbose than an

25
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:55,729
etymologist flame war. But, yeah, the Rus
traded slaves. They also relied on agriculture

26
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,450
— and your relationships to the land determined
both your social status and your tax burden.

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,150
And if you fell into tax debt, which a lot
of peasants did, then you became bonded to

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,149
the land you farmed for the rest of your life.
I guess that slave-like dynamic is okay as

29
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,289
a model for social organization, but if you
step on the proletariat for too long, you

30
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,078
might end up with a Communist revolution.

31
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:16,989
But I’m getting way ahead of myself. Couple
more things about Kiev: First, the ruler of

32
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,400
Kiev was called the Grand Prince, and he became
the model for future Russian Kings. Also,

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,230
the early grand princes made a fateful decision:
They became Byzantine Christians. According

34
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:30,090
to legend, prince Vladimir chose to convert
the Rus to Byzantine Christianity in the 11th

35
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,739
century. He purportedly chose Christianity
over Islam because of Islam’s prohibition

36
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,519
on alcohol saying: “Drink is the joy of
the Russian.”

37
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,658
Anyway, the Kievan Rus eventually fell in
1240 when these guys showed up and replaced

38
00:02:41,658 --> 00:02:44,919
them. By that time the Rus had been at war
with pastoral nomads for centuries; from the

39
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,789
Khazars to the Pechenegs to the Cumans, and
they were tired. Which made them easy targets.

40
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:53,959
The period of Mongol “rule” over Russia
is also known as Appanage Russia. An Appanage

41
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,989
is princedom, and this period basically featured
a bunch of Russian princes vying for control

42
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,269
over territory, which is not a recipe for
political stability or economic growth, another

43
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,400
theme that will re-emerge in Russian history.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,438
By the way, I’m describing all of this as
Russia even though if you did that in the

45
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,959
13th century, people would look at you funny.
They’d be like, “What do you mean, Russia?

46
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,319
Also, where’d you get those pants? And all
those teeth?” “MMMM…YOU SMELL PRETTY.”

47
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,579
Right. So, to discuss how important the Mongols
were to Russia, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

48
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,579
The Mongols did set up the Khanate of the
Golden Horde in Russia, but it didn’t leave

49
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,239
much lasting impact on the institutions of
the region, which had already been set up

50
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,639
by the Kievans. But they did bring about a
population shift — away from the South,

51
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:36,400
where Kiev was, toward the Northeast. This
was partly to get away from the Mongols and

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,188
their massacring, but that noted, the Mongols
were comparatively light rulers: They were

53
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:45,669
happy to live in their yurts and collect tribute
from the ever-bickering Russian princes. And

54
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:50,388
all the princes had to do in exchange for
their relative freedom was recognize the Mongol

55
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:55,700
khans as their rulers and allow the Mongols
to pick the Grand Prince from among the Russians.

56
00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:00,119
Perhaps most importantly, Mongol rule cut
the Russians off from the Byzantines and further

57
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,799
isolated them from Europe, leaving Russia
not Byzantine, not European, and not really

58
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,829
Mongol either, since they hated the Mongols
and generally believed the Mongols were a

59
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,269
scourge sent from God to punish them for their
sinfulness and everything.

60
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,590
But the Mongols did help propel Moscow to
prominence and in doing so, created the idea

61
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:25,069
that this was Russia. And as an aside, they
also did what Napoleon, Hitler, and many others

62
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:29,209
couldn’t: The Mongols successfully conquered
Russia in the winter. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

63
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:33,310
So how did the Mongols help catapult Moscow
and its princes to prominence? Well, first,

64
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,149
they named Muscovite princes The Grand Prince
on more than one occasion. More importantly,

65
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:41,819
the Muscovite princes won — that is to say
purchased — the right to collect tribute

66
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,670
on behalf of the Khan from other princes.
That’s a good gig because it’s easy to

67
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,660
skim a little bit off the top before you send
it down the line to the Mongols. Which is

68
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,310
precisely what the Muscovites did to enrich
themselves. One prince who was particularly

69
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,500
good at this was known as Ivan Kalita. Using
my Russian, I can tell you that that translates

70
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,670
to “Johnny Moneybags.” As my Russian professor
would tell you, I’m a “creative” translator.

71
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,699
All this loot helped Moscow expand their influence
and buy principalities. The Mongols also helped

72
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,750
them more directly by attacking their enemies.
Plus Moscow was at the headwaters of four

73
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,850
rivers which made it well-positioned for trade.
And because they were kind of the allies of

74
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,980
the Mongols, the Mongols rarely attacked them
– which meant that lots of people went to

75
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,150
Moscow because it was relatively safe. Including
churchy people. In fact, Moscow also became

76
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:28,310
the seat of the Eastern Orthodox church in
1325, when the Metropolitan Peter moved there.

77
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,050
So you might think that the Muscovites would
be grateful for all this help from the Mongols,

78
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,970
but you would be wrong. As the Mongols’
position weakened in Russia in the latter

79
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,600
half of the 14th century, one of Moscow’s
princes Dmitry Donskoy made war on them and

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,990
inflicted the first major defeat of Mongols
in Russia at battle of Kulikovo Field. This

81
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,970
showed that the Mongols weren’t invincible,
which is always really bad for an imperial

82
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,280
force. Plus it made Moscow look like the hero
of the Russians. And that helped strengthen

83
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,489
the idea of a unified Russia, just as you’ll
remember the Persians helped unify the Greeks

84
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,829
a long time ago. Aiding this growth was stability,
which Moscow owed largely to luck: Muscovite

85
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,939
princes usually had sons which allowed them
to have successors. In fact, there was only

86
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,990
one major succession struggle and it was between
two blind guys named Basil. That’s not a

87
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,850
joke by the way. Oh, it’s time for the Open
Letter?

88
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,360
An Open Letter to Basil and Basil.

89
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,150
But first, let’s see in the Secret Compartment.
Oh, it’s Grizzlor! Yeah, I guess that is

90
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,849
kind of how the Russians saw the Mongols.

91
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,400
Dear Basils,
The 15th century Muscovite civil war was insanely

92
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,199
complicated, but it culminated with you guys
essentially blinding each other. First, Basil

93
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,860
II, the eventual winner of the civil war,
had Basil the cross-eyed blinded. Because

94
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,520
being cross-eyed wan’t bad enough. And that
was seen as the end of the political career

95
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,060
of Basil the Cross-Eyed. But then Basil the
Cross-Eyed’s brother tracked down Basil

96
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,509
II and he was like “Imma blind you back!”
And of course, everybody thought that would

97
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,180
end Basil II’s political career, but they
were wrong. It turns out you can rule Russia

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,240
like a Boss even if you’re blind.
Best wishes, John Green

99
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,980
After Basil the Blind came the real man who
expanded Moscow’s power, Ivan III, later

100
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,460
known as Ivan the Great. First, he asserted
Russian independence from the Mongols and

101
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,560
stopped paying tribute to the khan-- after
the khan had named him Grand Prince, of course.

102
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,310
Then, Ivan purchased, negotiated for or conquered
multiple appanages, thus expanding Muscovite

103
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,230
power even more. Ivan later declared himself
sovereign of all Russians and then married

104
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,750
the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, thus
giving him even more legitimacy. And he took

105
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,500
titles autocrat and tsar, which means Caesar.
Basically, Ivan created the first centralized

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,449
Russian state and for doing that he probably
deserves title “the Great.”

107
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,459
And that would be a good place to stop, except
then we won’t see the type of absolute rule

108
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:41,389
that characterized Russia for most of the
rest of its history, even unto Putin. OH GOD.

109
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,899
JUST KIDDING PUTIN! YOU’D NEVER RIG AN ELECTION..
N-NO…PLEASE DON’T PUT ME IN JAIL!

110
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,439
While Ivan III consolidated Muscovite power,
the undeniable brutal streak in Russian governance

111
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,829
comes not from the Mongols, but from Ivan
IV, better known as Ivan the Terrible. Ivan

112
00:07:54,829 --> 00:08:01,430
IV ruled from 1533 to 1584, taking the throne
at age 16, yet more evidence that adolescents

113
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,889
should not be trusted with emerging empires.
Ivan the Terrible’s reign represents the

114
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,439
end of princely power and the beginning of
the autocracy that Russia is famous for. But

115
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,410
in the beginning, he was really an innovative
leader. As a young king, he worked with a

116
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,980
group of advisers called the Chosen Council,
which certainly sounds like a good thing.

117
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,720
He also called the very first meeting of the
zemsky sobor, a grand council of representatives

118
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,420
similar to the estates general that would
become so important in France two hundred

119
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,830
years later. And also reformed the army, emphasizing
the new technology of muskets.

120
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:32,429
But in the second part of his reign, Ivan
earned his nickname, the Terrible — which

121
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,019
can mean either bad or just awe-inspiring,
depending on your perspective. Psychological

122
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,668
historians will point out that things started
go terribly wrong with Ivan after the death

123
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:44,720
of his beloved wife, Anastasia Romanov. Or
they might point to the fact that he enjoyed

124
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,730
torturing animals when he was a kid.

125
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,039
Regardless, Ivan set out to break the power
of the nobility-- the former princes and landowners

126
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,490
called the boyars. They were the last link
to princely rule. And after an odd episode

127
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,389
that saw him briefly “abdicate,” Ivan
returned to Moscow and declared he had the

128
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:02,948
right to punish all traitors and evildoers.
To help him in this effort, Ivan created the

129
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:08,438
oprichniki, a corps of secret police who rode
around on black horses, wearing all black,

130
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:13,838
whose job it was to hunt down and destroy
any enemies of the tsar. See also: Nazgûl

131
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,639
and Dementors. So this was the first of Russia’s
purges. And over the latter half of Ivan’s

132
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,688
reign, whole towns were destroyed. It was,
in effect, a civil war, except with no resistance.

133
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:27,219
One historian called it a civil massacre.
In the end, Ivan IV established absolute control

134
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,720
of the tsar over all the Russian people, but
he also set the precedent of accomplishing

135
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,680
this through terror, secret police, and the
suspension of law. And that would echo through

136
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,859
the ages of Russian history… I mean, until
Vladimir Putin heroically put an end to it.

137
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,680
His little eyes. They’re scary…

138
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,120
So, hence the stereotype of Russian brutality
and barbarism, but here’s the truth; the

139
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,240
rest of Europe also knew a lot about brutality
and secret police forces. But for centuries,

140
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,519
Russia was seen by western Europe as both
European and not, an “Other” that was

141
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,049
to be doubly feared because it was not fully
Other. And when we think of all these historical

142
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:04,620
stereotypes about Russia, it’s worth remembering
that what you see as barbaric about others

143
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,100
is often what they see as barbaric about you.
Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you next week.
