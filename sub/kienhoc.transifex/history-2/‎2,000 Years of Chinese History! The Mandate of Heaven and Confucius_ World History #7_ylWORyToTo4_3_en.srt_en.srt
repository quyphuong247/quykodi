00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,179
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course World History,
and today we’re going to talk about China, which

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:10,480
these days is discussed almost constantly on television
and in newspapers - wait, are they still a thing?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,179
So, we used to print information on thinly
sliced trees and then you would pay someone

4
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:16,829
to take these thinly sliced trees and throw
them onto your front lawn, and that’s how

5
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:19,729
we received information. No one thought this
was weird, by the way.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:28,480
[theme music]

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,219
Right, but anyway, you hear a lot about how
China is going to overtake the U.S. and bury

8
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:34,339
us under a pile of inexpensive electronics,
but I don’t want to address those fears

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,840
today. Instead, I want to talk about how the
way you tell a story shapes the story.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,120
China was really the first modern state – by
which I mean it had a centralized government

11
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,549
and a corps of bureaucrats who could execute
the wishes of that government. And it lasted,

12
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:54,500
in pretty much the same form, from 150 BCE until 1911
CE, which is technically known as a long-ass time.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,719
The Chinese were also among the first people
to write history. In fact, one of the Confucian

14
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,640
Classics is called the Shujing, or Classic
of History. This is great for us, because

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,609
we can now see the things that the Chinese
recorded as they were happening, but it is

16
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:07,689
also problematic because of the way the story
is told.

17
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:10,640
So even Me From The Past with his five minutes
of World History knows that Chinese History

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,519
is conveniently divided into periods called
Dynasties.

19
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,158
Mr. Green, I didn’t even say anything. That
doesn’t seem very fair --

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,560
Shh! What makes a dynasty a dynasty is that
it’s ruled by a king, or as the Chinese

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,859
know him, an emperor, who comes from a continuous
ruling family. As long as that family produces

22
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,560
emperors -- and they are always dudes --

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,140
No they aren't. First off, there were several
empress dowagers who wielded tremendous power

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,489
throughout Chinese history, and there was
one very important full-fledged empress, Empress

25
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,949
Wu, who WU-led China for more than 20 years
and founded her own freaking dynasty!

26
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,769
-and those emperors keep ruling, the dynasty
gets to be a dynasty.

27
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:47,149
So the dynasty can end for two reasons: either
they run out of dudes (which never happened

28
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,180
thanks to the hard work of many, many concubines),
or the emperor's overthrown after a rebellion

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,479
or a war. This is more or less what happened
to all the dynasties, which makes it easy

30
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:59,578
for me to go over to camera two and describe them
in a single run-on sentence: Hi there – camera two.

31
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,799
Leaving aside the Xia dynasty, which was sadly
fictional, the first Chinese dynasty was the

32
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,118
Shang, who were overthrown by the Zhou, which
disintegrated into political chaos called

33
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:12,180
the Warring States period, in which states
warred over periods - oh, no, wait, it was

34
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,800
a period in which states warred - which ended
when the Qin emperor was able to extend his

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,830
power over most of the heretofore warring
states, but the Qin were replaced by the Han,

36
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,599
which was the dynasty that really set the
pattern for most of China’s history and

37
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,449
lasted for almost 400 years after which China
fell again into political chaos – which

38
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:32,060
only means there was no dynasty that ruled
over all of China – and out of this chaos

39
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,810
rose the Sui, who were followed quickly by
the Tang, who in turn were replaced, after

40
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,900
a short period of no dynasty, by the Song,
who saw a huge growth in China’s commerce

41
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,110
that was still not enough to prevent them
from being conquered by the Yuan, who were

42
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,230
both unpopular and unusual... because they
were Mongols- [mongoltage] - which sparked

43
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:52,679
rebellions resulting in the rise of the Ming,
which was the dynasty that built the Great

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,300
Wall and made amazing vases, but didn’t
save them from falling to the Manchus, who

45
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,200
founded a dynasty that was called the Qing,
which was the last dynasty because in 1911

46
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,689
there was a rebellion like the ones in, say,
America, France or Russia, and the whole dynastic

47
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:08,259
system which at this point had lasted for
a long-ass time, came to an end.

48
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:12,049
And... breathe. So that's what happened, but
what's interesting, as far as capital-H History

49
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,689
is concerned, is why it happened, and especially
why the people who were writing history at

50
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:20,359
the time said it happened. Which leads us
to the Mandate of Heaven.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,400
So the concept of the Mandate of Heaven dates
from the Zhou Dynasty, and current historians

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,069
think that they created it to get rid of the
Shang. Before the Zhou, China didn’t even

53
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,839
have a concept of “Heaven” or T’ian,
but they did have a “high god” called Shangdi.

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,530
But the Zhou believed in T’ian, and they
were eager to portray the idea of heaven as

55
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,229
eternal, so they ascribed the concept of the
Mandate of Heaven back to a time even before

56
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:45,090
the Shang, explaining that the Shang were
able to conquer the Xia only because the Xia

57
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,039
kings had lost the Mandate of Heaven. This,
of course, would have been impossible, partly

58
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,179
because the Xia kings had no concept of “heaven”,
and partly because, as previously noted, they

59
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,519
didn’t exist, but let’s just leave that
aside.

60
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,260
The Shujing is pretty specific about what
caused the Xia kings to lose the Mandate,

61
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,848
by the way, explaining: “The attack on Xia
may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao.”

62
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:08,158
Sadly, the Shujing is woefully short on details
of these orgies, but orgies are the kind of

63
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:14,699
behavior that is not expected of a ruler,
and therefore Heaven saw fit to come in, remove

64
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,349
the Mandate and allow the Shang to take power.

65
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,680
But then the Shang lost the Mandate. Why?
Well, the last Shang emperor was reported

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,939
to have roasted and eaten his opponents, which,
you know, bit of a deal breaker as far as

67
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:28,100
the Mandate of Heaven is concerned. Of course,
that might not actually have happened, but

68
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,490
it would explain why Heaven would allow the
Zhou to come to power.

69
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,970
So basically the fact that one dynasty falls
and is replaced by another in a cycle that

70
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,710
lasts for 3000 years is explained, in the
eyes of early Chinese historians, by divine

71
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:43,819
intervention based on whether the ruler behaves
in a proper, upright manner. It’s after-the

72
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,019
fact analysis that has the virtue of being
completely impossible to disprove, as well

73
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:53,149
as offering a tidy explanation for some very
messy political history. And even more importantly,

74
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:57,399
it reinforces a vision of moral behavior that
is a cornerstone of Confucianism, which I

75
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,779
will get to momentarily.

76
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:02,899
But first, let’s see an example of the Mandate
of Heaven in action. The Qin dynasty on lasted

77
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,810
only 38 years, but it's one of the most important
dynasties in Chinese history, so important

78
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,120
in fact that it gave the place its name, “Chin-
uh.” (laughing) Can I just tell you guys,

79
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,399
that we literally just spent 20 minutes on
that shot? We shot it like 40 times. Stan,

80
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,049
you are in love with puns.

81
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,740
The accomplishment of the Qin was to re-unify
China under a single emperor for the first

82
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,210
time in 500 years, ending the warring states
period. As you can imagine, the making of

83
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:34,399
that particular omelette required the cracking
of quite a few eggs, and the great Qin emperor

84
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,508
Qin Shi Huangdi and his descendants developed
a reputation for brutality that was justified.

85
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:45,379
But it was also exaggerated for effect so
that the successor dynasty, the Han, would

86
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:49,149
look more legitimate in the eyes of Heaven.
So when recounting the fall of the Qin, historians

87
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:53,149
focused on how a bunch of murderous eunuchs
turned the Qin emperors into puppets, not

88
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:56,179
literal puppets, although that would have
been awesome. And these crazy eunuchs like

89
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,550
tricked emperors into committing suicide when
they started thinking for themselves, et cetera.

90
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,600
So the Mandate of Heaven turned away from
these suicidal puppet emperors, which set

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,449
up a nice contrast with the early Han emperors,
such as Wen, who came to power in 180 BCE

92
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,350
and ruled benevolently, avoiding extravagance
in personal behavior and ruling largely according

93
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,729
to Confucian principles.

94
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:19,228
Under Wen, there were no more harsh punishments
for criticizing the government, executions

95
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:23,508
declined, and, most importantly for the Confucian
scholars who were writing the history, the

96
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,139
government stopped burning books. Thus, according
to the ancient Chinese version of history,

97
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,769
Emperor Wen, by behaving as a wise Confucian,
maintains the Mandate of Heaven. So who is

98
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:36,079
this Confucius I won’t shut up about? Let’s
go to the Thought Bubble.

99
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,219
Confucius was a minor official who lived during
the Warring States period and developed a

100
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,470
philosophical and political system he hoped
would lead to a more stable state and society.

101
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,870
He spent a great deal of his time trying to
convince one of the powerful kings to embrace

102
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,250
his system, but while none ever did, Confucius
got the last laugh because his recipe for

103
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,418
creating a functioning society was ultimately
adopted and became the basis for Chinese government,

104
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,620
education, and, well, most things.

105
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,060
So Confucius was conservative. He argued that
the key to bringing about a strong and peaceful

106
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:11,310
state was to look to the past and the model
of the sage emperors. By following their example

107
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:17,180
of upright, moral behavior, the Chinese emperor
could bring order to China. Confucius’ idea

108
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,939
of morally upright behavior boils down to
a person’s knowing his or her place in a

109
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,918
series of hierarchical relationships and acting
accordingly.

110
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,939
Everyone lives his life (or her life, but
like most ancient philosophical traditions,

111
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:34,120
women were marginalized) in relationship to
other people, and is either a superior or

112
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,930
an inferior. There are five key relationships
- but the most important is the one between

113
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,579
father and son, and one of the keys to understanding
Confucius is filial piety - a son treating

114
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,300
his father with reverential respect.

115
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,439
The father is supposed to earn this respect
by caring for the son and educating him, but

116
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,430
this doesn’t mean that a son has the right
to disrespect a neglectful father. Ideally,

117
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,430
though, both the father and the son will act
accordingly: the son will respect the father,

118
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,759
and the father will act respectably.

119
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,960
Ultimately, the goal of both father and son
is to be a “superior man” (Junzi in Chinese).

120
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,918
If all men strive to be Junzi, the society
as a whole will run smoothly. This idea applies

121
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,089
especially to the emperor, who is like the
father to the whole country. Oh, it’s time

122
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,948
for the Open Letter? Alright.

123
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:28,689
God, that’s good. But first, let’s see
what’s in the Secret Compartment today.

124
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:34,708
Oh, an iPhone? Stan, this doesn’t factor
into Chinese history until much later. An

125
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,708
Open Letter to the Xia Dynasty.

126
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,528
Dear Xia Dynasty, Why you gotta be so fictional?

127
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:43,568
You contain all of the most awesome emperors,
including my favorite emperor of all time,

128
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:49,909
Yu the Engineer. There are so many The Greats
and The Terribles among royalty and so few

129
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:55,659
The Engineers. We need more kings like Yu
The Engineer: Peter The Mortgage Broker; Danica

130
00:08:55,659 --> 00:09:02,649
The Script Supervisor; Stan The Video Editing
and Producer Guy. Those should be our kings!

131
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,698
I freakin’ love you, Yu The Engineer. And
the fact that you’re not real – it breaks

132
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:13,519
my heart, in a way that could only be fixed
by Yu The Engineer. The circularity actually

133
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,159
reminds me of the Mandate of Heaven.

134
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,879
Best wishes, John Green

135
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,159
But back to the Junzi: So how do you know
how to behave? Well, first you have to look

136
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,318
to historical antecedents, particularly the
sage emperors. The study of history, as well

137
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:30,338
as poetry and paintings in order to understand
and appreciate beauty, is indispensable for

138
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,839
a Junzi. The other important aspects of Junzi-ness
are contained in the Confucian ideas of ren

139
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,259
and li. Ren and Li are both incredibly complex
concepts that are difficult to translate,

140
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,009
but we’re going to do our best.

141
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:44,699
Ren is usually translated as “propriety”.
It means understanding and practicing proper

142
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:48,588
behavior in every possible situation, which
of course depends on who you’re interacting

143
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,050
with, hence the importance of the five relationships.
Li is usually translated as “ritual” and

144
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:56,508
refers to rituals associated with Chinese
religion, most of which involve the veneration

145
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:57,409
of ancestors.

146
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:00,938
Which brings us back, in a very roundabout
way, to the fundamental problem of how early

147
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:05,019
Chinese historians wrote their history. Traditional
Chinese historians were all trained in the

148
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:10,999
Confucian classics, which emphasized the idea
that good emperors behaved like good Confucians.

149
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:14,839
Would-be historians had to know these classics
by heart and they’d imbibed their lessons,

150
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,600
chief among which was the idea that in order
to maintain the Mandate of Heaven, you had

151
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,569
to behave properly and not engage in orgies
or eat your enemies or eat your enemies while

152
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:27,078
engaging in orgies.

153
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:31,988
In this history the political fortunes of
a dynasty ultimately rest on one man and his

154
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:36,569
actions - whether he behaves properly. The
Mandate of Heaven is remarkably flexible as

155
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:40,578
an explanation of historical causation. It
explains why, as dynasties fell, there were

156
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:46,068
often terrible storms and floods and peasant
uprisings... If the emperor had been behaving

157
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,669
properly, none of that stuff would have happened.

158
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:51,838
Now, a more modern historian might point out
that the negative effects of terrible storms

159
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,529
and floods, which includes peasant uprisings,
sometimes lead to changes in leadership. But

160
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:00,928
that would take the moral aspect out of history
and it would also diminish the importance

161
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,600
of Confucian scholars.

162
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,649
Because the scholars can tell you that one
of the best ways to learn how to be a good

163
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:12,110
emperor, and thereby maintain the Mandate
of Heaven, is to read the Confucian Classics,

164
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,159
which were written by scholars.

165
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,488
In short, the complicated circularity of Chinese
history is mirrored by the complicated circularity

166
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:22,589
of the relationship between those who write
it and those who make it. Which is something

167
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,160
to think about no matter what history you’re
learning, even if it’s from Crash Course.

168
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,749
Next week we’ll talk about Alexander the
Grape— really, Stan, for an entire episode?

169
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:34,389
That seems excessive to me. They’re just
like less sour, grapey-er lemonheads - ohhh

170
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:40,360
Alexander the GREAT. That makes more sense.
Until then, thanks for watching.

171
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,480
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

172
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,928
Our graphics team is Thought Bubble, and the
show is written by my high school history

173
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:49,909
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself.

174
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,480
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Right
Here In River City". If you wanna guess at

175
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,980
this week’s phrase of the week or suggest
future ones, you may do so in comments where

176
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,700
you can also ask questions about today’s
video that'll be answered by our team of historians.

177
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,379
Thanks for watching. As we say in my hometown,
don't forget to be awesome!
