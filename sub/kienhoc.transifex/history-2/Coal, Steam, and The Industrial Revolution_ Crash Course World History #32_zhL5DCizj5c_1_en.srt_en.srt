00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,120
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re going to

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,759
discuss the series of events that made it
possible for you to watch Crash Course. And

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:12,000
also made this studio possible. And made the
warehouse containing the studio possible.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,448
A warehouse, by the way, that houses stuff
for warehouses. That’s right, it’s time

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,389
to talk about the Industrial Revolution.

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:21,899
Although it occurred around the same time
as the French, American, Latin American, and

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,599
Haitian Revolutions - between, say, 1750 and
1850 - the industrial revolution was really

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,359
the most revolutionary of the bunch.

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,118
Past John: No way, dude. All those other revolutions
resulted in, like, new borders and flags and stuff.

10
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,059
Present John: [sigh] We’ve studied 15,000
years of history here at Crash Course, Me

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,560
from the Past. And borders and flags have
changed plenty, and they’re going to keep

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,500
changing. But in all that time, nothing much changed 
about the way we disposed of waste or located

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,060
drinking water or acquired clothing. Most people lived
on or very close to the land that provided their food.

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,649
Except for a few exceptions, life expectancy
never rose above 35 or below 25. Education

15
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,909
was a privilege, not a right. In all those
millennia, we never developed a weapon that

16
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,578
could kill more than a couple dozen people
at once, or a way to travel faster than horseback.

17
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:10,068
For 15,000 years, most humans never owned
or used a single item made outside of their

18
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:15,400
communities. Simon Bolivar didn’t change that and
neither did the American Declaration of Independence.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,579
You have electricity? Industrial Revolution.
Blueberries in February? Industrial Revolution.

20
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:26,238
You live somewhere other than a farm? Industrial
Revolution. You drive a car? Industrial Revolution.

21
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,679
You get twelve years of free, formal education?
Industrial Revolution. Your bed, your antibiotics,

22
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:38,728
your toilet, your contraception, your tap
water, your every waking and sleeping second:

23
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:40,379
Industrial Revolution.

24
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:49,340
[theme music]

25
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,240
Here’s one simple statistic that sums it
up: Before the industrial revolution, about

26
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:59,298
80% of the world’s population was engaged
in farming to keep itself and the other 20%

27
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:05,200
of people from starving. Today, in the United States,
less than 1% of people list their occupation as farming.

28
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,580
I mean, we’ve come so far that we don’t
even have to farm flowers anymore. Stan, are

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,820
these real, by the way? I can’t tell if
they’re made out of foam or digital. So

30
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,439
what happened? TECHNOLOGY! Here’s my definition:

31
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:17,889
The Industrial Revolution was an increase
in production brought about by the use of

32
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:22,399
machines and characterized by the use of new
energy sources. Although this will soon get

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,810
more complicated, for our purposes today,
industrialization is NOT capitalism - although,

34
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,069
as we will see next week, it is connected
to modern capitalism. And, the industrial

35
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,560
revolution began around 1750 and it occurred
across most of the earth, but it started in

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,219
Europe, especially Britain. What happened?
Well, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

37
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:41,699
The innovations of the Industrial Revolution
were intimately interconnected. Like, look,

38
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,039
for instance, at the British textile industry:
The invention of the flying shuttle by John

39
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:51,429
Kay in 1733 dramatically increased the speed
of weaving, which in turn created demand for

40
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,650
yarn, which led to inventions like the Spinning
Jenny and the water frame. Soon these processes

41
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,840
were mechanized using water power, until the
steam engine came along to make flying shuttles

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,759
really fly in these huge cotton mills.

43
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,479
The most successful steam engine was built
by Thomas “They Didn’t Name Anything After

44
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,109
Me” Newcomen to clear water out of mines.
And because water was cleared out of those

45
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,040
mines, there was more coal to power more steam
engines, which eventually led to the fancying

46
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,289
up of the Newcomen Steam Engine by James “I
Got a Unit of Power and a University Named

47
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:25,519
After Me” Watt, whose engine made possible
not only railroads and steamboats but also

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,570
ever-more-efficient cotton mills.

49
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,919
And, for the first time, chemicals other than
stale urine (I wish I was kidding) were being

50
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,879
used to bleach the cloth that people wore
- the first of which was sulfuric acid, which

51
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,430
was created in large quantities only thanks
to lead-lined chambers, which would’ve been

52
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,770
impossible without lead production rising
dramatically right around 1750 in Britain,

53
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,350
thanks to lead foundries powered by coal.

54
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:53,269
And all these factors came together to make
more yarn that could be spun and bleached

55
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,600
faster and cheaper than ever before, a process
that would eventually culminate in $18 Crash

58
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,080
So, the problem here is that with industrialization
being so deeply interconnected, it’s really

59
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,079
difficult to figure out why it happened in
Europe, especially Britain. And that question

60
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,879
of why turns out to be one of the more contentious
discussions in world history today.

61
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,790
For instance, here are some Eurocentric reasons
why industrialization might have happened

62
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,750
first in Europe: There’s the cultural superiority
argument that basically holds that Europeans

63
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,029
are just better and smarter than other people.
Sometimes this is formulated as Europeans

64
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:35,659
possessing superior rationality. By the way,
you’ll never guess where the people who

65
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,540
make this argument tend to come from - unless
you guessed that they come from Europe.

66
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,900
And then, others argue that only Europe had
the culture of science and invention that

67
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,429
made the creation of these revolutionary technologies
possible. Another argument is that freer political

68
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,000
institutions encouraged innovation and strong
property rights created incentives for inventors.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,959
And, finally, people often cite Europe’s
small population because small populations

70
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:03,918
require labor-saving inventions. Oh, it’s
time for the Open Letter?

71
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,370
An Open Letter to the Steam Engine. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

72
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,660
today. Oh, it’s a TARDIS. Truly the apex
of British industrialization.

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,380
Dear Steam Engine, You know what’s crazy?
You’ve really never been improved upon.

74
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:21,909
Like this thing, which facilitates time travel,
probably runs on a steam engine. Almost all

75
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,720
electricity around the world, whether it’s
from coal or nuclear power, is just a steam engine.

76
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,740
It’s all still just water and heat, and
it speaks to how truly revolutionary the Industrial

77
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,879
Revolution was that since then, it’s really
just been evolution. Best Wishes, John Green

78
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,079
So, you may have heard any of those rationales
for European industrialization, or you may

79
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,469
have heard others. The problem with all of
them, is that each time you think you’re

80
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,050
at the root cause it turns out there’s a
cause of the root cause. To quote Leonardo

81
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,660
DiCaprio, James Cameron, and coal mine operators,
“We have to go deeper.”

82
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,720
But, anyway, the problem with these Eurocentric
why answers, is that they all apply to either

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,260
China or India or both. And it’s really
important to note that in 1800, it was not

84
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,659
clear that Europe was going to become the
world’s dominant manufacturing power in

85
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,439
the next hundred years. At the time, China,
India, and Europe were all roughly at the

86
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,339
same place in terms of industrial production.

87
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,539
First, let’s look at China. It’s hard
to make the European cultural superiority

88
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,600
argument because China had been recording
its history since before Confucius, and plus

89
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
there was all that bronze and painting and
poetry.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,139
It’s also kind of difficult to make a blanket
statement that China was economically inferior

91
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,230
to Europe, since they invented paper money
and led the world in exports of everything

92
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,860
from silk to china. I mean, pre-Industrial
Revolution, population growth was the surest

93
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,110
sign of economic success, and China had the
biggest population in the world. I guess that

94
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,790
answers the question of whether they’re
digital.

95
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,120
It’s also difficult to say that China lacked
a culture of invention when they invented

96
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,329
gunpowder, and printing, and paper, and arguably
compasses. And China had more free enterprise

97
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:47,560
during the Song dynasty than anywhere in the
world.

98
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,310
Some argue that China couldn’t have free
enterprise because they had a long history

99
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,439
of trying to impose monopolies on items like
salt and iron. And that’s true, but when

100
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,339
it comes to enforcing those monopolies, they
also had a long history of failure. So really,

101
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:02,209
in a lot of ways, China was at least as primed
for an Industrial Revolution as Britain was.

102
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:07,060
So, why didn’t it happen? Well, Europeans
- specifically the British - had two huge

103
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,899
advantages: First, Coal. When you trace the
story of improved transportation, or communication,

104
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:17,179
or industrial efficiency, or better chemical
manufacturing, it always comes back to coal,

105
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,120
because the Industrial Revolution was all about
using different forms of energy to automate production.

106
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,280
And England had large supplies of coal that
were near the surface, which meant that it

107
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,110
was cheap to mine, so it quickly replaced
wood for heating and cooking and stuff. So

108
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,350
that encouraged the British to look for more
coal. The only problem with coal mining, aside

109
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,260
from it being, you know, like, deadly and
everything, is that the coal mines flooded

110
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:39,269
all the time. I guess coal mining is also
a little problematic for, like, the health

111
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,849
of, you know, like, the planet.

112
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,010
But, because there was all this incentive
to get more coal out of the ground, steam

113
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,918
engines were invented to pump water out of
the mines. And because those early steam engines

114
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,568
were super inefficient, they needed a cheap
and abundant source of fuel in order to work

115
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,270
- namely, coal, which meant they were much
more useful to the British than anyone else.

116
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:00,329
So steam engines used cheap British coal to
keep British coal cheap, and cheap British

117
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,918
coal created the opportunity for everything
from railroads to steel, which like so much

118
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,819
else in the Industrial Revolution, created
a positive feedback loop. Because they run

119
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,769
on rails, railroads need steel. And because
it is rather heavy, steel needs railroads.

120
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:17,459
Secondly, there were Wages. Britain (and to
a lesser extent the Low Countries) had the

121
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,138
highest wages in the world at the beginning
of the 18th century. In 1725, wages in London

122
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,338
were the equivalent of 11 grams of silver
per day. In Amsterdam, they were 9 grams.

123
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,859
In Beijing, Venice, and Florence, they were
under 4. And in Delhi, they were under 2.

124
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,950
It’s not totally clear why wages were so
high in Britain. Like, one argument is that

125
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,379
the Black Death lowered population so much
that it tightened labor markets, but that

126
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:41,599
doesn’t explain why wages remained low in,
like, plague-ravaged Italy. Mainly, high wages

127
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,360
combined with cheap fuel costs meant that
it was economically efficient for manufacturers

128
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,680
to look to machines as a way of lowering their
production costs. To quote the historian Robert

129
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,139
Allen: “Wages were high and energy was cheap.
These prices led directly to the industrial

130
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:59,740
revolution by giving firms strong incentives
to invent technologies that substituted capital

131
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,200
and coal for labor.”

132
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
Ugh, Stan, I’m a little worried that people
are still going to accuse me of Eurocentrism.

133
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,580
Of course, other people will accuse me of
an anti-European bias. I don’t have a bias

134
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,300
against Europe. I love Europe. Europe gave
me many of my favorite cheeses and cross-country

135
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:17,278
skiing and Charlie Chaplin, who inspired today’s
Danica drawing.

136
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,950
Like, the fact of coal being near the surface
in Britain can’t be chalked up to British

137
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,420
cultural superiority. But the wages question
is a little different because it makes it

138
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:27,019
sound like only Europeans were smart enough
to pay high wages.

139
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,129
But here’s one last thing to consider: India
was the world’s largest producer of cotton

140
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:35,210
textiles, despite paying basically the lowest
wages in the world. Indian agriculture was

141
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,269
so productive that laborers could be supported
at a very low cost. And that, coupled with

142
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:43,299
a large population, meant that Indian textile
manufacturing could be very productive without

143
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,639
using machines, so they didn’t need to industrialize.

144
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,509
But more importantly from our perspective,
there’s a strong argument to be made that

145
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:52,700
Indian cotton production helped spur British
industrialization. It was cotton textiles

146
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,440
that drove the early Industrial Revolution,
and the main reason that Britain was so eager

147
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,029
to produce cottons was that demand was incredibly
high. They were more comfortable than woolens,

148
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:05,109
but they were also cheaper, because cottons
could be imported from India at such a low cost.

149
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,039
So, Indian cottons created the market and
then British manufacturers invested in machines

150
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,730
(and imported Indian know-how) to increase
production so that they could compete with

151
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,639
India. And that’s at least one way in which
European industrialization was truly a world

152
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,100
phenomenon. For those of you who enjoy such
highly contentious and thorny, cultural historical

153
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,080
debates, good news. Next week, we’ll be
talking about capitalism.

154
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,960
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you then.

155
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,740
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

156
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,639
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself. We are ably

157
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,129
interned by Meredith Danko. And our graphics
team is Thought Bubble.

158
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:44,049
Last week’s phrase of the week was "The
New England Revolution." That was challenging.

159
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:46,969
If you want to suggest future phrases of the
week or take a guess at this week's, you can

160
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,629
do so in comments, where you can also ask
questions about today’s video that will

161
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,570
be answered by our team of historians.

162
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,290
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome.
