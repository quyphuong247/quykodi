00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, my name is John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we're gonna talk about slavery.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,900
Slavery is not funny. In fact, it is very
near the top of the list of things that aren't

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,469
funny, so today's episode is gonna be a little
light on the jokes but, I'm gonna help you

4
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:20,149
understand what pre-Civil War Americans often
euphemistically refer to as "the peculiar institution."

5
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:29,109
[Intro Music]

6
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,338
Slavery is as old as civilization itself,
although it is not as old as humanity thanks

7
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:37,759
to our hunting and gathering foremothers,
but the numbers involved in the Atlantic slave

8
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,759
trade are truly staggering.

9
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,640
From 1500 to 1880CE somewhere between 10 and
12 million African slaves were forcibly moved

10
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,759
from Africa to the Americas and about 15%
of those people died during the journey.

11
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:52,609
I know you're saying that looks like a very
nice ship, I mean my God, its almost as big

12
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:56,908
as South America, yeah, not to scale, and
those who didn't die became property; bought

13
00:00:56,908 --> 00:00:58,548
and sold like any commodity.

14
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:04,289
Where Africans came from and went to changed
over time, but in all 48% of slaves went to

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,350
the Caribbean, and 41% to Brazil, although
few Americans recognize this, relatively few

16
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:13,030
slaves were imported to the U.S, only about
5% of the total.

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,189
It's also worth noting that by the time Europeans
started importing Africans into the Americas,

18
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,189
Europe had a long history of trading slaves.

19
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:23,019
The first real European slave trade began
after the 4th Crusade in 1204; the crusade

20
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:27,170
that you will remember as "The Crazy One".
Italian merchants imported thousands of Armenians,

21
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,780
Circassian and Georgian slaves to Italy. Most
of them were women who worked as household

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,049
servants but many worked processing sugar,
and sugar is of course a crop that African

23
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,890
slaves later cultivated in the Caribbean.

24
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,560
Camera 2 side note; none of the primary crops
grown by slaves--sugar, tobacco, coffee--is

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,329
necessary to sustain human life. So in a way,
slavery is a very early by-product of a consumer

26
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:50,750
culture that revolves around the purchase
of goods that bring us pleasure, but not sustenance.

27
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,879
You are welcome to draw your own metaphorically
resonant conclusions from this fact.

28
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,819
One of the big misconceptions about slavery,
or at least when I was growing up, is that

29
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,699
Europeans somehow captured Africans, put them
in chains, stuffed them on boats and then

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,019
took them to the Americas.

31
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:08,478
The chains and ships bit is true as is the
America part if you define America as America

32
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,780
and not as 'Merica, but Africans were living
in all kinds of conglomerations. From small

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,169
villages to city-states to empires and they
were much too powerful for the Europeans to

34
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:21,419
just conquer. And in fact, Europeans obtained
African slaves by trading for them.

35
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:24,699
Because trade is a two-way proposition, this
meant that Africans were captured by other

36
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:30,169
Africans and then traded to Europeans in exchange
for goods; usually like metal tools or fine

37
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:34,879
textiles or guns; and for those Africans, slaves
were a form of property, and a very valuable one.

38
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,400
In many places, slaves were one of the only
sources of private wealth because land was

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,939
usually owned by the state.

40
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:43,379
And this gets to a really important point;
if we're gonna understand the tragedy of slavery,

41
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,709
we need to understand the economics of it;
we need to get inside what Mark Twain famously

42
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,009
called "a deformed conscience." We have to
see slaves both as they were, as human beings,

43
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:55,459
and as they were viewed, as an economic commodity.

44
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,909
Right, so you probably know about the horrendous
conditions aboard slave ships, which at their

45
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:02,639
largest could hold 400 people. but it's worth
underscoring that each slave had an average

46
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,738
of four square feet of space. That is 4 square
feet. As one eye-witness testified before

47
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,629
Parliament in 1791, "They had not so much
room as a man in his coffin."

48
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:16,680
Once in the Americas, the surviving slaves
were sold in a market very similar to the

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,520
way cattle would be sold. After purchase,
slave owners would often brand their new possession

50
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,750
on the cheeks, again, just as they would do
with cattle. The lives of slaves were dominated

51
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,650
by work and terror, but mostly work.

52
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,610
Slaves did all types of work, from housework
to skilled crafts work, and some even worked

53
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,520
as sailors, but the majority of them worked
as agricultural laborers. In the Caribbean

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,770
and Brazil, most of them planted, harvested
and processed sugar, working ten months out

55
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,360
of the year, dawn until dusk.

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,750
The worst part of this job, which is saying
something, because there were many bad parts,

57
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,939
was fertilizing the sugar cane. This required
slaves to carry 80 pound baskets of manure

58
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,989
on their heads up and down hilly terrain.

59
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,909
MFTP:"Mr. Green, Mr. Green! ...Isn't there
a poop joke in there somewhere?"

60
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,370
John Green: No, me-from-the-past, because
this whole thing is too depressing!

61
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,379
When it came time to harvest and process the
cane, speed was incredibly important because

62
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:05,068
once cut, sugar sap can go sour within a day.
This meant that slaves would often work 48

63
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:09,179
hours straight during harvest time, working
without sleep in the sweltering sugar press

64
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,379
houses where the cane would be crushed in
hand rollers and then boiled. Slaves often

65
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,028
caught their hands in the rollers, and their
overseers kept a hatchet on hand for amputations.

66
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,680
Ugh.....I told you this wasn't going to be
funny.

67
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,639
Given these appalling conditions, it's little
wonder that the average life expectancy for

68
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,879
a Brazilian slave on a sugar plantation in
the late 18th century was 23 years.

69
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,759
Things were slightly better in British sugar
colonies like Barbados, and in the U.S., living

70
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,069
and working conditions were better still.
So relatively good that, in fact, slave populations

71
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,150
began increasing naturally, meaning that more
slaves were born than died.

72
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:44,258
This may sound like a good thing, but it is
of course it's own kind of evil because it

73
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:47,520
meant that slave owners were calculating that
if they kept their slaves healthy enough,

74
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,778
they would reproduce and then the slave owners
could steal and sell their children. Or use

75
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:53,959
them to work their land, either way, blech!

76
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,088
Anyway, this explains why even though the
percentage of slaves imported from Africa

77
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,709
to the United States was relatively small,
slaves and other people of African descent

78
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:04,158
came to make up a significant portion of the
U.S. population. The brutality of working

79
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:07,959
conditions in Brazil, on the other hand, meant that
slaves were never able to increase their population

80
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:13,459
naturally, hence the continued need to import 
slaves into Brazil until slavery ended in the 1880s.

81
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,658
So I noted earlier that slavery isn't new,
it's also a hard word to define. Like Stalin

82
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:21,990
forced millions to work in the gulags, but
we don't usually consider those people slaves.

83
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,900
On the other hand, many slaves in history
had lives of great power, wealth, and influence.

84
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:30,138
Like remember Zheng He, the world's greatest
admiral?He was technically a slave, so were

85
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,199
many of the most important advisors to Suleiman
the Magnificent. So was Darth Vader!

86
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,150
But Atlantic slavery was different and more
horrifying, because it was chattel slavery,

87
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:41,299
a term historians use to indicate that the
slaves were move-able property.

88
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, it's time for the open letter?

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,680
An open letter to the word slave.

90
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:55,069
But first lets see what's in the secret compartment
today. Oh. It's Boba Fett. Noted owner of

91
00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:00,119
a ship called Slave One. And apparently a
ballet dancer. (Singing) Do do doloo do do doo...

92
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:02,949
Stan: That's a fine approximation of ballet
music.

93
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:05,169
(Laughter)
John: Thank you Stan.

94
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:08,788
Alright, dear slave, as a word. You are over
used.

95
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:15,158
Like Britney Spears, I'm a Slave 4 U, no you're not!
Boba Fett's ship, Slave One, a ship can't be a slave!

96
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:20,079
But more importantly slave, you are constantly
used in political rhetoric, and never correctly!

97
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,079
There's nothing new about this,witness for
instance, all the early Americans claiming

98
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,538
that paying the stamp tax would make them
slaves. And that was in a time when they knew

99
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:28,668
exactly what slavery looked like!

100
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:32,838
Taxes, as I have mentioned before, can be
very useful. I, for instance like paved roads.

101
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:37,399
But even if you don't like a tax, it's not
slavery. Here, I have written for you a list

102
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:43,718
of all the times it is okay to use the word
slave, oh, it is a one item long list!

103
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:45,199
Best Wishes, John Green.

104
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,978
So what exactly makes slavery so horrendous?
Well, definitions are slippery, but I'm going

105
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:52,758
to start with the definition of slavery proposed
by sociologist Orlando Patterson.

106
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,990
It is "the permanent, violent and personal
domination of natally alienated and generally

107
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,278
dishonoured persons." According to this definition
a slave is removed from the culture, land

108
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:06,490
and society of his or her birth suffers from
what Patterson called "social death".

109
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,769
Ultimately then, what makes slavery slavery
is that slaves are de-humanized. The Latin

110
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,658
word that gave us 'chattel', also gave us
'cattle'.

111
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:18,399
In many ways Atlantic slavery drew from previous
models of slavery, and took every that sucked

112
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,519
about each of them and combined them into
a big ball so that it would be the biggest

113
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,049
possible ball of suck.

114
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,468
Stan am I allowed to say suck on this show?
(pause) Nice.

115
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:29,988
Now to understand what I'm talking about we
need to look at some previous models of slavery.

116
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:30,959
Lets go to the Thought Bubble.

117
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,868
The Greeks were among the first to consider
otherness a characteristic of slaves. Most

118
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:39,550
Greek slaves were Barbarians and their inability
to speak Greek kept them from talking back

119
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,710
to their masters, and also indicated their
slave status.

120
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:47,019
Aristotle, who despite being spectacularly
wrong about almost everything was incredibly

121
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:52,049
influential, believed that some people were
just naturally slaves, saying "It is clear

122
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,939
that there are certain people who are free,
and certain people who are slaves by nature,

123
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,309
and it is both to their advantage, and just,
for them to be slaves"

124
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:05,669
This idea, despite being totally insane, remained
popular for millennia. The Greeks popularized

125
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:09,539
the idea that slaves should be traded from
far away, but the Romans took it to another level.

126
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,218
Slaves probably made up 30% of the total Roman
population, similar to the population of America

127
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:20,240
at slavery's height. The Romans also invented
the plantation, using mass numbers of slaves

128
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,038
to work the land on giant farms called latifundia,
so called because they were not fun.

129
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,558
The Judeo-Christian world also contributed
as well, and though we are not going to venture

130
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:33,690
into the incredibly complicated role that
slavery plays in the Bible because I vividly

131
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,080
remember the comments section of the Christianity
episode, the Bible was widely used to justify

132
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,879
slavery. And in particular the enslavement
of Africans, because of the moment in Genesis

133
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:49,409
when Noah curses Ham, saying "cursed be Canaan,
the lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers".

134
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:54,579
This encapsulates the two ideas vital to Atlantic
slavery: 1. that slavery can be a hereditary

135
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,139
status passed down through generations, and
2. that slavery is the result of human sin.

136
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:06,220
Both ideas serve as powerful justifications for holding
an entire race in bondage. Thanks Thought Bubble.

137
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,139
But there were even more contributors to the
ideas that led to Atlantic slavery. For instance,

138
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,340
Muslim Arabs were the first to import large
number of Bantu speaking Africans to their

139
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,350
territory as slaves. The Muslims called these
Africans Zanj and they were a distinct and

140
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,470
despised group, distinguished from other North
Africans by the colour of their skin.

141
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,769
The Zanj and territory held by the Abbasid
staged one of the first big slave revolts

142
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:29,100
in 869CE, and it may be that this revolt was
so devastating that it convinced the Abbasid

143
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,639
that large scale, plantation-style agriculture
on the Roman model just wasn't worth it.

144
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,429
But by then they'd connected the Aristotelian
idea that some people are just naturally slaves

145
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:41,419
with the appearance of Sub-Saharan Africans.
The Spanish and the Portuguese, you no doubt

146
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:44,949
remember, were the Europeans with the closest
ties to the Muslim world because there were

147
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,540
Muslims living on the Iberian Peninsula until
1492. So it makes sense that the Iberians

148
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:52,459
were the first to these racist attitudes towards
blacks.

149
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,970
And as the first colonizers of the Americas
and the dominant importers of slaves, the

150
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,190
Portuguese and the Spanish helped define the
attitudes that characterized Atlantic slavery,

151
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,650
beliefs they'd inherited from a complicated
nexus of all the slave holders who came before them.

152
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:08,519
In short Atlantic slavery was a monstrous
tragedy, but it was a tragedy in which the

153
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,039
whole world participated, and it was the culmination
of millennia of imagining the other as inherently

154
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,079
lesser. It's tempting to pin all the blame
for Atlantic slavery on one particular group,

155
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,740
but to blame one group is to exonerate all
the others, and by extension ourselves.

156
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,610
The truth that we must grapple with is that
a vast array of our ancestors, including those

157
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,139
we think of as ours, whoever they may be,
believed it was possible for their fellow

158
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,019
human being to be mere property.

159
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,220
Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week.

160
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,800
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson,

161
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,659
this show is written by my High School history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics

162
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:44,439
team is Thought Bubble.

163
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,330
Last weeks Phrase of the Week was "Cinnamon
Challenge", I hate you for that by the way.

164
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,030
If you want to suggest future Phrases of the
Week you can do so in comments, where you

165
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,809
can also guess at this week's Phrase of the
Week or ask questions of our team of historians.

166
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:57,829
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my home town, don't forget to be awesome.
