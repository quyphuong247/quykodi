00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,919
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,910
about decolonization. The empires European
states formed in the 19th century proved about

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,669
as stable and long-lasting as Genghis Khan’s
leading to so many of the nation states we

4
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:15,779
know and love today. Yes, I’m looking at
you, Burundi.

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,980
[singing] DID YOU EVER KNOW YOU’RE MY BURUNDI?
YOU’RE EVERYTHING

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,280
[theme music]

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,880
STAN, DON’T CUT TO THE INTRO! I SING LIKE
AN ANGEL!

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:33,600
[theme music]

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,120
So unless you’re over 60-- and let’s face
it, Internet, you’re not-- you’ve only

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,240
ever known a world of nation states. But as
we’ve seen from Egypt to Alexander the Great

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:48,000
to China to Rome to the Mongols, who, for
once, are not the exception here, [Mongoltage]

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,039
to the Ottomans and the Americas, empire has long
been the dominant way we’ve organized ourselves

13
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,060
politically -- or at least the way that
other people have organized us.

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,869
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! So to them
Star Wars would’ve been, like, a completely

15
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:02,899
different movie. Most of them would’ve been
like, Go Empire! Crush those rebels!

16
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, also they’d be like what is this screen
that displays crisp moving images of events

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,079
that are not currently occurring? Also, not
to get off-topic, but you never learn what

18
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,819
happens AFTER the rebel victory in Star Wars.
And, as as we’ve learned from the French

19
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:18,099
Revolution to the Arab Spring, revolution
is often the easy part. I mean, you think

20
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:22,419
destroying a Death Star is hard? Try negotiating
a trade treaty with Gungans. Right, anyway.

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,189
So, the late 20th century was not the first
time that empires disintegrated. Rome comes

22
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,489
to mind. Also the Persians. And of course
the American Revolution ended one kind of

23
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,619
European imperial experiment. But in all those
cases, Empire struck back… heh heh, you

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,620
see what I did there? I mean, Britain lost
its 13 colonies, but later controlled half

25
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,920
of Africa and all of India. And what makes
the recent decolonization so special is that

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,780
at least so far, no empires have emerged to
replace the ones that fell.

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,710
And this was largely due to World War II because
on some level, the Allies were fighting to

28
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:56,000
stop Nazi imperialism. Hitler wanted to take
over Central Europe, and Africa, and probably

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,340
the Middle East-- and the Ally defeat of the
Nazis discredited the whole idea of empire.

30
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,890
So the English, French, and Americans couldn’t
very well say to the colonial troops who’d

31
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,788
fought alongside them, “Thank you so much
for helping us to thwart Germany’s imperialistic

32
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,809
ambitions. As a reward, please hand in your
rifle and return to your state of subjugation.”

33
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,729
Plus, most of the big colonial powers-- especially
France, Britain, and Japan-- had been significantly

34
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,688
weakened by World War II, by which I mean
that large swaths of them looked like this.

35
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:27,968
So, post-war decolonization happened all over
the place: The British colony that had once

36
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,348
been “India” became three independent
nations. By the way, is this Gandhi or is

37
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:37,449
this Ben Kingsley playing Gandhi? In Southeast
Asia, French Indochina became Cambodia, Laos,

38
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,709
and Vietnam. And the Dutch East Indies became
Indonesia. But of course when we think about

39
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,259
decolonization, we mostly think about Africa
going from this to this.

40
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,858
So we’re gonna oversimplify here, because
we have to, but decolonization throughout

41
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,799
Afro-Eurasia had some similar characteristics.
Because it occurred in the context of the

42
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:58,159
Cold War, many of these new nations had to
choose between socialist and capitalist influences,

43
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,039
which shaped their futures. While many of
these new countries eventually adopted some

44
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,090
form of democracy, the road there was often
rocky. Also, decolonization often involved

45
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,058
violence, usually the overthrow of colonial
elites.

46
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:14,169
But we’ll turn now to the most famous nonviolent--
or supposedly so, anyway-- decolonization:

47
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:18,599
that of India. So the story begins, more or
less, in 1885 with the founding of the Indian

48
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,399
National Congress. Congress Party leaders
and other nationalists in India were usually

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,549
from the elite classes. Initially, they didn’t
even demand independence from Britain. But

50
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,419
they were interested in creating a modern
Indian nation rather than a return to some

51
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:36,599
ancient pre-colonial form, possibly because
India was-- and is--hugely diverse and really

52
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:41,528
only unified into a single state when under
imperial rule by one group or another, whether

53
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:46,060
the Mauryans, the Guptas, the Mughals, or
the British. Okay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

54
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,319
The best known Indian nationalist, Mohandas
K. Gandhi, was a fascinating character. A

55
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,848
British educated lawyer born to a wealthy
family, he’s known for making his own clothes,

56
00:03:54,848 --> 00:04:00,078
his long fasts, and his battles to alleviate
poverty, improve the rights of women, and

57
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,799
achieve a unified Indian independence from
Britain. In terms of decolonization, he stands

58
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,049
out for his use of nonviolence and his linking
it to a somewhat mythologized view of Indian

59
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,150
history. I mean, after all, there’s plenty
of violence in India’s past and in its heroic

60
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,389
epics, but Gandhi managed to hearken back
to a past that used nonviolence to bring change.

61
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,419
Gandhi and his compatriot Jawaharlal Nehru
believed that a single India could continue

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,949
to be ruled by Indian elites and somehow transcend
the tension between the country’s Hindu

63
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:30,960
majority and its sizable Muslim minority.

64
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,430
In this they were less practical than their
contemporary, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader

65
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,870
of the Muslim League who felt-- to quote historian
Ainslie Embree-- "that the unified India of

66
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,800
which the Congress spoke was an artificial
one, created and maintained by British bayonets.”

67
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,379
Jinnah proved correct and in 1947 when the
British left, their Indian colony was partitioned into

68
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:55,379
the modern state of India and West and East Pakistan,
the latter of which became Bangladesh in 1971.

69
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,259
While it’s easy to congratulate both the
British and the Indian governments on an orderly

70
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:05,579
and nonviolent transfer of power, the reality
of partition was neither orderly nor nonviolent.

71
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:10,219
About 12 million people were displaced as
Hindus in Pakistan moved to India and Muslims

72
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,419
in India moved to Pakistan. As people left
their homes, sometimes unwillingly, there

73
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:19,139
was violence, and all tolled as many as half
a million people were killed, more than died

74
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,110
in the bloody Indonesian battle for independence.
So while it’s true that the massive protests

75
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,669
that forced Britain to end its colonization
of India were nonviolent, the emergence of

76
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:32,560
the independent states involved really wasn’t.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,629
All this violence devastated Gandhi, whose
lengthy and repeated hunger strikes to end

78
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:41,099
violence had mixed results, and who was eventually
assassinated by a Hindu nationalist who felt

79
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:44,819
that Gandhi was too sympathetic to Muslims.
Oh, it’s time for the open letter?

80
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,140
An Open Letter to hunger strikers.

81
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,039
But first, let’s see what’s in the secret
compartment today.

82
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,060
A cupcake? Stan, this just seems cruel. These
are from Meredith the Intern to celebrate

83
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,620
Merebration, the holiday she invented to celebrate
the anniversary of her singleness.

84
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,120
Dear hunger strikers, Do you remember earlier
when I said that Gandhi hearkened back to

85
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:14,040
a mythologized Indian past? Well it turns
out that hunger striking in India goes back

86
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,150
all the way to, like, the 5th century BCE.
Hunger strikes have been used around the world

87
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,168
including British and American suffragettes,
who hunger struck to get the vote. And in

88
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:25,878
pre-Christian Ireland, when you felt wronged
by someone, it was common practice to sit

89
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,759
on their doorstep and hunger strike until
your grievance was addressed. And sometimes

90
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,129
it even works. I really admire you, hunger
strikers. But I lack the courage of your convictions.

91
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:40,500
Also, this is an amazing cupcake.
Best wishes, John Green

92
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,939
Since independence, India has largely been
a success story, although we will talk about

93
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,439
the complexity of India’s emerging global
capitalism next week.

94
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,509
For now, though, let’s travel east to Indonesia,
a huge nation of over 13,000 islands that

95
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:56,669
has largely been ignored here on Crash Course
World History due to our long-standing bias

96
00:06:56,668 --> 00:07:01,308
against islands. Like, we haven’t even mentioned
Greenland on this show. The Greenlanders,

97
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:04,389
of course, haven’t complained because they
don’t have the Internet.

98
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,728
So, the Dutch exploited their island colonies
with the system of cultuurstelsel, in which

99
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:12,418
all peasants had to set aside one fifth of
their land to grow cash crops for export to

100
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:17,478
the Netherlands. This accounted for 25% of
the total Dutch national budget and it explains

101
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,248
why they have all kinds of fancy buildings
despite technically living underwater. They’re

102
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:25,610
like sea monkeys. This system was rather less
popular in Indonesia, and the Dutch didn’t

103
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,979
offer much in exchange. They couldn’t even
defend their colony from the Japanese, who

104
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:32,990
occupied it for most of World War II, during
which time the Japanese furthered the cause

105
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,230
of Indonesian nationalism by placing native
Indonesians in more prominent positions of

106
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,810
power, including Sukarno, who became Indonesia’s
first prime minister.

107
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,120
After the war, the Dutch-- with British help--
tried to hold onto their Indonesian colonies

108
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,400
with so-called “police actions,” which
went on for more than four years before Indonesia

109
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,818
finally won its independence in 1950. Over
in the French colonies of Indochina, so called

110
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,819
because they were neither Indian nor Chinese,
things were even more violent. The end of

111
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,908
colonization was disastrous in Cambodia, where
the 17-year reign of Norodom Sihanouk gave

112
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:07,908
way to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, which
massacred a stunning 21% of Cambodia’s population

113
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:10,620
between 1975 and 1979.

114
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,840
In Vietnam, the French fought communist-led
nationalists, especially Ho Chi Minh from

115
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:19,550
almost the moment World War II ended until
1954, when the French were defeated. And then

116
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,009
the Americans learned that there was a land
war available in Asia, so they quickly took

117
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:27,598
over from the French and communists did not
fully control Vietnam until 1975. Despite

118
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,300
still being ostensibly communist, Vietnam
now manufactures all kinds of stuff that we

119
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,379
like in America, especially sneakers.

120
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,980
More about that next week, too, but now to
Egypt. You’ll remember that Egypt bankrupted

121
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,320
itself in the 19th century, trying to industrialize
and ever since had been ruled by an Egyptian

122
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,210
king who took his orders from the British.
So while technically Egypt had been independent

123
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,560
since 1922, it was very dependent independence.
But, that changed in the 1950s, when the king

124
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,509
was overthrown by the army. The army commander
who led that coup was Gamal Abdul Nasser,

125
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,819
who proved brilliant at playing the US and
the USSR off each other to the benefit of

126
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,690
Egypt. Nasser’s was a largely secular nationalism,
and he and his successors saw one of the other

127
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,690
anti-imperialistic nationalist forces in Egypt,
the Muslim Brotherhood, as a threat. So once

128
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,620
in power, Nasser and the army banned the Muslim
Brotherhood, forcing it underground, where

129
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,879
it would disappear and never become an issue
again. Wait, what’s that? …Really?

130
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,710
And finally let’s turn to Central and Southern
Africa. One of the most problematic legacies

131
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,100
of colonialism was its geography. Colonial
boundaries became redefined as the borders

132
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,870
of new nation states, even where those boundaries
were arbitrary or, in some cases, pernicious.

133
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,769
The best known example is in Rwanda, where
two very different tribes, the Hutu and the

134
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,029
Tutsis were combined into one nation. But,
more generally, the colonizers’ focus on

135
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,779
value extraction really hurt these new nations.
Europeans claimed to bring civilization and

136
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,069
economic development to their colonies, but
this economic development focused solely on

137
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,020
building infrastructure to get resources and
export them.

138
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,460
Now whether European powers deliberately sabotaged
development in Africa is a hot-button topic

139
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,660
we’re going to stay well away from, but
this much is inarguably true: when the Europeans

140
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:05,389
left, African nations did not have the institutions
necessary to thrive in the post-war industrial

141
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:09,379
world. They had very few schools, for instance,
and even fewer universities. Like, when the

142
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:15,850
Congo achieved independence from Belgium in
1960, there were sixteen college graduates

143
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,360
in a country of fourteen million people.

144
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,159
Also, in many of these new countries, the
traditional elites had been undermined by

145
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,549
imperialism. Most Europeans didn’t rule
their African possessions directly but rather

146
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:30,179
through the proxies of local rulers. And once
the Europeans left, those local rulers, the

147
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,479
upper classes, were seen as illegitimate collaborators.
And this meant that a new group of rulers

148
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,889
had to rise up to take their place, often
with very little experience in governance.

149
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:42,819
I mean, Zimbabwe’s long-serving dictator
Robert Mugabe was a high school teacher. Let

150
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,160
that be a lesson to you. YOUR TEACHERS MAY
HAVE DICTATORIAL AMBITIONS. But most strongmen

151
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,219
have emerged, of course, from the military:
Joseph Mobutu seized power in the Congo, which

152
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:58,560
he held from 1965 until his death in 1997.
Idi Amin was military dictator of Uganda from

153
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:05,469
1971 to 1979. Muammar Gaddafi ruled Libya
from 1977 until 2011. The list goes on, but

154
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,190
I don’t want to give the wrong impression
about Africa.

155
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,310
Because while the continent does have less
freedom and lower levels of development than

156
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:16,250
other regions in the world, many African nations
show strong and consistent signs of growth

157
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,940
despite the challenges of decolonization.
Botswana for instance has gone from 70% literacy

158
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:27,450
to 85% in the past 15 years and has seen steady
GDP growth over 5%. Benin’s economy has

159
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,170
grown in each of the past 12 years, which
is better than Europe or the US can say. In

160
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:38,589
2002, Kenya’s life expectancy was 47; today
it’s 63. Ethiopia’s per capita GDP has

161
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:44,090
doubled over the past 10 years; and Mauritania has
seen its infant mortality rate fall by more than 40%.

162
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,509
Now, this progress is spotty and fragile,
but it’s important to note that these nations

163
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:54,299
have existed, on average, about 13 years less
than my dad. Of course, past experience with

164
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,889
the fall of empires hasn’t given us cause
for hope, but many citizens of these new nations

165
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,759
are seeing real progress. That said, disaster
might lurk around the corner. It’s hard

166
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,819
to say. I mean, now more than ever, we’re
trying to tell the story of humans… from

167
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,780
inside the story of humans.

168
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,059
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

169
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,079
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

170
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,680
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

171
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,329
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself. And our
graphics team is Thought Bubble. Last week’s

172
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,190
phrase of the week was “Meatloaf’s Career.”
If you want to guess at this week’s phrase

173
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,060
of the week or suggest future ones, you can
do so in comments where you can also ask questions

174
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,439
about today’s video that will be answered
by our team of historians. Thanks for watching

175
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,680
Crash Course and as we say in my hometown,
Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
