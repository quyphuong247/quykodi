00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,740
Hi, I’m John Green. This is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,440
about World War II. Finally, a war with some
color film! So, here at Crash Course we try to make

3
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:14,359
history reasonably entertaining, and fortunately,
World War II was hilarious...said no one ever.

4
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:17,829
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Is this, like, gonna
be one of the unfunny ones where you build

5
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:22,159
to the big melodramatic conclusion about how
I have to imagine the world more complexly?

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,740
Me from the Past, as long as you have that
eighth rate soup-strainer, I’m not even

7
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,719
going to acknowledge your existence.

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:36,679
[theme music]

9
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,659
Right, so you’ve probably heard a lot about
World War II from movies and books, The History

10
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:45,549
Channel, before it decided that Swamp People
were History, the incessant droning of your

11
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:48,968
grandparents, etc. We’re not gonna try to
give you a detailed synopsis of the war today.

12
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:52,270
Instead, we’re going to try to give a bit
of perspective on how the most destructive

13
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,129
war in human history happened, and why it
still matters globally.

14
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:59,759
So one of the reasons history classes tend
to be really into wars is that they’re easy

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,500
to put on tests. They start on one day and
they end on another day. And they’re caused

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,909
by social, political, and economic conditions
that can be examined in a multiple choice

17
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,909
kind of manner. Except, not really.

18
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:16,000
Like, when did World War II start? In September
1939, when the Nazis invaded Poland? I’d

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,180
say no - it actually started when Japan invaded
Manchuria in 1931, or at the very latest when

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,540
the Japanese invaded China in 1937, because
they didn’t stop fighting until 1945. Then again,

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,219
you could also argue 1933, when Hitler took power, or
1941, when America started fighting. It’s complicated.

22
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,439
But anyway, in China the fighting was very
brutal, as exemplified by the infamous rape

23
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,770
of Nanking, which featured the slaughter of
hundreds of thousands of Chinese people and

24
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:46,688
is still so controversial today that:
1. It affects relations between Japan & China

25
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:48,669
and
2. Even though I have not described it in

26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,579
detail, you can rest assured that there will be angry
comments about my use of the word “slaughter.”

27
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,259
But the World War II we know the most about
from movies and TV is primarily the war in

28
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,359
the European theater, the one that Adolf Hitler
started. Hitler is the rare individual who

29
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,078
really did make history - specifically he
made it worse - and if he hadn’t existed,

30
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:09,558
it’s very unlikely that World War II would’ve
ever happened. But he did exist, and after

31
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:14,058
coming to power in 1933, with the standard
revolutionary promises to return the homeland

32
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:18,479
to its former glory, infused with quite a
bit of paranoia and anti-Semitism, Germany

33
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,318
saw rapid re-militarization and eventually,
inevitably, war.

34
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:26,348
In the beginning, it was characterized by
a new style of combat made possible by the

35
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:31,688
mechanized technology of tanks, airplanes,
and especially, trucks. This was the Blitzkrieg,

36
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:37,759
a devastating tactic combining quick movement
of troops, tanks, and massive use of air power

37
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,269
to support infantry movements. And in the
very early years of the war, it was extremely

38
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:46,960
effective. The Nazis were able to roll over
Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands,

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,680
and then all of France, all within about 9 months
between the fall of 1939 and the summer of 1940.

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,558
So after knocking out most of central Europe,
the Nazis set their sights on Great Britain,

41
00:02:56,558 --> 00:03:01,180
but they didn’t invade the island, choosing
instead to attack it with massive air strikes.

42
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,659
I mean, you look at this poster and think,
“Man, the Queen wants me to finish my term

43
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:10,448
paper, so I can do it,” but when this poster
was first produced in 1939, it was to quell

44
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,749
terror in the face of bombardment.

45
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:16,588
The Battle of Britain was a duel between the
Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe, and while

46
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:21,278
the RAF denied the Nazis total control of
British airspace, the Nazis were still able

47
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:25,549
to bomb Great Britain over and over again
in what’s known as the Blitz. STAN, NO.

48
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,359
NO JOKES this time. Yes, the Blitz.

49
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,879
Meanwhile, Europeans were also fighting each
other in North Africa. The Desert campaigns

50
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,548
started in 1940 and lasted through 1942 - this
is where British general “Monty” Montgomery

51
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,049
outfoxed German general Irwin “the Desert
Fox” Rommel. It’s also the place where

52
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,959
Americans first fought Nazis in large numbers.
But most importantly, it’s where Indiana

53
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,930
Jones discovered the Ark of the Covenant.
Okay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

54
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,829
1941 was a big year for World War II. First,
the Nazis invaded Russia, breaking a non-aggression

55
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:57,949
pact that the two powers had signed in 1939.
This hugely escalated the war, and also made

56
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:02,849
allies of the most powerful capitalist countries
and the most powerful communist one, an alliance

57
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:08,238
that would stand the test of time and never end... until
like three seconds after the defeat of the Nazis.

58
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,169
The Nazi invasion of Russia opened the war
up on the so-called Eastern Front, although

59
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,978
if you were Russian, it was the Western Front,
and it led to millions of deaths, mostly Russian.

60
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,589
Also, 1941 saw a day that would "live in infamy"
when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, hoping

61
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,519
that such an audacious attack would frighten
the United States into staying neutral, which

62
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:31,158
was a pretty stupid gamble because:
1. The U.S. was already giving massive aid

63
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:36,228
to the Allies and was hardly neutral and
2. The United States is not exactly famed

64
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:38,639
for its pacifism or political neutrality.

65
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,500
1941 also saw Japan invading much of Southeast
Asia, which made Australia and New Zealand

66
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,399
understandably nervous. As part of the British
commonwealth, they were already involved in

67
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,508
the war, but now they could fight the Japanese
closer to home. And shut up about how I never

68
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:54,020
talk about you Australians. I just gave you
1.5 sentences.

69
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:58,810
But by the time the Americans and Australians
started fighting the Japanese, it was already

70
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,949
a World War. Sometimes this meant fighting
or starving or being bombed; other times,

71
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,490
it meant production for the war - you don’t
think of Argentina as being a World War II

72
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,000
powerhouse, for instance, but they were vital
to the Allies, supplying 40% of British meat

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,120
during World War II. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

74
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,990
So, not to sound jingoistic, but the entry
of the U.S. into the war really did change

75
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,340
everything, although I doubt the Nazis could’ve
taken Russia regardless. No one conquers Russia

76
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,758
in the wintertime, unless you are - wait for
it - the Mongols.

77
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,310
Okay, we’re going to skip most of the big
battles of 1942 - like the Battle of Midway,

78
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,930
which effectively ended Japan’s chance of
winning the war - and focus on the Battle

79
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,079
of Stalingrad. The German attack on Stalingrad,
now known as Volgograd because Stalin sucks,

80
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,930
was one of the bloodiest battles in the history
of war, with more than two million dead. The

81
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,740
Germans began by dropping more than 1,000
tons of bombs on Stalingrad, and then the

82
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,150
Russians responded by “hugging” the Germans,
staying as close to their front lines as possible

83
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,679
so that German air support would kill Germans
and Russians alike.

84
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,288
This kind of worked, although the Germans
still took most of the city. But then, a Soviet

85
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:08,188
counterattack left the sixth army of the Nazis
completely cut off. And after that, due partly

86
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:12,919
to Hitler’s overreaching megalomania and
partly to lots of people being scared of him,

87
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:18,019
the sixth army slowly froze and starved to
death before finally surrendering. And of

88
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:24,549
the 91,000 Axis POWs from Stalingrad, only
about 6,000 ever returned home.

89
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,329
Stalingrad turned the war in Europe and by
1944, the American strategy of “island hopping”

90
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:34,709
in the Pacific was taking GIs closer and closer
to Japan. Rome was liberated in June by Americans

91
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:39,498
and Canadians; and the successful British,
Canadian, and American D-Day invasion of Normandy

92
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:44,509
was the beginning of the end for the Nazis.
Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?

93
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:50,400
An Open Letter to Canada. But first, let’s
see what’s in the secret compartment today.

94
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,120
Oh, it’s Canadian mittens. I wanna thank
the Canadian Crash Course fans, who sent us

95
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,569
these mittens. Canadians are just so nice,
Stan. Like, all we ever do on this show is

96
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,729
make fun of them, and they’re just like, “It’s so
kind of you to mention us. Here’s some mittens!”

97
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:07,339
Dear Canada, We’re not always nice to you here on
Crash Course, but you are awesome. I’m pointing,

98
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:10,818
but you can’t tell because I’m wearing
mittens. 45,000 Canadians died fighting for

99
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:16,300
the Allies in World War II, which means that, per capita,
Canada lost more people than the United States.

100
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,629
You fought with the Royal Air Force to defend
Great Britain from the beginning of the war

101
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,110
and you were there on D-Day, successfully
invading Juno Beach. And, as many of you have

102
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,699
pointed out in comments, you defeated the
United States in the War of 1812, meaning

103
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,610
that, arguably, Canada, you are the greater
military power.

104
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:37,439
Plus, you have lumberjacks, and excellent
beer, and hockey, and universal healthcare,

105
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:43,519
and Justin Bieber. I’m jealous! That's what
it is - I'm jealous!

106
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,240
Best Wishes, John Green.

107
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:49,879
So, by the end of 1944, the Allies were advancing
from the West and the Russian Red Army was

108
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,439
advancing from the East and then, the last-ditch
German offensive at the battle of the Bulge

109
00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:00,979
in the winter of 1944-1945 failed. Mussolini
was executed in April of 1945. Hitler committed

110
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:06,430
suicide at the end of that month. And, on
May 8, 1945 the Allies declared victory in

111
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,370
Europe after Germany surrendered unconditionally.

112
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,129
Three months later, the United States dropped
the only two nuclear weapons ever deployed

113
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,539
in war, Japan surrendered, and World War II
was over.

114
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:22,378
The war had a definite cause: unbridled military
expansion by Germany, Japan, and, to a small

115
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,180
extent, Italy. Now, it’s easy to claim that
Hitler was crazy or evil, and, in fact, he

116
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,490
was certainly both, but that doesn’t explain
the Nazis decision to invade Russia, and it

117
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,990
sure doesn’t explain Japan’s decision
to bomb Pearl Harbor.

118
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,620
And there are many possible explanations beyond
mere evil; but the most interesting one, to

119
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,418
me, involves food. Hitler had a number of
reasons for wanting to expand Germany’s

120
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:46,000
territory, but he often talked about Lebensraum
or living space for the German people. German

121
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,059
agriculture was really inefficiently organized
into lots of small farms, and that meant that

122
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:54,429
Germany needed a lot of land in order to be
self-sufficient in food production.

123
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:58,429
The plan was to take Poland, the Ukraine,
and Eastern Russia, and then resettle that

124
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:02,849
land with lots of Germans, so that it could
feed German people. This was called the Hunger

125
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,379
Plan because the plan called for 20 million
people to starve to death. Many would be the

126
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,220
Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians who’d previously
lived on the land. The rest would be Europe’s

127
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,269
Jews, who would be worked to death.

128
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,879
Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis,
many by starvation, but many through a chillingly

129
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,320
planned effort of extermination in death camps.
These death camps can be distinguished from

130
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,278
concentration camps or labor camps in that
their primary purpose was extermination of

131
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,439
Jews, Roma people, communists, homosexuals,
disabled people, and others that the Nazis

132
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,660
deemed unfit. Some historians believe that
the Nazis opened the death camps because the

133
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:41,069
Jews weren’t dying as fast as The Hunger
Plan had intended.

134
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,760
This was a sickening plan, but it made a kind
of demented sense. Rather than becoming more

135
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,909
involved in global trade, as the British had,
the Germans would feed themselves by taking

136
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:54,088
land and killing the people who’d previously
lived there.

137
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:57,990
Similarly, Japan, at the beginning of the
war, was suffering from an acute fear of food

138
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,129
shortage because its agricultural sector was
having trouble keeping up with population

139
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:06,049
growth. And the Japanese too, sought to expand
their agricultural holdings by, for instance,

140
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,500
resettling farmers in Korea.

141
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,690
So while it’s tempting to say that World
War II was about the Allies fighting for democratic

142
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,509
ideals against the totalitarian militaristic
imperialism of the fascist Axis powers, it

143
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:22,509
just doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. For instance,
a hugely important Allied power, Stalin’s

144
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:27,339
Soviet Union, was, like, the least democratic
place, ever. Stan just said that was hyperbole,

145
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,209
but it’s not. Stalin’s Soviet Union is
tied with all of the other completely undemocratic

146
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:37,289
countries for last place on the democracy
scale. It’s a big community there, at last

147
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:39,069
place, but they’re definitely in there somewhere.

148
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,399
And, by far, the biggest imperialists of the
war were the British. They couldn’t have

149
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,470
fed or clothed themselves - or resisted the
Nazis - without their colonies and commonwealth.

150
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,980
So, why is World War II so important? Well
first, it proved the old Roman adage homo homini

151
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,920
lupus: Man is a wolf to man. This is seen most clearly
in the Holocaust, but all the statistics are staggering.

152
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,439
More than a million Indian British subjects
died, mainly due to famine that could have

153
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:08,819
been avoided if the British had redistributed
food. And their failure to do so helped convince

154
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,589
Indians that the so-called superior civilization
of the British was a sham. More than a million

155
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:19,870
Vietnamese died, mainly due to famine. 418,000
Americans. More than a million noncombatants

156
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,250
in both Germany and Japan. And 20 million
people in the Soviet Union, most of them civilians.

157
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,519
These civilians were targeted because they
helped sustain the war, mostly through industrial

158
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,500
and agricultural production. In a total war,
when a nation is at war, not just its army,

159
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,470
there is no such thing as a non-military target.
From the firebombing of Dresden to Tokyo to

160
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,430
Hiroshima, the line between soldier and civilian
blurred.

161
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:48,169
And then, of course, there is the Holocaust,
which horrifies us because the elements of

162
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:55,028
Western progress - record-keeping, industrial
production, technology - were used to slaughter

163
00:11:55,028 --> 00:12:00,198
millions. World War II saw modern industrial
nations, which represented the best of the

164
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:05,889
Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution,
descend into once unimaginable cruelty.

165
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,759
And what makes World War II such a historical
watershed is that in its wake, all of us - in

166
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:16,399
the West or otherwise - were forced to question
whether Western dominance of this planet could,

167
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,938
or should, be considered progress.

168
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,359
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

169
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,440
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

170
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:29,389
Danko. Our associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

171
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:32,850
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself. And our
graphics team is Thought Bubble.

172
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,810
Last week’s phrase of the week was “an
end to history.” If you want to guess at

173
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:38,919
this week’s phrase of the week or suggest
future ones, you can do so in comments, where

174
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,740
you can also ask questions about today’s
video that will be answered by our team of historians.

175
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,299
If you enjoy Crash Course, make sure you’re
subscribed. Thanks for watching, and as we

176
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,859
say in my hometown, Don’t Forget To Be Awesome.
