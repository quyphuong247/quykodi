00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,200
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History and today we’re going to talk about

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:09,039
a relationship. No, not you, college girlfriend.
No, not that kind of relationship either.

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,338
No. STAN, THIS IS A HISTORY CLASS. We’re
gonna talk about the relationship between

4
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:17,050
a city, Venice, and an empire, the Ottomans,
and in doing so, we're going to return to

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,780
an old theme here on Crash Course World History:
How studying history can make you a better

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,800
boyfriend and/or girlfriend. Probably or,
but I’m not here to judge.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,200
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! No offense, but you don’t really
seem like an expert in how to get girls to like you.

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,380
Here’s something amazing, Me From the Past.
You know that girl, Sarah, in 10th grade,

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,359
who’s super super smart?

10
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,240
Yeah, she’s really hot. She’s like three
or four leagues hotter than I am.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,429
Yeah, I married her. So shut up and listen.

12
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:48,340
[theme music]

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,180
Ten minutes from now, I’m hoping you’ll understand
how one mutually beneficial relationship, between

14
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:57,640
the Venetians and the Ottomans, led to two really
big deals: the European Renaissance and Christopher

15
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,380
Columbus. Not like his birth, I mean he wasn't
like a half-Ottoman, half-Venetian baby, his travels!

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,820
So Venice is a city made up of hundreds of
islands at the northern tip of the Adriatic

17
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:09,589
Sea, but walking around it, you can’t help
but feel that the city is essentially a collection

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,539
of floating buildings tied together by some
canals. If ever there was a place where geography

19
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:18,769
was destiny, it was Venice. Venice was literally
built for ocean-going trade. As you can imagine,

20
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:22,539
Venice didn’t have a lot of natural resources
— except for fish and mustaches — so if

21
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:26,780
they wanted to grow, they had to rely on trade.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,358
First, Venetians became experts in shipbuilding.
Remember that when the crusaders needed ships

23
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:34,169
for their crazy Fourth Crusade, they headed
to Venice, because the Venetians were famous

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,899
for their ships, including merchant ships
like the galley and the cog. Not only could

25
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:41,748
they build ships; they could also sail them
to pleasant locales like Constantinople and

26
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:45,498
the Levant, so the Venetians formed trade
treaties, sometimes called concessions, with

27
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:49,798
the Byzantines, and then when Constantinople
fell to the Ottomans and became Istanbul,

28
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,549
the Venetians were quick to make trade treaties
with their new neighbors, famously saying

29
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,200
that while Istanbul had been Constantinople,
the matter of Constantinople getting the works

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,019
was nobody’s business but the Turks.

31
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,679
But even before the Ottomans, Venice had experience
trading with the Islamic world: It initially

32
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:07,998
established itself as the biggest European
power in the Mediterranean thanks to its trade

33
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:11,799
with Egypt’s sultan in the outlandishly
lucrative pepper business. Can’t blame the

34
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,170
Europeans, really, that stuff is delicious.
Oh, you mean like actual pepper? Ah, that’s

35
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,859
good too, especially since it masks the taste
of spoiled meat, which most meat was in the

36
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,170
days before refrigeration. Due to some awkward…
Crusades… the Egyptian merchants weren't

37
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:28,869
terribly welcome in…ya know...Europe. But
they had all the pepper, because the Egyptians

38
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,420
imported it from India and controlled both
overland and oversea access to the Mediterranean.

39
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,649
And when others cited moral or religious opposition
to trade, the Venetians usually found a way.

40
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,209
Which is why the whole freaking town is made
of marble. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

41
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,269
To avoid the sticky situation of having to
consort with the heathen Egyptians, the Venetians

42
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,500
employed a handy story. This is the Piazza
San Marco, the #1 Destination in the Entire

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,650
World for People Who Like to Be Pooped on
by Pigeons. It’s also home to this church,

44
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,829
which includes some bronze horses you may
remember that were looted from Constantinople.

45
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:04,549
And it contains the body of St. Mark, author
of the Gospel According to St. Mark, who had

46
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,989
once been the bishop of Alexandria, in Egypt.

47
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,239
So naturally he died and was buried in Alexandria,
but the Venetians claimed him as their own,

48
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,780
because apparently one time he visited Venice,
and these two merchants hatched a very clever

49
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,699
plan. They went to Alexandria on business,
stole St. Mark’s body and then hid it in

50
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,239
a shipment of pork, which the Muslims didn’t check very
carefully because, you know, they were disgusted by it.

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,400
You can even see a version of this on the
mosaics in the Basilica of St. Mark, complete

52
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,479
with the Muslims shouting an Arabic version
of “ewww gross.” And then, forever after,

53
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,229
the Venetians were like, “Listen, we HAVE
to trade with these guys. We use it as a secret

54
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,590
way to ferry saint bodies out of Egypt. We
don’t WANT to become fantastically wealthy.

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,450
It’s just a necessary byproduct of our saint-saving.”

56
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:49,780
So what did Venice import? Lots, but notable
for us, they imported a lot of grain, because

57
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,669
if you've ever been to Venice, then you might
have noticed that it is basically made out

58
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:55,848
of marble and therefore kind of difficult
to farm. The Ottomans, on the other hand,

59
00:03:55,848 --> 00:04:00,438
had abundant grain, even before they conquered
Egypt and its oh-so-fertile Nile River in

60
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,530
1517. Also, while trade was certainly the
linchpin of Venice’s economic success, they

61
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,419
had a diverse economy. They also produced
things like textiles and glass. And in fact,

62
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:11,979
Venice is still known for its glass, but they
couldn’t produce it without a special ash

63
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:15,988
that they used to make the colors. And you’ll
never guess where the ash came from. The Ottomans.

64
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,850
Am I making you a better boyfriend yet? You
have to add to your partner’s life. You

65
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,260
have to color their glass. That sounds like
a euphemism. but it’s not-- BACK TO HISTORY.

66
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,250
One last thing about Venice that makes it
special, at least for its time. Venice was

67
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,920
a republic, not a monarchy or, god forbid,
an empire. So its leaders were elected, and

68
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,720
had to answer to the populace- I mean, at
least the property-owning male populace. The

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,200
ruler was the doge and he got to live in a
very nice house and wear a funny hat.

70
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,969
The Sultan of the Ottoman empire also got
to live in a nice house and wear a funny hat,

71
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,390
but there the similarities end. To begin,
the Ottomans were an empire that lasted from

72
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:54,560
around 1300 CE until 1919, making it one of
the longest-lasting and richest empires in

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,079
world history. The Ottomans managed to blend
their pastoral nomadic roots with some very

74
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,419
un-nomadic empire building, and some really
impressive architecture, like this and this

75
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,970
and this, making them very different from,
wait for it, the Mongols.

76
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,750
The empire, or at least the dynasty, was founded
by Osman Bey, and Ottoman is a Latinization

77
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:20,339
of Osmanli, which basically means like the
House of Osman. No, Stan, the house, y-, yes.

78
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,250
Oh my Gosh. The Ottomans were greatest in
the 15th and 16th centuries under two famous

79
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,449
sultans: First, Mehmed the Conqueror ruled
from 1451 to 1481 and expanded Ottoman control

80
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:34,149
to the Balkans, which is why there are Bosnian
Muslims today. But Ottoman expansion reached

81
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:40,500
its greatest extent under Suleiman the Magnificent,
who ruled from 1520 to 1566. He took valuable

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,370
territory in Mesopotamia and Egypt, thus securing
control over the western parts of the Asian

83
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,590
trade – both overland and oversea. He also
defeated the king of Hungary and laid siege

84
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:54,789
to Vienna in 1526. And he turned the Ottomans
into a huge naval power. Also, judging from

85
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,340
his hat, he had the largest brain in human
history.

86
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,269
The Ottomans basically controlled about half
of what the Romans controlled, but it was

87
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:04,659
much more valuable because of all the Indian
Ocean trade you’ll remember from last week.

88
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,730
So all this land brought a lot of wealth,
but it needed to be ruled. The Ottomans could

89
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,640
have followed the Roman model, where you send
out generals and nobles to rule over conquered

90
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,409
territories, or they could’ve demanded the
allegiance of client kings like the Persians,

91
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,670
or developed a civil service system like the
Chinese, but instead, they created an entirely

92
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,250
new ruling class, a system that some historians
call the slave aristocracy.

93
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,509
So if you are a King, one of your main problems
is hereditary nobles, because they always

94
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:30,959
want to replace you, and they don’t want
to give you your money, & they want their

95
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,049
ugly sons to marry your gorgeous daughters,
etc. One way to deal with this problem is

96
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,009
to make them part of the government so they
feel included and shut up. Another way is

97
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:44,789
to kill them. That’s what they usually do in Russia.
I’m whispering so Putin doesn’t hear me. Ahh! Putin!

98
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,600
The Ottomans just bypassed the problem of
hereditary nobles altogether by creating both

99
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,100
an army and a bureaucracy from scratch so
they would be loyal only to the Sultan. How?

100
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,260
The devshirme, a program in which they kidnapped
Christian boys, converted them to Islam, and

101
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,170
raised them either to be members of an elite
military fighting force called the Janissaries,

102
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,810
or to be government bureaucrats. Incidentally,
which of those gigs would you prefer? Because

103
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,949
I think that says a lot about you as a person.
Either way, you weren’t allowed to have

104
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,420
kids, which prevented the whole hereditary
nobles problem, and also ensured that the

105
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:19,569
Ottoman government would contain quite a lot
of Eunuchs. Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?

106
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,279
An Open Letter to Ottoman Eunuchs. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

107
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,589
today. Oh, its a blow up globe. See what quitting
smoking will get you, Me From the Past?

108
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:32,929
Hey there Ottoman Eunuchs, How’s it hanging?
I’m just kidding, that was mean. Listen,

109
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,310
there’ve been eunuchs all around this great
planet of ours. But you’re special. I’m

110
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,250
not going to give you the details why, because
they’re horrifying. I’m just going to

111
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,220
link to an article in the video info.

112
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,170
You started out just being harem guards, Ottoman
Eunuchs, which is kind of an obvious gig for

113
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,830
you, but then, you expanded. As had happened
in China, you made yourselves indispensable,

114
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,779
and you were often the center of palace intrigue.

115
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,889
In fact, few people in the Ottoman Empire
were as wealthy and important as many of you

116
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,389
were. Way to turn lemons into lemonade. I’m
sorry, I shouldn’t have brought up lemons.

117
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,879
Best wishes, John Green

118
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,980
This system eventually broke down as Janissaries
(who had guns) lobbied to be allowed to have

119
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,030
families. But until that happened, the Ottomans
system of using a mix of slave administrators

120
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:13,219
and Eunuchs to run everything worked incredibly
well. But to return to the relationship between

121
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,630
the Ottomans and the Venetians: After the
Ottomans captured Egypt, they pretty much

122
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:21,600
controlled the flow of trade through the Mediterranean,
but the Venetians had centuries of experience

123
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,300
as mariners, and also lots of boats. Speaking
of ships, I ship these guys. So the Ottomans

124
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,259
were content to let the Venetians do all the like,
trading and carrying of goods, and they just made

125
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,759
their money from taxes. And that worked because both
Venice and the Ottomans added value to each other.

126
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,200
Healthy relationships — listen up, Me From
the Past — aren’t about extracting value;

127
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,129
they have to be mutually beneficial to work.
And boy, was that a mutually beneficial relationship.

128
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:50,820
For instance, Venice became super rich, and
being super rich was a prerequisite for the

129
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,170
European Renaissance because all that art
and learning required money, which is why

130
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:59,029
Venice was a leading city at the beginning
of the European Renaissance before being eclipsed

131
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,639
by Florence, Rome, and I don’t know, say
Rotterdam.

132
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,519
Also, this relationship established firm connections
between Europe and Islamic world, which allowed

133
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,439
ideas to flow again especially old Greek  that ideas
had preserved and built upon by Muslims. I mean,

134
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,000
I guess those connections had existed for a long time,
but crusades aren’t a great way to exchange ideas.

135
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,939
But perhaps the most crucial result of the
Venetian and Ottoman control of trade was

136
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,760
that it forced other Europeans to look for
different paths to the riches of the East.

137
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:29,080
And that fueled huge investments in exploration.
The Portuguese sailed south and east around

138
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,900
the southern tip of Africa, and the Spanish
went west, believing that the Indies and China

139
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,889
were much closer than they turned out to be.
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.
