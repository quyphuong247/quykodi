00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,400
Hi there my name’s John Green; this is Crash
Course World History, and today we’re gonna

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,929
talk about Alexander the Great, but to do
that we’re going to begin by talking about

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:12,378
ideals of masculinity and heroism and Kim
Kardashian and the Situation.

4
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:15,288
Mr Green, Mr Green, Mr. Green! Which Situation?

5
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:19,269
Oh, Me from the Past, I forgot you wanted
to go to Columbia. Me from the Present regrets

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,419
to inform you that you do not get in.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,300
But since you live in the past, you have no
way of knowing who I’m talking about, and

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,940
it occurs to me that this video may be watched
in some glorious future when Kim Kardashian

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,289
and the Situation have mercifully disappeared
from public life, and the supermarket tabloids,

10
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,649
instead of talking about celebrities, talk
about Foucault and the Higgs-Boson particle,

11
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:42,989
so Kim Kardashian is a professional famous
person who rose to notoriety by skoodilypooping

12
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:47,890
with someone named Ray Jay, and Mike “The
Situation” I forgot his last name is a professional

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,539
stupid person with big muscles. They’re
both known by millions, lives in luxury, and

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,159
people literally pay to own their odors.

15
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,289
Why do these people crave fame? Why do any
of us? Well, I’d argue it’s not about

16
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,238
money. If it were, our tabloids would be devoted
to the lives and times of bankers. I think

17
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,518
we all want to leave a legacy. We want to
be remembered. We want to be Great.

18
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:17,579
[theme music]

19
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,299
For a long time, history was all about the
Study of Great Men, and it was common to call

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,219
people as “the Great,” but these days
historians are less likely to do that, because

21
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:29,158
they recognize that one man’s Great is generally
another man’s Terrible.

22
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,590
And also “the Great” has some misogynistic
implications, like, it’s almost always men

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,649
who are called "the Great". You never hear
about Cleopatra the Great or Elizabeth the

24
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:39,849
Great. There was, of course, Catherine the
Great of Russia, but for her masculine Greatness

25
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:44,118
she was saddled with the completely untrue
rumor that she died trying to skoodilypoop

26
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,978
with a horse. Saddled? Get it? Anybody? Saddled
with the rumor?

27
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:51,879
Anyway, they could’ve soiled Catherine the
Great’s name just by telling the truth:

28
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,659
which is that like so many other Great men
and women, she died on the toilet. Get it?

29
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,619
soiled? Toilet? Yes? Yes!

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,880
So, quick biography of Alexander of Macedon,
born in 356 BCE, died in 323 BCE at the ripe

31
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:11,299
old age of 32. Alexander was the son of King
Philip the 2nd, and when just 13 years old

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,380
he tamed a horse no one else could ride named
Bucephalus, which impressed his father so

33
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:20,909
much he said: “Oh thy son, look thee at
a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself,

34
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,810
for Macedonia is too little for thee.”

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,340
By that time, he was already an accomplished
general, but over the next decade he expanded

36
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,400
his empire with unprecedented speed and he
is famous for having never lost a battle. Today we’re

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,539
going to look at Alexander of Macedon’s story
by examining three possible definitions of greatness.

38
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,699
First, maybe Alexander was great because of
his accomplishments. This is an extension

39
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:44,699
of the idea that history is the record of
the deeds of great men. Now, of course, that’s

40
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,030
ridiculous. For one thing, half of people
are women; for another, and this is important,

41
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,240
there are lots of historic events that no one can take
responsibility for, like for instance the Black Plague.

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,780
But still, Alexander was accomplished. I mean,
he conquered a lot of territory. Like, a lot.

43
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:03,849
His father, Philip, had conquered all of Greece,
but Alexander did what the Spartans and Athenians

44
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,539
had failed to do: He destroyed the Persian
Empire. He conquered all the land the Persians

45
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:12,620
had held including Egypt, and then marched
toward India, stopping at the Indus River

46
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,819
only because his army was like, “Hey, Alexander,
you know what would be awesome? Not marching.”

47
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,949
Also, Alexander was a really good general,
although historians disagree over whether

48
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:26,318
his tactics were truly brilliant or if his
army just happened to have better technology,

49
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,068
specifically these extra long spears called
sarissas. Much of his reputation as a general,

50
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:37,579
and his reputation in general, anybody? Puns?
Maybe I should stop? OK. Is because of Napoleon.

51
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,819
Napoleon, like many other generals through
the Millennia, was obsessed with Alexander

52
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:43,750
the Great, but more on that in a moment.

53
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,509
That said, Alexander wasn’t very good at
what we might now call empire-building. Alexander’s

54
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,318
empire was definitely visually impressive,
but it wasn’t actually much of an empire.

55
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,000
Like, Alexander specialized in the tearing
down of things, but he wasn’t so great at

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,318
the building up of institutions to replace
the things he’d torn down. And that’s

57
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,568
why, pretty soon after his death, his Empire
broke into three empires, called the Hellenistic

58
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:09,759
Kingdoms. Each was ruled by one of Alexander’s
generals, and they became important dynasties.

59
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,649
The Antigones in Greece and Macedonia, the
Ptolemies in Egypt, the Seleucids in Persia,

60
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,269
all of which lasted longer than Alexander’s
empire itself.

61
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,278
A Second Greatness: Maybe Alexander was Great
because he had an enormous impact on the world

62
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:29,879
after his death. Like King Tut, Alexander
the Great was amazingly good at being a dead

63
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,899
person. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

64
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:37,659
So, After Alexander of Macedon died, everyone
from the Romans to Napoleon to Oliver Stone

65
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:42,180
loved him, and he was an important military
model for many generals throughout history.

66
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,499
But his main post-death legacy may be that
he introduced the Persian idea of Absolute

67
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:51,789
Monarchy to the Greco-Roman world, which would
become a pretty big deal.

68
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:55,028
Alexander also built a number of cities on
his route that became big deals after his

69
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:59,819
death, and it’s easy to spot them because
he named most of them after himself and one

70
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:04,939
after his horse. The Alexandria in Egypt became
a major center of learning in the classical

71
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:10,569
world, and was home to the most amazing library
ever, which Julius Caesar probably “accidentally”

72
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,749
burned down while trying to conquer a bunch
of land to emulate his hero, Alexander the Great.

73
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:19,800
Plus, the dead Alexander had a huge impact
on culture. He gave the region its common

74
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,139
language, Greek, which facilitated conversations
and commerce. Greek was so widespread that

75
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,718
archaeologists have found coins in what is
now Afghanistan with pictures of their kings

76
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:34,180
and the word “king” written beneath the
pictures — in Greek. This is also why, incidentally,

77
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,158
the New Testament was eventually written in
Greek.

78
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:40,718
Although Alexander was mostly just conquering
territory for the glory and heroism and greatness

79
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:46,189
of it all, in his wake emerged a more closely
connected world that could trade and communicate

80
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:51,559
with more people more efficiently than ever
before. Alexander didn’t make those things

81
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,449
happen, but they probably wouldn’t have
happened without him.

82
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,319
But here’s a question: If you’re watching
Jersey Shore and get so involved in The Situations

83
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,789
romantic conquest that you leave the bath
water running, thereby flooding your apartment,

84
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:06,509
and you have to call a plumber, and the plumber
comes over and you fall in love with him and

85
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,689
get married and live happily ever after, does
that make The Situation responsible for your

86
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,120
marriage? Thanks, Thought Bubble.

87
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,579
Okay, a third definition of greatness: Maybe
Alexander is great because of his legend:

88
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:21,038
Since no accounts of his life were written
while he lived, embellishment was easy, and

89
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,788
maybe that’s where true greatness lies.
I mean the guy died at 32, before he ever

90
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:29,519
had a chance to get old and lose battles.
He was tutored by Aristotle, for God’s sakes.

91
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,758
Then there’s Alexander’s single-minded
Ahab-esque pursuit of the Persian King Darius,

92
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,059
who he chased across modern-day Iraq and Iran
for no real reason except he desperately wanted

93
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:44,759
to kill him, and when Bessus, one of Darius’s
generals, assassinated him before Alexander

94
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,620
had the chance, Alexander chased Bessus around
until he could at least kill him.

95
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,119
These almost-comical pursuits of glory and
heroism are accompanied in classical histories

96
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:59,099
by stories of Alexander walking through the
desert, and then suddenly raining, and these

97
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:03,889
ravens coming to lead him to the army he’s
supposed to fight, and stories of his hot

98
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,309
Persian wife Roxana, who supposedly while
still a teenager engineered the assassinations

99
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:10,419
of many of Alexander’s fellow wives.

100
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:14,448
And even at his death, people tried to make
Alexander live up to this heroic ideal. Like,

101
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:19,550
Plutarch tells us that he died of a fever,
but that’s no way for a masculine, empire-building,

102
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,598
awesome person to die! So rumors persist that
he died either of alcohol poisoning or else

103
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:29,949
of assassination-y poisoning. I mean, no great
man can die of a fever. Speaking of Great

104
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,490
Men, it’s time to strip down for the Open
Letter.

105
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,769
So elegant. But first let’s see what’s
in the Secret Compartment today. Oh. It’s

106
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:47,228
Kim Kardashian’s perfume. Thanks Stan. I’ll
wear this. I’ll check it out, I’ll give

107
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:53,378
it a try. C’ah. Wow. That is... mmm... it’s
like all the worst parts of baby powder and

108
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,889
all the worst parts of cat pee. An Open Letter
to the Ladies.

109
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,379
Hello, Ladies,

110
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,819
You’ve really been unfairly neglected in
Crash Course World History and also in World

111
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:06,009
History textbooks everywhere. Like, there
will be a whole chapter exploring the exploits

112
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:10,408
of great men and then at the end there will
be one sentence that’s like “also women

113
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:14,978
were doing stuff at the time and it was important,
but we don’t really know what it was, so

114
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,918
back to Alexander the Great…”

115
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,598
History has been very good at marginalizing
and demeaning women and we’re going to fight

116
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,468
against that as we move forward in the story
of human civilization. Ladies, I have to go

117
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:30,118
now because my eyes are stinging from the
biological weapon known as Kim Kardashian’s

118
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,639
Gold. Seriously, don’t wear it.

119
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,299
Best wishes, John Green

120
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:37,889
So in Alexander the Great we have a story
about a man who united the world while riding

121
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:42,379
a magical horse only he could tame across
deserts where it magically rained for him

122
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:46,340
so that he could chase down his mortal enemy
and then leave in his wake a more enlightened

123
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,810
world and a gorgeous, murderous wife.

124
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,659
But of course it’s not just Assassin’s
Creed and Call of Duty that celebrate the

125
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,629
idea that ennobled violence can lead to a
better world. And that takes us to my opinion

126
00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:00,870
of how Alexander really came to be Great.
Millennia after his death in 1798, Napoleon

127
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,769
invaded Egypt, not because he particularly
needed to invade Egypt but because he wanted

128
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,629
to do what Alexander had done.

129
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:11,700
And long before Napoleon, the Romans really
worshipped Alexander, particularly the Roman

130
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,590
General Pompey, AKA Pompeius Magnus, AKA Pompey
the Great. Pompey was so obsessed with Alexander

131
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:23,350
that he literally tried to emulate Alexander’s
boyishly disheveled hair style.

132
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,990
In short, Alexander was Great because others
decided he was Great. Because they chose to

133
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,570
admire and emulate him. Yes, Alexander was
a great general. Yes, he conquered a lot of

134
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,350
land. The Situation is also really good at
picking up girls... of a certain type. And

135
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,100
Kim Kardashian is good at- Stan, what is Kim
Kardashian good at?

136
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,620
We made Alexander Great, just as today we
make people great when we admire them and

137
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,370
try to emulate them. History has traditionally
been in the business of finding and celebrating

138
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,960
great men, and only occasionally great women,
but this obsession with Greatness is troubling

139
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,310
to me. It wrongly implies, first, history
is made primarily by men and secondly, that

140
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:03,229
history is made primarily by celebrated people,
which of course makes us all want to be celebrities.

141
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,409
Thankfully, we’ve left behind the idea that
the best way to become an icon is to butcher

142
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:12,539
people and conquer a lot of land, but the
ideals that we’ve embraced instead aren’t

143
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:16,959
necessarily worth celebrating either. All
of which is to say we decide what to worship

144
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:23,450
and what to care about and what to pay attention
to. We decide whether to care about The Situation.

145
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,700
Alexander couldn’t make history in a vacuum,
and neither can anyone else. Thanks for watching.

146
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,600
I’ll see you next week.

147
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,940
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller; the show is written by my high school
