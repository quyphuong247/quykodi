00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,540
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re gonna talk

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,708
about the Cold War, which actually lasted
into my lifetime, which means that I can bore

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:12,009
you with stories from my past like your grandpa
does. When I was a kid, they made us practice

4
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,849
hiding under our desks in the event of a nuclear
attack, because, you know, school desks are

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,420
super good at repelling radiation.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,000
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Right, remember in elementary
school there was this special guest who’d

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,839
defected from the Soviet Union, and he had--

8
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,949
Like this crazy Russian accent and he kept
going on and on about how Reagan should spit

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,469
in Gorbachev’s face instead of signing treaties
with him.

10
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,960
And I was like, whoa dude calm down. You’re
in a room full of third graders.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,630
And then for like months afterward on the
playground, we’d play Reagan-Gorbachev and

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,170
spit in each other’s faces. Those were the days.
Sometimes I forget that you’re me, Me from the Past.

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,850
Yeah, it’s just really nice to talk to you
and feel like you’re lis --

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,250
You’re boring. Cue the intro.

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:51,929
[theme music]

16
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,359
So the Cold War was a rivalry between the
USSR and the USA that played out globally.

17
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,689
We’ve tried to shy away from calling conflicts
ideological or civilizational here on Crash

18
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,349
Course, but in this case, the “clash of
civilizations” model really does apply.

19
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,559
Socialism, at least as Marx constructed it,
wanted to take over the world, and many Soviets

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,329
saw themselves in a conflict with bourgeois
capitalism itself. And the Soviets saw American

21
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:18,450
rebuilding efforts in Europe and Japan as
the U.S. trying to expand its markets, which,

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,219
by the way, is exactly what we were doing.

23
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,420
So the U.S. feared that the USSR wanted to
destroy democratic and capitalist institutions.

24
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,010
And the Soviets feared that the US wanted
to use its money and power to dominate Europe

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,330
and eventually destroy the Soviet system.
And both parties were right to be worried.

26
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,390
It’s not paranoia if they really are out
to get you.

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,879
Now of course we’ve seen a lot of geopolitical
struggles between major world powers here

28
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,109
on Crash Course, but this time there was the
special added bonus that war could lead to

29
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:48,709
the destruction of the human species. That
was new for world history, and it’s worth

30
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,780
remembering: It’s still new. Here’s the
period of time we’ve discussed on Crash

31
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,180
Course. And this is how long we’ve had the
technological capability to exterminate ourselves.

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,520
So that’s worrisome.

33
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,599
Immediately after World War II, the Soviets
created a sphere of influence in eastern Europe,

34
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,640
dominating the countries where the Red Army
had pushed back the Nazis, which is why Winston

35
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,789
Churchill famously said in 1946 that an “Iron
Curtain” had descended across Europe.

36
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:16,989
While the dates of the Cold War are usually
given between 1945 and 1990, a number of historians

37
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,400
will tell you that it actually started during
World War II. Stalin’s distrust of the U.S.

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,480
and Britain kept growing as they refused to
invade Europe and open up a second front against

39
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,539
the Nazis. And some even say that the decision
to drop the first Atomic Bombs on Japan was

40
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:34,289
motivated in part by a desire to intimidate
the Soviets. That sort of worked, but only

41
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:38,608
insofar as it motivated the Soviets to develop
atomic bombs of their own — they successfully

42
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:40,868
tested their first one in 1949.

43
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:44,699
From the beginning, the U.S had the advantage
because it had more money and power and could

44
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,828
provide Europe protection (what with its army
and one of a kind nuclear arsenal) while Europe

45
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:53,829
rebuilt. The USSR had to rebuild itself, and
also they had the significant disadvantage

46
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:58,359
of being controlled by noted asshat Joseph
Stalin. I will remind you, it’s not cursing

47
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:01,379
if he’s wearing an ass for a hat. Oh, I
guess it’s time for the open letter.

48
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,199
An Open Letter to Joseph Stalin.

49
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,639
But first, let’s see what’s in the secret
compartment today.

50
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:15,040
Oh, it’s silly putty. Silly putty: the thing
that won the Cold War. This is exactly the

51
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,509
kind of useless consumer good that would never
have been produced in the Soviet Union. And

52
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:25,378
it is because we had so much more consumer
spending, on stuff like silly putty, that

53
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:28,568
we won the Cold War. Go team!

54
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:32,869
Dear Joseph Stalin, You really sucked. There
was a great moment in your life, at your first

55
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,139
wife’s funeral, when you said, “I don’t
think I shall ever love again.” And then

56
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:40,129
later, you had that wife’s whole family
killed. Putting aside the fact that you’re

57
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:42,878
responsible for tens of millions of deaths,
I don’t like you because of the way that

58
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,438
you treated your son, Yakov. I mean, you were
really mean to him and then he shot himself

59
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:50,418
and he didn’t die and you said, “He can’t
even shoot straight.” And then later, when

60
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,239
he was captured during World War II, you had
a chance to exchange prisoners for him, but

61
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,058
you declined. And then he died in a prison
camp. You were a terrible leader, a terrible

62
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,360
person, and a terrible father.

63
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,840
Best wishes,
John Green

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,979
All right, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.
Europe was the first battleground of the Cold

65
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,498
War, especially Germany, which was divided
into 2 parts with the former capital, Berlin,

66
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:13,978
also divided into 2 parts. And yes, I know
the western part was divided into smaller

67
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,750
occupation zones, but I’m simplifying. In
1948, the Soviets tried to cut off West Berlin,

68
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,990
by closing the main road that led into the
city, but the Berlin airlift stopped them.

69
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,910
And then in 1961, the Soviets tried again
and this time they were much more successful

70
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,439
building a wall around West Berlin, although
it’s worth noting that the thing was up

71
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:35,660
for less than 30 years. I mean, Meatloaf’s
career has lasted longer than the Berlin Wall did.

72
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,100
The U.S. response to the Soviets was a policy
called containment; it basically involved

73
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,350
stopping the spread of communism by standing
up to the Soviets wherever they seemed to

74
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,320
want to expand. In Europe this meant spending
a lot of money. First the Marshall Plan spent

75
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,560
$13 billion on re-building western Europe with
grants and credits that Europeans would spend

76
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,839
on American consumer goods and on construction.
Capitalism’s cheap food and plentiful stuff,

77
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,350
it was hoped, would stop the spread of communism.

78
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,910
The US also tried to slow the spread of communism
by founding NATO and with CIA interventions

79
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,370
in elections where communists had a chance,
as in Italy. But despite all the great spy

80
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,269
novels and shaken not stirred martinis, the
Cold War never did heat up in Europe.

81
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,399
Probably the most important part of the Cold
War that people just don’t remember these

82
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,910
days is the nuclear arms race. Both sides
developed nuclear arsenals, the Soviets initially

83
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,870
with the help of spies who stole American
secrets. Eventually the nuclear arsenals were

84
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,079
so big that the U.S. and USSR agreed on a
strategy appropriately called MAD, which stood

85
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,959
for “mutually assured destruction.” Thanks
Thought Bubble.

86
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,899
And yes, nuclear weapons were, and are, capable
of destroying humanity many times over. But

87
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,589
only once or twice did we get close to nuclear
war: during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis

88
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:51,409
and then again in 1983, when we forgot to
give the Russians the heads up that we were

89
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,040
doing some war games, which made it look like
we had launched a first strike. OUR BAD!

90
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,650
But even though mutually assured destruction
prevented direct conflict, there was plenty

91
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:04,120
of hot war in the Cold War. The Korean War
saw lots of fighting between communists and

92
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,780
capitalists, as did the Vietnam War. I mean,
these days we remember “the domino effect”

93
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,889
as silly paranoia, but after Korea and especially
China became communist, Vietnam’s movement

94
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:17,240
toward communism seemed very much a threat
to Japan, which the U.S. had helped re-make

95
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,470
into a vibrant capitalist ally. So the US
got bogged down in one of its longest wars

96
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,510
while the Soviets assisted the North Vietnamese
army in the Viet Cong.

97
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,149
But then we paid them back by supporting the
anti-communist mujaheddin after the Soviets

98
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:33,009
invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Of course, as
we now know, nobody conquers Afghanistan

99
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,319
…unless you are the mongols.
[Mongoltage]

100
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,920
So after 10 disastrous years, the Soviets
finally abandoned Afghanistan.

101
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,709
Some of those mujahideen later became members
of the Taliban, though, so it’s difficult

102
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:46,149
to say that anyone won that war.

103
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:50,379
But it wasn’t just Asia: In Nicaragua, the
US supported rebels to overthrow the leftist

104
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,360
government; in El Salvador, the US bolstered
authoritarian regimes that were threatened

105
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,740
by left-wing guerrillas. The United States
ended up supporting a lot of awful governments,

106
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,560
like the one in Guatemala, which held onto
power through the use of death squads. Frankly,

107
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,079
all our attempts to stabilize governments
in Latin America led to some very unstable

108
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,029
Latin American governments, and quite a lot
of violence.

109
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,779
And then there were the luke-warm conflicts,
like The Suez Crisis where British and French

110
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:18,239
paratroopers were sent in to try to stop Egypt
from nationalizing the Suez canal. Or all

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,620
the American covert operations to keep various
countries from “falling” to communism.

112
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,420
These included the famous CIA-engineered coup
to overthrow Iran’s democratically elected

113
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,100
prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh after his
government attempted to nationalize Iran’s

114
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,240
oil industry. And the CIA helping Chile’s
General Augusto Pinochet overthrow democratically

115
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,500
elected Marxist president Salvador Allende
in 1973.

116
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,180
And lest we think the Americans were the only
bad guys in this, the Soviets used force to

117
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,600
crush popular uprisings in Hungary in 1956
and in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

118
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,270
So, you may have noticed that our discussion
of the Cold War has branched out from Europe

119
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,139
to include Asia, and the Middle East, and
Latin America. And in fact, almost every part

120
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,960
of the globe was involved in some way with
the planet being divided into three “worlds.”

121
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,549
The first world was the U.S., Western Europe
and any place that embraced capitalism and

122
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,329
a more or less democratic form of government.
The Second World was the Soviet Union and

123
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:09,990
its satellites, mostly the Warsaw Pact nations,
China and Cuba. The Third World was everyone

124
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,300
else and we don’t use this term anymore because it
lumps together a hugely diverse range of countries.

125
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,319
We’ll talk more about the specific economic
and development challenges faced by the so-called

126
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:21,459
“Third World countries,” but the big one
in terms of the Cold War, was that neither

127
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,509
the U.S. nor the Soviets wanted any of these
countries to remain neutral. Every nation

128
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,259
was supposed to pick sides, either capitalist
or communist, and while it seems like an easy

129
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,328
choice now, in the 50s and 60s, it wasn’t
nearly so clear. I mean, for a little while,

130
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:36,578
it seemed like the Soviets might come out
ahead, at least in the Third World. For a

131
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:40,088
while, capitalism, and especially the United
States, seemed to lose some of its luster.

132
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,319
The US propped up dictatorships, had a poor
civil rights record, we sucked at women’s

133
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:49,219
gymnastics. Plus, the Soviets were the first
to put a satellite, a man, and a dog into

134
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,329
space. Plus, Marxists just seemed cooler,
which is why you never see Milton Friedman

135
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:57,649
t-shirts… until now available at DFTBA.com.
I like that, Stan, but I’m more of a centrist.

136
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:02,009
Can I get a Keynes shirt? Yes. That, now that’s
hot.

137
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:07,048
But Soviet socialism did not finally prove
to be a viable alternative to industrial capitalism.

138
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:11,000
Over time, state-run economies just generally
don’t fare as well as private enterprise,

139
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,669
and people like living in a world where they
can have more stuff. More importantly, Soviet

140
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:20,599
policies were just bad: collectivized agriculture
stymied production and led to famine; suppression of

141
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,000
dissent and traditional cultures made people angry; and
no one likes suffering the humiliation of driving a Yugo.

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,559
But why the Cold War ended when it did is
one of the most interesting questions of the

143
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:33,628
20th century. It probably wasn’t Ronald
Reagan bankrupting the Soviets, despite what

144
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:37,930
some politicians believe. The USSR had more
satellite states that it needed to spend more

145
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:41,758
to prop up than the U.S. had to invest in
its Allies. And the Soviet system could never

146
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,720
keep up with economic growth in the West.
But, probably the individual most responsible

147
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,009
for the end of the Cold War was Mikhail Baryshnikov.
No? Mikhail Gorbachev? Well, that’s boring.

148
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:57,360
I always thought the Soviets danced their
way to freedom. No? It was Glasnost and Perestroika?

149
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,200
Alright.

150
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,400
But Gorbachev’s Perestroika and Glasnost
opened up the Soviet political and economic

151
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:07,458
systems with contested local elections, less
restricted civil society groups, less censorship,

152
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:12,118
more autonomy for the Soviet Republics, more
non-state-run businesses and more autonomy

153
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:16,319
for state-run farms. Glasnost or “openness”
led to more information from the west and less

154
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,760
censorship led to a flood of criticism as people realized
how much poorer the second world was than the first.

155
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,379
And one by one, often quite suddenly, former
communist states collapsed. In Germany, the

156
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:32,919
Berlin Wall came down in 1989 and East and
West Germany were reunited in 1990. In Poland,

157
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:37,179
the Gdansk dockworker’s union Solidarity
turned into a mass political movement and

158
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:42,068
won 99 of the 100 seats it was allowed to
contest in the 1989 election. Hungary held

159
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:47,208
multiparty elections in 1990. The same year,
mass demonstrations led to elections in Czechoslovakia.

160
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:52,179
In 1993, that country split up into Slovakia
and the Czech Republic, the happiest and most

161
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:55,019
mutually beneficial divorce since Cher left
Sonny.

162
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,149
Of course sometimes the transition away from
communism was violent and painful. In Romania,

163
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:03,068
for instance, the communist dictator Ceaușescu
held onto power until he was tried and put

164
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:08,110
before a firing squad at the end of 1989.
And it took until 1996 for a non-communist

165
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,610
government to take power there. And in Yugoslavia,
well, not so great. And in Russia, it’s

166
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,580
a little bit Putin-ey. Ah! Putin.

167
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,379
But just twenty years later, it’s hard to
believe that the world was once dominated

168
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,949
by two super powers held in check mutually
assured destruction. What’s really amazing

169
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:29,179
to me, though, is that until the late 1980s,
it felt like the Cold War was gonna go on

170
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:33,888
forever. Time seems to slow as it approaches
us, & living in the post-Cold War nuclear

171
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,470
age, we should remember that the past feels
distant even when it’s near, and that the

172
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,710
future seems assured — even though it isn’t.
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

Danko. Our associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

175
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,969
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself. And our graphics
team is Thought Bubble. Last week’s phrase

176
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,670
of the week was "Justin Bieber" Thanks for
that suggestion. If you’d like to suggest

177
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:01,799
future phrases of the week, you can do so
in comments where you can also ask questions

178
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,959
about today’s video that will be answered
by our team of historians. Thanks for watching

179
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,200
Crash Course and as we say in my hometown,
Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
