00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
Hello, learned and astonishingly attractive
pupils. My name is John Green and I want to

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,129
welcome you to Crash Course World History.
Over the next forty weeks together, we will

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,790
learn how in a mere fifteen thousand years
humans went from hunting and gathering...

4
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:15,268
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Is this gonna be on
the test?

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,179
Yeah, about the test: The test will measure
whether you are an informed, engaged, and

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:24,100
productive citizen of the world, and it will
take place in schools and bars and hospitals

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,910
and dorm-rooms and in places of worship. You
will be tested on first dates; in job interviews;

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,589
while watching football; and while scrolling
through your Twitter feed.

9
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,238
The test will judge your ability to think
about things other than celebrity marriages;

10
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:39,038
whether you'll be easily persuaded by empty
political rhetoric; and whether you'll be

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,499
able to place your life and your community
in a broader context.

12
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:46,859
The test will last your entire life, and it
will be comprised of the millions of decisions

13
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,999
that, when taken together, make your life
yours. And everything — everything — will

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,320
be on it. I know, right? So pay attention.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:04,120
[theme music]

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,020
In a mere fifteen thousand years, humans went
from hunting and gathering to creating such

17
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:12,769
improbabilities as the airplane, the Internet,
and the ninety-nine cent double cheeseburger.

18
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:16,549
It's an extraordinary journey, one that I
will now symbolize by embarking upon a journey

19
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,289
of my own ... over to camera two.

20
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,460
Hi there, camera two ... it's me, John Green.
Let's start with that double cheeseburger.

21
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:25,539
Ooh, food photography! So this hot hunk of
meat contains four-hundred and ninety calories.

22
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,330
To get this cheeseburger, you have to feed,
raise, and slaughter cows, then grind their

23
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:33,420
meat, then freeze it and ship it to its destination;
you also gotta grow some wheat and then process

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,909
the living crap out of it until it's whiter
than Queen Elizabeth the First; then you gotta

25
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,500
milk some cows and turn their milk into cheese.
And that's not even to mention the growing

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,640
and pickling of cucumbers or the sweetening
of tomatoes or the grinding of mustard seeds, etc.

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,420
How in the sweet name of everything holy did
we ever come to live in a world in which such

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,950
a thing can even be created? And HOW is it
possible that those four-hundred and ninety

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,120
calories can be served to me for an amount
of money that, if I make the minimum wage

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,320
here in the U.S., I can earn in ELEVEN MINUTES?
And most importantly: should I be delighted

31
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,019
or alarmed to live in this strange world of
relative abundance?

32
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,210
Well, to answer that question we're not going
to be able to look strictly at history, because

33
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,890
there isn't a written record about a lot of
these things. But thanks to archaeology and

34
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:19,109
paleobiology, we CAN look deep into the past.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

35
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,630
So fifteen thousand years ago, humans were
foragers and hunters. Foraging meant gathering

36
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:28,530
fruits, nuts, also wild grains and grasses;
hunting allowed for a more protein-rich diet

37
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,520
... so long as you could find something with
meat to kill. By far the best hunting gig

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,530
in the pre-historic world incidentally was
fishing, which is one of the reasons that

39
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,969
if you look at history of people populating
the planet, we tended to run for the shore

40
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:41,340
and then stay there. Marine life was:
A) abundant, and

41
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,450
B) relatively unlikely to eat you.

42
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:47,060
While we tend to think that the life of foragers
were nasty, brutish and short, fossil evidence

43
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,719
suggests that they actually had it pretty
good: their bones and teeth are healthier

44
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,818
than those of agriculturalists. And anthropologists
who have studied the remaining forager peoples

45
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:59,780
have noted that they actually spend a lot
fewer hours working than the rest of us and

46
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,000
they spend more time on art, music, and storytelling.
Also if you believe the classic of anthropology, NISA,

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,818
they also have a lot more time for skoodilypooping.
What? I call it skoodilypooping. I'm not gonna apologize.

48
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:13,429
It's worth noting that cultivation of crops
seems to have risen independently over the

49
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,790
course of milennia in a number of places ... from
Africa to China to the Americas ... using

50
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:24,209
crops that naturally grew nearby: rice in
Southeast Asia, maize in in Mexico, potatoes

51
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,719
in the Andes, wheat in the Fertile Crescent,
yams in West Africa. People around the world

52
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:33,068
began to abandon their foraging for agriculture.
And since so many communities made this choice

53
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:37,979
independently, it must have been a good choice
... right? Even though it meant less music

54
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,500
and skoodilypooping. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

55
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,180
All right, to answer that question, let's take a look
at the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture.

56
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,300
Advantage: Controllable food supply. You might
have droughts or floods, but if you're growing

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,360
the crops and breeding them to be hardier,
you have a better chance of not starving.

58
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,569
Disadvantage: In order to keep feeding people
as the population grows you have to radically

59
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:58,439
change the environment of the planet.

60
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,848
Advantage: Especially if you grow grain, you
can create a food surplus, which makes cities

61
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:07,909
possible and also the specialization of labor.
Like, in the days before agriculture, EVERYBODY'S

62
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:13,560
job was foraging, and it took about a thousand
calories of work to create a thousand calories

63
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,089
of food ... and it was impossible to create
large population centers.

64
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,659
But, if you have a surplus agriculture can
support people not directly involved in the

65
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,820
production of food. Like, for instance, tradespeople,
who can devote their lives to better farming

66
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:30,120
equipment which in turn makes it easier to
produce more food more efficiently which in

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,300
time makes it possible for a corporation to turn a
profit on this ninety-nine cent double cheeseburger.

68
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,639
Which is delicious, by the way. It's actually
terrible. And it's very cold. And I wish I

69
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,860
had not eaten it. I mean, can we just compare
what I was promised to what I was delivered?

70
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,420
Yeah, thank you. Yeah, this is not that.

71
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,240
Some would say that large and complex agricultural
communities that can support cities and eventually

72
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,209
inexpensive meat sandwiches are not necessarily
beneficial to the planet or even to its human

73
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,949
inhabitants. Although that's a bit of a tough
argument to make, coming to you as I am in

74
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,479
a series of ones and zeros.

75
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,200
ADVANTAGE: Agriculture can be practiced all
over the world, although in some cases it

76
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,569
takes extensive manipulation of the environment,
like y'know irrigation, controlled flooding,

77
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,099
terracing, that kind of thing.

78
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,840
DISADVANTAGE: Farming is hard. So hard in
fact that one is tempted to claim ownership

79
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,750
over other humans and then have them till
the land on your behalf, which is the kind

80
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,668
of non-ideal social order that tends to be
associated with agricultural communities.

81
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:29,870
So why did agriculture happen?

82
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,660
Wait, I haven't talked about herders. Herders,
man! Always getting the short end of the stick.

83
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,880
Herding is a really good and interesting alternative
to foraging and agriculture. You domesticate

84
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,819
some animals and then you take them on the
road with you. The advantages of herding are

85
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,189
obvious. First, you get to be a cowboy. Also,
animals provide meat and milk, but they also

86
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,300
help out with shelter because they can provide
wool and leather.

87
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,860
The downside is that you have to move around
a lot because your herd always needs new grass,

88
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,240
which makes it hard to build cities, unless
you are the Mongols. [music, horse hooves]

89
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,569
By the way, over the next forty weeks you
will frequently hear generalizations, followed

90
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,990
by "unless you are the Mongols" [music, hooves].

91
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,019
But anyway one of the main reasons herding
only caught on in certain parts of the world

92
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,728
is that there aren't that many animals that
lend themselves to domestication. Like, you

93
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:19,769
have sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, horses, camels,
donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, all

94
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:24,319
of which have something in common. They aren't
native to the Americas. The only halfway useful

95
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,180
herding animal native to the Americas is the
llama. No, not that Lama, two l's. Yes, that llama.

96
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,379
Most animals just don't work for domestication.
Like hippos are large, which means they provide

97
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,508
lots of meat, but unfortunately, they like
to eat people. Zebras are too ornery. Grizzlies

98
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,460
have wild hearts that can't be broken. Elephants
are awesome, but they take way too long to

99
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,529
breed. Which reminds me! It's time for the
Open Letter.

100
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:57,459
Elegant. But first, let's see what the Secret
Compartment has for me today. Oh! It's another

101
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:02,199
double cheeseburger. Thanks, Secret Compartment.
Just kidding, I don't thank you for this.

102
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,979
An Open Letter to elephants.

103
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,479
Hey elephants, You're so cute and smart and awesome.
Why you gotta be pregnant for 22 months? That's

104
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:14,149
crazy! And then you only have one kid. If
you were more like cows, you might have taken

105
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:21,089
us over by now. Little did you know, but the greatest
evolutionary advantage: being useful to humans.

106
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:27,179
Like here is a graph of cow population, and
here is a graph of elephant population. Elephants,

107
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,639
if you had just inserted yourself into human
life the way cows did, you could have used

108
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,478
your power and intelligence to form secret
elephant societies, conspiring against the

109
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,060
humans! And then you could have risen up,
and destroyed us, and made an awesome elephant

110
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,579
world with elephant cars, and elephant planes!

111
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:47,439
It would have been so great! But noooo! You
gotta be pregnant for 22 months and then have

112
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,439
just one kid. It's so annoying!

113
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,000
Best wishes, John Green.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,699
Right, but back to the agricultural revolution
and why it occurred. Historians don't know

115
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,629
for sure, of course, because there are no
written records. But, they love to make guesses.

116
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:03,909
Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture
even though it was more work, or abundance

117
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:09,270
gave people leisure to experiment with domestication
or planting originated as a fertility rite

118
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:14,979
- or as some historians have argued - people needed
to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol.

119
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,829
Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists,
believed agriculture was an accident, saying,

120
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:24,288
"a wild and unusually good variety of native
plant might attract the attention of some

121
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:28,189
wise old savage." Off topic, but you will
note in the coming weeks that the definition

122
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:31,069
of "savage" tends to be be "not me."

123
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:34,500
Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't
really an agricultural revolution at all,

124
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,870
but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary
desire to eat more. Like early hunter gatherers

125
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,120
knew that seeds germinate when planted. And,
when you find something that makes food, you

126
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,899
want to do more of it. Unless it's this food.
Then you want to do less of it. I kinda want

127
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:55,129
to spit it out. Eww. Ah, that's much better.

128
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,889
So early farmers would find the most accessible
forms of wheat and plant them and experiment

129
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:02,269
with them not because they were trying to
start an agricultural revolution, because

130
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,879
they were like, you know what would be awesome:
MORE food!

131
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,870
Like on this topic, we have evidence that
more than 13,000 years ago humans in southern

132
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,830
Greece were domesticating snails. In the Franchthi
Cave, there's a huge pile of snail shells,

133
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,800
most of them are larger than current snails,
suggesting that the people who ate them were

134
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,949
selectively breeding them to be bigger and
more nutritious.

135
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,660
Snails make excellent domesticated food sources,
by the way because

136
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:26,159
A) surprisingly caloric
B) they're easy to carry since they come with

137
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,679
their own suitcases, and
C) to imprison them you just have to scratch

138
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,779
a ditch around their living quarters.

139
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,120
That's not really a revolution, that's just
people trying to increase available calories.

140
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,899
But one non-revolution leads to another, and
pretty soon you have this, as far as the eye can see.

141
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,779
Many historians also argue that without agriculture
we wouldn't have all the bad things that come

142
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:49,120
with complex civilizations like patriarchy,
inequality, war, and unfortunately, famine.

143
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,470
And, as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture
has been a big loser. Without it, humans never

144
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,339
would have changed the environment so much,
building dams, and clearing forests, and more

145
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:01,230
recently, drilling for oil that we can turn
into fertilizer.

146
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,170
Many people made the choice for agriculture
independently, but does that mean it was the

147
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:10,129
right choice? Maybe so, and maybe not, but,
regardless, we can't unmake that choice. And

148
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,740
that's one of the reasons I think it's so
important to study history.

149
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,570
History reminds us that revolutions are not
events so much as they are processes; that

150
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,300
for tens of thousands of years people have
been making decisions that irrevocably shaped

151
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:26,059
the world that we live in today. Just as today
we are making subtle, irrevocable decisions

152
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,319
that people of the future will remember as
revolutions.

153
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,490
Next week we're going to journey to the Indus
River Valley - whoa - very fragile, our globe,

154
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,370
like the real globe. We're going to travel
to the Indus River Valley. I'll see you then.

155
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,750
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

156
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,909
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself, and our

157
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:49,750
graphics team is Thought Bubble.

158
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,500
If you want to guess at the phrase of the
week, you can do so in comments. You can also

159
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,958
suggest future phrases of the week. And if
you have a question about today's video, please

160
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:00,498
leave it comments where our team of semi-professional
quasi-historians will aim to answer it.

161
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,980
Thanks for watching, and as we say in my hometown,
Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
