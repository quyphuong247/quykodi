00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,660
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re going to

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,830
do some legitimate comp. civ., for those of
you into that kind of thing. Stan, I can’t

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,849
help but feel that we have perhaps too many
globes. That’s better.

4
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:16,339
Today we’re going to learn about the horrible
totalitarian Persians and the saintly, democracy-loving

5
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:19,059
Greeks. But of course we already know this
story — there were some wars in which no

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:23,549
one wore any shirts, and everyone was reasonably
fit. The Persians were bad; the Greeks were

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,230
good. Socrates and Plato were awesome; the
Persians didn’t even philosophize. The West

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,310
is the Best; Go Team! Yeah, well, no.

9
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:39,640
[theme music]

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,740
Let’s start with the Persian empire, which
became the model for pretty much all land-based

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:50,530
empires throughout the world. Except for — wait
for it — the Mongols. [Mongoltage]

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,219
Much of what we know about the Persians and
their empire comes from an outsider writing

13
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:58,210
about them, which is something we now call
history, and one of the first true historians

14
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,600
was Herodotus, whose famous book The Persian
Wars talks about the Persians quite a bit.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,650
Now the fact that Herodotus was a Greek is
important because it introduces us to the

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,900
idea of historical bias. But more on that
in a second.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,820
So the Persian Achaemenid dynasty... Achaemenid?
Hold on...

18
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,879
HowJSay: AkEEmenid or AkEHmenid

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,160
They’re both right? I was right twice!?

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,459
Right, so the Persian AkEEmenid or AkEHmenid
dynasty was founded in 539 BCE by King Cyrus

21
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:26,539
the Great. Cyrus took his nomadic warriors
and conquered most of Mesopotamia, including

22
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,370
the Babylonians, which ended a sad period
in Jewish history called The Babylonian Exile,

23
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,250
thus ensuring that Cyrus got great press in
the Bible.

24
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,290
But his son, Darius the First, was even greater,
he extended Persian control east to our old

25
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:44,020
friend the Indus Valley, west to our new friend
Egypt, and north to Crash Course newcomer

26
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:48,479
Anatolia. By the way, there were Greeks in Anatolia
called Ionian Greeks who will become relevant shortly.

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,620
So even if you weren’t Persian, the Persian
Empire was pretty dreamy. For one thing, the

28
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,819
Persians ruled with a light touch, like, conquered
kingdoms were allowed to keep their kings

29
00:01:55,819 --> 00:02:00,019
and their elites as long as they pledged allegiance
to the Persian King and paid taxes, which

30
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,950
is why the Persian king was known as The King
of Kings.

31
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,769
Plus, taxes weren’t too high, and the Persians
improved infrastructure with better roads

32
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:10,919
and they had this pony express-like mail service
of which Herodotus said: “...they are stayed

33
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:18,459
neither by snow nor rain nor heat nor darkness from
accomplishing their appointed course with all speed.”

34
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,519
And the Persians embraced freedom of religion.
Like they were Zoroastrian, which has a claim

35
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,039
to being the world’s first monotheistic
religion. It was really Zoroastrianism that

36
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,548
introduced to the good/evil dualism we all
know so well. You know: god and Satan, or

37
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:34,840
Harry and Voldemort... But the Persians weren’t
very concerned about converting people of

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,299
the empire to their faith. Plus, Zoroastrianism
forbid slavery, and so slavery was almost

39
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,079
unheard of in the Persian Empire.

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,120
All in all, if you had to live in the 5th
century BCE, the Persian Empire was probably

41
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,718
the best place to do it. Unless, that is,
you believe Herodotus and the Greeks. We all

42
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:55,998
know about the Greeks: architecture, philosophy,
literature. The very word music comes from

43
00:02:55,998 --> 00:03:00,370
Greek, as does so much else in contemporary
culture. Greek poets and mathematicians playwrights

44
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,009
and architects and philosophers founded a
culture we still identify with. And they introduced

45
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:09,039
us to many ideas, from democracy to fart jokes. And the

46
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,699
Greeks gave the west our first dedicated history,
they gave us our vocabulary for talking about politics.

47
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:18,358
Plus they gifted us our idealization of democracy,
which comes from the government they had in Athens.

48
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,969
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green,
Mr. Green — did you say fart jokes?

49
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,968
Present John: Uhh. You don’t ask about Doric,
Ionian, or Corinthian columns. You don’t

50
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:30,388
ask about Plato’s allegory of the cave.
It’s all scatological humor with you — It’s

51
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,588
time for the open letter? Really? Already?
Alright.

52
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,479
An open letter [the whoopee cushion sounds]...
Stan! To Aristophanes. Dear Aristophanes...

53
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:46,079
Oh right, I have to check the secret compartment.
Stan, what... oh. Thank you, Stan. It’s

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,299
fake dog poo. How thoughtful.

55
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,299
So, good news and bad news, Aristophanes.

56
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,859
2,300 years after your death — this is the
good news — you’re still a reasonably

57
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,829
famous. Only eleven of your forty plays survived,
but even so, you’re called the Father of

58
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,528
Comedy; there are scholars devoted to your
work.

59
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:06,028
Now, the bad news: Even though your plays
are well-translated and absolutely hilarious,

60
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:10,278
students don’t like to read them in schools.
There always like, why do we gotta read this

61
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:14,370
boring crap? And this must be particularly
galling to you, because so much of what you

62
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,408
did in your career was make fun of boring
crap, specifically in the form of theatrical

63
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:24,329
tragedies. Plus, you frequently used actual
crap to make jokes. Such as when you had the

64
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:29,469
chorus in The Acharnians imagining a character
in your play throwing crap at a real poet you didn’t like.

65
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,870
You, Aristophanes, who wrote that under every
stone lurks a politician, who called wealth

66
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,620
the most excellent of all the gods... You,
who are responsible for the following conversation:

67
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,930
"Praxagora: I want all to have a share of
everything and everything to be in common;

68
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,319
there will no longer be either rich or poor;
[...] I shall begin by making land, money,

69
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,030
everything that is private property, common
to all. [...]

70
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,568
Blepyrus: But who will till the soil?

71
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:52,449
Praxagora: The slaves.

72
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:53,460
Blepyrus: Oh."

73
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,709
And yet you’re seen as homework! Drudgery!
That, my friend, is a true tragedy. On the

74
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,789
upside, we did take care of slavery. It only
took us two thousand years.

75
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,569
Best wishes,
John Green

76
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:07,629
When we think about the high point of Greek
culture, exemplified by the Parthenon and

77
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:11,930
the plays of Aeschylus, what we’re really
thinking about is Athens in the fourth century

78
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,449
BCE, right after the Persian Wars. But Greece
was way more than Athens; Greeks lived in

79
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,610
city-states which consisted of a city and
its surrounding area. Most of these city-states

80
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:27,750
featured at least some form of slavery, and in all
of them citizenship was limited to males. Sorry ladies...

81
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,860
Also, each of the city-states had its own
form of government, ranging from very democratic

82
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,680
— unless you were a woman or a slave — to
completely dictatorial. And the people who

83
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,680
lived in these cities considered themselves
citizens of that city, not of anything that

84
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,280
would ever be called Greece. At least until
the Persian wars.

85
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,989
So between 490 and 480 BCE, the Persians made
war on the Greek City states. This was the

86
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,430
war that featured the battle of Thermopylae
where three hundred brave Spartans battled

87
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,329
— if you believe Herodotus — five million
Persians.

88
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:01,550
And also the battle of Marathon, which is
a plain about 26.2 miles away from Athens.

89
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,780
The whole war started because Athens supported
those aforementioned Ionian Greeks when they

90
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:10,438
were rebelling in Anatolia against the Persians.
That made the Persian king Xerxes mad, so

91
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,080
he led two major campaigns against the Athenians,
and the Athenians enlisted the help of all

92
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:19,120
the other Greek city-states. And in the wake
of that shared Greek victory, the Greeks began

93
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,340
to see themselves as Greeks, rather than as
Spartans, or Athenians or whatever.

94
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,709
And then Athens emerged as the de facto capital
of Greece and then got to experience a Golden

95
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:30,989
Age, which is something that historians make
up. But a lot of great things did happen during

96
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,908
the Golden Age, including the Parthenon, a
temple that became a church and then a mosque

97
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:38,610
and then an armory until finally settling
into its current gig as a ruin.

98
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,908
You also had statesmen like Pericles, whose
famous funeral oration brags about the golden

99
00:06:42,908 --> 00:06:47,598
democracy of Athens with rhetoric that wouldn’t
sound out of place today. “If we look to

100
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:51,978
the laws, they afford equal justice to all
in their private differences... if a man is

101
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:56,430
able to serve the state, he is not hindered
by the obscurity of his condition.”

102
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,848
When you combine that high-minded rhetoric
with the undeniable power and beauty of the

103
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:06,218
art and philosophy that was created in ancient
Athens, it’s not hard to see it as the foundation

104
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,759
of Western civilization. And if you buy into
this, you have to be glad that the Greeks

105
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,740
won the Persian Wars. But even if you put
aside the slavery and other injustices in

106
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,139
Greek society, there’s still trouble.

107
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,718
Do I have to say it, seriously? FINE. TROUBLE
RIGHT HERE IN RIVER CITY WITH A CAPITAL T

108
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:21,629
AND THAT RHYMES WITH P AND THAT STANDS FOR
PELOPONNESE.

109
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:26,280
Pericles’s funeral oration comes from a
later war, The Peloponnesian War, a thirty

110
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:32,128
year conflict between the Athenians and the
Spartans. The Spartans did not embrace democracy

111
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:38,150
but instead embraced a kingship that functioned
only because of a huge class of brutally mistreated

112
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:42,628
slaves. But to be clear, the war was not about
Athens trying to get Sparta to embrace democratic

113
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:48,028
reform; wars rarely are. It was about resources
and power. And the Athenians were hardly saintly

114
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:52,240
in all of this, as evidenced by the famous
Melian Dialogue. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

115
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,460
So in one of the most famous passages of Thucydides’
history of the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians

116
00:07:56,468 --> 00:08:01,908
sailed to the island of Melos, a Spartan colony,
and demanded that the Melians submit to Athenian

117
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:05,728
rule. The Melians pointed out that they’d
never actually fought with the Spartans and

118
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:09,089
were like, “Listen, if it’s all the same
to you, we’d like to go Switzerland on this

119
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,519
one,” except of course they didn’t say
that because there was no Switzerland.

120
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,098
To which the Athenians responded, and here
I am quoting directly, “The strong do what

121
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:20,269
they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”

122
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:25,769
Needless to say, this is not a terribly democratic
or enlightened position to take. This statement,

123
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:30,848
in fact, is sometimes seen as the first explicit
endorsement of the so-called theory of Realism

124
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:35,379
in international relations. For realists,
interaction between nations, or peoples, or

125
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:41,149
cultures is all about who has the power. Whoever
has it can compel whoever doesn’t have it

126
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:43,069
to do pretty much anything.

127
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,080
So what did the meritocratic and democratic
Athenians do when the Melians politely asked

128
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:54,600
not to participate in the fight? They killed all the
Melian men and enslaved all the women and children.

129
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,000
So, yes, Socrates gave us his interrogative
Method; Sophocles gave us Oedipus; but the

130
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,059
legacy of Ancient Greece is profoundly ambiguous,
all the moreso because the final winner of

131
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:09,079
the Peloponnesian War were the dictatorial Spartans.
Thanks for the incredible bummer, Thought Bubble.

132
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,840
So here’s a non-rhetorical question: Did
the right side win the Persian wars?

133
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,440
Most classicists and defenders of the Western
Tradition will tell you that of course we

134
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,780
should be glad the Greeks won. After all,
winning the Persian war set off the cultural

135
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,980
flourishing that gave us the Classical Age.
And plus, if the Persians had won with their

136
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,110
monarchy that might have strangled democracy
in its crib and given us more one-man rule.

137
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,710
And that’s possible, but as a counter that
argument, let’s consider three things:

138
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,960
First, it’s worth remembering that life
under the Persians was pretty good, and if

139
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,090
you look at the last five thousand years of
human history, you’ll find a lot more successful

140
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,340
and stable empires than you will democracies.

141
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,070
Second, life under the Athenians wasn’t
so awesome, particularly if you were a woman

142
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,900
or a slave, and their government was notoriously
corrupt. And ultimately the Athenian government

143
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,480
derived its power not from its citizens, but
from the imperialist belief that Might Makes

144
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,330
Right. It’s true that Athens gave us Socrates,
but let me remind you, they also killed him.

145
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,100
Well, I mean they forced him to commit suicide.
Whatever, Herodotus, you’re not the only

146
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,029
one here who can engage in historical bias.

147
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,139
And lastly, under Persian rule the Greeks
might have avoided the Peloponnesian War,

148
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:15,340
which ended up weakening the Greek city-states
so much that Alexander “Coming Soon” the

149
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,769
Great’s father was able to conquer all of
them, and then there were a bunch of bloody

150
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:23,139
wars with the Persians and all kinds of horrible
things, and Greece wouldn’t glimpse democracy

151
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:27,740
again for two millennia. All of which might
have been avoided if they’d just let themselves

152
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,659
get beaten by the Persians.

153
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:33,719
All of which forces us to return to the core
question of human history: What’s the point

154
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,060
of being alive? I’ve got good news for you,
guy. You’re only going to have to worry

155
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:41,309
about it for about 8 more seconds. Should
we try to ensure the longest, healthiest,

156
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:46,139
and most productive lives for humans? If so,
it’s easy to argue that Greece should have

157
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,830
lost the Persian Wars. But perhaps lives are
to be lived in pursuit of some great ideal

158
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:57,020
worth sacrificing endlessly for. And if so,
maybe the glory of Athens still shines, however dimly.

159
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,879
Those are the real questions of history: What’s
the point of being alive? How should we organize

160
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,330
ourselves, what should we seek from this life?
Those aren’t easy questions, but we’ll

161
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,129
take another crack at them next week when
we talk about the Buddha. I’ll see you then.

162
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:13,860
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson,

163
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,870
the graphics team is Thought Bubble, and the
show is written by my high school history

164
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,000
teacher Raoul Meyer and me.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,659
Our phrase of the week last week was "Un mot
de français". If you’d like to guess this

166
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,860
week’s phrase of the week you can do so
in comments. You can also ask questions about

167
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,840
today’s video in comments where our team
of historians will attempt to answer them.

168
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,480
Thanks for watching, and Don't Forget To Be
Awesome.
