00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,239
Hi, my name is John Green, This is Crash Course
World History. Oh my gosh! Today we're going

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,519
to talk about war. Ah! Explosions everywhere!

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,849
So, traditionally, historians are pretty keen
on wars, because they feature clearly delineated

4
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:16,649
beginnings, and middles, and ends, and because
they always have a fair bit of death and drama

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,169
and mortally wounded generals who have great
last words like

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,470
"Let us cross the river and rest under the
shade of those trees,"

7
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:27,769
whereas the last words of, plague victims
are always, like, "Unggggg."

8
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:31,589
Sorry, plague victims. As if you don't have
enough troubles. Now you've got me teasing

9
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,960
you about your uninspired death throes.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,960
Wars have easy whens, wheres, whos, and whys:
1861-1865. The United States. The North vs.

11
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,768
the South. To end slavery and save the Union.

12
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:48,399
Mr. Green, Mr. Green. Are you gonna show us
the hidden complexities behind something we

13
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,268
already think we understand again?

14
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:56,248
Sorry me from the past, but yes. However,
to placate you, here are some more explosions.

15
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:59,719
The 17th and 18th centuries saw a bunch of
top-notch wars, but today we're going to focus

16
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,358
on the 7 Years War, also called the French
and Indian War, because it was the first truly global war.

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,689
In fact, no less a historian than Winston
Churchill called it "The first world war."

18
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,030
But we've been so Eurocentric here on Crash
Course that all we are going to say about

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,370
the ENTIRE WAR IN EUROPE is that Prussia and
Great Britain fought France and Austria, and

20
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,469
that the Austrian Hapsburgs wanted to win
back Silesia, which they failed to do. THERE.

21
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:23,939
THAT'S ALL YOU GET, EUROPE.

22
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,659
So the Seven Years War lasted for...anyone...anyone...

23
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,280
Twenty three years.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,600
I hate you, Me from the Past. But, as it happens,
by sheer coincidence, you are not necessarily wrong.

25
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:43,329
[theme music]

26
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:48,859
So, the when: The Seven Years War began in
1756 and ended in 1763.

27
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:53,030
Unless you believe—as many historians do—that
the 7 Years War lasted 23 years, because it

28
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,159
was really a continuation of the War for Austrian
Succession.

29
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,219
Then you have the fact that much of the information
in today's episode is taken from a book called,

30
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:06,069
"The Global Seven Years War: 1754-1763," a
nine year period.

31
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:10,500
As for the who: It was mainly fought between
the British and the French, seen here reenacting

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,310
the knife fight from either Beat It or West
Side Story, depending on your age.

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,560
But some of the British were actually Americans,
and both the British and the French were supported

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,039
by American Indians. And there was fighting in India
between Indian Indians, the British, the French.

35
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,079
And as previously noted the French were fighting the
Prussians and the British were fighting the Austrians.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,140
The where: Europe, the continental U.S., the
Caribbean Sea, off the cost of Africa, India.

37
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,480
Basically, the world.

38
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:39,539
And the why: Ostensibly, land. British colonists wanted
to expand into land west of the original 13 colonies.

39
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,870
And that land was technically held by the
French, who left it alone except for a bunch

40
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,009
of trading posts. And they were like, "Je
de veux pens l'anglais."

41
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:47,870
Thank you, four years of high school French.

42
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,650
Anyway, the war wasn't really about land;
it was really about our old friend trade.

43
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,709
The British wanted to expand into the American
interior to allow for more colonists, because

44
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,709
the British benefited from both the export
of raw materials from the Americas and the

45
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,789
import of British consumer goods to the Americas.

46
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:09,639
So, more colonists meant more trade, which
meant more wealth, which meant ever-fancier hats.

47
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,759
And the French realized that this British-Atlantic
maritime trade was making Britain so rich

48
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,280
that British might come for France's actually
valuable colonies—which were not in the

49
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,209
continental U.S. but those slave-based sugar
plantations in the Caribbean.

50
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,989
So the fighting began around here. And while
the British did send over actual British troops,

51
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,060
much of the early fighting was done by colonial
militias.

52
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,539
Probably the most famous commander of British
troops was a Virginia colonel named George Washington.

53
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,219
In fact, he may have actually started the
shooting at the battle of Fort Necessity in

54
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:41,848
May of 1754. Washington was captured in that
battle and then he was immediately released

55
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:44,560
because 18th century war was super weird.

56
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,180
Anyway, the real North American action was
in New York and Canada. At the battle at the

57
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,800
Plains of Abraham in 1759, for instance, the
British defeated the French and captured the

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,000
city of Quebec. Both the British commander,
General Wolfe and the French commander, General

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,889
Montcalm, were killed at this battle, with
the death of the former being immortalized

60
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,139
in this famous painting, by Benjamin West:

61
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,889
As indicated by the picture, almost all the
battles in North America featured significant

62
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,049
participation by Native Americans.

63
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,800
Different Native tribes sided with both the
British and the French, but as a broad generalization,

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,489
Native Americans were more likely to support
the French.

65
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,649
Up to this point, shrewd Indian tribes had
been able to play the British and the French

66
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,608
off each other and maintain a degree of autonomy
for themselves.

67
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:25,060
And as long as the French were present, the
British were prevented from encroaching too

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,060
much on lands Native Americans were using
for hunting and agriculture.

69
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,490
Now, we haven't talked much about American
Indians, mostly because they were geographically

70
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,310
isolated and didn't have a written language.
But let's at least give them a Thought Bubble.

71
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,620
Before the arrival of the Europeans, most
Native Americans lived in tribal groups. And

72
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,930
they subsisted on a combination of small-scale
agriculture and hunting and gathering, depending

73
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,310
on where they were situated.

74
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,300
There were too many tribes to generalize about
specific social structures but it's probably safe

75
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,300
to say that in terms of gender they were much more
egalitarian than the Europeans who they met up with.

76
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,910
Which may explain why European women who were
taken captive by Indians sometimes preferred

77
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,530
to stay with the tribe rather than be rescued,
although that's somewhat controversial.

78
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:07,119
One thing we can say about the Indians: their
notions of what it meant to hold property

79
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:13,850
were very different from those of the Europeans.
Individual Indians did not "own" land in the

80
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,080
European sense; they used it, and not always
particularly intensively.

81
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,069
Europeans, when they came to North America,
had a hard time even recognizing that the

82
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:27,139
Indians were raising crops because their forms
of farming were so different from European

83
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,418
agriculture, so the French and especially
the English just assumed that the Indians

84
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:35,609
weren't improving the land, which meant that
they didn't own the land, so that meant that

85
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,240
it was ok for Europeans to take it. As you
might imagine, that was problematic for the Indians.

86
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,740
In general, Indian tribes initially got along
better with the French than with the Dutch

87
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,959
or English because
1. The French did not settle in large numbers,

88
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,989
as they were mostly traders and fur trappers,
and 2. French missionaries who made the journey

89
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,769
to the Americas were Catholic, often Jesuits,
who were so intent on converting the Indians

90
00:05:55,769 --> 00:06:00,250
that they took the time to learn Indian languages
and try to make Catholicism more amenable

91
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,759
to Indian religion.

92
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:05,549
The end result of the war, a greatly reduced
French presence on the American mainland,

93
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,280
meant that Indians could no longer easily
play the British and French off each other,

94
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,709
which opened the floodgates of British settlers.
In the end, the American Indians were perhaps

95
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,189
the biggest losers of the 7 Years War.

96
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,540
Thanks Thought Bubble. So, two thousand miles
south, in the Caribbean, there was also quite

97
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,329
a lot of fighting between the French and the
British over sugar colonies.

98
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:26,560
Most of these were naval battles, and by 1761,
Spain got involved, because, you know, they

99
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,350
had some sugar colonies of their own.

100
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,540
While these battles get a lot of ink, it's
interesting to note that by far, the greatest

101
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,610
threat to combatants, was disease.

102
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:40,460
By October of 1761 the British had lost about
1,000 men to war and 5,000 to disease.

103
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:44,859
Meanwhile in West Africa, the British and the French
were fighting there too. Because, you know, why not?

104
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,040
The British attacked the French at a trading
post called Saint Louis. Aw, Stan, don't make

105
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,520
me say it right. Fine. Saint Louis.

106
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,719
And at a town called Goree, both in Senegal.
Why? Well, trade, of course.

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,520
Senegal was the major source of gum Arabic,
which is notable for many reasons but most

108
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,698
importantly, it is a key ingredient in the
Diet Coke and Mentos phenomenon, so of course

109
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,379
the British wanted lots of it.

110
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,990
The French were also fighting the British
in India.

111
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,110
In the 18th century India was nominally ruled by the
Mughal empire. I bet I'm saying that wrong, aren't I?

112
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,560
HowJSay: Mugal.
John: Yeah, that sounds more plausible.

113
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:19,069
But as throughout most of its history, the
real power in India lay with local kings and

114
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,240
princes, sometimes called nawabs.

115
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,210
And these princes, just like their European
counterparts were constantly vying for power

116
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,689
and control over more territory.

117
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,689
And to get it, they often enlisted the help,
especially the military help, of Europeans.

118
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:34,759
This is what happened in the most notorious event
in the 7 Years War in India, the Black Hole of Calcutta.

119
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,620
In June of 1756 the British governor of Calcutta,
Roger Drake, made the mistake of insulting

120
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:44,600
the emissaries sent by the nawab Siraj-ud-daula,
who duly besieged and captured the English

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,080
garrison of 500 with his own army of 30,000.

122
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,599
Drake escaped to nearby ships with the town's
women and children—you know the old saying,

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,169
women, children, and governors first.

124
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:57,240
But the town's defenders remained, and the
survivors were imprisoned in a small windowless

125
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,870
room that came to be known as the Black Hole.

126
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,310
And 40 of 63 prisoners suffocated overnight.

127
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,579
This story is mostly famous, in a war that
killed a million people, because the British

128
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:09,909
press exaggerated the numbers in order to
build support for the war in India.

129
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,630
Not the last time that exaggerations of enemy
brutality would be used to gin up support for a war.

130
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:17,319
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the
military campaigns in this part of the world

131
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,389
is that, at least initially, they were not
undertaken by governments themselves, but

132
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,870
by corporations that had their own armies.

133
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,259
The British East India Company was the most
successful of these corporations primarily

134
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,788
because of the military skill of its leader,
Robert Clive.

135
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:36,788
Oh, it's time for the open letter? An Open
Letter to Robert Clive.

136
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,630
But first, let's see what's in the secret
compartment today. Oh, bubbles. That makes

137
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:47,269
sense, Stan. The British East India Company
was involved in several early market bubbles.

138
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,760
Mmm, bubbles.

139
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,120
Dear Robert Clive,
You were a complicated man, and not entirely

140
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,120
likable, but you did win a very important
battle at Plassey in 1757.

141
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,870
And the way you won it says a lot about the
relationship between Europe and its colonies.

142
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,970
So, the key to your success was a conspiracy
to overthrow the existing nawab orchestrated

143
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:16,970
by a Bengali banking family, called the Seths.
No, Stan. The Seths. Yes. Come on.

144
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:21,809
And in thanks for your support of their conspiracy,
the new nawab quickly signed a treaty with

145
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:23,989
your company, the East India Company.

146
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,350
And thereafter, the British had effective control over
trade in Bengal and the French were excluded from it.

147
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,560
This was an incredibly valuable region because it
produced silk and inexpensive cotton cloth for export.

148
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,039
And it gave the British a decisive advantage over the
French and eventually allowed them to control all of

149
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,599
India. And you accomplished this, Robert Clive, primarily
by fomenting revolution. Why does this work

150
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,960
for you and it never works for the CIA?

151
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,500
Best wishes, John Green

152
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:51,360
So, by now you have probably figured out that since the
French kept losing battles they eventually lost the war.

153
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,879
The main peace treaty, signed in Paris in
1763, limited French presence in the Caribbean,

154
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,019
in India, and in North America.

155
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:01,799
Although not completely, otherwise they couldn't
have sold Louisiana to Thomas Jefferson in 1803.

156
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,079
So, France was obviously dramatically weakened.
But overall, so was Britain.

157
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,470
One thing rarely mentioned is the actual human
cost of war. As many as a million combatants

158
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,580
died in the Seven Years War, but even that
doesn't tell the whole story.

159
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,740
In the 18th century armies usually fed themselves
by foraging, which really meant just pillaging

160
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,759
the countryside. In Europe, a single Prussian province
lost a fifth of its population to pillaging. And

161
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,509
in North America settlers in frontier regions
lived in constant fear of raids.

162
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:30,309
And, one of the perhaps lesser known outcomes
of the war was the systematic deportation

163
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:34,449
of the French Acadians from Maine to Louisiana
where they became Cajuns.

164
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,019
Meaning that the stars of the television shows
Lobster Wars and Swamp Wars are basically

165
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:45,289
the same people. What's that? There's no television
show called Swamp Wars? STAN, CANCEL EVERYTHING

166
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:47,860
AND GET ME ON THE PHONE WITH THE DISCOVERY
CHANNEL.

167
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,970
One last thing about wars: they are expensive.

168
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:58,600
In 1756 the British national debt was £75million;
in 1763 it was £133 million.

169
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,500
Someone had to pay for this, and the British felt it was
only fair that American colonists should foot the bill.

170
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,580
And those taxes, which helped fuel the American
Revolution, were a direct result of the Seven Years War.

171
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,370
So in one way, winning the Seven Years War
cost Britain its first empire.

172
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,549
But, when we remember that it was a global
war, and especially when we think about what

173
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,389
happened in India, then the Seven Years War
also begins to look like the beginning of

174
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:21,850
Britain's second, and much greater empire.

175
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,129
Winning is losing is winning is losing. Such
is life, and such is history.

176
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:29,350
Thanks for watching. See you next week.

177
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,120
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson. The show is

178
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,960
written by my high school history teacher Raoul Meyer and myself and the graphics team is Though Bubble.

179
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,019
Last week's phrase of the week was "you're a grandfather." You can take a guess at this week's phrase

180
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:48,840
of the week or suggest future ones. You can do so in comments where you can also ask questions about

181
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,680
today's video that will be answered by our team of historians. Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we

182
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,179
say in my home town: Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
