00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Hi there, my name’s John Green and this is Crash Course: World History, and today we’re going to talk about Egypt.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,200
No, not that Egypt.
Older.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,480
Older.
Older.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,380
Less fictional.
Yes, that one.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,400
Ancient Egypt is probably the most influential
of the river valley civilizations.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,839
Like you might not recognize any Assyrian Kings or Assyrian language, but you probably do know King Tut.

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,920
And you may recognize that the Eye of Horus
is right now staring at me and judging me.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,929
I can feel, I can feel your judgement.

9
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:36,879
[Theme Music]

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,840
When we think of Ancient Civilizations, we
think of Egypt.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,720
There are a few reasons for this, like the fact that the pyramids are the last man standing among the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World.

12
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:53,719
But more importantly, Ancient Egyptian civilization lasted from 3000 BCE to 332 BCE.

13
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,000
That’s a period that historians call a long-ass time.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
And I will remind you it is not cursing
if I'm talking about donkeys.

15
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:04,780
So there are many approaches to the study
of history. You could view history as a millennial

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,710
long conversation about philosophy or as clashes
between great men or you can see history through

17
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:15,579
the lens of traditionally neglected populations,
like women or indigenous peoples or slaves.

18
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:19,969
And we’re going to try to take many approaches
to our study of history during Crash Course.

19
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:25,039
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, which approach is right?
I mean, for the test.

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,420
Oh me-from-the-past. Remember how you spent
all of third year French writing notes back

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,710
and forth to that girl and she eventually
agreed to go out with you and you did make

22
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:36,188
it to second base but now you can hardly parle
un mot de francais?

23
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:41,228
Historical lenses are like that, my friend: With every
choice, something is gained and something is lost.

24
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:45,509
Right, so in discussing agriculture and early
civilizations, we’ve been approaching history

25
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,459
through the lens of resource distribution
and geography.

26
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:52,609
And just as the violent and capricious Tigris
and Euphrates rivers shaped the worldview

27
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:58,188
of early Mesopotamians, the Nile shaped the world
view of the Egyptians. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

28
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:03,368
The Nile was regular, navigable, and benign,
making for one of the safest and richest agricultural

29
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:07,170
areas in the world. Each summer the river
flooded the fields at precisely the right

30
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,920
time, leaving behind nutrient-rich silt for
planting season.

31
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,189
Planting was so easy that Egyptians just tossed
seeds around the silty earth and then let

32
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:20,469
their cattle or pigs walk on it to press the
seeds into the ground, and then boom, grain

33
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,680
and figs and wheat and pomegranates and melons
and joy.

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,379
Unlike most river valley civilizations, Egyptian
communities existed ONLY along the Nile, which

35
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:36,399
was navigable enough to get valuable resources
downstream from timber to gold, which the Egyptians

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,900
considered the divine metal, thereby introducing
an idea that would eventually culminate in Mr. T.

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,400
The Nile is also easily tamed. While other
river valley civilizations needed complicated

38
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:50,299
and labor-intensive hydraulic engineering
projects to irrigate crops, the Nile was so

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,989
chill that Egyptians could use a simple form
of water management called basin irrigation,

40
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,120
in which farmers used floodwaters to fill
earthen basins and canals for irrigation.

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,340
In short, the awesomeness of the Nile meant
Egyptians could create big food surpluses

42
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,319
with relatively little work, allowing time
and energy for some pretty impressive projects.

43
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,009
Also, the Nile may help explain the ancient
Egypt’s general optimism:

44
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:17,878
While ancient Sumerian religion, for instance,
saw the afterlife as this gloomy, dark place,

45
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,348
Egyptians were often buried with things that
were useful and pleasurable to them in life,

46
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:27,039
because the Afterlife was seen as a continuation
of this life, which, at least if you lived

47
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,979
along the Nile, wasn’t half-bad.

48
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,549
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

49
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:36,710
And now, my dear pupils, I shall terrorize
you with the oppression of dates. No. Dates.

50
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,480
Yes. Thank you.

51
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,628
Historians have divided Egyptian history into
three broad categories. Each with their own

52
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:46,699
numbered dynasties. But only hardcore Egyptologists
know the dynasties, and we’re not trying

53
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,449
to become hardcore Egyptologists.

54
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:51,759
The Old Kingdom lasted from 2649 to 2152;

55
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,759
The middle kingdom from 2040 to 1640;

56
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,459
And the New Kingdom, so called because it
is only 3,000 years old, lasted from 1550-1070 BCE.

57
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:03,449
In between you have a couple so-called Intermediate
periods. Okay, OLD KINGDOM.

58
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,079
This was really the glory age of ancient Egypt,
when we get all the stuff that will later

59
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,800
make Indiana Jones possible, like the pyramids at Giza, and the sun king Ra, and the idea of divine kingship.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,098
The king, or Pharoh, was either a god or very close to a god.

61
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:20,680
which seems like a good gig, except that it
meant that he wasn’t expected to act like

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,478
a person, he was expected to act like a god,
which in ancient Egypt means acting like the

63
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,639
Nile: calm, cool, benevolent...
There’s no fun it that.

64
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
And then of course there are the pyramids,
which aside from remaining impressive to behold

65
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,638
represent a remarkable degree of political
and social control over the population, because

66
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,838
it is not easy to convince people to devote
their lives to building a sarcophagus for someone else.

67
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:48,990
The most famous pyramids were built between
2575 and 2465 BCE.

68
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,259
The one with the Sphinx was for Khephren;

69
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,499
the largest, the Great Pyramid, was built
for the Pharaoh Khufu.

70
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:58,719
These pyramids were built partly by peasants
who were required by Egyptian law to work

71
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:01,149
for the government a certain number of months
per year,

72
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:05,309
and partly by slaves, but not by Moses and
the Jews, who showed up on the scene long

73
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:08,960
before pyramids were ever even a twinkle in
Khufu’s eye.

74
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:15,959
This leads to an overwhelming question: Why?
Why in the sweet name of Ra would anyone ever

75
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,399
build such a thing?

76
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,329
Well, let’s start with Ra. So, Ra started
out as a regional god, reigning over Heliopolis,

77
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:25,558
but he eventually became really central to
the entire pantheon of gods of ancient Egypt.

78
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:28,369
He was the god of the sun, but also the god
of creation.

79
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:32,029
And the thinking was that if humans did their
jobs then the pantheon of gods would maintain

80
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:38,118
cosmic order, and since the pharaohs became
gods upon their death, it made sense to please

81
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,610
them even unto pyramids.

82
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,809
Egyptian popular religion also embraced the
belief in amulets and magic and divination

83
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:46,559
and the belief that certain animals--

84
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,449
especially cats—had divine power.

85
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,139
And yes, I did bring that up just so I could
lolcat.

86
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,129
Old Kingdom Egypt was also remarkably literate:

87
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:58,270
They had two forms of writing, hieroglyphics
for sacred writing and then demotic script

88
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:02,848
for recording contracts and agreements and
other boring stuff.

89
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:05,498
The last thing I want to say about Old Kingdom
Egypt; it was ridiculously rich.

90
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:10,099
But then around 2250 BCE there were a series
of droughts and Pharaohs started fighting

91
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:13,838
over who should have power and we had an intermediate
period.

92
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:16,019
[classic intermission music]

93
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,588
Which was followed by the Middle Earth...

94
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:24,678
No, what? The middle kingdom? Ohh. Really?
That’s a bummer, Stan. I want it to be the

95
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:28,778
Middle Earth. How awesome would that be? Like
right in the middle of Egyptian history, there

96
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:29,528
were Hobbits....

97
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:34,288
So the Middle Kingdom, which apparently had
no Hobbits, restored Pharaonic rule in 2040

98
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,490
BCE but with some distinct changes:

99
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,499
First, the rulers were outsiders, from downriver
in Nubia. Second, they fostered a new pantheon

100
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:45,319
of gods, the star of which was Ammun, which
means hidden.

101
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,959
So here’s a little lesson from history: Hidden
gods tend to do well because they’re omnipresent.

102
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:54,800
So Ammun eventually merged with Ra to form
the god Ammun-Ra, who was like the best god ever

103
00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:01,178
and all the Middle Kingdom pharaohs made temples
for him and devoted all of their surplus to his glory.

104
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:05,468
The Middle Kingdom also developed an interest
in conquering, specifically the new homeland

105
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:10,149
of Nubia, and they developed a side interest
in getting conquered, specifically by Semitic

106
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:11,588
peoples from the Levant.

107
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:15,959
They were able to conquer much of Egypt using
superior military technology like bronze weapons

108
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,528
and compound bows, and chariots of fire. What?
They were just regular chariots? STAN WHY

109
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,749
ARE YOU ALWATS KILLING MY DREAMS?

110
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:28,429
One group, the Hyksos, were able to conquer
all of Egypt, but rather than like destroying

111
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:33,718
the Egyptian culture, they just relaxed like
the Nile and assimilated into the Egyptians.

112
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:38,399
And the Egyptians adopted their military technology.
And then the Egyptians destroyed the Hyksos

113
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,778
and expelled them from Egypt.

114
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:43,778
And then by 1550 BCE there was again an Egyptian
pharaoh, Ahmosis...

115
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:45,959
...whose name only sounds like an STD.

116
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,179
Anyway, after all this conquering and being
conquered, Egypt eventually emerged from its

117
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,958
geographically imposed isolationism and, can
you cue the New Kingdom Graphic please?

118
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,079
There it is!

119
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,620
New Kingdom Egypt continued this military
expansion but it looked more like an Empire,

120
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:03,949
particularly when they headed south and took
over land in an attempt to find gold and slaves.

121
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,110
Probably the most expansive of the New Kingdom
pharaohs was Hatshepsut, a woman who ruled

122
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,088
Egypt for about 22 years.

123
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:14,019
And who expanded Egypt not through military
might, but through trade.

124
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:18,338
But most new kingdom pharaohs being dudes,
focused on military expansion, which brought

125
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:22,110
Egypt into conflicts with the Assyrians who
you’ll remember from last week,

126
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,399
And then the Persians, and then Alexander
the Great and finally, the Romans.

127
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,709
On the whole, Egypt probably would’ve been
better off enjoying its geographical isolation

128
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:34,560
and not trying to conquer new territory, but
all of Egypt’s friends had jumped off a bridge, so…

129
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,699
One last thing about the New Kingdom. There
was this crazy New Kingdom Pharaoh named Akehenaten,

130
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,168
who tried to invent a new god for Egypt, Aten.

131
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,129
Akehenaten was kind of the Kim Jong Il of
Ancient Egypt, like he had this feared police

132
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:50,159
force and this big cult of personality. And
also he was a nut job.

133
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,208
Anyway, after his death he was replaced by
his wife, and then a daughter and than a son,

134
00:08:55,208 --> 00:09:01,439
Tutankaten, who turned his back on the weird
god Aten and changed his name to Tutankhamen.

135
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,629
And that is about all King Tut did before
he died...

136
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,470
...probably around the age of 17. Honestly,
the only reason King Tut is famous is that

137
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,019
most Pharaohs had their graves robbed by ancient
people; and King Tut had his grave robbed

138
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:16,828
by 20th century British people.

139
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:18,788
Which brings us to the Open Letter.

140
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,420
An Open Letter to King Tut:

141
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:29,740
Oh, but first we gotta find out what Stan
left for me in the Secret Compartment. It’s a pen.

142
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:33,539
AAHHHH!! It’s a shock
pen! Stan?%@#

143
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:37,439
That’s a terrible, terrible gift for the
secret compartment.

144
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,900
Dear King Tut, I know that as Pharaohs lives go, yours
was pretty poor. First, you had to marry your

145
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,870
sister, which hopefully you weren’t that
psyched about, plus you had a cleft palette

146
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,039
and probably scoliosis.

147
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,980
Plus you died before really reaching adulthood.
But dude, you have had the best afterlife ever.

148
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,019
Since your body was discovered in 1922, you’ve
become probably the most famous ancient person.

149
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,459
There have been lots of books about you, scholars
have devoted their lives to you.

150
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,739
Dude, we’re so obsessed with you that we
used this fancy new technology to scan your

151
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,509
body and establish that you probably died
of an infected broken leg and/or malaria,

152
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:16,068
So you’ve inspired such seminal works of
art as the Discovery Kids series Tutenstein,

153
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:17,759
which my son forces me to watch.

154
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:22,360
Your relics have been to six continents! So
it all works out in the end, man.

155
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,019
Well, I mean, you’re still dead. So that’s
kinda sucks.

156
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,799
Best wishes,
John Green

157
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,469
King Tut leads us nicely to the really crucial
thing about Egyptian culture.

158
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,939
Because King Tut lived right around the same
time as the pyramids right? Wrong.

159
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:41,360
Remember the pyramids were built around 2500
BCE during the Old Kingdom. King Tut died

160
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,539
in 1322 BCE, 1200 years later!

161
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:50,318
That’s five and a half Americas. But because
Egypt was so similar for so long, it all tends

162
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:52,878
to blend together when we imagine it.

163
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,329
Ancient Egypt lasted 1000 years longer than
Christianity has been around, and about 800

164
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:00,778
years longer than that other super-long lived
civilization, China.

165
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:05,809
So there was an entire culture that lasted
longer than Western Civilization has existed

166
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:08,799
and it had run its course before “the West”
was even born.

167
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,990
Next week, we’ll look at the Persians and
the Greeks. I’ll see you then.

my high school history teacher and myself;
our script supervisor is Danica Johnson and

170

171
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,438
Last week’s phrase of the week was “Male
Models.” You can take your guess at this

172
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:32,719
week’s phrase of the week in Comments and
also suggest future phrases of the week.

173
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,490
And if you have any questions about today’s
video, leave them in Comments and our team

174
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,649
of semi-professional quasi-historians will
endeavor to answer them as best we can.

175
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,249
Thanks for watching and as we say in my hometown:
Don’t forget to be awesome.
