00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course
World History.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,530
Let’s begin today with a question.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,760
Why am I alive? Also, why don’t I have any
eyes? Ah, That’s better.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,039
The way we answer that question ends up organizing
all kinds of other thoughts, like what we

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:15,579
should value, and how we should behave, and
if we should eat meat, and whether we should

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,850
dump that boy who is very nice, but insanely
clingy, in a way that he cannot possibly think

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,830
is attractive. All of which adds up-

8
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,019
Uh, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, uh, are you talking
about me?

9
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:29,399
Yes, I’m talking about you, me from the
past. I’m telling you that one of the reasons

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,738
we study history is so that you can be a less
terrible boyfriend, but more on that momentarily.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:43,380
[theme music]

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,420
Today we’re going to talk about civilizations,
but in order to do that, we have to talk about

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,280
talking about civilizations, because it’s
a problematic word. So problematic, in fact,

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,520
that I have to turn to camera 2 to discuss
it.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,320
Certain Conglomerations of humans are seen
as civilizations, whereas, say, nomadic cultures

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,000
generally aren’t, unless, you are -- say it
with me --

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,259
the mongols

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,200
By calling some groups civilizations, you
imply that all other social orders are uncivilized,

19
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,619
which is basically just another way of saying
that they’re savages or barbarians.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,579
side note: originally Greek, the word Barbarian
denoted anyone who did not speak ancient Greek,

21
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:19,319
because to the Greeks, all other languages
sounded like bar bar bar bar bar bar.

22
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,739
So, that is to say that we are all essentially
barbarians, except for the classics majors,

23
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:26,659
which is worth remembering when we’re discussing
civilizations.

24
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,799
Civilizations are like most of the things
we like to study, they’re intellectual constructs.

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,859
No one woke up in the city of Thebe’s in
Egypt one morning and said, “what a beautiful

26
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:38,840
morning, I sure am living at the height of
Egyptian civilization.” Still, they’re

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,670
useful constructs, particularly when you’re
comparing one civilization to another. They’re

28
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,070
less useful when you’re comparing a civilization
to a non-civilization type social order, which

29
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:49,639
is why we will try to avoid that.

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,618
And yes, I am getting to the good boyfriend
stuff. Patience, grasshopper.

31
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:56,090
So what is a civilization? Well, diagnosing
a civilization is a little like like diagnosing

32
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,909
an illness. If you have four or more of the
following symptoms, you might be a civilization.

33
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,130
Surplus production. Once one person can make
enough food to feed several people, it becomes

34
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,310
possible to build a city, another symptom
of civilization.

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,830
It also leads to the specialization of labor,
which in turn leads to trade. Like, if everybody

36
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,180
picks berries for a living, there’s no reason
to trade, because I have berries, and you

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,439
have berries,  but if I pick berries for a living and
you make hammers, suddenly, we have cause to trade.

38
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,639
Civilizations are also usually associated
with social stratification, centralized government,

39
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,389
shared values, generally in the form of religion,
and writing. And at least in the early days,

40
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:30,339
they were almost always associated with rivers.

41
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,200
These days you can just bisect a segment of
land horizontally and vertically, and boom,

42
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,679
build a city. But 5000 years ago, civilizations
were almost always associated with rivers. Whether

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,200
that’s the Tigris and Euphrates, the Yellow River,
The Nile, the Amazon Basin, the Coatzacoalcos -

44
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,859
Gaaah! I was doing so good until I got to
Coatzacoalcos!

45
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,750
(computer says: Coatzacoalcos) Coatzacoalcos.
Maybe.

46
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,479
Why river valleys? They’re flat, they’re well watered,
and when they flood, they deposit nutrient-rich silt.

47
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,179
We’ll have more to say about most of these
civilizations later, but let’s talk about

48
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,349
this guy, the Indus Valley Civilization, ‘cause
it’s my all time favorite.

49
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:07,639
The Indus Valley Civilization was located
in the flood plain of the Indus and Sarawati

50
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,268
rivers, and it was about the best place in
the world to have an ancient civilization

51
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:16,539
because the rivers flooded very reliably twice
a year, which meant that it had the most available

52
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:19,799
calories per acre of pretty much anywhere
on the planet.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,819
We know the Indus Valley Civilization flourished
a long time ago. Probably around 3000 BCE.

54
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:26,458
Why is that question literally hanging over
my head?

55
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,960
But people of the Indus valley were trading
with Mesopotamians as early as 3500 BCE. We also

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,240
know that it was the largest of the ancient civilizations.
Archaeologists have discovered more than 1500 sites.

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,159
So what do we know about this civilization?
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

58
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,609
Everything we know about the Indus Valley
Civilization comes from archaeology, because

59
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,629
while they did use written language, we don’t
know how to read it, and no Rosetta Stone

60
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,780
has thus appeared to help us learn it.

61
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,159
I meant the other Rosetta Stone, Thought Bubble, yeah.

62
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,460
Although, come to think of it, either would be acceptable.

63
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,439
So here’s what we know, they had amazing
cities. Harappa and Mohenjo Daro are the best

64
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:04,739
known, with dense, multi-story homes constructed
out of uniformly sized bricks along perpendicular

65
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,680
streets. I mean this wasn’t some ancient
world version of Houston, more like Chicago.

66
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,010
This means they must have had some form of
government and zoning, but we don’t know

67
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,669
what gave this government its authority.

68
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,579
Cities were oriented to catch the wind and
provide a natural form of air conditioning.

69
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,550
And they were clean. Most homes were connected
to a centralized drainage system that used

70
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,400
gravity to carry waste and water out of the
city in big sewer ditches that ran under the

71
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,199
main avenues, a plumbing system that would
have been the envy of many 18th century European cities.

72
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,879
Also, in Mohenjo Daro, the largest public
building was not a temple or a palace, but

73
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,519
a public bath, which historians call the Great
Bath. We don’t know what the great bath

74
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,180
was used for, but since later Indian culture
placed a huge emphasis on ritual purity, which

75
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,100
is the basis for the caste system, some
historians have speculated that the bath might

76
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,240
have been like a giant baptismal pool.

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,759
Also, they traded. One of the coolest things
that the Indus Valley Civilization produced

78
00:04:55,769 --> 00:05:01,259
were seals used as identification markers on goods
and clay tablets. These seals contained the writing

79
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,579
that we still can’t decipher, and a number of fantastic
designs, many featuring animals and monsters.

80
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,110
One of the most famous and frightening is
of a man with what looks like water buffalo

81
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,720
horns on his head, sitting cross-legged between
a tiger and a bull. We don’t know what’s

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,090
really going on here, but it’s safe to say
that this was a powerful dude, because he

83
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,159
seems to be able to control the tiger.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,199
How do these seals let us know that they traded?
Well, because we found them in Mesopotamia,

85
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,949
not the indus valley. Plus, archaeologists
have found stuff like bronze in the indus

86
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,538
valley that is not native to the region. So
what did they trade? Cotton cloth. Still such

87
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,189
a fascinating export, incidentally that it
will be the subject of the 40th and final

88
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:39,439
video in this very series.

89
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,480
But here’s the most amazing thing about the
Indus Valley people. They were peaceful. Despite

90
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:51,600
archaeologists finding 1500 sites, they have found
very little evidence of warfare, almost no weapons.

91
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,520
Thanks Thought Bubble. OK, before we talk
about the fascinating demise of the Indus

92
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,099
Valley Civilization. It’s time for the open
letter.

93
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,660
Magic!

94
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,419
I wonder what the secret compartment has for
me today? Oh! Fancy clothes.

95
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:10,978
I guess the secret compartment didn’t think
I was dressed up enough for the occasion.

96
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,520
An open letter to Historians. Dear historians,
the Great Bath? Really? THE GREAT BATH? I’m

97
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,909
trying to make history fascinating, and you
give me a term that evokes scented candles,

98
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,410
bath salts and Frederic Fekkai hair products?

99
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,050
I know sometimes the crushingly boring names
of history aren’t your fault. You didn’t

100
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,210
name the federalist papers or the Austro-Hungarian
Empire or Adam Smith. But when you do get

101
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:39,349
a chance to name something, you go with THE
GREAT BATH? Not the Epic Bath of Mohenjo Daro,

102
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,960
or the Bath to End All Baths, or the Pool
That Ruled, or the Moist Mystery of Mohenjo

103
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:51,959
Daro or the Wet Wonder? The Great Bath? Really?
You can do better. best wishes, John Green.

104
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,579
So what happened to these people? Well, here’s
what didn’t happen to them. They didn’t

105
00:06:55,579 --> 00:07:00,508
morph into the current residents of that area
of the world, Hindu Indians or Muslim Pakistanis.

106
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,990
Those people probably came from the Caucasus.

107
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,918
Instead, sometime around 1750 BCE, the Indus
Valley Civilization declined until it faded

108
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,498
into obscurity. Why? Historians have three
theories.

109
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,600
One: Conquest! Turns out to be a terrible military
strategy not to have any weapons, and it’s possible

110
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,410
people from the Indus Valley were completely
overrun by people from the Caucasus.

111
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,710
Two: Environmental Disaster! It’s possible they brought
about their own end by destroying their environment.

112
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,889
Three: Earthquake! The most interesting theory
is that a massive earthquake changed the

113
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,289
course of the rivers so much that
a lot of the tributaries dried up.

114
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,340
Without adequate water supplies for irrigation,
the cities couldn’t sustain themselves,

115
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,978
so people literally picked up and headed for
greener pastures.

116
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:44,008
Well, probably not pastures, it’s unlikely
they became nomads. They probably just moved

117
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:48,319
to a different plain an continued their agricultural
ways. I am already boring you and I haven’t

118
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,158
even told you yet how to be a better boyfriend
and/or girlfriend. I’m going to do that now.

119
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,280
So we don’t know why the Indus Valley Civilization
ended, but we also don’t really know why

120
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:02,258
it started. Why did these people build cities, and dig
swimming pools, and make unnecessarily ornate seals?

121
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,860
Were they motivated by hunger, fear, a desire
for companionship, the need to be near their

122
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,949
sacred spaces, or a general feeling that city
life was just more awesome than foraging?

123
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,740
Thinking about what motivated them to structure
their life as they did helps us to think about

124
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,418
how we structure our own lives. In short,
you’re clingy because you’re motivated

125
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,939
by fear and a need for companionship,

126
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,329
and she finds it annoying because it’s enough
work having to be responsible for herself

127
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,639
without having to also be responsible for
you.

128
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,849
Also, you’re not really helping her by clinging,
and from the Indus Valley in the bronze age,

129
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,479
to school life today, human life is all about
collaboration.

130
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,278
Trading cloth for bronze, building cities
together, and collaborating to make sure that

131
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:42,908
human lives are tilted to catch the wind.

132
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:47,539
Next week we will travel here to discuss the
Hot Mess o’ Potamia, but in the meantime,

133
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:52,519
if you have any questions, leave them in comments,
and our team of semi-trained semi-professionals

134
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,159
will do their best to answer them.

135
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,149
Also, you’ll find some suggested resources
in the video info below, he said, pointing

136
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:05,149
at his pants. Thanks for watching, and we’ll
see you next week!
