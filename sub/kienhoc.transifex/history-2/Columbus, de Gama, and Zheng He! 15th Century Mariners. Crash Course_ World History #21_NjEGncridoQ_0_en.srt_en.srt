1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,839
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to do

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,349
some compare and contrast, because that’s
what passes for hip in world history.

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:11,768
Right, so you’ve probably heard of Christopher
Columbus who in 1492 sailed the ocean blue

4
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:15,989
and discovered America, a place that had been
previously discovered only by millions of people --

5
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:18,920
Mr Green, Mr Green! Columbus was just a lucky
idiot.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,420
Yeah, no. Here’s a little rule of thumb,
Me from the Past: If you are not an expert

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,599
in something, don’t pretend to be an expert.
This is going to serve you well both in your

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,480
academic career and in your Kissing Career.
MOVING ON.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,859
[intro music]

10
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,839
So unlike Me from the Past, I'd argue that
Columbus has a deserved reputation in history

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,450
— but was he really the greatest sailor
of the 15th Century? Well, let’s meet the

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,760
other contestants. In the red corner, we have
Zheng He, who, when it comes to ocean-going

13
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,960
voyages was the first major figure of the
15th century. And in the blue corner is Vasco

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,460
da Gama, from scrappy little Portugal, who
managed to introduce Europeans to the Indian

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,808
Ocean trade network. Columbus, you have to
sit in the polka-dotted corner.

16
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,319
As you’ll no doubt remember from our discussion
of Indian Ocean trade, it was dominated by

17
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,798
Muslim merchants, involved ports in Africa
and the Middle East and India and Indonesia

18
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,330
and China, and it made a lot of people super
rich. This last point explains why our three

19
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,780
contestants were so eager to set sail. Well,
that and the ceaseless desire of human beings

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,978
to discover things and contract scurvy.

21
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,420
Let’s begin with Zheng He, who is probably
the greatest admiral you’ve never have heard

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,739
of. Couple of important things about Zheng
He, First, he was a Muslim. That may seem

23
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:34,118
strange until you consider that by the late
14th century, China had long experience with

24
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,530
Muslims, especially when they were ruled by,
wait for it... The Mongols.

25
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:45,409
Secondly, Zheng He was a eunuch. Fortunately,
15th century China had excellent general anesthesia,

26
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,799
so I’m sure it didn’t hurt at all when
they castrated him — what’s that, Stan?

27
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,320
They didn’t have any anesthesia? Oh, boy.
Oh. Stan! I’M SEEING IT! I can see, AH AH

28
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,279
AHHHH. Stan! SHOW ME SOMETHNG CUTE RIGHT NOW!
Oh, hi there kitty! How’d you get in that

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,689
little teacup? Thank you, Stan. Right, so
Zheng He rose from humble beginnings to lose

30
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:07,179
both of his testicles, and become the greatest admiral
in Chinese history. Let’s go to the thought Bubble.

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,760
Between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He led seven
voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, the expeditions

32
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:17,049
of the so-called treasure ships, and they
were huge. Columbus’ first voyage consisted

33
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:23,410
of three ships. Zheng He led an armada of
over 300, with a crew of over 27,000 — more

34
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,939
than half of London’s population at the
time. And some of these ships were, well,

35
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:33,419
enormous. The flagships, known as the treasure
ships, were over 400 feet long and had 7 or

36
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,208
more masts. See that little tiny ship there
in front of the Treasure Ship? That’s a

37
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,509
to-scale rendering of Christopher Columbus’s
flagship, the Santa Maria.

38
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:45,549
Zheng He wasn’t an explorer: The Indian
Ocean trade routes were already known to him

39
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,530
and other Chinese sailors. He visited Africa,
India, and the Middle East, and in a way,

40
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,439
his journeys were trade missions, but not
in the sense of filling his ships up with

41
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,949
stuff to be sold later for higher prices.

42
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:00,979
At the time, China was the leading manufacturer
of quality goods in the world, and there wasn’t

43
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:05,889
anything they actually needed to import. What
they needed was prestige and respect so that

44
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:09,518
people would continue to see China as the
center of the economic universe, so there

45
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,150
was a tribute system through which foreign
rulers or their ambassadors would come to

46
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,920
China and engage in a debasing ritual called
the kowtow wherein they acknowledged the superiority

47
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,750
of the Chinese emperor and offered him - or
her, but usually him - gifts in exchange for

48
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,310
the right to trade with China.

49
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,378
The opportunity to humble yourself before
the Chinese emperor was so valuable that many

50
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:33,268
a prince was happy to jump on a treasure ship
and sail back to China with Zheng He. Also,

51
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:38,209
these tribute missions brought lots of crazy
things to China, including exotic animals:

52
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,920
from Africa, Zheng He brought back a zoo’s
worth of rhinos, zebras, and even giraffes.

53
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,689
Basically, he was like the medieval Chinese
Noah. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

54
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:51,719
So the Chinese were world leaders in naval
technology, and they wanted to dominate trade

55
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,180
here in the Indian Ocean. So why, then, did
these voyages end? One reason was that Zheng

56
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,560
He couldn’t live forever, and sure enough,
he didn’t. Also his patron, the Yongle Emperor,

57
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,598
died. And the emperor’s successors weren’t
very interested in maritime trade. They were

58
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,750
more concerned with protecting China against
its traditional enemies, nomads from the steppe.

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,330
To do this, they built a rather famous wall.
The Great Wall was mostly built under the

60
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,250
Ming Dynasty using resources that they only
had because they stopped building gigantic

61
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,689
ships. Just imagine what might have happened
if the Ming emperors had embraced a different

62
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:24,399
strategy. One that was based on outreach instead
of isolationism.

63
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,879
And now, to the blue corner. Representing
Portuguese exploration, we have Vasco da Gama.

64
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,959
Couple things about Portugal: first, it has
a fair bit of coastline. Secondly, it was

65
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,489
relatively resource-poor, which meant it relied
upon trade in order to grow. Also, the Iberian

66
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,650
peninsula was the only place in Europe where
Muslims could be found in large numbers in

67
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:44,299
the 15th century, which meant the Christian
crusading spirit was quite strong there, presumably

68
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,560
because Muslims had brought so much stability
and prosperity to the region.

69
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,329
And chief among these would-be crusaders was
Prince Henry the Navigator, so called because

70
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:54,909
he was not a navigator. He was, however, a
patron, not only of sailors themselves, but

71
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,530
of a special school at Sagres in which nautical
knowledge was collected and new maps were

72
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:02,769
made, and all kinds of awesome stuff happened.
And all that knowledge gave Portuguese sailors

73
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,310
a huge competitive advantage when it came
to exploration.

74
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,689
Henry commissioned sailors to search for two
things. First, a path to the Indian Ocean

75
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:12,459
so they could get in on the lucrative spice
trade. And second, to find the kingdom of

76
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,620
Prester John, a mythical Christian King who
was supposed to live in Africa somewhere,

77
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,319
so that Henry could have Prester John’s
help in a crusade.

78
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,500
Da Gama was the first of Henry’s protégés
to make it around Africa, and into the Indian

79
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,939
Ocean. In 1498, he landed at Calicut, a major
trading post on India’s west coast. And

80
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:31,978
when he got there, merchants asked him what
he was looking for. He answered with three

81
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,839
words: Gold and Christians. Which basically
sums up Portugal’s motivations for exploration.

82
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,549
So, once the Portuguese breached the Indian
Ocean, they didn’t create, like, huge colonies,

83
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,129
because there were already powerful empires
in the region. Instead, they apparently sat

84
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:47,709
in the middle of the Indian Ocean doing nothing.
Actually, they were able to capture & control

85
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:51,769
a number of coastal cities, creating what
historians call a “trading post empire.”

86
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:55,448
They could do this thanks to their well-armed
ships, which captured cities by firing cannons

87
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,990
into city walls like IRL Angry Birds.

88
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,879
But since the Portuguese didn’t have enough
people or boats to run the Indian Ocean trade,

89
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,550
they had to rely on extortion. So, Portuguese
merchant ships would capture other ships and

90
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,889
force them to purchase a permit to trade called
a cartaz. And without a cartaz, a merchant

91
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,960
couldn’t trade in any of the towns that
Portugal controlled. To merchants, who’d

92
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,859
plied the Indian Ocean for years in relative
freedom, the Portuguese were just glorified

93
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,310
pirates, extracting value from trade without
adding to its efficiency or volume.

94
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,810
So, the cartaz strategy sort of worked for
a while, but the Portuguese never really took

95
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,490
control of Indian Ocean trade. They were successful
enough that their neighbors, Spain, became

96
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,610
interested in their own route to the Indies,
and that brings us to Columbus.

97
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,699
But first, let’s dispel some myths:

98
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,240
One, Columbus and his crew knew the earth
was round. He was just wrong about the earth’s

99
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,319
size. Columbus used Ptolemy’s geography
and the Imago Mundi, based on Muslim scholarship

100
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,090
— and ended up overestimating the size of
Asia and underestimating the size of the oceans.

101
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,459
Two, Columbus never thought he’d made it
to China. He called the people he encountered

102
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,000
“Indians” because he thought that he’d
made it to the East Indies, what we know as

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,360
Indonesia.

104
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,180
And three, Columbus was not a lucky idiot.
He navigated completely unknown waters primarily

105
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,009
relying on a technique known as dead reckoning,
in which you figure out your position based

106
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,379
on three pieces of information: the direction
you’re going, your speed, and the time,

107
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:13,848
which you figure out via hourglass. With only
that technology to guide you, it's not actually

108
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:18,120
that easy to hit a continent. Come here, people
who are saying he didn’t hit a continent,

109
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,689
that he only hit some islands. Come here.
DAHHH!

110
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:28,589
Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?
An open letter to the Line of Demarcation.

111
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:33,779
But first, let’s see what’s in the secret
compartment today. Oh, its a globe. Thanks

112
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,269
Stan! Just what I always needed.

113
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:39,068
Dear Line of Demarcation, You have so much
to teach us about the way that the world used

114
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,979
to work, and the way that it works now. In
1494, Pope Alexander VI settled a dispute

115
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:50,279
between Portugal and Spain by dividing the
world into two parts: The Spanish part, and

116
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,318
the Portuguese part. This whole thing, at
least according to Pope Alexander VI, could

117
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,669
be split between Spain and Portugal.

118
00:07:56,668 --> 00:08:01,750
At least when it came to so-called unclaimed
land. I mean, unclaimed by whom? You know

119
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,079
all the American Indians were like, “wait,
this land is available? In, in that case,

120
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,139
we’ll just, we’ll just keep it. If it's
all the same to you.”

121
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,740
Anyway, Line of Demarcation, I have great
news for you. What Alexander VI did totally

122
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,240
worked. We haven’t had a problem since.

123
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
Best wishes, John Green

124
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,529
So, Columbus’s first journey (he made four,
the last three of which were pretty calamitous)

125
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:23,619
was tiny, and he initially landed on a small
Caribbean island he called San Salvador in

126
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,800
search, like the Portuguese, of Gold and Christians.
He was able to convince Ferdinand and Isabella

127
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,318
of Spain to fund his expedition by promising
riches and conversions of the natives, hopefully

128
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:34,559
to sign them up for yet another crusade.

129
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,309
And there’s a long-standing myth that Columbus
tricked Ferdinand and Isabella into paying

130
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,389
for his trip, but in fact they’d commissioned
two different sets of experts to analyze his

131
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:45,350
plans, both of which agreed, he was crazy.
One called the plan, “Impossible to any

132
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,360
educated person.”

133
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,470
But even so, Ferdinand and Isabella footed
the bill, partly because they were full of

134
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,040
Crusading zeal after expelling the Muslims
from Spain, and partly because they were desperate

135
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,159
to get their hands on some of that pepper
richness. Columbus, of course, failed at finding

136
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,909
riches — he returned with neither spices
nor gold. He did create some Christians, as

137
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:05,419
we’ll discuss in a future episode, but in
terms of goal accomplishment, Columbus was

138
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,059
much less successful than either Zheng He
or Vasco de Gama.

139
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:12,899
But within two generations of Columbus, Spain
would become fantastically wealthy, and for

140
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,879
a time they were the leading power in Europe.
Columbus’s voyages also had a huge, largely

141
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,450
negative, impact on the people the Spanish
encountered in the Americas. And excitingly

142
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,209
from my perspective, once Columbus returned
from San Salvador, we can speak for the first

143
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:29,049
time of a truly world history. Except for
you, Australia.

144
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:32,689
So who was the greatest mariner of the 15th
century? Well, as usual, it depends on your

145
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,029
definition of greatness. If you value administrative
competence over ill-advised adventure, than

146
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:40,958
Zheng He is certainly the winner. But the
reason we remember Columbus over him or Vasco

147
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,518
de Gama is that Columbus’s voyages had a
lasting impact on the world, even if it wasn’t

148
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,700
necessarily a positive one. And that makes
me wonder what kind of person you’d want

149
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,040
to be: A capable administrator and brilliant
sailor like Zheng He? A daring captain like

150
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,309
de Gama? Or the bearer of a complicated but
famous legacy like Columbus? Let me know in

Last week’s Phrase of the Week was, “You
smell pretty.” Thanks for that suggestion,

157
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,778

video that will be answered by our team of
historians. Thanks for watching Crash Course,
