00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,260
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re going to

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:08,719
be discussing trade here, in the Indian Ocean.
Oh, my globe had a globe! We’re gonna do

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,330
some new-school history where we talk about
a system instead of talking about individuals

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,949
or some boring boring dynasty — no, Stan,
not that kind of Dynasty — yes, that kind of dynasty.

5
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,619
So many world history classes still focus
on People Who Wore Funny Hats, and how their

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,080
antics shaped our lives, right? And while
it’s interesting and fun to note that, for

7
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,879
instance King Charles VI of France believed
that he was made out of glass, relentlessly focusing

8
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,859
on the actions of the Funny-Hatted-People who
ruled us makes us forget that we also make history.

9
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,768
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Did Charles VI of France
really believe that he was made out of glass?

10
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:43,869
Yes, he did, but today we’re talking about
Indian Ocean trade and it’s going to be

11
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:47,929
interesting, I promise. So pay attention.
ALSO, NO HATS! This is a classroom, not a

12
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:49,589
Truman Capote beach party!

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:58,630
[theme music]

14
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,660
So Indian Ocean trade was like the Silk Road,
in that it was a network of trade routes that

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,310
connected people who had stuff to people who
wanted it and were willing to pay for it.

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,420
And just as the Silk Road was not a single
road, there were lots of Indian Ocean trade

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,159
routes connecting various port cities around
the Indian Ocean Basin, including Zanzibar

18
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,868
and Mogadishu and Hormuz and Canton.

19
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:22,549
By the way, before you criticize my pronunciation,
please remember that mispronunciation is my

20
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,520
thing and I’ve been doing it since episode
one, and nobody ever notices that it’s a

21
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,349
thing! Sorry, I lost it there... But Indian
Ocean trade was bigger, richer, and featured

22
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:34,149
more diverse players than the Silk Road, but
it is much less famous probably because it

23
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:35,530
does not have a snazzy name.

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,530
What do you think, Stan? Like the “Neptunian
Network”? No. “The Wet Web”? No, that’s

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,509
definitely not it. “The Sexy Sea Lanes of
South Asia”? No, that’s too hard for me

26
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:48,159
to say with my lisp... “THE MONSOON MARKETPLACE!”
Thanks, Danica. And now the tyranny of dates:

27
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,700
By about 700 CE, there was a recognizable
Monsoon Marketplace, but it really blew up

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,429
between 1000 CE and 1200. It then declined
a bit during the Pax Mongolica, when overland

29
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:03,929
trade became cheap and safe, Thanks to-- wait
for it-- The Mongols. [Mongoltage] But then

30
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:08,229
Indian Ocean trade surged again in the 14th
and 15th centuries. So who was trading? Swahili

31
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:14,670
coast cities, Islamic empires in the Middle
East, India, China, Southeast Asia, and NOT

32
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,639
EUROPE, which is probably one of the reasons
that Monsoon Marketplace isn’t as famous

33
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,359
as it should be. Let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,300
So if you live in China, and you need some
ivory to make the handle for a sword, you

35
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,000
have to trade for it, because elephants only
live in India and Africa. One of the reasons

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,909
Indian Ocean trade took off is that there
were a wide range of resources available and

37
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:39,280
a wide range of import needs -- from ivory
to timber to books to grain. But the most

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,419
important thing was the wind.

39
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:45,839
The Indian Ocean is home to a set of very
special winds called Monsoons. You generally

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,250
hear about Monsoons in the context of rain
in India, but rather than thinking of Monsoons

41
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,460
as the rain itself, think of them as the wind
that bring a rainy season. The great thing

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,960
about seasons is that they come regularly
-- and so do the Monsoon winds. So if you

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,159
were a sailor, you could count on the wind
to bring you from Africa to India if you sailed

44
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,240
between April and September, and one that
would bring you back to Africa if you sailed

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,340
between November and February. In fact, these
winds were so predictable that early maritime

46
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,300
travel guides often listed ideal times of 
down to the week and sometimes even the day.

47
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,060
Predictable winds make trade a lot less risky:
Like, back in the day when the only power

48
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:29,259
for ships were sails and oarsmen, your cargo
might not arrive on time, or it might spoil,

49
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:34,479
or you might die, all of which are bad for
the health of global economic trade. But predictable

50
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,889
winds meant lower risk, which meant cheaper
trade, which meant more trade, which meant

51
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,829
more people could have awesome sword handles.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

52
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,320
Okay, there are a few more facets of Indian
Ocean trade worth mentioning. First, Indian

53
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,209
Ocean trade incorporated many more people
than participated in Silk Road trade. There

54
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,469
were Jewish people and people from Africa
to Malaysia and India and China, all sailing

55
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:59,060
around and setting up trading communities
where they would act as middle men, trying

56
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,039
to sell stuff for more than they bought it for and trying
to find new stuff to buy that they could sell later.

57
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,039
But despite this diversity, for the most part,
especially on the Western half of the Indian

58
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,349
Ocean basin, the trade was dominated by Muslim
merchants. Why? Largely because they had the

59
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,319
money to build ships, although we will see
that in the 15th century, the Chinese state

60
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,099
could have changed that balance completely.
By the way, I need to point out that when

61
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,810
I say that the trade was dominated by Muslim
merchants, the emphasis should be on the merchants-

62
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,899
not the Muslim or the dominated.

63
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:27,189
As previously noted, we tend to think that
states and governments and the funny-hatted

64
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:31,060
people who rule them are the real movers and
shakers in history, but that’s really not

65
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,339
the case. In the Indian Ocean, the terms of
trade were set by the merchants and by the

66
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:38,189
demands of the market, not by the whims of
political rulers. And the self-regulating

67
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:42,319
nature of that trade was remarkable and pretty
much unprecedented. I mean, the most amazing

68
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,120
thing is that, except for a few pirates, all
of this trade was peaceful!

69
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,879
For the better part of seven hundred years
these merchant ships were free to sail the

70
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,740
seas without the need for protection from
any state’s navy. This despite the fact

71
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,769
that some pretty valuable crap was being traded.
No, Thought Bubble, I meant that colloquially.

72
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:04,649
Alright, we need to do the open letter before
Thought Bubble tries more puns. Magic!

73
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,949
For today’s Open Letter, to further discuss
the relationship between merchants and nobles,

74
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:13,009
we’re going to go inland to Kashmir where
Kota Rani was the ruler until 1339. Mostly

75
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,399
I just love this story. But first, let’s
find out what’s in the Secret Compartment.

76
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,669
Oh, it’s Blowouts. Stan, are you asking
me to make a diarrhea joke? Because I’m

77
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,430
above that. I will, however, give you a party
blower solo.

78
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,829
Dear Kota Rani, So, you had a pretty crazy
life. First, when you were a kid you were

79
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,199
kidnapped by a rival noble who disguised his
army as a bunch of merchants. Then you were

80
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,949
forced to marry your kidnapper who was the
ruler of Kashmir, but, then he died. And then

81
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,339
you became the ruler and you were really good
at it and everything was going awesome and

82
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:46,529
you were lining things up for your sons, but
then some dude comes in and decides he’s

83
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:51,089
going to marry you and forces you to do it
by attacking you. And so what do you do? Immediately

84
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:55,339
after your second wedding you commit suicide
by slicing open your belly and offer your

85
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:59,629
intestines to your horrible new husband as
a wedding present. Oh, Stan. I don’t want

86
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:04,360
to say it but I have to; That really took
guts, Kota Rani! Sorry... And all this because

87
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,050
your father welcomed an army into his house
thinking they were merchants.

88
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,430
Best wishes, John Green

89
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,120
So, right. You wouldn’t let an army, or
a rival noble, into your house, but everyone

90
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,949
welcomes a merchant -- and not just royalty.
The great thing about seaborne trade is that

91
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:21,110
you can trade bulk goods like cotton cloth,
foodstuffs, and timber that’s all too heavy

92
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,020
to strap onto a camel or mule. So for the
first time we see the beginnings of goods

93
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:28,259
being traded for a mass market, instead of
just luxury goods, like silk for elites.

94
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,649
Wood, for instance, can be used to build houses
-- but it’s not all that plentiful in the

95
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:36,519
Arabian peninsula, however, when it becomes
cheaper thanks to trade, suddenly more people

96
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,899
can have better houses. Much of the timber
that was shipped in the Monsoon Marketplace

97
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,449
came from Africa, which is kind of emblematic.

98
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,789
Africa produced a lot of the raw materials
like animal hides and skin and ivory and gold.

99
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,760
The Swahili city states imported finished
goods such as silk and porcelain from China

100
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,810
and cotton cloth from India. Spices and foodstuffs
like rice were shipped from Southeast Asia

101
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,740
and especially Sri Lanka where black pepper
was a primary export good, and the Islamic

102
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,710
world provided everything from coffee to books
and weapons. But it wasn’t just products

103
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,899
that made their way around the eastern hemisphere
thanks to the Indian Ocean.

104
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,870
Technology spread, too. Like the magnetic
compass, which is kind of crucial if you like

105
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,540
to know where you’re going, came from China.
Muslim sailors popularized the astrolabe which

106
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,770
made it easier to navigate by the stars. Boats
using stern-post rudders were easier to steer,

107
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,870
so that technology quickly spread throughout
the Monsoon Marketplace. The Islamic world

108
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,870
also produced the triangular lateen sail,
which became super important because it allowed

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,918
for ships to tack against the wind. This meant
that a skilled crew could make their way through

110
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,579
the ocean even if they didn’t have a strong
tailwind. And just as with the Silk Road,

111
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,709
ideas also traveled in the Monsoon Marketplace.

112
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:39,269
For instance today, more Muslims live in Indonesia
than in any other country. And yes, I know

113
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:43,459
Indonesia has more than two islands. This
is not to scale, obviously. Knowing what you’ve

114
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,509
already learned about the growth of Islam
and the spread of trade, it won’t surprise

115
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,120
you to learn that Islam spread to Indonesia
via the Monsoon Marketplace. After the 1200s,

116
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,550
the region which had previously been heavily
influenced by the Indian religions of Hinduism

117
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,579
and Buddhism, like witness this temple, for
instance... became increasingly Islamic as

118
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:03,300
rulers and elites adopted the religion so
they could have religious as well as economic

119
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,478
ties to the people they were trading with.
The conversion of most of a region to Islam,

120
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,849
where it continues to flourish today is a
pretty big deal. But Islam didn’t spread

121
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,410
as effectively to the to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia
or Vietnam because they weren’t centers of trade.

122
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,270
How do you become a center for trade? Well,
let’s zoom in here to the strait of Malacca.

123
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:21,870
You can see how it could act as a choke point
for trade. Any city that controlled that strait

124
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,740
could stop the ships from going through it,
or more likely tax them. And that’s exactly

125
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,629
what happened, to such an extent that a powerful
merchant state called Srivijaya rose up on

126
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:33,119
Sumatra. And for a while, Srivijaya dominated
trade in the region, because there were so

127
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:37,240
many ships going through the Strait of Malacca
to and from China. But, as we’ll see in

128
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,788
another episode that this trade abruptly declined
in the 15th century. And with it, so did Srivijaya.

129
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,919
This brings up a key point about Indian Ocean
Trade, which is that it was indispensable

130
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,948
to the creation of certain city states, like
Srivijaya and the city states of the Swahili

131
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:54,839
Coast. Without trade, those places wouldn’t
have existed, let alone become wealthy and grand.

132
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,980
Trade was a huge source of wealth for these
cities because they could tax it; through

133
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,740
import and export duties or port fees. But
the fact that they are no longer powerful

134
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,879
shows that trade can be a pretty weak foundation
on which to built a polity, even a small one.

135
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,539
There are many reasons for this: like high
taxes can motivate traders to find other routes,

136
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:14,740
for instance, but the main one is this: Reliance
upon trade makes you especially vulnerable

137
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,539
to the peaks and troughs in the global economy.
The legacy of the merchant kingdom in Southeast

138
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,019
Asia is still alive and well in Singapore,
for instance. But one of the great lessons

139
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,350
of cities that have declined or disappeared
is that there’s usually a town nearby that’s

140
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,829
eager to take your place and happy to offer
lower taxes. It’s almost as if the merchants

141
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:34,989
decide where the people with the funny hats
go, rather than the other way around. Thanks

142
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,759
