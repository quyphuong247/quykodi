00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,778
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to learn

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:08,410
about the Roman Empire, which of course began
when two totally nonfictional twins, Romulus

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,530
and Remus, who’d been raised by wolves,
founded a city on seven hills.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:15,199
Mr Green, Mr Green, what… what does SPQR
stand for?

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,189
It means shut pie hole quickly, rapscallion.
No, it means Senātus Populusque Rōmānus,

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,280
one of the mottos of the Roman Republic.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,580
So today we’re going to do some old school
Great Man History and focus on Julius Caesar

8
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:31,679
while trying to answer a question: When, if
ever, is it OK to stab someone 23 times?

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:40,640
[Theme Music]

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,200
Shakespeare answers that question by saying
that Roman senators killed Caesar because

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,859
he was going to destroy the Roman republic, but
even if that’s true, we still have to answer whether:

12
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,839
a. The Roman Republic was worth preserving,
and

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,340
b. whether Caesar actually destroyed it.

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,399
One of the things that made the Roman republic
endure, both in reality and in imagination

15
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,879
was its balance. According to the Greek historian
Polybius, "THE THREE kinds of government,

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,939
monarchy, aristocracy and democracy, were
all found united in Rome. And… it was no easy

17
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:14,759
thing to determine with assurance, whether the entire
state was an aristocracy, a democracy, or a monarchy.”

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,660
At the heart of this blended system was the
Senate, a body of legislators chosen from

19
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,820
a group of elite families. (Rome was divided
into two broad classes: the Patricians – the

20
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:25,478
small group of aristocratic families and the
Plebeians, basically everybody else. The Senators

21
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:28,900
were drawn from the Patricians.) The Senate
was a sort of a mixture of legislature and

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,330
giant advisory council. Their main job was
to set the policy for the Consuls.

23
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,920
Each year the Senate would choose from among
its ranks 2 co-Consuls to serve as sort of

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,030
the chief executives of Rome. There needed
to be two so they could check each other’s

25
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,009
ambition, and also so that one could, you
know, take care of Rome domestically, while

26
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,469
the other was off fighting wars, and conquering
new territory.

27
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,039
There were two additional checks on power:
First, the one-year term. I mean, how much

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,729
trouble could you really do in a year, right?
Unless you’re the CEO of Netflix, I mean

29
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:57,978
he destroyed that company in like two weeks.

30
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:01,789
And secondly, once a senator had served as
consul, he was forbidden to serve as consul

31
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,520
again for at least 10 years. Although that
went a little bit like you say you’re only

32
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,649
going to eat one Chipotle burrito per week,
and then there are a few exceptions, and then

33
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,439
all of a sudden you’re there every day, and YES,
I know guacamole is more, JUST GIVE IT TO ME!

34
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,039
But right, we were talking about the Romans.
The Romans also had a position of dictator,

35
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,568
a person who would who’d take over in the
event the Republic was in imminent danger.

36
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:26,519
The paradigm for this selfless Roman ruler
was Cincinnatus, a general who came out of

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,340
comfortable retirement at his plantation,
took command of an army, defeated whatever

38
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,479
enemy he was battling, and then laid down
his command and returned to his farm, safe

39
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:41,810
in the knowledge that one day the second largest
city in Ohio would be named for him.

40
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,949
If that model of leadership sounds familiar
to Americans by the way, it’s because George

41
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:49,859
Washington was heavily influenced by Cincinnatus
when he invented the idea of a two term president.

42
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,120
So along comes Caesar. Gaius Ju- Gay-us? No
it’s Gaius, I know from Battlestar Galactica.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,909
Gaius Julius Caesar was born around 100 BCE
to one of Rome’s leading families. His birth

44
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:04,568
was somewhat miraculous, requiring a surgical
procedure that we know as Caesarian section.

45
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:07,589
Coming as he did from the senatorial class,
it was natural that Caesar would serve in

46
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,580
both the army and the Senate, which he did.
He rose through the ranks, and after some

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,709
top-notch generalling, and a gig as the governor
of Spain, he decided to run for consul.

48
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,810
In order to win, Caesar needed financial help,
which he got from Crassus, one of Rome’s

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,878
richest men. Crassus ran a private fire company
whose business model was essentially, “Hey,

50
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,949
I notice your house is on fire. Give me some
money and I’ll help you out with that.”

51
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:32,348
Caesar succeeded in becoming consul in 59
BCE and thereafter sought to dominate Roman

52
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:37,179
politics by allying himself with Crassus and
also with Rome’s other most powerful man,

53
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,219
the general Pompey. You’ll no doubt remember
Pompey from his fascination with Alexander

54
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,530
the Great. Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar were
the so-called first triumvirate, and the alliance

55
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,280
worked out super well, for Caesar. Not so
well for the other two. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,020
After a year as consul that included getting
the senate to pass laws largely because of

57
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,049
intimidation by Pompey’s troops, Caesar
landed the governorship of Gaul, at least

58
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,200
the southern part of Gaul that Rome controlled.
He quickly conquered the rest of Gaul and

59
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,658
his four loyal armies — or legions, as the
Romans called them — became his source of

60
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:12,058
power. Caesar continued his conquests, invading Britain
and waging another successful war against the Gauls.

61
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,780
While he was away, Crassus died in battle
with the Parthians and Pompey, who had become

62
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,358
Caesar’s rival and enemy, was elected Consul.
Pompey and the Senate decided to try to strip

63
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,408
Caesar of his command and recall him to Rome.
If he returned to Rome without an army, Caesar

64
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:30,528
would have been prosecuted for corrupt consuling
and also probably exceeding his authority

65
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:35,449
as governor, so instead he returned with the
13th Legion.

66
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,240
He crossed the Rubicon River, famously saying,
“The die is cast” or possibly, “Let

67
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:44,210
the die be cast.” Sorry, Thought Bubble,
sources disagree. Basically, Caesar was invading

68
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:48,609
his own hometown. Pompey was in charge of
Rome’s army but like a boss fled the city,

69
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,930
and by 48 BCE Caesar was in total command
of all of Rome’s holdings, having been named

70
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,468
both dictator and consul.

71
00:04:56,468 --> 00:05:00,610
Caesar set out to Egypt to track down Pompey
only to learn that he’d already been assassinated

72
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,629
by agents of the Pharaoh Ptolemy. Egypt had
its own civil war at the time, between the

73
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:10,509
Pharaoh and his sister/wife Cleopatra. Ptolemy
was trying to curry favor with Caesar by killing

74
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:17,348
his enemy, but Caesar was mad in that the-only-person-who-gets-to-tease-my-little-brother-is-me
kind of way, except with murder instead of

75
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:22,240
teasing. So Caesar sided with — and skoodilypooped
with — Cleopatra. Thank you, Thought Bubble.

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,028
Cleopatra went on to become the last Pharaoh
of Ancient Egypt and bet on Marc “I am the

77
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:32,098
Wrong Horse” Antony instead of Emperor “There
is a Baby Attached to My Leg” Augustus.

78
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,579
But before all that, Caesar made his way back
from Egypt to Rome, stopping off to defeat

79
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,728
a few kings in the east, and was declared
dictator again. That position that was later

80
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:41,740
extended for ten years, and then for life.

81
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:48,408
He was elected consul in 46 BCE and then again
in 45 BCE, this last time without a co-consul.

82
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:53,899
By 45 BCE Caesar was the undisputed master
of Rome and he pursued reforms that strengthened

83
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,809
his own power. He provided land pensions for
his soldiers, restructured the debts of a

84
00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:02,129
huge percentage of Rome’s debtors, and also
changed the calendar to make it look more

85
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,729
like the one we use today.

86
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:08,718
But by 44 BCE, many Senators had decided that
Caesar controlled too much of the power in

87
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:12,838
Rome, and so they stabbed him 23 times on
the floor of the Roman senate. Caesar was

88
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:16,288
duly surprised about this and everything,
but he never said, “Et Tu, Brute” when

89
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:20,318
he realized Brutus was one of the co-conspirators.
That was an invention of Shakespeare.

90
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
The conspirators thought that the death of
Caesar would bring about the restoration of

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,490
the Republic, and they were wrong. For one
thing, Caesar’s reforms were really popular

92
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,499
with the Rome’s people, who were quick to
hail his adopted son Octavian, as well as

93
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:36,909
his second-in-command Mark “I am the Wrong
Horse” Antony and a dude named Lepidus,

94
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,899
as a second triumvirate.

95
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:43,848
This triumvirate was an awesome failure, degenerating
into a second civil war. Octavian and Antony

96
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:48,288
fought it out. Antony, being the wrong horse,
lost. Octavian won, changed his name to Caesar

97
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:52,718
Augustus, became sole ruler of Rome, attached
a baby to his leg, adopted the title Emperor,

98
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:58,278
and started printing coins identifying himself
as Divini Filius: The Son of God. More on that next week.

99
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,998
Although Augustus tried to pretend that the
forms of the Roman republic were still intact,

100
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:05,379
the truth was that he made the laws and the
Senate had become nothing more than a rubber

101
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:11,789
stamp. Which reminds me, it’s time for the
open letter.

102
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:15,800
Movie magic! An open letter to the Roman Senate.
Oh, but first, let’s see what’s in the

103
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,059
secret compartment. Ah, it’s a harmonica!
Stan, do you want me to play some old, Roman

104
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:35,639
folk songs? Very well. Stan, I just want to thank
you for doing such a good job of overdubbing there.

105
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,639
Dear Roman Senate, Whether you were rubber
stamping the laws of Emperor Augustus, or

106
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:45,528
stabbing Caesar on the floor of your sacred
hall, you were always doing something! I don’t

107
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:49,610
want to sound nostalgic for a time when people
lived to be 30, a tiny minority of adults

108
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,319
could vote, and the best fashion choice was
bed-sheets, but oh my god, at least you did something!

109
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:59,538
Your senate was chosen from among the Patrician
class. Our senate here in the United States

110
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:03,759
is chosen from among the obstructionist class.
But don’t get me wrong, Roman senate, you

111
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,459
were terrible. Best wishes, John Green.

112
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,538
So did Caesar destroy the Republic? Well,
he started a series of civil wars, he seized

113
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:14,428
power for himself, he subverted the ideas
of the republic, he changed the constitution,

114
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:19,258
but he’s only really to blame if he was
the first one to do that. And he wasn’t.

115
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,949
Take the general Marius, for instance, who
rose to power on the strength of his generalship

116
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:28,059
and on his willingness to open up the army
to the poor, who were loyal to him personally,

117
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:33,250
and not to Rome, and whom he promised land
in exchange for their good service in the

118
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,318
army. This of course required the Romans to
keep conquering new land so they could keep

119
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:43,498
giving it to new legionnaires. Marius also
was consul 5 times in a row, 60 years before Caesar.

120
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,679
Or look at the general Sulla who, like Marius,
ensured that his armies would be more loyal

121
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,720
to him personally than to Rome, but who marched
against Rome itself, and then became its dictator,

122
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,759
executing thousands of people in 81 BCE, 30
years before Caesar entered the scene.

123
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,860
There is another way of looking at this question
altogether if we dispense with great man history.

124
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,440
Maybe Rome became an empire before it had
an emperor. Like, remember the Persian Empire?

125
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,589
You’ll recall that empire had some characteristics
that made it, imperial. Like a unified system

126
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:17,040
of government, continual military expansion,
and a diversity of subject peoples.

127
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,958
The Roman empire had all three of those characteristics
long before it became The Roman Empire. Like

128
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,628
Rome started out as a city, and then it became
a city state, then a kingdom, and then a Republic,

129
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:32,519
but that entire time, it was basically comprised
of the area around Rome.

130
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,318
By the 4th century BCE, Rome started to incorporate
its neighbors like the Latins and the Etruscans,

131
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:41,059
and pretty soon they had all of Italy under
their control, but that’s not really diversity

132
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:45,109
of subject peoples. I mean, nothing personal,
Italians, but you have a lot of things in

133
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,919
common, like the constant gesticulations.

134
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,789
If you want to talk about real expansion and
diversity, you’ve got to talk about the

135
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:54,059
Punic Wars. These were the wars that I remember,
primarily because they involved Hannibal crossing the

136
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:59,099
Alps with freaking war-elephants, which was probably
the last time that the elephants could have risen

137
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,320
up, and formed their awesome secret elephant
society with elephant planes and elephant cars.

138
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:07,859
In the First Punic War, Rome wanted Sicily,
which was controlled by the Carthaginians.

139
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,259
Rome won, which made Carthage cranky, so they
started the second Punic war. In 219 BCE,

140
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:16,350
Hannibal attacked a Roman town and then led
an army across Spain, and then crossed the

141
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,319
freaking Alps with elephants.

142
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:22,809
Hannibal and his elephant army almost won,
but alas, they didn’t, and as a result the

143
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:27,599
Romans got Spain. People in Spain are definitely
NOT Romans (despite Russell Crowe’s character

144
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,870
in Gladiator), which means that by 201 BCE
Rome was definitely an empire.

145
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,688
The third Punic War was a formality – Rome
found some excuse to attack Carthage and then

146
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:40,769
destroyed it so completely that these days
you can’t even find it on a map. Eventually

147
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:44,938
this whole area, and a lot more, would be
incorporated into a system of provinces and

148
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:48,149
millions of people would be ruled by the Roman
Empire.

149
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,269
And it’s ridiculous to say that Rome was
a Republic until Augustus became Rome’s

150
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:55,899
first official emperor, because by the time
he did that, Rome had been an empire for almost

151
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:59,778
200 years. There's a reason I'm arguing that
the death of the Republic came long before

152
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:03,318
Caesar and probably around the time that Rome
became an Empire.

153
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:07,019
If anything destroyed the idea of Republican
Rome, it was the concentration of power into

154
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,240
the hands of one man. And this man was always
a general. I mean, you can’t march on Rome

155
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,250
without an army, after all. Why were there
such powerful generals? Because Rome had decided

156
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,990
to become an Empire, and empires need to expand
militarily. Particularly, the Roman empire

157
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,000
needed to expand militarily because it always
needed new land to give its retired legionnaires.

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,490
That expansion created the all-powerful general
and the incorporation of diverse peoples made

159
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:35,060
it easier for them to be loyal to him, rather
than to some abstract idea of the Republic.

160
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:38,568
Julius Caesar didn’t create emperors: Empire
created them.

161
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:42,099
Next week we’ll be discussing Christianity,
so that shouldn’t be controversial. Until

162
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,930
then, thanks for watching.

163
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:47,559
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

164
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,339
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself and our graphics

165
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,740
team is Thought Bubble.

166
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,278
Last week's Phrase of the Week was "Pre-Distressed
Designer Jeans" If you want to guess at this

167
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,049
week’s Phrase of the Week or suggest future
ones, you can do so in Comments where you

168
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:03,500
can also ask questions about today’s video
which our team of historians will endeavor to answer.

169
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,100
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.

170
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,559
Whoah… Geez! Yikes! Everything is fine!
