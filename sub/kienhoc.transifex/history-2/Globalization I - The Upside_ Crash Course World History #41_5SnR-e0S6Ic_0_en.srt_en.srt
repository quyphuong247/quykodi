00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,059
Hi, I’m John Green. This is Crash Course
World History and today is the penultimate

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,879
episode of Crash Course. We’re gonna talk
about globalization.

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,939
This was going to be the last episode, but
I just can’t quit you, World Historians.

4
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:13,689
So, today we’re going to talk about globalization,
and in doing so, we’re going to talk about

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,238
why we study history at all.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,100
Ooh ooh, Mr. Green!

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,020
Yes, Me from the Past?

8
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:20,320
We study history to get a good
grade to go to a good college to get a good job --

9
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,809
--so you can make more money
than you would otherwise make and be a slightly

10
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:27,259
larger cog among the seven billion gears that
turn the planet’s economic engine, right?

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,440
And that’s fine, but if that’s why you
really study history, then you need to understand

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,988
all the ways that the t-shirt you’re wearing
is both the cause and result of your ambition.

13
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:41,968
This t-shirt contains the global economy:
its efficiency, its massive surplus, its hyperconnectedness,

14
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,808
and its unsustainability. This t-shirt tells
one story of globalization. So let’s follow it.

15
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:55,699
[Theme Music]

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,260
So, globalization is a cultural phenomenon.
It’s reflected in contemporary artwork and

17
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,728
population migration and linguistic changes,
but we’re going to focus, as we so often

18
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:05,469
have during Crash Course, on trade.

19
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:11,549
So the world today, as symbolized by our international
felt melange, experiences widespread global

20
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,469
economic interdependence. Now, of course economic
interdependence and the accompanying cultural

21
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:19,890
borrowing are nothing new. You’ll remember
that we found trade documents from the Indus

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,530
Valley civilization all the way in Mesopotamia.

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,780
But for a few reasons, the scale of this trade
has increased dramatically:

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,200
1. Multinational corporations have global
reach and increasing power.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,859
2. Travel and shipping are cheap and safe.
It took about two months to cross the Atlantic

26
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,599
in 1800. Today it takes about five hours by
plane, and less than a week by ship.

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,949
3. Governments have decreased tariffs and
regulations on international trade, leading

28
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,170
to what is sometimes called euphemistically
”free trade.” To which I say, if this

29
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,710
trade is so free, how come BBC America is
in the premium tier of my cable package?

30
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,390
To understand the role that governments play
in international trade, let’s look again

31
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,890
at this t-shirt. This t-shirt, like most t-shirts
made in the world, contains 100% American

32
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,000
cotton. And that’s not because the U.S.
makes the best cotton or the most efficient

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,409
cotton, it’s because the U.S. government
subsidizes cotton production. And that’s

34
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,009
what makes this cotton cheaper than cotton
of similar quality from Brazil or India. But

35
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,669
in the last 30 years, the US’s share of
cotton exports has gone down as Brazil, India,

36
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,759
and Africa’s cotton exports go up. And that
trend will likely continue as the US moves

37
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:22,389
away from its expensive cotton subsidies.
In fact, these days it’s already possible

38
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:28,209
to find t-shirts with Brazilian, Indian, or Ugandan cotton,
or a mixture of cottons from all around the world.

39
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,439
But because the American government doesn’t
subsidize industry in the way it does agricultural

40
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:36,689
production, the actual spinning and weaving
of the cotton takes place in lower wage countries:

41
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:43,000
Mexico, Guatemala, Vietnam, China, India,
China, China, sometimes even China. And then the

42
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,080
finished shirts, called blanks, are usually sent to Europe 
or the United States for screen printing, and then sold.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,060
You would think the most expensive part of
this process is the part where we ship this

44
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,390
across the Pacific Ocean, turn it into this,
and then ship it back across the Pacific Ocean,

45
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:02,579
but you’d be wrong. Wholesale t-shirt blanks
can cost as little as $3; the expense is in

46
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,719
the printing, the retail side of things, and
paying the designer at Thought Bubble who

47
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,240
was tasked with the difficult job of creating
a Mongol who is at once cute and terrifying.

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,450
So contemporary global trade is pretty anarchic
and unregulated, at least by international

49
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:19,459
institutions and national governments. Much
of this has to do with academic economists,

50
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,629
mostly in the U.S. and Europe who have argued
with great success that governmental regulation

51
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:27,810
diminishes prosperity by limiting growth.
Now, some nations-- in Latin America, the

52
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,939
Caribbean, and Africa-- haven’t been particularly
keen to pursue free trade but they’ve been

53
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:36,329
bullied into it by larger economies with whom
they desperately need to trade.

54
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,989
So in the past 30 years, we’ve seen all
these emerging markets lowering their tariffs,

55
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,270
getting rid of regulation, and privatizing
formerly state-run businesses. And they often

56
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,989
do that to appease the International Monetary
Fund, which offers low interest loans to developing

57
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,840
world economies with the motto: Many Strings
Attached.

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,800
Now, whether these decreased regulations have
been a net positive for these developing world

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,050
economies is a subject of much debate, and
we will wade into it but not until next week.

60
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,069
First, we need to understand more about the
nature of this trade. So you’ll remember

61
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:07,179
from the Industrial Revolution episode that
industrial western powers produced most of

62
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,110
the manufactured goods, which were then sold
in international markets, but you’ll also

63
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,189
remember that domestic consumption was extremely
important. I mean, almost all early Model

64
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,719
T’s were built by Americans, and bought
by Americans.

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,710
But since the 1960s, and especially today,
former non-industrialized parts of the world

66
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:29,659
had been manufacturing consumer goods-- for
domestic markets, yes, but primarily for foreign

67
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,470
ones. This t-shirt, made in China and the
Dominican Republic before being imported to

68
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,160
Mexico and then to the United States, is a
primary example of what I’m talking about,

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,380
but so is the computer that you’re watching
me on. Your computer was probably manufactured

70
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,879
in China, but with parts from all over the
world, especially Taiwan, Japan and South

71
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,500
Korea.

72
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,029
And this international manufacturing is always
finding, like, new markets too. Like, Brazil,

73
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:56,189
for instance, has a huge technology sector.
They make iPads there, actually. Sorry, I’m

74
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:58,879
trying to play Angry Birds. But, what all
these countries have in common is that while

75
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,019
there is a domestic market for things like
iPads and t-shirts, the foreign markets are

76
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:10,209
much, much bigger. Oh, it’s time for the
Open Letter?

77
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,659
An open letter to Cookie Monster. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

78
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,400
today. Oh, it’s a cookie dough flavored
Balance Bar. For people who love cookies and

79
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,739
pretending to be healthy.

80
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,040
Dear Cookie Monster, Here’s the thing, man.
You don’t have a stomach. That’s why when

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,020
you put a cookie in your mouth, it crumbles
up and then it just falls out of your mouth.

82
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:30,698
But here’s what fascinates me, Cookie Monster.
I believe you when you say you love cookies.

83
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,079
It doesn’t matter that you can’t actually
eat cookies because where you would have a

84
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,728
stomach, you instead have someone’s arm.
And that, Cookie Monster, is what makes you

85
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:44,349
a beautiful symbol for contemporary consumption.
You just keep eating. Even though you can’t

86
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,850
eat. Cookie Monster, you are the best and
the worst of us.

87
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,379
Best wishes, John Green

88
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,339
So, although die-hard Marxists might still
resist this, by 2012 it’s become pretty

89
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,990
obvious that global capitalism has been good
for a lot of people. It's certainly increased

90
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,889
worldwide economic output. And while American
autoworkers may suffer job loss, moving manufacturing

91
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:08,228
jobs from high wage to lower wage countries
allows a greater number of people to live

92
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:12,719
better than they did when the First and Second
Worlds monopolized manufacturing. And while

93
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,080
I don’t want to conflate correlation and
causation, some 600 million people have emerged

94
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,668
from poverty in the last 30 years, at least
according to the World Bank’s definition

95
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:24,430
of poverty, which is living on less than $1.25
a day.

96
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,379
Americans can argue about whether absurdly
inexpensive clothes, shoes and televisions

97
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,680
are worth the domestic economic and social
dislocation, but for the Vietnamese worker

98
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,750
stitching a pair of sneakers, that job represents
an opportunity for a longer, healthier and

99
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,439
more secure life than she would have had if
those shoes were made in the U.S.A.

100
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,379
But, before we jump on the celebratory globalization
bandwagon, let’s acknowledge that this brave

101
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:50,909
new world has some side effects. For instance,
it maybe hasn’t been so good for families,

102
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,169
it definitely has not been good for the environment,
and also there’s a chance that globalization

103
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:59,728
will spark, like, the end of the human species.
But, we’re gonna talk about all that next

104
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:04,189
week. For today, let’s bring on the bandwagon
and ride straight for the Thought Bubble.

105
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,740
So these days, people move more than they
ever have. 21% of people living in Canada

106
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,519
were born somewhere else, as was an astonishing
69% of Kuwait’s current population.

107
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,339
Migration has become easier because:

108
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,700
1. Air travel is pretty cheap, especially if
you only take a few plane trips in your life, and

109
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,719
2. It’s relatively easy and inexpensive
to stay in touch with relatives living far

110
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,910
away thanks to Skype, mobile phones, and inexpensive
calling cards. Also

111
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,479
3. Even with increased industrialization in
the developing world, economic opportunities

112
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,449
are often much better in wealthy countries.
Remittances-- money sent home by people working

113
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,728
abroad-- are now a huge driver of economic
growth in the developing world. Like, in Tajikistan,

114
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:49,120
for instance, remittances are 35% of the country’s
total gross domestic product.

115
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,600
With all these people moving around the world,
it’s not surprising that globalization also

116
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,699
means cultural blending. When people move,
they don’t just give up their literary,

117
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,830
culinary, artistic, and musical traditions.
Globalized culture is a bit of a paradox,

118
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:05,990
though, because some people see culture today
as increasingly Americanized, right? Like,

119
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,490
FRIENDS is currently broadcast in over 100
countries; you can find Diet Coke for sale

120
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,519
deep in the jungles of Madagascar; the NBA
is huge in China. There are fewer languages

121
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,740
spoken today, and probably less cultural diversity.

122
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,129
But on the other hand, an individual’s access
to diverse cultural experience has never been

123
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:28,339
greater. Bollywood movies, Swedish hip hop,
Brazilian soap operas, highlights from Congolese

124
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,199
football matches, these are all available
to us. Culinary cultural fusion is all the

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,890
rage; more novels are translated from languages
than ever before, although few are actually

126
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:43,769
read; and in the surest sign of cultural globalization,
football, the world’s game, has finally

127
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:49,708
reached America, where broadcasts of the greatest
collective enterprise humanity has ever known,

128
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,869
Liverpool Football Club, got record ratings
in 2012. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

129
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:59,879
Hey, one last request: Could you put me in
a Liverpool jersey? On the pitch at Anfield?

130
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:05,080
Raising the premier league trophy? WITH STEVEN
GERRARD HUGGING ME? YES, JUST LIKE THAT. OH,

131
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,170
THOUGHT BUBBLE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

132
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:11,490
Okay, so this all brings us to how globalization
has changed us, and whether it’s for the

133
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,470
better. Assuming you make the minimum wage
here in the United States, this t-shirt, purchased

134
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,889
at your friendly neighborhood e-tailer dftba.com,
will cost you about three hours’ worth of

135
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,679
work-- and yes, that does include shipping.
By the time it arrives at your door, the cotton

136
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,609
within that t-shirt will have traveled by
truck, train, ship, possibly even airplane

137
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,750
if you opt for priority shipping. And it will
probably have travelled further than Magellan

138
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,159
did during his famous circumnavigation of
the globe. You get all that for THREE HOURS

139
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:44,179
of work; by contrast, a far less comfortable
garment several hundred years ago would have

140
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:46,409
cost you ten times as much work.

141
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:50,969
But these improvements have been accompanied
by change so radical that we struggle to contextualize

142
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:58,470
it. Like, the human population of our planet
over time looks like this. Dang. Like, in

143
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,480
1800, there were a billion human beings on this planet.
And that was more than had ever been seen before.

144
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,539
And we live more than twice as long on average
as humans did just two centuries ago, largely

145
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:12,419
due to improved health care for women in childbirth
and their infants, but also thanks to antibiotics

146
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,049
and the second agricultural revolution that
began in the 1950s, the so-called “green

147
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:22,079
revolution” that saw increased use of chemical
fertilizers lead to dramatically higher crop yields.

148
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,110
Of course, these gains haven’t been evenly
distributed around the world, but chances

149
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,419
are if you’re watching this, you A. survived
childbirth and B. feel reasonably confident

150
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,379
that your children will as well. That’s
a new feeling for humans. And as a parent,

151
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,639
I can assure you, it’s a miracle, and one
to be celebrated.

152
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,309
We study history so that we can understand
these changes, and so that we can remember

153
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:46,609
both what we’ve gained and lost in getting
to where we are. Next week, our last week,

154
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,720
we’ll look at the many facets of globalization
that aren’t causes for celebration. But

155
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,889
for today, let’s just pause to consider
how we got from here to here, how the relentless

156
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:01,699
and unquenchable ambition of humans led to
a world where the entire contents of the Library

157
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,080
of Alexandria would fit on my iPhone along
with recordings of everything Mozart ever

158
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,019
composed. In such a world, it’s easy to
feel that we are big and powerful, maybe even

159
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:18,059
invincible. It’s easy to feel that... and also dangerous.
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

160
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,719

163
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:31,769
Last week’s phrase of the week was “Crush
Those Rebels.” If you want to suggest future

164
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:35,389
phrases of the week or guess at this week’s,
you can do so in comments where you can also

165
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:38,629
ask questions about today’s video that will
be answered by our team of historians.

166
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:42,559
Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we
say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
