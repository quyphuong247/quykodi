00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,559
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History, and today we're gonna discuss 19th

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,599
century imperialism. So the 19th century certainly
didn't invent the empire, but it did take

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:13,149
it to new heights, by which we mean lows,
or possibly heights, I dunno, I can't decide,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,720
roll the intro while I think about it.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:23,359
[theme music]

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,980
Yeah, I don't know, I'm still undecided. Let's
begin with China! When last we checked in,

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,660
China was a thriving manufacturing power,
about to be overtaken by Europe, but still

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,320
heavily involved in world trade, especially
an importer of silver from the Spanish empire.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,399
Europeans had to use silver because they didn't
really produce anything else the Chinese wanted,

10
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,039
and that state of affairs continued through
the 18th century. For example, in 1793, the

11
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,000
Macartney Mission tried to get better trade
conditions with China and was a total failure.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,509
Here's the Qianlong Emperor's well known response
to the British: "Hither to all European nations

13
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:56,378
including your own country's barbarian merchants
have carried on their trade with our celestial

14
00:00:56,378 --> 00:01:01,488
empire at Canton. Such has been the procedure
for many years, although our celestial empire

15
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:07,608
possesses all things in prolific abundance
and lacks no product within its own borders."

16
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:12,319
But then Europeans, especially the British,
found something that the Chinese would buy:

17
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,659
opium. By the 1830s, British free trade policy
unleashed a flood of opium in China, which

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,299
threatened China's favorable balance of trade.
It also created a lot of drug addicts.

19
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,810
And then in 1839 the Chinese responded to
what they saw as these unfair trade practices

20
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,460
with...a stern letter that they never actually
sent. Commissioner Lin Zexu drafted a response

21
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:35,548
that contained a memorable threat to "cut
off trade in rhubarb, silk, and tea, all valuable

22
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,689
products of ours without which foreigners
could not live."

23
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:42,699
But even if the British had received this
terrifying threat to their precious rhubarb

24
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:47,000
supply, they probably wouldn't have responded
because selling drugs is super lucrative.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,950
So the Chinese made like tea partiers, confiscating
a bunch of British opium and chucking it into

26
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,799
the sea. And then the British responded to
this by demanding compensation, and access

27
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,390
to Chinese territory where they could carry
out their trade.

28
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,599
And then the Chinese were like, "Man that
seems a little bit harsh," whereupon the British

29
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,929
sent in gunships, opening trade with Canton
by force.

30
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,830
Chinese General Yijing made a counter attack
in 1842 that included a detailed plan to catapult

31
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,770
flaming monkeys onto British ships. Stan,
is that true?

32
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,800
All right, apparently the plans actually involved
strapping fireworks to monkeys' backs and

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,620
were never carried out, but still!

34
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,959
Slightly off topic: obviously I don't want
anyone to light monkeys on fire. I'm just

35
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,729
saying that flaming monkeys lend themselves
to a lot of great band names, like the Sizzling

36
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:33,090
Simians, Burning Bonobos, Immolated Marmoset...Stan,
sometimes I feel like I should give up teaching

37
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,430
world history and just become a band name
generator. That's my real gift.

38
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,439
Anyway, due to lack of monkey fireworks, the
Chinese counterattacks were unsuccessful,

39
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,199
and they eventually signed the treaty of Nanjing,
which stated that Britain got Hong Kong and

40
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,189
five other treaty ports, as well as the equivalent
of two billion dollars in cash. Also, the

41
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,378
Chinese basically gave up all sovereignty
to European spheres of influence, wherein

42
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,959
Europeans were subject to their laws, not
Chinese laws.

43
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,810
In exchange for all of this, China got a hot
slice of nothing. You might think the result

44
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,060
of this war would be a shift in the balance
of trade in Britain's favor, but that wasn't

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,400
immediately the case. In fact, the British
were importing so much tea from China that

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,170
the trade deficit actually rose more than
30 billion dollars.

47
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:13,469
But eventually after another war and one of
the most destructive civil rebellions in Chinese

48
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:18,189
and possibly world history, the Taiping Rebellion,
the situation was reversed, and Europeans,

49
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:21,609
especially the British, became the dominant
economic power in China.

50
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,950
Okay. So but when we think about the 19th
century imperialism, we usually think about

51
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:30,149
the way that Europe turned Africa from this
[map] into this [map], the so-called scramble

52
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,980
for Africa. Speaking of scrambles and the
European colonization of Africa, you know

53
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,399
what they say--sometimes to make an omelette,
you have to break a few eggs. And sometimes,

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,120
you break a lot of eggs and you don't get
an omelette.

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,908
Europeans have been involved in Africa since
the 16th century, when the Portuguese used

56
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:47,729
their cannons to take control of cities on
coast to set up their trading post empire,

57
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,908
but in the second half of the 19th century,
Europe suddenly and spectacularly succeeded

58
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:54,959
at colonizing basically all of Africa. Why?

59
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,438
Well, the biggest reason that Europeans were
able to extend their grasp over so much of

60
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:02,978
the world was the same reason they wanted
to do so in the first place: industrialization.

61
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,399
Nationalism played its part, of course. European
states saw it as a real bonus to be able say

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,900
that they had colonies--so much so, that a
children's rhyme in An ABC for Baby Patriots

63
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,579
went, "C is for colonies. Rightly we boast.
That of all great countries Great Britain has the most."

64
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,560
But it was mostly, not to get all Marxist
on you or anything, about controlling the

65
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:28,168
means of production. Europeans wanted colonies
to secure sources of raw materials, especially

66
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:33,519
cotton, copper, iron, and rubber, that were
used to fuel their growing industrial economies.

67
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,799
And in addition to providing the motive for
imperialism, European industrialization also

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,819
provided the means. Europeans didn't fail
to take over territory in Africa until the

69
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,680
late 19th century because they didn't want to; they failed
because they couldn't. This was mostly due to disease.

70
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,079
Unlike in the Americas, Africans weren't devastated
by diseases like smallpox because they'd had

71
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,019
smallpox for centuries and were just as immune
to it as Europeans were. Not only that, but

72
00:04:56,019 --> 00:05:00,639
Africa had diseases of its own, including
yellow fever, malaria, and sleeping sickness,

73
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,560
all of which killed Europeans in staggering
numbers.

74
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,780
Also, nagana was a disease endemic to Africa
that killed horses, which made it difficult

75
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:11,489
for Europeans to take advantage of African
grasslands, and also difficult for them to

76
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,300
get inland, because their horses would die
as they tried to carry stuff.

77
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,770
Also, while in the 16th century Europeans
did have guns, they were pretty useless, especially

78
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:23,649
without horses. So most fighting was done
the old-fashioned way, with swords. That worked

79
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:27,049
pretty well in the Americas, unless you were
the Incas or the Aztecs, but it didn't work

80
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,590
in Africa, because the Africans also had swords.
And spears, and axes.

81
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:35,609
So as much as they might have wanted to colonize
Africa in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries,

82
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,770
Africa's mosquitoes, microbes, and people
were too much for them.

83
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,819
So what made the difference? Technology.

84
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:46,079
First, steam ships made it possible for Europeans
to travel inland, bringing supplies and personnel

85
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,579
via Africa's navigable rivers. No horses?
No problem.

86
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:53,439
Even more important was quinine medicine,
sometimes in the form of tonic water, mixed

87
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:57,650
into refreshing quintessentially British gin
and tonics. Quinine isn't as effective as

88
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:02,029
modern antimalarial medication, and it doesn't
cure the disease, but it does help moderate its effects.

89
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,318
But of course the most important technology
that enabled Europeans to dominate Africa

90
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,229
was guns. By the 19th century, European gun
technology had improved dramatically, especially

91
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:15,899
with the introduction of the Maxim machine
gun, which allowed Europeans to wipe out Africans

92
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,979
in battle after battle. Of course, machine
guns were effective when wielded by Africans,

93
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,860
too, but Africans had fewer of them.

94
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,720
Oh, it's time for the open letter? And my
chair is back!

95
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:31,919
An open letter to Hiram Maxim. But first, let's
see what's in the secret compartment today.

96
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,699
Oh, it's Darth Vader! What a great
reminder of imperialism.

97
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,531
Dear Hiram Maxim, I hate you. It's not so
much that you invented the Maxim machine gun,

98
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,160
although obviously that's a little bit problematic,
or even that you look like the poor man's

99
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:48,909
Colonel Sanders. First off, you're a possible
bigamist. I have a long standing opposition

100
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,300
to bigamy. Secondly, you were born an American
but became a Brit, thereby metaphorically

101
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,228
machine gunning our founding fathers. But
most importantly, among your many inventions

102
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:02,579
was the successful amusement park ride, the
Captive Flying Machine. Mr. Maxim, I hate

103
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:06,948
the Captive Flying Machine. The Captive Flying
Machine has resulted in many a girlfriend

104
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,049
telling me that I'm a coward. I'm not a coward,
I just don't want to die up there! It's all

105
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:14,319
your fault, Hiram Maxim, and nobody
believes your story about the light bulb.

106
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,939
Best wishes, John Green.

107
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:20,029
All right. So, here is something that often
gets overlooked. European imperialism involved

108
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:24,659
a lot of fighting and a lot of dying. And
when we say that Europe came to dominate Africa,

109
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,630
for the most part that domination came through
wars, which killed lots of Africans and also

110
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,579
lots of Europeans, although most of them died
from disease. It's very, very important to

111
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:39,359
remember that Africans did not meekly acquiesce
to European hegemony: they resisted, often

112
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,960
violently, but ultimately they were defeated
by a technologically superior enemy.

113
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,759
In this respect, they were a lot like the
Chinese, and also the Indians, and the Vietnamese,

114
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,019
and -- you get the picture.

115
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:53,029
So by the end of the 19th century, most of
Africa and much of Asia had been colonized

116
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:57,469
by European powers. I mean, even Belgium got in on it,
and they weren't even a country at the beginning

117
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,000
of the 19th century. I mean, Belgium has enjoyed
like, 12 years of sovereignty in the last 3 millennia.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,199
Notable exceptions include Japan, which was
happily pursuing its own imperialism, Thailand,

119
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,299
Iran, and of course Afghanistan. Because no
one can conquer Afghanistan,

120
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,240
unless you are -- wait for it -- the Mongols.
[Mongoltage]

121
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,400
It's tempting to imagine Europe ruling their
colonies with the proverbial topaz fist, and while

122
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,359
there was always the threat of violence, the truth is a
lot more complicated. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

123
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
In most cases, Europeans ruled their colonies
with the help of, and sometimes completely

124
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,180
through, intermediaries and collaborators.
For example, in the 1890s in India, there

125
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:41,079
were fewer than 1,000 British administrators
supposedly ruling over 300 million Indians.

126
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,639
The vast majority of British troops at any
given time in India, more than two-thirds,

127
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,879
were in fact Indians under the command of
British officers.

128
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,320
Because of their small numbers relative to local
populations, most European colonizers resorted

129
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,160
to indirect rule, relying on governments that were
already there but exerting control  over their leaders.

130
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,819
Frederick Lugard, who was Britain's head honcho
in Nigeria for a time, called this "rule through

131
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,320
and by the natives." This worked particularly
well with British administrators, who were

132
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,480
primarily middle class men but had aristocratic
pretensions, and were often pleased to associate

133
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,029
with the highest echelons of Indian or African
society.

134
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,179
Now, this isn't to say that indigenous rulers
were simply puppets. Often, they retained

135
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,380
real power. This was certainly true in India,
where more than a third of the territory was

136
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:29,689
ruled by Indian princes. The French protectorates
of Morocco and Tunisia were ruled by Arab

137
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,980
monarchs, and the French also ruled through
native kings in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

138
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,159
For the most part, Europeans could almost
always rely on their superior military technology

139
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:43,669
to coerce local rulers into doing what the
Europeans wanted. And they could replace native

140
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:48,559
officials with Europeans if they had to. But
in general, they preferred to rule indirectly.

141
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,619
It was easier and cheaper. Also, less malaria.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

142
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:57,159
So while we can't know why all native princes
who ruled in the context of European imperialism

143
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:00,929
put up with it, we can make some pretty good
guesses. First of all, they were still rulers.

144
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:04,729
They got to keep their prestige and their
fancy hats, and to some extent their power.

145
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,610
Many were also able to gain advantages through
their service, like access to European education

146
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,159
for themselves and for their children. Mahatma
Gandhi, for instance, was the son of an Indian

147
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,299
high official, which made it possible for
him to study law in England.

148
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,069
And we can't overlook the sheer practicality
of it. The alternative was to resist, and

149
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,510
that usually didn't work out well. I'm reminded
of the famous couplet, "Whatever happens,

150
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:26,419
we have got the Maxim gun, and they have not."

151
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:30,439
But even with this enormous technological
advantage, it wasn't always easy. For example,

152
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,820
it took 25 years, from 1845 to 1870, for the
British to fully defeat the Maori on New Zealand

153
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:40,189
because the Maori were kick-ass fighters who
had mastered musketry and defensive warfare.

154
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,250
And I will remind you, it is not cursing if
you're talking about donkeys.

155
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,389
In fact, it took them being outnumbered three-to-one
with the arrival of 750,000 settlers for the

156
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:53,740
Maori to finally capitulate. And I will remind you that the
rule against splitting infinitives is not an actual rule.

157
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,440
Those of you more familiar with U.S. history
might notice a parallel between the Maori

158
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,600
and some of the Native American tribes, like the
Apaches and the Lakota, a good reminder that the

159
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,080
United States did some imperial expansion of its own
as part of its nationalizing project in the 19th century.

160
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,220
But back to Africa. Sometimes African rulers
were so good at adapting European technology

161
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,860
that they were able to successfully resist
imperialism. Ethiopia's Menelik II defeated

162
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,250
the Italians in battle, securing not just
independence but an empire of his own.

163
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,600
But embracing European-style modernization
could also be problematic, as Khedive Ismail

164
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,540
of Egypt found out during his rule in the
late 19th century. He celebrated his imperial

165
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:32,949
success by commissioning an opera, Giuseppe
Verdi's Aida, for the opening of the Cairo

166
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,470
Opera House in 1871. Giuseppe Verdi, by the
way -- no relation to John Green.

167
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,339
And Ismail had ambitions of extending Egypt's
control up the Nile, west toward Lake Chad.

168
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,720
But to do that, he needed money, and that's
where he got into trouble. His borrowing bankrupted

169
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,660
Egypt and led to Britain's taking control
over the country's finances and its shares

170
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:54,519
in the Suez Canal that Ismail had built, with
French engineers and French capital, in 1869.

171
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,740
The British sent in 1,300 bureaucrats to fix
Egypt's finances, an invasion of red tape

172
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,399
that led to a nationalist uprising, which
brought on a full-scale British intervention

173
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,409
after 1881 in order to protect British interests.

174
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:10,230
This business imperialism, as it is sometimes
known, is really at the heart of the imperialistic

175
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,389
impulse. Industrialized nations push economic
integration upon developing nations, and then

176
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:19,600
extract value from those developing nations,
just as you would from a mine or a field you owned.

177
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,040
And here we see political history and economic
history coming together again. As western

178
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:28,349
corporations grew in the latter part of the
19th century, their influence grew as well,

179
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,528
both in their home countries and in the lands
where they were investing.

180
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:35,299
But ultimately, whether the colonizer is a
business enterprise or a political one, the

181
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:39,799
complicated legacy of imperialism survives.
It's why your bananas are cheap, why your

182
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:44,919
call centers are Indian, why your chocolate comes 
from Africa, and why everything else comes from China.

183
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,759
These imperialistic adventures may have only
lasted a century, but it was the century in

184
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,740
which the world as we know it today began
to take shape.

185
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,159
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

186
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,299
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson,

187
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:03,490
the show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics

188
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,409
team is Thought Bubble. Oh, our intern! I'm
sorry, Meredith the Intern. Our intern is Meredith Danko.

189
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,879
Last week's Phrase of the Week was "homogeneous
mythologized unitary polity." Thank you for

190
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,309
that suggestion. If you want to guess this
week's Phrase of the Week or suggest future

191
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:19,369
ones, you can do so in comments, where you
can also ask questions about today's video

192
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,389
that will be answered by our team of historians.

193
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:24,190
Thanks for watching Crash Course. Remember,
you can get this shirt, the Mongol shirt,

194
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,970
or our poster at dftba.com. Speaking of which, as
we say in my hometown, "Don't Forget to be Awesome."
