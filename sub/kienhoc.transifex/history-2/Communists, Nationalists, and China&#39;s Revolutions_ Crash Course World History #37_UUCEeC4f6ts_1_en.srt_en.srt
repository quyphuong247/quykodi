1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,200
Hi I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to return

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:07,320
— sadly for the last time on Crash Course
— to China.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,780
By the way, Stan brought cupcakes. That’s
good. I wish I could draw some parallel between

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,859
this and China, but I got nothing. It’s
just delicious.

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:18,699
I’ll sure miss you, piece of felt Danica
cut out in the shape of China using blue because

6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:20,079
we felt red would be cliché.

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,439
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr Green!

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,160
You don’t get to talk until you shave the
mustache, Me From The Past.

9
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:28,158
So the 20th century was pretty big for China
because it saw not one but two revolutions.

10
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:32,219
China’s 1911 revolution might be a bigger
deal from a world historical perspective than

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,100
the more famous communist revolution of 1949,
but you wouldn’t know it because:

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,760
1. China’s communism became a really big
deal during the Cold War, and

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,120
2. Mao Zedong, the father of Communist China,
was really good at self-promotion. Like, you

14
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,979
know his famous book of sayings? Pretty
much everyone in China just had to own it.

15
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,639
And I mean, had to.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:59,500
[theme music]

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,979
So as you no doubt recall from past episodes
of Crash Course, China lost the Opium Wars

18
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,239
in the 19th century, resulting in European
domination, spheres of influence, et cetera,

19
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,959
all of which was deeply embarrassing to the
Qing dynasty and led to calls for reform.

20
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,228
One strand of reform that called for China
to adopt European military technology and

21
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:18,379
education systems was called self-strengthening,
and it was probably would have been a great

22
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,978
idea, considering how well that worked for
Japan. But it never happened in China-- well,

23
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:23,608
at least not until recently.

24
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:28,149
Instead, China experienced the disastrous
anti-Western Boxer Rebellion of 1900, which

25
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:32,789
helped spur some young liberals, including
one named Sun Yat Sen, to plot the overthrow

26
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:35,429
of the dynasty. Oh, it’s already time for
the Open Letter…

27
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,000
An open letter to Sun Yat Sen.

28
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:42,739
Oh, but first, let’s see what’s in the
secret compartment today.

29
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:46,968
Oh, more champagne poppers? Stan, at this
point aren’t we sort of belaboring the fact

30
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:54,778
that China invented fireworks? Wow! That is
innovation at work right there. We used to

31
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:58,929
not be able to fire off one of these, and
now we can fire off six at a time if you count

32
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:00,748
the two secret ones from behind me.

33
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:04,318
Dear Sun Yat Sen, You were amazing! I mean
the Republic of China calls you the father

34
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,330
of the nation. The People’s Republic of
China calls you the forerunner of the democratic

35
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,469
revolution. You’re the only thing they can
agree on! You lived in China, Japan, the United

36
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,469
States, you converted to Christianity, you
were a doctor, you were the godfather of an

37
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:19,060
important science fiction writer.

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,219
But the infuriating thing is that you never
actually got much of a chance to rule China,

39
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,569
and you would have been great at it. I mean,
your three principles of the people, Nationalism,

40
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,560
Democracy, and the People’s Livelihood,
are three really great principles. I mean

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,140
the problem, aside from you not living long
enough is that you just didn’t have a face

42
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,649
for Warhol portraits. Huh, it’s too bad.
Best wishes, John Green

43
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,770
So the 1911 revolution that led to the end
of the Qing dynasty started when a bomb accidentally

44
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,030
exploded, at which point the revolutionaries
were like, “we’re probably going to be

45
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,409
outed, so we should just start the uprising
now”. The uprising probably would’ve been

46
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:55,069
quelled like many before it, except this time
the army joined the rebellion, because they

47
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,569
wanted to become more modern.

48
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,590
The Qing emperor abdicated, and the rebels
chose a general, Yuan Shikai, as leader, while

49
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,950
Sun Yat Sen was declared president of a provisional
republic on Jan 1, 1912. A new government

50
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:09,419
was created with a Senate and a Lower House,
and it was supposed to write a new constitution.

51
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,429
And after the first elections, Sun Yat Sen’s
party, the Guomindang were the largest, but

52
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,909
they weren’t the majority. So Sun Yat Sen
deferred to Yuan, which turned out to be a

53
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:21,259
huge mistake because he then outlawed the
Guomindang party and ruled as dictator.

54
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:26,439
But when Yuan Shikai died in 1916, China’s
first non-dynastic government in over 3000

55
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,400
years completely fell apart. Localism reasserted
itself with large-scale landlords with small-scale

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,230
armies ruling all the parts of China that
weren’t controlled by foreigners. You might

57
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:39,269
remember this phenomenon from earlier in Chinese
history, first during the Warring States period

58
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,630
and then again for three hundred years between
the end of the Han and the rise of the Sui.

59
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:48,849
So the period in Chinese history between 1912
and 1949 is sometimes called the Chinese Republic,

60
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,180
although that gives the government a bit too
much credit. The leading group trying to re-form

61
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,040
China into a nation state was the Guomindang,
but after 1920 the Chinese Communist Party

62
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,650
was also in the mix. And for the Guomindang
to regain power from those big landlords and

63
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,330
reunify China, they needed some help from
the CCP.

64
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,260
Now if an alliance between Communists and
Nationalists sounds like a match made in hell,

65
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:13,259
well, yes. It was. That said, the two did
manage to patch things up for a while in the

66
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,459
early 1920s, you know, for the sake of the
kids.

67
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,720
But then Sun Yat Sen died in 1925 and the
alliance fell apart in 1927 when Guomindang

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,310
leader Chiang Kai-Shek got mad at the communists
for trying to foment socialist revolution,

69
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,360
to which the communists were like, “But
that’s what we do, man. We’re communists.”

70
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,879
Anyway, this turned out to be a bad break
up for a bunch of reasons, but mainly because

71
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,240
it started a civil war between the Communists
and the Nationalists. We’re not going to

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,439
get into exhausting detail on the civil war
but, spoiler alert: the Communists won. But

73
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,589
there are a few things to point out.

74
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:44,899
First, even though Mao emerged victorious,
he and the communists were almost wiped out

75
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:49,469
in 1934 except that they made a miraculous
and harrowing escape, trekking from southern

76
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,200
China to the mountains in the north in what
has become famously known as the Long March,

77
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,909
a great example of historians missing an opportunity
since it could easily have been called the

78
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,510
Long Ass March, as it featured donkeys.

79
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,769
Second, for much of the time the Kuomintang
was trying to crush the CCP, significant portions

80
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:09,500
of China were being occupied and/or invaded
by Japan.

81
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,220
Thirdly, the Communists were just better at
fighting the Japanese than the Nationalists

82
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,630
were. In spite of the fact that Chiang Kai-Shek
had extensive support from the U.S. And each

83
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:20,500
time the Nationalists failed against the Japanese,
their prestige among their fellow Chinese

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,490
diminished. It wasn’t helped by Nationalist
corruption, or their collecting onerous taxes

85
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,660
from Chinese peasants, or stories about Nationalist
troops putting on civilian clothes and abandoning

86
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,060
the city of Nanking during its awful destruction
by the Japanese army in 1937. Meanwhile, the

87
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,990
Communists were winning over the peasants
in their northwestern enclave by making sure

88
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,430
that troops didn’t pillage local land and by
giving peasants a greater say in local government.

89
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,000
Now, that isn’t to say everything was rosy
under Mao’s communist leadership, even at

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,769
its earliest stages. By the way, that is an
actual chalk illustration. Very impressed.

91
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:55,168
In a preview of things to come, in 1942 Mao
initiated a “rectification” program, which

92
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,579
basically meant students and intellectuals
were sent down into the countryside to give

93
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:02,389
them a taste of what “real China” was
like in an effort to re-educate them. We try

94
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,480
to be politically neutral here on Crash Course, but we
are always opposed to intellectuals doing hard labor.

95
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,040
But anyway, within four years of the end of
World War II the Communists routed Chiang

96
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,389
Kai-Shek’s armies and sent them off to Taiwan,
and these military victories paved the way

97
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,150
for Mao to declare the People’s Republic
of China on October 1, 1949.

98
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:23,120
So once in power, Mao and the PRC were faced
with the task of creating a new, socialist

99
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,530
state. And Mao declared early on that the
working class in China would be the leaders

100
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:31,479
of a “people’s democratic dictatorship.”
Oh democratic dictatorships. You’re the

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,610
BEST. It’s all the best parts of democracy,
and all the best parts of dictatorship. You

102
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,270
get to vote, but there’s only one choice.
It takes all the pesky thinking out it.

103
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:45,509
The PRC promised equal rights for women, rent
reduction, land redistribution, new heavy

104
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:51,560
industry and lots of freedoms, including freedoms
of “thought, speech, publication, assembly,

105
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,800
association, correspondence, person, domicile,
moving from one place to another, religious

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,579
belief, and the freedom to hold processions
and demonstrations.” Yeah, NO. Even putting

107
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:05,359
aside the PRC’s failure to protect any of
those rights, Mao’s China wasn’t much

108
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
fun if you were a landlord or even if you
were a peasant who’d done well. Land redistribution

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,478
and reform meant destroying the power of landlords,
often violently.

110
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:16,899
But centralizing power and checking individual
ambition proved difficult for the government,

111
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:21,109
and it was made harder by China’s involvement
in the Korean War, which helped spur the first

112
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,330
mass campaign of Mao’s democratic dictatorship.
Designed to encourage support for the War,

113
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:29,728
the campaign was called the “Resist America
and Aid Korea campaign,” and it resulted

114
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:32,079
in almost all foreigners leaving China.

115
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,800
A second campaign, against “counterrevolutionaries”
was much worse. People suspected of sympathizing

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,319
with the Guomindang, or anyone insufficiently
communist, was subject to humiliation and

117
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:49,139
violence. Between October 1950 and August
1951, 28,332 people accused of being spies

118
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,900
or counterrevolutionaries were executed in
Guandong city alone.

119
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:57,079
A third mass campaign, the “Three Anti Campaign”
was aimed at reforming the Communist party

120
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,990
itself. And the final mass campaign, the Five
Anti Campaign was an assault on all bourgeois

121
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,949
capitalism, which effectively killed private
industry in China. Very few of the victims

122
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,439
of this last campaign actually died, but capitalism
was weakened and state control bolstered.

123
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,779
OK, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

124
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,758
Mao and the CCP set out to turn China into
an industrial powerhouse by following the

125
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,280
Soviet model. We haven’t really talked about
this, but under the Soviet system, Russia

126
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,149
was able to accomplish massive industrialization--
not to mention tens of millions of deaths

127
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:28,620
from starvation-- through centralized planning
and collectivization of agriculture, following

128
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,139
what were known as Five Year Plans.

129
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,720
The Chinese adopted the model of Five Year
Plans beginning in 1953 and the first one

130
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:39,240
worked, at least as far as industrialization
was concerned. In fact, the plan worked even

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,500
better than expected, with industry increasing
121% more than projected. In order for this

132
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,299
to work though, the peasants had to grow lots
of grain and sell it at extremely low prices.

133
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:53,349
This kept inflation in check, and saving was
encouraged by the fact that the Five Year

134
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,670
Plan didn’t have many consumer goods, so
there was nothing to buy. For urban workers,

135
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:01,829
living standards improved and China’s population
grew to 646 million.

136
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,160
So far, Mao’s plan seemed to be working,
but there was no way that China could keep

137
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,639
up that growth, especially without some backsliding
into capitalism. So Mao came up with a terrible

138
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,919
idea called the Great Leap Forward. Mao essentially
decided that the nation could be psyched up

139
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,899
into more industrial productivity.

140
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,009
Among many other bad ideas, he famously ordered
that individuals build small steel furnaces

141
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:26,200
in their backyard to increase steel production.
This was not a good idea. First off, it didn’t

142
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,200
actually increase steel production much. Secondly,
it turns out that people making steel in their

143
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,100
backyard who know nothing about making steel…
make bad steel.

144
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,790
But the worst idea was to pay for heavy machinery
from the USSR with exported grain. This meant

145
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:45,240
there was less for peasants to eat — and
as a result, between 1959 and 1962, 20 million

146
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,440
people died, probably half of whom were under
the age of 10. Jeez, Thought Bubble, that was sad.

147
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,020
And then in happier news came the Cultural
Revolution! Just kidding, it sucked. By the

148
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:57,429
middle of the sixties, Mao was afraid that
China’s revolution was running out of steam,

149
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:01,649
and he didn’t want China to end up just
a bureaucratized police state like, you know,

150
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,330
most of the Soviet bloc. And the Cultural
Revolution was an attempt to capture the glory

151
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,950
days of the revolution and fire up the masses, and
what better way to do that than to empower the kids.

152
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,379
Frustrated students who were unable find decent,
fulfilling jobs jumped at the chance to denounce

153
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:19,909
their teachers, employers, and sometimes even
their parents and to tear down tradition,

154
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:23,659
which often meant demolishing buildings and
art. The ranks of these “Red Guards” swelled

155
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:29,110
and anyone representing the so-called “four
olds” — old culture, old habits, old ideas,

156
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,300
and old customs — was subject to humiliation
and violence. Intellectuals were again sent

157
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,889
to the countryside as they were in 1942; millions
were persecuted; and countless historical

158
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,919
and religious artifacts were destroyed.

159
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,979
But the real aim of the Cultural Revolution
was to consolidate Mao’s revolution, and

160
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,870
while his image still looms large, it’s
hard to say that China these days is a socialist

161
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,639
state. Many would argue that Mao’s revolution
was extremely short-lived, and that the real

162
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,350
change in China happened in 1911. That’s
when the Chinese Republic ended 3,000 years

163
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,149
of dynastic history and forever broke the
cyclical pattern the Chinese had used to understand

164
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:07,399
their past. I mean at least in some senses, those
Nationalist revolutionaries literally put an end to history.

165
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,379
That sense of living in a truly New World
has made many great and terrible things possible

166
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:17,000
for China, but the legacy of China’s two
revolutions is mixed at best. China, for instance,

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,339
made most of the camera we use to film this
video. And China made most of the computers

168
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:25,430
we use to edit. But no one in the People’s
Republic of China will legally be able to

169
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:30,679
watch this video, because the government blocks
YouTube. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

170
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:34,958
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

171
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,729
Danko. Our associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

172
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,690
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics
team is Thought Bubble.

173
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,520
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Disco
Golf Ball." If you want to guess at this week’s

174
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,730
phrase of the week or suggest future ones,
you can do so in comments, where you can also

175
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,028
ask questions about today's videos that will
be answered by our team of historians. If

176
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,070
you like Crash Course, make sure you’ve
subscribed.

177
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,550
Thanks for watching, and as we say in my hometown,
Don’t Forget To Be Awesome.
