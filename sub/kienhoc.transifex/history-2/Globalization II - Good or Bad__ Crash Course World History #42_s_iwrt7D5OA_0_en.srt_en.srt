00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,519
Hi, I’m John Green and this is the final
episode of Crash Course: World History, not

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,089
because we’ve reached the end of history
but because we’ve reached the particular

3
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,779
middle where I happen to be living. Today
we’ll be considering whether globalization

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,390
is a good thing, and along the way we’ll
try to do something that you may not be used

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,099
to doing in history classes: imagining the
future.

6
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:22,498
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green! In the future,
I’m gonna get to second base with Molly Brown.

7
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:25,818
Present John: No you won’t, Me from the
Past, but the fact that when asked to imagine

8
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:31,138
THE future, you imagine YOUR future says a
lot about the contemporary world. And listen,

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,259
Me From the Past, while there’s no question
that your solipsistic individualism is bad both for

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,560
you and for our species, the broader implications 
of individualism in general are a lot more complex.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:50,660
[Theme Music]

12
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,379
Man, I’m gonna miss you, Intro.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,240
So last week (ta-da) we discussed how global
economic interdependence has led, on average,

14
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:01,760
to longer, healthier, more prosperous lives
for humans--not to mention an astonishing

15
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,849
change in the overall human population. In
the West, globalization has also led to the

16
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:10,969
rise of a service economy. In the US and Europe,
most people now work not in agriculture or

17
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:17,118
manufacturing but in some kind of service
sector: healthcare, retail, education, entertainment,

18
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,840
information technology, Internet videos about
world history, etc. And that switch has really

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,868
changed our psychology, especially the psychology
of upper classes living in the industrialized world.

20
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:31,218
I mean, to quote Fredric Jameson, “we are...so
far removed from the realities of production

21
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:36,478
and work that we inhabit a dream world of
artificial stimuli and televised experience.”

22
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,039
Think of it this way: if you had to kill a
chicken every time you visited KFC, you would

23
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:45,519
probably eat fewer chickens. Another change
of psychology: many historians-of-the-now

24
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,769
note that globalization has also led to a
celebration of individualism, particularly

25
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:52,950
in the wake of the failures of the Marxist
collectivist utopias.

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,820
The generation that lived through the Depression
and World War II saw large-scale collectivist

27
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,148
responses to both those crises. And they were
responses that limited freedom. Like, the

28
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,228
military draft, for instance, which limited
your freedom, you know, not to be a soldier.

29
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:10,050
Or the collectivization of health insurance
seen in most of the post-war West, which limited

30
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,189
your freedom to go bankrupt from health care
costs. Or also government programs like social

31
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,550
security, which limit your freedom not to
pay for old people’s retirement.

32
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,939
But since the 1960s, the ascendant idea of
personal freedom minimally limited by government

33
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,500
intervention has become very powerful. Even
the Catholic church was part of this new search

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,729
for individual freedom, as the Second Vatican
Council relaxed church rules in ways that

35
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:37,250
weakened central authority, made concessions
to individual styles of worship, even said

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,000
that people of different religions could go
to heaven. What good is heaven if it’s gonna

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,530
be full of Protestants? It’s just gonna
be like Minnesota.

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,120
So here in the last episode of Crash Course
World History, in the last thirty seconds,

39
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,539
I have offended, uh, 5/6ths of the world’s
population in the form of non-Catholics and,

40
00:02:53,539 --> 00:03:00,139
uh, all Republicans, and probably some political
moderates. Who are confused about what Obama’s

41
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,839
healthcare law will and will not do. Stan,
maybe I should just make this episode just

42
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,409
an extended rant where I reveal all of my
political biases. And also my personal biases.

43
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:15,719
Look, you’re never gonna meet a historian
who doesn’t have biases. But good historians

44
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,359
try to acknowledge their biases and I am biased
toward Canada and its awesome healthcare system.

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,080
I can’t lie. I’m very jealous of you guys.

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,000
But perhaps the greatest effect of the victory
of individualism was on sex and the family.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,129
We haven’t talked much about sex because
my brother’s teaching Biology, which is

48
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:36,229
basically just sex, but sex is pretty important
historically because it’s how we keep happening.

49
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:39,689
But, in the 20th century, greater variety
and availability of contraception made it

50
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:44,009
possible for people to experiment with multiple
sexual partners and helped to uncouple sex

51
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:48,909
from child bearing, which was awesome, but
individualism also had a destabilizing effect

52
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:49,490
on families.

53
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:54,200
As the great Leo Tolstoy put it, all happy
families are alike, but each unhappy family

54
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,139
is unhappy in its own way. But when your individual
fulfillment trumps all, you needn’t live

55
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:04,199
amid your uniquely unhappy family, you can
just leave! So, divorce rates have skyrocketed

56
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,819
in the past few decades, and not just in the
US. By the turn of the 21st century, divorce

57
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:13,750
rates in China reached nearly 25%, with 70%
of those divorces initiated by women.

58
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,538
Technology has also driven families apart,
as parents and children spend increasing time

59
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:23,098
alone in front of their individual screens,
sharing fewer experiences. That’s individualism,

60
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:26,009
too, but not of a kind that we usually celebrate.

61
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,800
But probably the biggest consequence of globalization
and the ensuing rise in human population has

62
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,098
been humanity's effect on the environment.
While populations have increased partly thanks

63
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:40,728
to better yields from existing farmland, much
more land has also been brought under cultivation

64
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:44,568
in the past half-century. Often this meant
cutting down trees in valuable rainforests–

65
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,430
the best known example of this is what’s
going on in the Amazon, but it happens worldwide.

66
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,590
And we're losing land not just for food, but
also to grow the global economy. Oh, it’s

67
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:55,119
time for the open letter?

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,870
An Open Letter to Flowers. But first, let’s
see what’s in the secret compartment today.

69
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:07,348
Oh, it’s fake flowers. Thank you, Stan.
One for behind each ear.

70
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:12,628
Dear Flowers, You capture the best and the
worst of the globalized economy. You’re

71
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:16,810
so pretty. Even the fake ones are pretty.
But the real one are constantly dying. They’ve

72
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,459
got to be harvested, and shipped, and cut
very efficiently. And it’s a global phenomenon.

73
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:26,359
Like there are flowers in my corner market
from Africa. These are from China, but because

74
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,379
they are plastic, they could just be shipped
in a shipping container.

75
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,610
More people can afford to apologize by giving
their romantic partners professionally cut

76
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,218
and arranged roses than in any time in human
history, but in that we have lost something,

77
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:42,449
which is that the whole idea of flowers is
that you had to go out into the field and,

78
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,199
like, cut them and arrange them yourself to
apologize. It’s not supposed to be, “I’m

79
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,280
sorry I forgot your birthday. Here’s $8
worth of work that was done in Kenya.” It’s

80
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,098
supposed to be, “I’m sorry I forgot your
birthday, so I went into the frakking forest

81
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:56,228
and got you some frakking flowers."

82
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:59,120
Anyway, flowers, Best wishes, John Green

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,800
Aww... you guys got me flowers for my last
episode of World History. Okay, let’s go

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,028
to the Thought Bubble.

85
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:11,418
As worldwide production and consumption increases,
we use more resources, especially water and

86
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:16,318
fossil fuels. Globalization has made the average
human richer, and rich people tend to use

87
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,979
more of everything but especially energy.
This has already resulted in climate change,

88
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:23,538
which will likely accelerate.

89
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:28,668
The global economy isn’t a zero-sum game.
Like, I don’t need to become more poor in

90
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:34,060
order for someone else to become more rich.
But growth, at least so far, has been dependent

91
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,860
upon unsustainable use of the planet's resources.
The planet can’t sustain seven billion automobiles,

92
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,509
for instance, or seven billion frequent flyers,
although most of us who can afford to drive

93
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,098
or fly feel entitled to do so.

94
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:50,218
You'll remember that when we talked about
the Industrial Revolution, we discussed the

95
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:55,550
virtuous cycle of more efficiency making things
cheaper, which in turn made them easier to

96
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,770
buy, which increased demand, which increased
efficiency. But from the perspective of the

97
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:06,508
planet, each turn in that cycle takes something:
More land under cultivation, more carbon emissions,

98
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,770
more resource extraction. That can’t go
on forever, but worryingly, our current models

99
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:14,519
of economic growth don’t allow for any other
way.

100
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,598
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

101
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,658
And then there is our astonishingly robust
health. Although much of the world has been

102
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:24,769
ravaged by HIV/AIDS for the past three decades,
there’s been a relative lack of global pandemics

103
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:29,649
since the 1918 flu. And that’s particularly
surprising given increased population density

104
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:35,299
and more travel between population centers.
China has seen 150 million people leave the

105
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,658
countryside for cities in the last 20 years.
This was Shanghai in 1990; and this is Shanghai

106
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:50,009
in 2010. The population of Lagos was 41,000
in 1900; today, it's almost 8 million. Of

107
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:54,968
course, people have been moving from country
to city for a long time; remember Gilgamesh?

108
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:58,860
But the pace of that change has dramatically
accelerated.

109
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,759
Similarly, there's nothing new about international
trade, but its pace has also increased dramatically:

110
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,150
In 1960, trade accounted for 24% of the world's
GDP; today, it’s more than double that.

111
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:15,688
Almost no human being alive today lives with
stuff only manufactured in their home country,

112
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:20,490
but a thousand years ago, only the richest
of the rich could benefit from the Silk Road.

113
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,038
Still, trade isn’t new. And while it’s
tempting to say that the types of goods being

114
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:29,588
traded-– pharmaceuticals, computers, software,
financial services-- represent something wholly

115
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:33,889
new, you could just as easily see this as
part of the evolution of trade itself. At

116
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,809
some point silk was seen as a new trade good.
As tastes change and consumers become more

117
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,909
affluent, the things that they want to buy
change.

118
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,269
So is anything really different, or is it
all just accelerated? Well, some historians

119
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,710
argue that an economically interdependent
world is much less likely to go to war. And

120
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,330
that may be true, but increasing global, cultural,
and economic integration hasn’t led to an

121
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,450
end to violence. I mean, we've seen large
scale ethnic and nationalistic violence from

122
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,390
Rwanda to the former Yugoslavia to the Democratic
Republic of Congo to Afghanistan. Globalization

123
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,539
has not rid the world of violence.

124
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,929
But there is an ideological shift in the age
of globalization that does seem pretty new,

125
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:15,000
and that’s the turn to democracy. Now this
isn’t the limited democracy of the ancient

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,750
Greeks, or the quirky republican system originally
developed in the U.S.; there are almost as

127
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,279
many kinds of democracies as there are nations
experiencing democracy.

128
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,059
The fact is, however, that democracy and political
freedom, especially the freedom to participate

129
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:34,379
in and influence the government, have been
on the rise all over the world since the 1980s

130
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,210
and especially since 1990. For instance, if
you looked at the governments of most Latin

131
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,280
American countries during most of the 20th
centuries, you would usually find them ruled

132
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,269
by military strongmen. Now, with a couple
of exceptions (Fidel, Hugo)… Stan, are they

133
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,829
behind me right now? Because if they’re
behind me, I am in favor of collectivizing

134
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,060
oil revenue and distributing it to the poor.
If they’re not behind me, that’s a terrible

135
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:59,619
idea. Right, but anyway, democracy is now
flourishing in most of Latin America.

136
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,500
Probably the most famous democratic success
story is South Africa, which jettisoned decades

137
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,230
of Apartheid in the 1990s and elected former
dissident Nelson Mandela as its first black

138
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,879
president in 1994. It also adopted one of
the most progressive constitutions in the

139
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,850
world. But it’s worth remembering that democracy
and economic success don’t always go hand

140
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,659
in hand, as much as some Americans wish they
would. Many new African democracies continue

141
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:26,759
to struggle, the same is true in some Latin
American countries, and China has shown that

142
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,370
you don’t need democracy in order to experience
economic growth. But for a few countries,

143
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,610
especially Brazil and India, the combination
of democracy and economic liberalism has unleashed

144
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,639
impressive growth that has lifted millions
out of poverty.

145
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,620
So can we say that it's good, then? Can we
celebrate globalization, in spite of its destabilizing

146
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,490
effects on families and the environment? Well,
here's where we have to imagine the future,

147
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,590
because if some superbug shows up tomorrow
and it travels through all these global trade

148
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,110
routes and kills every living human, then
globalization will have been very bad for

149
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,399
human history: specifically, by ending it.
If climate change continues to accelerate

150
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,590
and displaces billions of people and causes
widespread famines and flooding, then we will

151
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,780
remember this period of human history as short-sighted,
self-indulgent, and tremendously destructive.

152
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,039
On the other hand, if we discover an asteroid
hurdling toward earth and mobilize global

153
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,589
industry and technology in such a way that
we lose Bruce Willis but save the world, then

154
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,009
globalization will be celebrated for millennia.
I mean, assuming we have millennia and can

155
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:27,500
convince Bruce Willis to go.

156
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,600
In short, to understand the present, we have
to imagine the future. That's the thing about

157
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,610
history, it depends on where you're standing.
From where I'm standing, globalization has

158
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,200
been a net positive, but then again, it's
been a pretty good run for heterosexual males

159
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,690
of European descent. Critics of globalization
point out that billions haven't benefited

160
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,330
much if at all from all this economic prosperity,
and that the polarization of wealth is growing

161
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:55,480
both within and across nations. And those
criticisms are valid and they are troubling,

162
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,200
but they aren’t new. Disparities between
those who have more and those who have less

163
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,080
have existed pretty much from the moment agriculture
enabled us to accumulate a surplus. At some

164
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,600
times this inequality has been a big concern,
as it was with Jesus and Muhammad, at other

165
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,540
times not so much. Inequalities are as old
as human history, and almost as old is the

166
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:18,539
debate about them. One thing that is new,
however, is our ability to learn about them,

167
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:24,019
to discuss them, and hopefully to find solutions
for them together as a global community that

168
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:28,389
is better integrated and more connected than
it has ever been before.

169
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:33,659
Because here's the other thing about history:
you are making it. That old idea that history

170
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:39,120
is the deeds of great men? That was wrong.
Celebrated individuals do shape history, but

171
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,279
so do the rest of us. And while it's true
that many historical forces-- malaria, meteors

172
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:50,470
from space-- aren't human, it's also true
that every human is a historical force. You

173
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,649
are changing the world every day. And it is
our hope that by looking at the history that

174
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:59,860
was made before us, we can see our own crucial
decisions in a broader context. And I believe

175
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,009
that context can help us make better choices,
and better changes.

176
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,819
Thanks for watching. But, there’s no need
to despair, Crash Course fans, I’ll see

177
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,879
you next week for the beginning of our mini
series on literature.

178
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,370
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

179
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,679
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

180
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,079
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself. And our
graphics team is Thought Bubble.

181
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,400
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Cookie
Monster". This week’s phrase of the week

182
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,459
was "Bruce Willis," which I am telling you because
we are retiring the idea of the phrase of the week.

183
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,139
Thank you so much for watching Crash Course:
World History. It has been super fun to try

184
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:38,179
to tell the history of the world in 42 twelve-minute
videos. I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you’ll

185
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:43,679
hang around for literature. Thanks for watching, and as
we say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
