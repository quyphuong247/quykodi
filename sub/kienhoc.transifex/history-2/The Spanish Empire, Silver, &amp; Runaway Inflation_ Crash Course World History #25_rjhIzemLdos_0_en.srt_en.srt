00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,839
Hi. I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,070
about the entire fracking globe over the course
of several centuries so let’s get right to it!

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,280
Mr. Green! Fracking?

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,980
You don’t know about Battlestar Galactica
yet, Me From The Past? Oh, man, there are

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,359
so many great things in your future!

6
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:17,820
Today, I’m going to try to show you how
tiny Spain’s influence spread around the

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,760
world and shaped the lives of almost every
human on the planet, generally in negative ways.

8
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,570
I know, everything is such a bummer on Crash
Course recently. It’s the sixteenth century.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,329
People are getting richer, they’re living
more connected lives and all I can do is whine

10
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,449
about how much better the old days were.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,469
What am I, your grandpa? Let’s get festive.
Woooo!

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:45,609
[theme music]

13
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:49,380
So the Aztecs weren’t the first impressive
polity in Mesoamerica, that honor would go

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,770
to the Olmecs or the Mayans. But they were
probably the greatest.

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,540
The Aztecs formed out of an alliance of three
major cities in modern day Mexico in about

16
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,009
1430, just 89 years before Cortez and his
conquistadors showed up.

17
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:04,689
The Aztec state was very hierarchical, with
an emperor at the top and a group of unruly

18
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:08,609
nobles beneath him, just like Europe! And
in addition, there was a class of powerful

19
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:11,409
priests whose job it was to keep order in
the cosmos.

20
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:15,649
So, Aztec religion held that history was cyclical
and punctuated by terrible disasters and then

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,050
would ultimately end with a massive apocalypse.
And the job of the priests was to avoid these

22
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,319
disasters, by appeasing the gods, generally
through human sacrifice.

23
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:27,019
The Aztecs extended their control over most
of southern Mexico, parts of Guatemala and

24
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:30,799
the Yucatan, and they demanded tribute from
conquered people in the form of goods, precious

25
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,039
metals, and people to sacrifice.

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,140
If you’re familiar with The Hunger Games,
it won’t surprise you to learn that this

27
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,370
didn’t sit very well with said conquered
people. And the fact that the Aztecs were

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,340
basically ruling over thousands of people
who hated them made it a lot easier for Cortez

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,880
to come in and find allies to overthrow them.

30
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,489
All that noted, in less than a hundred years,
the Aztecs accomplished some amazing things.

31
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:53,890
Especially the building of their capital city
Tenochtitlan, on the site of modern day Mexico

32
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,590
City, which was like Venice in that it was
divided and serviced by canals. They also

33
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,320
had floating gardens, called chinampas, which
provided food for the city. Oh, it’s already

34
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,089
time for the open letter? Alright.

35
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,109
An open letter to Human Sacrifice. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

36
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:15,329
today. Oh, nice! Come on. Be a mushroom, be
a mushroom, be a- ohhh dahh!

37
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:19,840
Dear Human Sacrifice, Look, I’m not going
to defend you. But if you really believe that

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,780
the world is going to end if the gods are not
appeased, then human sacrifice... kind of makes sense.

39
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:30,159
And as evidence for this, let me submit to
you that we engage in human sacrifice all

40
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:35,098
the time. Remember the movie, The Dirty Dozen? No?
Because you’re too young? That makes me hate myself.

41
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,739
Anyway, it was all about glorious sacrifice
and how a few have to die in order for many

42
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:43,489
to live. Did you at least see that uh, that meteor movie
that Ben Affleck was in? What was that called, Stan?

43
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,489
Stan: Asteroid.

44
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:45,439
John: Asteroid!

45
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,560
Stan: Armageddon.

46
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:50,558
John: Armageddon! Armageddon. Right. Like
that. Human sacrifice.

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,140
Best wishes,
John Green

48
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,699
Alright, now let’s head south to the Inca
civilization, which was older than the Aztecs

49
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:59,259
and in some ways even more impressive. Founded
in the 13th century, the Inca empire ruled

50
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,818
between 4 and 6 million people by the time
the Spanish showed up in 1532.

51
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:06,388
Trade and a very effective administrative
structure held the empire together, which

52
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,278
was even more impressive when you consider
all the roads and temples that were built

53
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:15,318
atop mountains with nothing to haul things
up those mountains, except for llamas and people.

54
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,918
The Inca had no written language but they
were able to keep records with knotted strings

55
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:22,870
called quipus. And they were really good at
integrating conquered people into the empire,

56
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,628
mandating that people learn the Incan language
and vitally, they ordered every male peasant

57
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:31,379
under the Inca control to do unpaid work for the Inca
government for a specified period of time each year.

58
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,859
This system, which the Inca called mit’a
allowed them to build all those roads and

59
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,439
temples. The Spanish would later adopt this
system, and the hierarchical system with the

60
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:42,318
emperor at the top, except they would make
it all, you know, much suckier. And, yes,

61
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,078
that is a technical historian term.

62
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:48,949
So, the Spanish arrived in Mexico in 1519,
and in Peru in 1532, benefiting in both cases

63
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:53,139
from total chaos due to disease. And after
conquering the Inca and the Aztecs, they created

64
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:57,338
an empire with two administrative divisions.
The Vice royalty of New Spain, founded in

65
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:01,519
1521, and the Vice royality of Peru, founded
in 1542.

66
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,699
In some ways, the Aztec and Inca empires were
perfect for Spanish conquest. Their administrative

67
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:09,139
structures were similar, there was a similar
link between secular and religious power,

68
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:12,799
albeit different religions. All of which made
it relatively easy for the Spanish crown to

69
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,739
step into the void left by those two great empires
and send their own administrators to run the place.

70
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,119
While most of the Spanish aristocrats who
came over ran large agricultural operations,

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,418
you don’t see a lot of movies called, like,
Indiana Jones and the Search for A Nice Farm

72
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:28,769
in the Countryside. The real glory for conquistadors
was gold.

73
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,918
Initially they found some, both in the Caribbean
and in Mexico, but never enough to get, like,

74
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:37,959
super-rich. Fortunately, or as I will argue,
unfortunately, they did find a mountain made of silver.

75
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,060
So the Spanish adapted the mit'a, which the
Incas had used to build roads and public buildings,

76
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:46,520
to mine and process that silver. So one seventh
of the adult male Indian population from each

77
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:51,659
district was required to work in the silver mines
for a year, being paid only subsistence wages.

78
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:55,288
Now, you might wonder why the Spanish didn’t
purchase African slaves to work in the mines.

79
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:59,719
They did in Mexico, but in South America it
was cheaper to use indigenous labor.

80
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,729
Purchasing slaves was inefficient because
one: They didn’t have experience working

81
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:06,098
at high altitudes, and two: Mine work was
super deadly.

82
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:10,149
Mercury, which can be used to refine silver
ore, was found at the mountain of Huancavelica.

83
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:14,149
And mercury poisoning among miners was so
common that parents would often maim their

84
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:18,668
children to keep them from having to work
the mines. You can see why I’m struggling

85
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:21,258
to be festive! Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

86
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:26,669
So Spanish mines in the Americas produced
over 150,000 tons of silver between the 16th

87
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:31,658
and the 18th centuries, over 80% of the world’s
supply. Spain became the richest nation in

88
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:34,668
Europe and Spanish silver pesos became the
de-facto currency.

89
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,728
But the Spanish royal family does not appear
to have understood inflation, and the huge

90
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:43,168
influx of silver caused skyrocketing inflation,
and since they never set tax rates to account

91
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:47,978
for it, they collected the same amount of
money sixty years after the discovery of silver,

92
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:52,348
but that money was worth a fraction of what
it once had been. And in general, it’s not

93
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:55,628
clear that Spain benefited much from the discovery
of silver.

94
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:59,889
Rich countries have a way of finding their
way into expensive and not totally necessary

95
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:04,348
wars, and Spain was no exception. While empire
wasn’t the central cause of Spain’s many

96
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:07,310
16th century wars, it sure did fund them.

97
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,228
So in 1519, which was a heck of a year for
Spain, Charles V united the kingdoms of Spain

98
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:17,188
and Austria by being named head of the Holy
Roman Empire, so called because it was not

99
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,919
holy, not Roman, and not an empire.

100
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,500
Charles had this dream of a unified central
Europe, which was constantly being thwarted

101
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,279
by German nobles, who had a dream of a non-unified
central Europe, and eventually Charles V’s

102
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,138
ambitions were shattered and he gave the Austrian
half of his kingdom to his son Ferdinand,

103
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,629
and gave Spain with the American stuff to
Philip in 1556.

104
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,710
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, Philip II didn’t
only inherited all of Spain’s holdings in

105
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:46,680
the Americas and in Europe and in the Phillip-not-a-coincidence-ines.
He also inherited a rebellion in the Netherlands,

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,870
because the Dutch were like, “We’re gonna
be Protestant, also you guys know nothing

107
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,978
about economics,” which, incidentally, the
Dutch are still saying to the Spanish.

108
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:56,568
And then the English sided with the Dutch
and there was a war featuring a disastrous

109
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:01,379
invasion of England, called the Spanish Armada,
in 1588. England’s success against the Spanish,

110
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,519
even though it can largely be chalked up to
the weather, was credited to Queen Elizabeth I.

111
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:08,489
That led to a period of wealth and national
pride, which meant that people had both the

112
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,160
money and the desire to see, I don’t know,
plays about old English Kings named Richard. And that,

113
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,120
my friends, is how the discovery of silver in Bolivia
contributed to the genius of William Shakespeare.

114
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,158
Anyway, American silver didn’t cause these
wars anymore than it wrote Hamlet, but the

115
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:27,610
new wealth made both more possible. Knowing
that they had this enormous silver “war

116
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,670
chest” at their disposal made them much more inclined
to build all those ships that got sunk in 1588.

117
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,000
And soon enough even a mountain of silver
couldn't pay for all their warring, and the

118
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,530
Spanish crown had to borrow money, which they
couldn’t pay back, so they defaulted on

119
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:42,848
their debt several times in the 17th century.
Yay, silver!

120
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:46,438
So, most of the silver mined in the Americas
went to Europe, but at least a third of it

121
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,840
went to China. Either directly, on Spanish
galleons, or indirectly through through the

122
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,369
purchase of Chinese goods.

123
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,379
China had encountered inflation of its own
after printing the world’s first paper money

124
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:58,099
in the 12th century, so they switched back
to coins. Initially, Chinese coins were made

125
00:07:58,098 --> 00:08:02,569
out of copper or bronze, but their economy
was so big — they were the leading producer

126
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,419
of consumer goods until the 19th century — that
they ran out. So they went to silver.

127
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,418
Now, China didn’t have a lot of silver itself,
but Japan did, so they traded manufactured

128
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:14,109
goods for it, but soon even that wasn’t
enough. This was mostly because in the 16th

129
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,778
century, China changed its tax structure.
Taxes, man, they’re at the center of human history.

130
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:23,749
In the early part of the Ming Dynasty, Chinese
farmers paid their taxes in goods, mainly

131
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:27,569
grain, and labor. But as more silver entered
the economy, the Ming government changed its

132
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:30,848
policy and required taxes to be paid in silver.

133
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:34,529
This meant that almost everyone in China had
to produce something that could be sold for

134
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,819
silver, which usually meant silk. In fact, the Ming
government often required people to make silk.

135
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,680
That glut of silk inevitably led to a price
drop, which hurt the Chinese economy but not

136
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,000
nearly as much as it hurt the Spanish economy,
where almost every silk producer was put out

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,299
of business. So much for the idea that global
outsourcing is a new problem.

138
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:53,659
You’d think all this silver would make the
Chinese incredibly rich, just like the Spanish,

139
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:58,379
right? Well, yes, just like the Spanish, in
that they got rich, but they didn’t stay

140
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,169
rich. The Ming government also failed to peg
taxes to inflation, and spent too much on

141
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:03,699
defense, notably the Great Wall.

142
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,879
And by the 17th century the Ming were overthrown
by the Fu Manchus. Oh, it’s just the Manchus?

143
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,939
Guh! History, always disappointing me. As
the historian Dennis Flynn put it, “A significant

144
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,460
hunk of the GDP of China – then the world’s
biggest economy – was surrendered in order

145
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,379
to secure a white metal that was produced
mostly in Spanish America and Japan... Think

146
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:24,189
about what else those resources could have
been used for.”

147
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,380
The Spanish empire’s silver trade was the
first truly global market — even India was involved,

148
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:33,039
but we’re really out of time — and its consequences
were dire, even if it did make some people rich.

149
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,419
Both Spain and China experienced inflation
that weakened their governments. The environment

150
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:41,120
suffered. The search for precious metals led
the Spanish to find and eventually destroy

151
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,450
two of the world’s great empires, the Aztecs
and the Inca.

152
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,820
And many thousands were killed mining silver
and the mercury used to refine it. But before

153
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,040
you say it wasn’t worth it, remember that
this process led to the life that you have

154
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,679
today, one where I can teach you history through
the magic of the Internet. Worth the sacrifices,

155
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:03,279
human and otherwise? I don’t know. You tell
me. Thanks for watching. See you next week.

156
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,759
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

157
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,850
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics

158
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,139
team is Thought Bubble.

159
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:15,210
Last week’s phrase of the week was “number
four, letter u” if you want to suggest future

160
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,639
phrases of the week or guess at this week’s
you can do so in comments, where you can also

161
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,139
ask questions that will be answered by our
team of historians.

162
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:25,120
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don't forget to be awesome!
