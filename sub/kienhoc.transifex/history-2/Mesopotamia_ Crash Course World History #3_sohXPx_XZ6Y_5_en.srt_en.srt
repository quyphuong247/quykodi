00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,149
Hi there. I'm John Green, you're watching
Crash Course World History, and today we're

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,990
going to talk about "Iraq" No, you purportedly
smart globe. We're going to talk about Mesopotamia.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,769
I love Mesopotamia because it helped create
two of my favorite things: Writing and taxes.

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,518
Why do I like taxes? Because before taxes,
the only certainty was death.

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,969
Mr. Green. Mr. Green, did you know that you're
referencing Mark Twain?

6
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:25,689
I'm not referencing Mark Twain, me from
the past, I'm referencing Benjamin Franklin,

7
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:31,179
who was probably himself quoting the unfortunately
named playwright Christopher Bullock. Listen.

8
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:35,100
You may be smart, kid, but I've been smart
longer. By the way, today's illustration

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,969
points out that an eye for an eye leaves the
whole world monocular.

10
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:47,780
[theme music]

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:54,460
So 5,000 years ago in the land meso, or between,
the Tigris and Euphrates potomoi, or rivers,

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,799
cities started popping up much like they had
in our old friend the Indus River valley.

13
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,000
These early Mesopotamian cities engaged in
a form of socialism, where farmers contributed

14
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:08,250
their crops to public storehouses out of which
workers, like metalworkers or builders or

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,230
male models or whatever—would be paid uniform
"wages" in grain. So, basically—

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,219
MR GREEN MR GREEN WERE THERE REALLY MALE
MODELS? CAN YOU DO BLUE STEEL?

17
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:21,368
Oh younger version of myself, how I hate you.

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,500
Oh the humiliation I suffer for you
people... that was my best Blue Steel.

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,459
That was as close as I can get.

20
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:32,859
So anyway, if you lived in a city, you could
be something other than a shepherd, and thanks

21
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,280
to this proto-socialism you could be reasonably
sure that you'd eat--

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,039
STAN, Is there any way we could get another
globe in here? I feel like this shot is inadequately

23
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,920
globed.
Yes, much better.

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,239
You know you can tell the quality of the historian
by the number of his or her globes.

25
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,459
But even though you could give up your flock,
a lot of people didn't want to.

26
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:55,019
One of the legacies of Mesopotamia is the
enduring conflict between country and city.

27
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,539
You see this explored a lot in some of our
greatest art such as

28
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:02,129
The Beverly Hillbillies and Deliverance,
and the showdown between Enkidu and Gilgamesh

29
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,239
in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is one
of the oldest known works of literature and

30
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,129
I'm not gonna spoil it for you—
there's a link to the poem in the video

31
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,900
info—but suffice it to say that in the showdown
between country and city, the city wins.

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,210
So what were these city states like? Well,
let's take a look at one such city-state,

33
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,140
Gilgamesh's home town of Uruk, in the Thought
Bubble:

34
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,819
Uruk was a walled city with an extensive canal system
and several monumental temples, called ziggurats.

35
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:29,459
The priests of these temples initially had
all the power, because they were able to communicate

36
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,140
directly with the gods.

37
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,889
That was a useful talent, because Mesopotamian
gods were moody and frankly pretty mean—like,

38
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,679
according to Gilgamesh they once got mad at
us because we were making too much noise while

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,890
they were trying to sleep so they decided
to destroy all of humanity with a flood.

40
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:49,089
The Tigris and Euphrates are decent as rivers
go, but Mesopotamia is no Indus Valley, with

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,090
its on-schedule flooding and easy irrigation.

42
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,000
A lot of slave labor was needed to make the
Tigris and Euphrates useful for irrigation;

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,189
they're difficult to navigate and flood
unpredictably and violently. Violent, unpredictable,

44
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:07,539
and difficult to navigate: Oh, Tigris and Euphrates,
how you remind me of my college girlfriend.

45
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:12,219
So I mean given that the region tends to yo-yo
between devastating flood and horrible drought,

46
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:17,270
it follows that one would believe that the
gods are kind of random and capricious, and

47
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:24,219
that any priests who might be able to lead rituals that
placate those gods would be very useful individuals.

48
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:29,099
But about 1000 years after the first temples
we find in cities like Uruk, a rival structure

49
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,480
begins to show up, the palace.

50
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,019
The responsibility for the well-being and
success of the social order was shifting from gods

51
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:42,599
to people, a power shift that will seesaw throughout
human history until...um, probably forever actually.

52
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,199
But in another development we'll see again,
these kings, who probably started out as military

53
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,280
leaders or really rich landowners, took on
a quasi-religious role.

54
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:56,509
How? Often by engaging in "sacred marriage"
-- specifically skoodilypooping with the

55
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,620
high priestess of the city's temple.

56
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,550
So the priests were overtaken by kings, who
soon declared themselves priests.

57
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,520
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So how do we know
that these kings were skoodilypooping with

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,240
lady priests? Because they made a skoodilypooping
tape and put it on the internet. No, because

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,700
there's a written record. Mesopotamia gave
us writing, specifically a form of writing

60
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:18,459
called cuneiform, which was initially created
not to like woo lovers or whatever but to

61
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,728
record transactions like how many bushels
of wheat were exchanged for how many goats.

62
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,930
I'm not kidding, by the way; a lot of cuneiform
is about wheat and goats.

63
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,990
I don't think you can overestimate the importance
of writing but let's just make three points here:

64
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,038
1. Writing and reading are things that not
everyone can do. So they create a class distinction,

65
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:41,240
one that in fact survives to this day. Foraging
social orders were relatively egalitarian;

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,728
but the Mesopotamians had slaves and they
played this metaphorically resonant sport

67
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:51,050
that was like polo except instead of riding
on horses you rode on other people.

68
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,509
And written language played an important role
in widening the gap between classes.

69
00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:00,519
2. Once writing enters the picture, you have actual
history instead of just a lot of guesswork & archaeology.

70
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,149
3. Without writing, I would not have a job,
so I'd like to personally thank Mesopotamia

71
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:09,508
for making it possible for me to work while
reclining in my lay-z-boy.

72
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,639
So why did this writing happen in Mesopotamia?
Well the fertile crescent, while it is fertile,

73
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,110
is lacking the pretty much everything else.
In order to get metal for tools or stone for

74
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,110
sculptures or wood for burning, Mesopotamia
had to trade. This trading eventually led

75
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,689
Mesopotamia to develop the world's first
territorial kingdom, which will become very

76
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,979
important and will eventually culminate in
some extraordinarily inbred Hapsburgs.

77
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,519
So the city state period in Mesopotamia ended
around 2,000 BCE, probably because drought

78
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,990
and a shift in the course of rivers led to
pastoral nomads coming in and conquering the

79
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,939
environmentally weakened cities. And then
the nomads settled into cities of their own

80
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,569
as nomads almost always will unless—wait
for it—

81
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:50,929
...You are the Mongols.

82
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,059
These new Mesopotamian city states were similar
to their predecessors in that they had temples

83
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,778
and writing and their own self-glorifying stories
but they were different in some important ways.

84
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:04,788
First, that early proto-socialism was replaced
by something that looked a lot like private

85
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:08,519
enterprise, where people could produce as
much as they would like as long as they gave

86
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,168
a cut, also known as taxes to the government.
We talk a lot of smack about taxes but it

87
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:16,068
turns out they're pretty important to creating
stable social orders.

88
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:19,439
Things were also different politically because
the dudes who'd been the tribal chiefs became

89
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,718
like full-blown kings, who tried to extend
their power outside of cities and also tried

90
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,939
to pass on their power to their sons.

91
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,778
The most famous of these early monarchs is
Hammurabi or as I remember him from my high

92
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:35,668
school history class, "The Hammer of Abi".
Hammurabi ruled the new kingdom of Babylon

93
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:38,788
from 1792 BCE to 1750 BCE.

94
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:42,979
Hammurabi's main claim to fame is his famous
law code which established everything from like

95
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,240
the wages of ox drivers to the fact that the punishment
for taking an eye should be having an eye taken.

96
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,860
Hammurabi's law code could be pretty insanely
harsh. Like if a builder builds a shoddy building

97
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,680
and then the owner's son dies in a collapse,
the punishment for that is the execution of

98
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,459
the builder's son. The kid's like, that's not fair! I'm
just a kid. What did I do? You should kill my dad.

99
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,680
All of which is to say that Hammurabi's
law code gives a new meaning to the phrase

100
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,220
tough on crime, but it did introduce the presumption
of innocence. And in

101
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,920
the law code Hammurabi tried to portray himself in two
roles that should sound familiar: shepherd and father.

102
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,939
"[I am] the shepherd who brings peace. My
benevolent shade was spread over the city,

103
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:28,159
I held the peoples of Sumer and Akkad safely
on my lap."

104
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,140
So again we see the authority for protection
of the social order shifting to men, not gods,

105
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:35,399
which is important, but don't worry, it'll
shift back.

106
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,878
Even though the territorial kingdoms like
Babylon were more powerful than any cities

107
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,468
that had come before, and even though Babylon
was probably the world's most populous city

108
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:47,259
during Hammurabi's rule, it wasn't actually
that powerful, and keeping with the pattern

109
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,278
it was soon taken over by the formerly-nomadic
Kassites.

110
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:54,778
The thing about Territorial kingdoms is that
they relied on the poorest people to pay taxes,

111
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:59,728
and provide labor and serve in the army, all
of which made you not like your king very

112
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:04,848
much so if you saw any nomadic invaders coming
by you might just be like "Hey nomadic invaders!

113
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:07,588
Come on in; you seem better than the last
guy."

114
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:11,278
Well, that was the case until the Assyrians
came along, anyway. The Assyrians have a deserved

115
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:15,718
reputation for being the brutal bullies of
Mesopotamia. But the Assyrians did give us an

116
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:20,740
early example of probably the most important
and durable form of political organization

117
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,490
in world history, and also Star Wars history,
the Empire.

118
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,840
The biggest problem with empires is that by definition

119
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,438
they're diverse and multi-ethnic,
which makes them hard to unify.

120
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,909
So beginning around 911 BCE, the neo-Assyrian
Empire grew from its hometowns of Ashur and

121
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,409
Nineveh to include the whole of Mesopotamia,
the Eastern Coast of the Mediterranean and

122
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,959
even, by 680 BCE, Egypt! They did
this thanks to the most brutal, terrifying

123
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,340
and efficient army the world had ever seen.
More adjectives describing my college girlfriend.

124
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,780
For one thing the army was a meritocracy.
Generals weren't chosen based on who their

125
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,689
dads were, they were chosen based on if they
were good at Generalling.

126
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,040
Stan, is generalling a word? [pauses, two
thumbs up w answer] It is!

127
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,879
Also, they were super mean. Like they would
deport hundreds of thousands of people to

128
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,250
separate them from their history and their
familes and also moved skilled workers around

129
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,389
where they were most needed.Also the neo-Assyrians
loved to find would-be rebels and lop off

130
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:18,309
their appendages. Particularly their noses
for some reason. And there was your standard

131
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:23,349
raping and pillaging and torture, all of which
was done in the name of Ashur, the great god

132
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,940
of the neo-Assyrians whose divine regent was
the King.

133
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,400
Ashur, through the King, kept the world going,
and as long as conquest continued the world

134
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,199
would not end. But if conquest ever stopped,
the world would end and there would be rivers

135
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,259
of blood and weeping and gnashing of teeth.
You know how apocalypses go.

136
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:43,149
The Assyrians spread this world view with
propaganda like monumental architecture and

137
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,699
readings about how awesome the king was at
public festivals, all of which were designed

138
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,259
to inspire awe in the Empire's subjects.

139
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:55,960
Oh that reminds me, ITS TIME FOR THE OPEN
LETTER.

140
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,950
An Open Letter to the Word Awesome:

141
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,680
But first lets see what's in the Secret
Compartment today. Oh, Stan is

142
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,410
this yellow cake uranium? You never find that
in Mesopotamia...

143
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:10,789
Dear Awesome, I love you. Like most contemporary
English speakers in fact, I probably love you a little

144
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:16,819
too much. The thing about you, awesome, is that
awesome is just so awesomely awesome at being

145
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,230
awesome. So we lose track of what you really
mean, awesome: You're not just cool, you're

146
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:28,379
terrifying and wonderful. You're knees-buckling,
chest-tightening, fearful encounters with

147
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:33,809
something radically other- something that
we know could both crush and bless us. That

148
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:36,849
is awe, and I apologize for having watered
you down.

149
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,690
But seriously, you're awesome.

150
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,320
Best wishes,
John Green

151
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,580
So what happened to the Assyrians? Well, first
they extended their empire beyond their roads,

152
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,500
making administration impossible.

153
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,370
But maybe even more importantly, when your
whole world view is based on the idea that

154
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,320
the apocalypse will come if you ever lose
a battle, and then you lose one battle, the

155
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,710
whole world view just blows up. That eventually
happened and in 612 BCE, the city of Nineveh

156
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,519
was finally conquered, and the neo-Assyrian
Empire had come to its end.

157
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,480
But the idea of Empire was just getting started.
Next week we'll talk about mummies — oh,

158
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,269
I have to talk about other things too? Crap,
I only want to talk about mummies. Anyway,

159
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,610
we'll be talking about [tapping stylus to
talking globe replying Sudan] No! Dangit!

160
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,409
We'll actually be talking about [taps globe
to reply Egypt] Thank you, Smart Globe.

161
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:23,509
See you next week.

162
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:28,019
Today's episode of Crash Course was produced and
directed by Stan Muller. Our Script supervisor is Danica

163
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:32,490
Johnson. The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer with some help from myself.

164
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,470
and our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

165
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,220
Last week's phrase of the week was "Better
Boyfriend." If you want to take a guess

166
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,899
at this week's phrase of the week, you can
do so in Comments where you can also suggest

167
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,279
new phrases of the week.

168
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,000
And if you have any questions about today's
show, leave them in Comments and our team

169
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:49,090
of semi-professional quasi-historians will
endeavor to answer them.

170
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,970
Thanks for watching and as we say in my hometown:
Don't forget to be awesome.
