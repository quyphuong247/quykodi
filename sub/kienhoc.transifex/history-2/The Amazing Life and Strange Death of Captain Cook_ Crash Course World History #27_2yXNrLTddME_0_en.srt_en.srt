00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,040
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History and today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,019
the life and astonishing death of Captain
James Hook. Who's death by a crocodile ch-

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:16,560
what? James Cook? There's no crocodiles? HGGG!
Stupid history, always disappointing me. Well,

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,000
Captain Cook is pretty interesting too and
his death is a nice entree into one of the

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,019
great historian feuds of recent times. God,
I love historian feuds.

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:33,100
[theme music]

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,359
So Captain Cook was born in 1728. He was a
sailor and eventually a British Naval Officer,

8
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,960
who saw action in the Seven Years War (which
you will no doubt remember from last week)

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,310
But he's best know for his three voyages of
exploration and scientific discovery that

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,870
took place in the Pacific Ocean.

11
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:52,939
The first was between 1768 and 1771, the second
between 1772 and 1775, and the third between

12
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:59,738
1776 and 1780. Although on the last one, Cook's
journey ended in 1779 because he died. And

13
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:02,919
as you can see from the map, Cook pretty much
OWNED the Pacific.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,670
He mapped the coast of Australia, paving the
way for British colonization and also paving

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,939
the way for the near destruction of aboriginal
peoples and their culture. As with the Columbian

16
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,758
Exchange, Cook's voyages to Australia remade
the biological landscape. He introduced sheep,

17
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,829
which paved the way for Australia's huge wool
industry. Right, there was a penal colony

18
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:25,498
established in Australia; but the real story
of Australia is its success as a colony. Within

19
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:30,349
80 years, Australia went from a 1,000 Anglo-Australians
to 1.2 million.

20
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:33,769
Equally important, Cook explored and mapped
out New Zealand. Again paving the way for

21
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:38,248
colonization and paving the way for Crash
Course World History to make an announcement!

22
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:42,458
We did it! We finally talked about Australia
and New Zealand! We're a real world history

23
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:49,319
class! Huzzah! (party horn) Now all you Australians
have to shut up about how we've never mentioned you!

24
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:52,648
Right, so in his voyage Cook also determined
the was no such thing as the mythical continent

25
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,179
of "Terra Australis" said to have exsited
here. And he helped to dispel the idea of

26
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,569
a North-West Passage, which Europeans had
been obsessed with for centuries. He was the

27
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:04,509
first European to describe Hawaii and also
the first to keep his ships' crews free of scurvy!

28
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:08,250
Cook and his successors were part of the middle
wave of European colonization. The one that

29
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,219
took place after Europeans settled in the
Americas, but before they set their sights

30
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:15,688
on Africa. One more thing to mention about
the context of these voyages, or rather their

31
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:19,438
impact. Besides huge territorial gains and
increased wealth, exploration of the Pacific

32
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:24,000
contributed to Europe's romantic fascination
with science. In the 18th and 19th centuries,

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,090
Europeans became obsessed with mapping and
charting and classifying the world. Which

34
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,269
maybe isn't like candle-light dinner romantic,
but if you think about visiting never before

35
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:37,180
seen lands and bringing back odd life-forms.
Well, I mean think about how we feel about

36
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,180
space. And then of course as they colonized
people, Europeans portrayed themselves as

37
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,510
a civilizing force; bringing both science
and religion.

38
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:52,359
Oh, it's time for the Open Letter? An Open
Letter to "The White Man's Burden." But first,

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,760
let's see what's in the secret compartment
today. Ah! It's a moustache, so I can look like Kipling!

40
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,489
Dear White Man's Burden,

41
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,140
I'mma go ahead and take this off Stan. I think
Tumblr has had enough to get their GIFs.

42
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:08,348
So White Man's Burden, you're a poem. And
more that a century after Kipling wrote you,

43
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:12,238
scholars still disagree over whether he was
kidding. And this speaks to how weird and

44
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,049
insane Imperialism really was. Europeans seemed
to genuinely believe that it was their unfortunate

45
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:23,530
duty to extract massive wealth from the rest
of the world. Seriously, were you kidding

46
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,718
when you called natives "Half Devil and Half
Child?" Because in retrospect, that seems

47
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:31,198
to describe... ya know... you.

48
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,859
Best Wishes,
John Green

49
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,310
Right, so now having discussed the life of
Captain Cook, we shall turn to the most controversial

50
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,549
thing he ever did. Die. Let's go to the Thought
Bubble.

51
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:46,090
So Cook landed in Hawaii at Kealakekua Bay
in early 1779 and explored the island. While

52
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,549
he was ashore he was greeted by an important
person, either a Chief or a God. And then

53
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,650
in early February, he left. But the ship had
trouble and was forced to return to the bay

54
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,539
for repairs. During this second visit, he
had difficulty with the Hawaiians, who'd previously

55
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,459
had been pretty hospitable. And there was
a fracas, in which Captain Cook was killed

56
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,269
by at least one Hawaiian. We know this from
journals kept by various crewman, but the

57
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:16,160
historical controversy arises from the details and
interpretation of his death. Why, in short, was Cook

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,500
killed? The traditional view is that Cook was killed
for some religious reason, although what isn't

59
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:24,500
always clear. One of the most fleshed out
versions of this story comes from the anthropologist

60
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,819
Marshall Sahlins, in his book "Islands of
History." So in the Hawaiian religious system

61
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:33,339
Ku, the God of War and Human Sacrifice, rules
for eight or nine months out of the year.

62
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:38,099
The other months are reserved for the Fertility
God, Lono. The season long festival for Lono

63
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,020
is call "Makahiki" and during this the Hawaiian
King, who is associated with Ku, is ritually

64
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,680
defeated. During the Makahiki, an image of
Lono tours the island, gets worshipped, and collects

65
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,000
taxes. And at the end of the Makahiki period, Lono
is ritually defeated and returned to his native Tahiti.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,310
The thinking goes that because Cook arrived
in the middle of the Makahiki, the Hawaiians

67
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,889
perceived him as Lono. So Cook took part in
the rituals and sacrifices that were made

68
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:06,000
as part of the Makahiki and in Sahlins' view,
Cook was killed as a ritual murder to mark

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,339
the end of Makahiki. For Ku to return, the
fesitval to end, and the normal political

70
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:15,589
order to be restored, ***** Lono had to be
defeated and presumably killed! For Sahlins,

71
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:18,899
Cook's death fits perfectly with the ritual
structure of Hawaiian culture.

72
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,219
Thanks Thought Bubble. So the big problem
with this interpretation, which admittedly

73
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,180
sounds pretty cool, is that we don't have much evidence
that Hawaiians would have actually seen Cook this way.

74
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,110
We find a really interesting opposing view
from Gananath Obeyesekere and I will remind

75
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,330
you that mispronunciation is my thing! Sorry
Gananath. Anyway, he criticized Sahlins' interpretation

76
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:40,939
of Cook's death for looking a lot more like
European myth than like a Hawaiian ritual.

77
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:45,579
First off, Obeyesekere argues that Cook himself
would not easily be confused with Lono. In

78
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:49,279
fact if he were taken for a God, it would
probably be Ku, the War God, what with all

79
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,519
the cannons and muskets. Also there's the
fact that the name Cook sounds more like Ku

80
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,009
than Lono. Also, arguing that native Hawaiians
would see a European and think him a God has

81
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,189
all kinds of troubling implications. One of
them being that native Hawaiians aren't terribly

82
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:06,759
smart. When in fact we know that they are
very smart because unlike the rest of us,

83
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,480
they live in Hawaii. And last but definitely
not least, Lono is associated with fertility

84
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,100
and the Hawaiians would have associated the
Europeans with the exact opposite of fertility

85
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,600
because they introduced gonorrhea to Hawaii.

86
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,330
And there's a further problem with the "Cook
equals Lono" equation, which is that nothing

87
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:26,969
in Hawaiian religion has any of their gods
being ritually killed. Part of their mythology

88
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,160
can be seen as sanctioning a ritual killing
of the King, but not of a god and also it's

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,360
a long way from ritual killing to actual killing!

90
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,540
The truth is probably a lot less spectacular,
which is that Cook was probably killed during

91
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,330
a melee in which a bunch of Hawaiians were
also killed. Before his death, Cook had attempted

92
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:46,269
to take a Hawaiian King hostage in response
to Hawaiians taking a bunch of stuff from

93
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:49,599
Cook's boats. This was common practice for
Cook. He had done the same thing in Tahiti

94
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,570
and other Polynesian Islands after Islanders
had taken European goods. Which by the way

95
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:57,659
happened everywhere Cook went in the Pacific,
so maybe he should have figured out that it

96
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,040
was like a thing! That you were allowed to
take stuff off boats in exchange for the right

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,580
to hang out there! Great sailor, terrible anthropologist.
Although to be fair, anthropology hadn't be invented.

98
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,269
Additionally, right before Cook was killed
there were rising tensions between the Hawaiians

99
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:16,719
and the Europeans. Even though at first their
relationship had been quite cordial as evidenced

100
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,260
by all that gonorrhea. So why the tension?
Probably because the Europeans dismantled

101
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:24,409
a Hawaiian ritual space, some sources call
it a temple, and used it for firewood. Cook

102
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,650
attempted to pay for it, but his low-ball offer of two
hatchets, I'm not making that up, was refused!

103
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,489
I'm sorry we destroyed your temple, but I'll
give you two hatchets! One for each hand!

104
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,269
I mean, what would you even do with a third
hatchet?!?

105
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,139
So unfortunately, the earliest Hawaiian account
offering this explanation for why Cook was

106
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,430
killed comes well after the accounts. But
at least it's a Hawaiian explanation. Of course

107
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,019
it's also possible that the Hawaiians were
just upset that Cook had attempted to kidnap

108
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,829
their King! Most accounts from the time portray
a chaotic scene in which Cook himself fired

109
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:55,740
at least two shots, probably killing at least
one Islander. And one thing that seem pretty

110
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,579
clear, even as described by European chroniclers,
is that Cook's death does not look premeditated

111
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,560
and it sure doesn't look like a ritual.

112
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,560
But even so, the idea that Hawaiians saw Cook
as a God has ended up in a good many accounts

113
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,319
of his demise. Why? Well one explanation is
that it fits in with other stories of explorers.

114
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,620
You've all probably heard that Taínos thought
Columbus was a god and that the Aztecs supposedly

115
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,110
thought Cortés was a god. And this just makes
Captain Cook one in a long line of Europeans

116
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,710
who were thought to be gods by people who
Europeans felt were savages. And making Cook

117
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:30,639
a god also sets up a stark contrast between
the enlightened West and primitive Polynesia,

118
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,240
because Captain Cook often appears in history
books as a model man of the Enlightenment.

119
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,379
Sure he never had much formal schooling, but
his voyages were all about about increasing

120
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:41,199
knowledge and scientific exploration. And
having him die at the hands of a people who

121
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,000
were so obviously mistaken in thinking him
a god makes an argument for the superiority

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,100
over the intellectualism of the Enlightenment
versus the so called "Primitive Religion"

123
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,159
of the colonies. But whenever a story seems
to fit really well into such a framework,

124
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,980
we need to ask ourselves, "Who's telling that
story?"

125
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,379
One of the reasons we know so much about Captain
Cook and the reason he shows up in so many

126
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:05,960
history textbooks is because we have tons
of records about him, but they're almost all

127
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,990
European records. Even the Hawaiian records
we have about Cook have been heavily influenced

128
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,340
by later contact with Europeans. So if we
cast Cook's death as part of a native ritual,

129
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,790
we're implying that Hawaiians were just performing
a ritual script. Which takes away all their

130
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:22,980
agency as human beings. Are we making them
recognizable, having them respond as we think

131
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,870
Europeans would by flying off the handle?
I don't have an answer, but the debate between

132
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,620
these two historical anthropologists brings
up something that we need to keep in mind.

133
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,330
Very often in history, we make statements
about people who haven't written their own

134
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,730
story. Whether it's Hawaiians or Native Americans
or working class people. And we try to imagine

135
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,149
that we're seeing the world as they have seen
it. But the best we can really do is offer

136
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,649
an approximation. So is it really possible
to present a Hawaiian version of Captain Cook's

137
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,049
death? Or is the exercise inherently condescending
and paternalistic? And most importantly, is

138
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:56,990
our inability to escape our biases a good
excuse for not even trying? As usual, those

139
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,669
aren't rhetorical questions. Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next week.
