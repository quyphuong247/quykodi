00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,600
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today things are going to

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,419
get a little bit confusing, because we’re going to talk
about revolution and independence in Latin America.

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:11,370
It’s a bit confusing because:
1. Latin America is big,

4
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:16,730
2. It’s very diverse,
3. Napoleon makes everything complicated,

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,530
and
4. As we’ve seen in the past, sometimes

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,710
revolutions turn out not to be not that revolutionary.
Witness, for instance, the New England Revolution,

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,230
who instead of, like, trying to form new and
better governments are always just kicking

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,629
balls around like all the other soccer teams.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:38,719
[theme music]

10
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,820
Right, so before independence, Latin American
society was characterized by three institutions

11
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,948
that exercised control over the population.

12
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:48,388
The first was the Spanish Crown, or if you
are Brazilian, the Portuguese crown. So, as

13
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:52,260
far as Spain was concerned, the job of the
colonies was to produce revenue in the form

14
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,198
of a 20% tax on everything that was called
“the royal fifth.” So government administration

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,040
was pervasive and relatively efficient - because
it had to be in order to collect its royal fifth.

16
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,939
Then there was the Catholic Church. Even more
than royal officials, the church exercised

17
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,719
influence over people's everyday lives. I
mean, the church even controlled time – the

18
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,170
church bells tolled out the hours and they
mandated a seven day work week so that people

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,609
could go to church on Sunday.

20
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,459
And finally, there was patriarchy. In Latin
America, like much of the world, husbands

21
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:24,609
had complete control over their wives and
any extra-or-pre-marital skoodilypooping was

22
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:28,609
severely punished. I mean, when it was the
women doing the illicit skoodilypooping. Men

23
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:32,629
could basically get up to whatever. This was
mainly about property rights because illegitimate

24
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:36,259
children could inherit their father’s property,
but it was constructed to be about, you know, purity.

25
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,620
To get a sense of how patriarchy shaped Latin
American lives, take a gander at Sor Juana

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,800
Ines de la Cruz, whose name I’m actually
abbreviating. A child prodigy who spoke five

27
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,769
languages by the age of 16, de la Cruz wanted
to disguise herself as a boy so she could

28
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:54,629
attend University, but she was forbidden to
do so. Still, she wrote plays and poetry,

29
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,819
she studied math and natural science, and
for being one of the leading minds of the

30
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:03,750
17th century, she was widely attacked, and
eventually forced to abandon her work and

31
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,530
sell all 4,000 of her books. That’s a shame
because she had a great mind, once writing

32
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,489
that “Aristotle would have written more
if he had done any cooking.”

33
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,950
Couple other things:
First, Latin America led the world in transculturation,

34
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:18,979
or Cultural Blending. A new and distinct
Latin American culture emerged mixing:

35
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,659
1. Whites from Spain called Peninsulares,
2. Whites born in the Americas called creoles,

36
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:26,598
3. Native Americans, and
4. African slaves.

37
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,378
This blending of cultures may be most obvious
when looking at Native American and African

38
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:33,848
influences on Christianity. The Virgin of
Guadalupe, for instance, was still called

39
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:38,348
Tonantzin, the indigenous earth goddess, by
Indians, and the profusion of blood in Mexican

40
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:43,328
iconography recalls the Aztec use of blood
in ritual. But transculturation pervaded Latin

41
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,739
American life, from food to secular music
to fashion.

42
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,900
Somewhat related: Latin America had a great
deal of racial diversity and a rigid social

43
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,218
hierarchy to match. There were four basic
racial categories: white, black, mestizo – a

44
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:59,858
mix of white and American Indian - and mulatto,
a mix of white and black. We try not to use

45
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,599
that word anymore because it’s offensive,
but that’s the word they used.

46
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,688
And from the 16th century on, Latin America
had a huge diversity of mixed race people,

47
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:10,959
and there were constant attempts to classify
them and divide them into castes. You can

48
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,489
see some of these in so called casta paintings,
which attempted to establish in a very weird

49
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,778
and Enlightenment-y way all the possible racial
combinations.

50
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:22,979
But of course that’s not how race works,
as evidenced by the fact that successful people

51
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,878
of lower racial castes could become “legally
white” by being granted gracias al sacar.

52
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,149
So by 1800, on the eve of Latin America’s
independence movements, roughly a quarter

53
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,528
of people were mixed race.

54
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,109
All right, now let's have us some revolutions.
How shall we organize this, Stan? Let's begin

55
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:43,099
with Latin America's most successful country
as defined by quality of soccer team.

56
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,318
So Brazil - he said as thousands of Argentinians
booed him - is obviously different because

57
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:51,768
it was ruled, not by Spain, but by Portugal.
But like a lot of revolutions in Latin America,

58
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:56,109
it was fairly conservative. The creoles wanted
to maintain their privilege while also achieving

59
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,900
independence from the Peninsulares.

60
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,489
And also like a lot of Latin American revolutions,
it featured Napoleon. Freaking Napoleon. You’re

61
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,778
everywhere. He’s behind me, isn’t he?
Gah! So when Napoleon took over Portugal in

62
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:13,459
1807, the entire Portuguese royal family and
their royal court decamped to Brazil. And

63
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,220
it turned out, they loved Brazil. King Joao
loved Brazil so much...

64
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,980
Off topic, but do you think that J-Woww named
herself after King Joao? I mean, does she

65
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,340
have that kind of historical sensibility?
I think she does.

66
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:29,089
So King Joao’s life in Rio was so good that
even after Napoleon was defeated at the Battle

67
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:33,659
of Waterloo, he just kind of stayed in Brazil.
And then, by 1820, the Portuguese in Portugal

68
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,410
were like, “Hey, maybe you should come back
and, like, you know, govern us, King of Portugal.”

69
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,490
So in 1821, he reluctantly returned to Lisbon,
leaving his son Prince Pedro behind. Meanwhile,

70
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,139
Brazilian creoles were organizing themselves
around the idea that they were culturally

71
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,810
different from Portugal, and they eventually
formed a Brazilian Party - no, Stan, not that

72
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:58,100
kind of party, come on - yes, that kind - a
Brazilian party to lobby for independence.

73
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,140
Then in 1822, they convinced Prince Pedro
of boring, old Portugal that he should just

74
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:09,009
become King Pedro of sexy, big Brazil. So
Pedro declared Brazil an independent constitutional

75
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,069
monarchy with himself as king.

76
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,670
As a result, Brazil achieved independence
without much bloodshed and managed to hold

77
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,930
on to that social hierarchy with the plantation
owners on top. And that explains why Brazil

78
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,720
was the last new world country to abolish
slavery, not fully abandoning it until 1888.

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,370
Right, so even when Napoleon wasn’t forcing
Portuguese royals into an awesome exile, he

80
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,110
was still messing with Latin America. Let’s
go to the Thought Bubble.

81
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,129
So Latin America’s independence movements
began not with Brazil, but in Mexico when

82
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:39,850
Napoleon put his brother on the Spanish throne
in 1808. Napoleon wanted to institute the

83
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,390
liberal principles of the French Revolution,
which angered the ruling elite of the Peninsulares

84
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,990
in what was then called New Spain. They were
aristocrats and they just wanted to go back

85
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,420
to some good old-fashioned divine right monarchy
with a strong church. So the Mexican Creoles,

86
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,650
seeking to expand their own power at the expense
of the Peninsular elite saw an opportunity

87
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:02,029
here. They affirmed their loyalty to the new
king, who was French even though he was the

88
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,769
king of Spain. I told you this was complicated.

89
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:09,000
Then, a massive peasant uprising began, led
by a renegade priest Padre Hidalgo, and supported

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,579
by the Creoles because it was aimed at the
Peninsulares, even though they weren’t actually

91
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:17,779
the ones who supported Spain. This was further
complicated by the fact that to the mestizo

92
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:23,179
peasants led by Hidalgo, Creoles and Peninsulares
looked and acted basically identical - they

93
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,720
were both white and imperious - so the peasants
often attacked the Creoles, who were technically

94
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,990
on their side in trying to overthrow the ruling
peninsulares. Even though it had tens of thousands

95
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,579
of supporters, this first peasant uprising
petered out.

96
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:40,079
But, a second peasant revolt, led by another
priest, Father Morelos, was much more revolutionary.

97
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,609
In 1813, he declared independence and the
revolt lasted until his death in 1815. But

98
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,230
since he was a mestizo, he didn’t gain much
Creole support,so revolutionary fervor in

99
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:57,110
Mexico began to fade... until 1820, when Spain,
which was now under the rule of a Spanish,

100
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,449
rather than a French king, had a REAL liberal
revolution with a new constitution that limited

101
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:04,490
the power of the church. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

102
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,230
So, in the wake of Spain’s liberalizing
movements, the Mexican elites, who had previously

103
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,569
supported Spain, switched sides and made common
cause with the creoles in the hopes that they

104
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,159
could somehow hold onto their privileges.
And pushing for independence together, things

105
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,600
went very well. The Creole general Iturbide
and the rebel mestizo commander Guerrero joined

106
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,680
forces and won independence with most of the
Peninsulares returning to Spain.

107
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,430
Iturbide – the whiter of the two generals
– became king of Mexico in 1822 (remember,

108
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,750
this was a revolution essentially AGAINST
representative government). But that didn’t

109
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,120
work out and within a year he was overthrown
by the military and a republic was declared.

110
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,199
Popular sovereignty was sort of victorious,
but without much benefit to the peasants who

111
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,839
actually made independence possible. This
alliance between conservative landowning elites

112
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,888
and the army - especially in the face of calls
for land reform or economic justice - would

113
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,540
happen over and over again in Latin America
for the next century and a half. But before

114
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,810
we come to any conclusions, let’s discuss
one last revolution.

115
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,389
So Venezuela had a cadre of well-trained creole
revolutionaries, who by 1811 had formed a

116
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:08,139
revolutionary junta that seized power in Caracas
and formed a republic. But, the interior of

117
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,730
Venezuela was home to mixed-race cowboys called
Llaneros who supported the king. They kept

118
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,670
the Caracas revolutionaries from extending
their power inland.

119
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:21,139
And that, is where Simon Bolivar, “el Libertador,”
enters the picture. Bolivar realized that

120
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,650
the only way to overcome the various class
divisions (like the one between the Caracas

121
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,569
creoles and Llaneros) was to appeal to a common
sense of South American-ness. I mean, after

122
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,009
all, the one thing that almost all South Americans
had in common: they were born in South America,

123
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,159
NOT SPAIN.

124
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,100
So then, partly through shows of toughness
that included, like, crossing flooded plains

125
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,778
and going without sleep, Bolivar convinced
the Llaneros to give up fighting for Spain

126
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:48,370
and start fighting against them. He quickly
captured the viceregal capital at Bogota and

127
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,528
by 1822 his forces had taken Caracas and Quito.

128
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:55,710
Hold on, hold on. Lest I be attacked by Argentinians
who are already upset about what I said about

129
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,980
their really good soccer team, I want to make
one thing clear: Argentina’s general Jose

130
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,340
de San Martin was also vital to the defeat
of the Spanish. He led an expeditions against

131
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,649
the Spanish in Chile and also a really important
one in Lima.

132
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:11,039
And then, in December of 1824, at the battle
of Ayacucho, the last Spanish viceroy was

133
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,969
finally captured and all of Latin America
was free from Spain. Oh, it’s time for the

134
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:23,649
open letter? That’s A chair, Stan, but it’s
not THE chair.

135
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,539
An Open Letter to Simón Bolívar. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

136
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:34,379
today. Oh, Llanero. I wonder if his hips swivel
when I wind him up. Context is everything.

137
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:37,659
They do! Hey there, cowboy.

138
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:42,539
Dear Simón Bolívar, First, you had fantastic
muttonchops. It’s as if you’re some kind of handsome

139
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,500
Martin Van Buren. You were a man of immense
accomplishments, but those accomplishments have

140
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,460
been richly rewarded. I mean, you have a country named
after you. Not to mention, two different currencies.

141
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,379
But for my purposes, the most important thing
you ever did was die. You may not know this,

142
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,759
Simón Bolívar, but when I'm not a world
history teacher sitting next to a fake fireplace,

143
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,799
I am a novelist. And your last words, “Damn
it, how will I ever get out of this labyrinth,” feature

144
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,959
prominently in my first novel, Looking for Alaska.
Except it turns out, those weren’t your last words!

145
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,620
Your last words were probably, “Jose, bring
the luggage.” But I decided to use your

146
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,060
fancy, romantic, inaccurate last words. It’s
called artistic license. Put that in your luggage.

147
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:23,299
Anyway, fantastic life; I just wish you’d
nailed it a little bit better with your last words.

148
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:25,019
Best wishes, John Green.

149
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,840
So by 1825, almost the entire western hemisphere
– with a few exceptions in the Caribbean

150
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,850
- was free from European rule. Oh, right.
And Canada. I’m just kidding, Canadians.

151
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,050
It’s so easy to make fun of you because
you’re so nice. So I tease you and then

152
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:41,870
you’re like, “Aw, thanks for noticing
that we exist.” It's my pleasure!

153
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,830
Anyway, this is pretty remarkable, especially
when you consider that most of this territory

154
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,910
had been under Spanish or Portuguese control
for almost 300 years. The most revolutionary

155
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:54,319
thing about these independence movements were
that they enshrined the idea of so called

156
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,910
popular sovereignty in the New World. Never
again would Latin America be under the permanent

157
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:04,309
control of a European power, and the relatively
quick division of Latin America into individual

158
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:08,729
states, despite Bolivar’s pan South American
dream, showed how quickly the people in these

159
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:14,139
regions developed a sense of themselves as
nations distinct from Europe, and from each other.

160
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:17,889
This division into nation states prefigures
what would happen to Europe in the mid-19th

161
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:22,990
century, and in that sense, Latin America
is the leader of 19th century world history.

162
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,379
And Latin American history presages another
key theme in modern life - multiculturalism.

163
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:30,909
And all of that makes Latin America sound
very modern, but in a number of ways, Latin

164
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:35,399
American independence wasn’t terribly revolutionary.
First, while the Peninsulares were gone, the

165
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,299
rigid social hierarchy, with the wealthy creoles
at the top, remained. Second, whereas revolutions

166
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,659
in both France and America weakened the power
of the established church, in Latin America,

167
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:48,100
the Catholic Church remained very powerful
in people’s everyday lives.

168
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,580
And then, there is the patriarchy. Although
there were many women who took up arms in

169
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,920
the struggle for independence, including Juana
Azurduy who led a cavalry charge against Spanish

170
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,259
forces in Bolivia, patriarchy remained strong
in Latin America. Feminist ideas like those

171
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,009
of Mary Wollstonecraft would have to wait.
Women weren’t allowed to vote in national

172
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:10,189
elections in Mexico until 1953. And Peru didn’t
extend voting rights to women until 1955.

173
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:16,560
Also, Latin America’s revolutionary wars
were long and bloody: 425,000 people died

174
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,500
in Mexico’s war for independence. And they
didn’t always lead to stability: Venezuela,

175
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,100
for instance, experienced war for much of the 19th
century, leading to as many as a million deaths.

176
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,990
And it’s important to note that fighting
for freedom doesn’t always lead to freedom;

177
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,549
the past two centuries in Latin America have
seen many military dictatorships that protect

178
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:37,139
private property at the expense of egalitarian
governance.

179
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,480
“Freedom,” “independence,” and “autonomy”
are complicated terms that mean different

180
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,680
things to different people at different times.
So too with the word “revolutionary.”

181
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,219
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

182
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,600
Location change because I forgot to record
the credits, and my shirt matches the wall.

183
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,550
Probably should have thought about that one
a little bit harder. Crash Course is produced

184
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:01,819
and directed by Stan Muller. Our script supervisor
is Danica Johnson, the show is ably interned

185
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,970
by Meredith Danko, and it’s written by my
high school history teacher Raoul Meyer and

186
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,040
myself. Our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

187
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,549
Last week’s phrase of the week was "giant
squid of anger." If you want to suggest a

188
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,659
future phrase of the week or guess at this
week’s, you can do so in comments, where

189
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,899
you can also ask questions that will be answered
by our team of historians.

190
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:21,559
Look at the beautiful Crash Course poster! Available 
now at DFTBA.com; link in the video description.

191
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:26,559
Thanks for watching, and, as we say in my
home town, Don’t Forget To Be Awesome. Ow!

192
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,339
That's much harder to do when there's carpet.
