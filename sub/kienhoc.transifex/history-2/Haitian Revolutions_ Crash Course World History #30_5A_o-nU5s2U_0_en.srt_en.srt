Hi, I’m John Green. This is Crash Course
World History. And apparently it’s Revolutions

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,060
Month here at Crash Course, because today
we are going to discuss the often-neglected

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,800
Haitian Revolutions. The Haitian Revolutions
are totally fascinating and they involve two

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,000
of my very favorite things:
1. Ending slavery, and

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,759
2. Napoleon getting his feelings hurt. I can’t
help myself, Napoleon. I like to see you suffer.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:30,600
[theme music]

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,359
So, the French colony in Saint-Domingue began
in the 17th century as a pirate outpost. And

8
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,539
its original French inhabitants made their
living selling leather and a kind of smoked

9
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,019
beef called boucan. All that beef actually
came from cattle left behind by the Spanish,

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,260
who were the first Europeans to settle the
island.

11
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:49,089
But anyway, after 1640, the boucan-sellers
started to run low on beef. And they were

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,960
like, “You know what would pay better than
selling beef jerky? Robbing Spanish galleons,”

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,980
which as you’ll recall were loaded with
silver mined from South America. So, by the

14
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:00,468
middle of the 17th century, the French had
convinced many of those buccaneering captains

15
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,389
to give up their pirating and settle on the
island.

16
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,540
Many of them invested some of their pirate
treasure in sugar plantations, which, by 1700

17
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:12,840
were thriving at both producing sugar and
working people to death. And soon, this island

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,789
was the most valuable colony in the West Indies,
and possibly in the world. It produced 40%

19
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:22,599
of Europe’s sugar, 60% of its coffee, and it was
home to more slaves than any place except Brazil.

20
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,500
And as you’ll recall from our discussion
of Atlantic slavery, being a slave in a sugar-production

21
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,519
colony was exceptionally brutal. In fact,
by the late 18th century, more slaves were

22
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:37,519
imported to Saint-Domingue EVERY YEAR— more
than 40,000— than the entire white population

23
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,009
of the island. By the 19th century, slaves
made up about 90% of the population.

24
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:46,168
And most of those slaves were African born,
because the brutal living and working conditions

25
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:50,348
prevented natural population growth. Like,
remember Alfred Crosby’s fantastic line,

26
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:54,859
“it is crudely true that if man’s caloric
intake is sufficient, he will somehow stagger

27
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:59,468
to maturity, and he will reproduce?” Yeah,
well, not in 18th century Haiti, thanks to

28
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:04,259
Yellow Fever and smallpox and just miserable
working conditions. So, most of these plantations

29
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,959
were pretty large, they often had more than
200 slaves, and many of the field workers—

30
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,209
in some cases, a majority— were women.

31
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:13,860
Colonial society in Saint-Domingue was divided
into four groups, which had important consequences

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,069
for the revolution. At the top, were the Big
White planters who owned the plantations and

33
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:21,828
all the slaves. Often these Grand Blancs were
absentee landlords who would just rather stay

34
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:25,730
in France and let their agents do, you know,
the actual brutality.

35
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,139
Below them were the wealthy free people of
color. Most of the Frenchmen who came to the

36
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,539
island were, you know, men, and they frequently
fathered children with slave women. These

37
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:36,548
fathers would often free their children. Wasn’t
that generous of them. So, by 1789, there

38
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:41,920
were 24,800 free people of color along with
about 30,000 white people in the colony. The

39
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,119
free people of color contributed a lot to
the island’s stability. They served in the

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,209
militia, and in the local constabulary, and
many of the wealthier ones eventually owned

41
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,030
plantations and slaves of their own.

42
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,939
And then, below them on the social ladder were
the poor whites, or the petit blancs, who worked

43
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:59,840
as artisans and laborers. And at the bottom were
the slaves who made up the overwhelming majority.

44
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:04,408
I know what you’re thinking: this is a recipe
for permanent social stability. No, it wasn’t.

45
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:08,289
Okay, so when the French Revolution broke
out in 1789, all these groups had something

46
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:12,280
to complain about. The slaves, obviously,
disliked being slaves. The free people of

47
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,468
color were still subject to legal discrimination,
no matter how wealthy they became.

48
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:19,959
And the poor whites, in addition to being
poor, were resentful of all the privileges

49
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,109
held by the wealthy people of color. And the
Grand Blancs were complaining about French

50
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:27,030
trade laws and the government’s attempts
to slightly improve the living and working

51
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,989
conditions of slaves. Basically they were
saying that government shouldn’t be in the

52
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:35,378
business of regulating business. So everyone
was unhappy, but the slaves were by far the worst off.

53
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:38,798
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! You’re always saying
how much slavery sucks, but is it really any

54
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,299
worse than having to work for, like, subsis...

55
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,620
Yeah, I’m gonna stop you right there, Me
from the Past, before you further embarrass

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,829
yourself. You often hear from people attempting
to comprehend the horrors of slavery that

57
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:50,340
slavery couldn’t have been all that bad,
and that it wasn’t that different from working

58
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,389
for minimum wage. And that we know this because
if it HAD been so bad, slaves would have just

59
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,840
revolted, which they never did. Yeah. Well,
1. equating slavery to poor working conditions

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,479
ignores the fact that if you work at, like,
Foxconn, Foxconn doesn’t get to sell your

61
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,039
children to other corporations. And
2. As you are about to see, SLAVES DID REVOLT.

62
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,400
So, the unrest in what became Haiti started
in 1789 when some slaves heard a rumor that

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,379
the King of France had freed them. Even though
it was across the ocean, word of the changes

64
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:19,279
in France reached the people of Haiti, where
The Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen,

65
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,948
while terrifying to planters, gave hope both
to free people of color and to slaves.

66
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:27,728
At the same time, some petit blancs argued
that there was inadequate discrimination against

67
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:31,209
blacks. They identified with the third estate
in France, and they called for interest rates

68
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:36,000
to be lowered so they could more easily pay their debts.
And they began lobbying for colonial independence.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,579
The psychology here shows you the extent to
which slaves were not considered people. I

70
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,609
mean, these radical petit blancs thought that
they were the oppressed people in Saint-Domingue

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,360
because they couldn’t afford to own slaves.
And they thought if they could become independent

72
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,419
from France, they could take power from the
people of privilege and institute a democracy

73
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:56,500
where everyone had a voice-- except for the
95% of people who weren’t white.

74
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,610
Then in 1791, these radical petit blancs seized
the city of Port-au-Prince. You’ll remember

75
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,830
that by 1791, France was at war with most
of Europe, and just like with the 7 Years’

76
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:09,959
War, the wars of Revolutionary France played
out in the colonies as well as at home. So

77
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,060
the French government sent troops to Saint-Domingue.

78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,689
Meanwhile, urges toward liberty, fraternity,
and equality were only growing in France,

79
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:21,959
and it didn’t seem very equitable to grant
citizenship based solely on race. So in May

80
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,939
of 1791, the National Assembly gave full French
citizenship to all free men of color. I mean,

81
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,459
if they owned property, and had enough money,
and weren’t the children of slaves. The

82
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,628
petit blancs weren’t thrilled about this,
and that led to fighting breaking out between

83
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:36,389
them and the newly French free people of color.

84
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:42,038
And then in August of 1791, the slaves were
like, “Um, hi, yes. Screw all of you.”

85
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:45,759
And a massive slave revolt broke out. Among
the leaders of this revolt was Toussaint Breda,

86
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,659
a former slave of full African descent, who later
took the name Toussaint L’ouverture. L’Ouverture

87
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,980
helped mold the slaves into a disciplined army
that could withstand attacks from the French troops.

88
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,360
But again, the context of the wider revolution
proves really important here. So, the Spanish

89
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,580
had consistently supported slave revolts in
Saint-Domingue hoping to weaken the French.

90
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:07,758
But, by 1793 they were offering even more
support. In fact, L’Ouverture became an

91
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,838
officer in the Spanish military because the
emancipation of the slaves was more important

92
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,378
to him than maintaining his rights as a French
Citizen.

93
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:18,580
So then, in October of 1793 the British, whom
as I’m sure you’ll recall were also at

94
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:23,168
war with France, decided to invade Saint-Domingue.
And at that point, the French military commanders

95
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:28,098
were like, We are definitely going to lose
this war if we fight the British, the Spanish,

96
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:31,860
and the slaves, so let’s free the slaves.
So they issued decrees freeing the slaves

97
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,750
and on February 4, 1794 the National Convention
in Paris ratified those decrees.

98
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,029
By May, having learned of the Convention’s
actions, L’Ouverture switched allegiances

99
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:43,948
to the French and turned the tide of the war.
Thus, the most successful slave revolt in

100
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:49,348
human history won freedom and citizenship
for every slave in the French Caribbean. But

101
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:53,259
emancipation didn’t end the story because
the French were still at war with the Spanish

102
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:56,860
and the English in Saint-Domingue. Luckily
for France, L’Ouverture was an excellent

103
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,330
general, and luckily for the people of the
island, L’Ouverture was also an able politician.

104
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:06,469
And between 1794 and 1802, he successfully
steered the colony toward independence.

105
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,970
So, although slavery was abolished, this didn’t
end the plantation system because both L’Ouverture

106
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,979
and his compatriot André Rigaud believed
that sugar was vital to the economic health

107
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:18,598
of the island. But now at least people were
paid for their labor and their kids couldn’t

108
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:21,348
be sold. Now you can compare it to Foxconn.

109
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:24,569
But soon, L’Ouverture and Rigaud came into
conflict over Rigaud’s refusal to give up

110
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,509
control over one of the Southern states on
the island, and there was a civil war, which

111
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:32,879
L’Ouverture, with the help of his able lieutenant
Jacques Dessalines, was able to win after

112
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,229
13 months of hard fighting. L’Ouverture
then passed a new constitution, and things

113
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:40,939
were going pretty well on Saint-Domingue with
the small problem that it was still technically part of

114
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:45,379
France, which meant that it was about to be ruled by
Napoleon Bonaparte. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

115
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:49,860
So, in 1799, Napoleon seized power in France
in a coup. And, his new regime, called the

116
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,509
Consulate (because he was the First Consul
à la the Roman Republic) established a new

117
00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:00,759
constitution that specifically pointed out its
laws did not apply to France’s overseas colonies.

118
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,500
Napoleon had plans to reconstruct France’s
empire in North America that it had lost most

119
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,509
of in the 7 Years’ War, and to do this he
needed tons of money from France’s most

120
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:15,848
valuable colony, Saint-Domingue. And the best
way to maximize profits? Why, to reintroduce

121
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:19,628
slavery, of course. That’s certainly what
the former slaves thought was the plan when

122
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:25,539
in 1802, a French expedition commanded by
Napoleon’s brother in-law Charles-Victor-Emmanuel

123
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,498
“I-Have-Too-Many-Names” Leclerc showed
up in Saint-Domingue.

124
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,639
This started the second phase of the Haitian
revolution, the fight for independence. So,

125
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,439
Leclerc eventually had L’Ouverture arrested
and shipped to France where he died in prison

126
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,080
in 1803. But this itself did not spark an
uprising against the French because L’Ouverture

127
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,820
wasn’t actually that popular, largely because he wanted
most blacks on the island to continue to grow sugar.

128
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,759
Instead, the former slaves only started fighting
when Leclerc tried to take away their guns,

129
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,259
thus beginning a guerrilla war that the French,
despite their superior training and weapons,

130
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:00,319
had absolutely no chance of winning. Although
the French were exceedingly cruel, executing

131
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,510
women as well as men and importing man-eating
dogs from Cuba, the Haitians had the best

132
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:10,500
ally of all: Disease, specifically in the
form of Yellow Fever, which killed thousands

133
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,879
of French soldiers, including Leclerc himself.
Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?

134
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,160
Stan! Where is my chair? Stan, you’re telling
me the yellow chair has been lost? The yellow

135
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:29,100
chair is the star of the show. The stars,
in order, are 1. me, 2. yellow chair, 3. the

136
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,940
chalkboard, 4. Danica, 5. Meredith the Intern,
6. you, Stan. You’re sixth. Oh, I’m mad.

137
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,000
Let’s see what’s in the secret compartment
today. It’s a giant squid of anger!!! I’M

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,440
A GIANT SQUID OF ANGER!!!! Oh, no. It broke.

139
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,100
An open letter to disease. Dear disease, why do you
always put yourself at the center of human history?

140
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,080
Most of you are just tiny, little single-celled
organisms, but you’re so self-important

141
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,310
and self-involved that you’re always interfering
with us. Admittedly, sometimes you work for

142
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:59,519
the good guys, but usually you don’t. It
seems like even though you’re constantly

143
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,279
interfering with human history, you don’t
even care about it.

144
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,559
I just hate when people, and also microbes,
are super self-involved. Like, don’t tell

145
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,609
me you gotta take a day off to go to your
mom’s birthday party, Stan. That’s not

146
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,830
imagining me complexly. I’ve got needs over
here.

147
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,379
Best wishes, John Green.

148
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,519
So continued defeat and the death of his troops
eventually convinced Napoleon to give up his

149
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,620
dreams of an American empire and cut his losses.
He recalled his surviving troops, of the 40,000

150
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,899
who left, only 8,000 made it back. And then,
he sold Thomas Jefferson Louisiana. And that

151
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,399
is how former slaves in Haiti gave America
all of this.

152
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,159
On January 1, 1804, Dessalines who had defeated
the French, declared the island of Saint-Domingue

153
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,539
independent and re-named it Haiti, which is
what the island had been called by the native

154
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:45,169
inhabitants before the arrival of Columbus.
The Haitian Declaration of Independence was

155
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:49,949
a rejection of France and, to a certain degree
of European racism and colonialism.

156
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,259
It also affirmed, to quote from the book Slave
Revolution in the Caribbean, “a broad definition

157
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:59,319
of the new country as a refuge for enslaved
peoples of all kinds.” So, why is this little

158
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,379
island so important that we would devote an
entire episode to it? First, Haiti was the

159
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:07,149
second free and independent nation state in
the Americas. It also had one of the most

160
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,240
successful slave revolts ever. Haiti became
the first modern nation to be governed by

161
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,539
people of African descent, and they also foiled
Napoleon’s attempts to build a big new world empire

162
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:20,490
Of course, Haiti’s history since its revolution
has been marred by tragedy, a legacy of the

163
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,990
loss of life that accompanied the revolution.
I mean, 150,000 people died in 1802 and 1803

164
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,440
alone. But the Haitian revolutions matter.
They matter because the Haitians, more than

165
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,460
any other people in the age of revolutions,
stood up for the idea that none should be

166
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,310
slaves, that the people who most need the
protection of a government should be afforded

167
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:43,619
that protection. Haiti stood up for the weak
when the rest of the world failed to.

168
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,340
The next time you read about Haiti’s
poverty, remember that.

169
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,899
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

170
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:54,399
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

171
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:58,909
The show is ably interned by Meredith Danko.
And our graphics team is Thought Bubble. Oh,

172
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:03,309
right, I write it with my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer. Actually, he does most

173
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:04,719
of the work, who are we kidding.

174
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,480
Last week’s phrase of the week was “fancy
footwear.” If you want to guess this week’s

175
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,009
phrase of the week or suggest future ones,
you can do so in comments, where you can also

176
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:13,819
ask questions that will be answered by our
team of historians.

177
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,240
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my home town, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
