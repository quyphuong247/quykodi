00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,139
Hi. I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today's video is kind of

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,580
a response to one of the most riveting history
books you'll ever read, the Columbian Exchange

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,339
by David Crosby. He had a good year in 1969--
published The Columbian Exchange, played Woodstock,

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:17,978
he was still on his first liver. What? It
was Albert Crosby? Gash! History, never being

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,379
as interesting as I want it to be.

6
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,480
Right, so it was Alfred Crosby Jr., and in
that book he wrote, "The big questions are

7
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:27,049
really the only ones worth considering, and
colossal nerve has always been a prerequisite

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,539
for such consideration." I love it!

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,950
Before 1492, we couldn't really talk about
a world history at all, we could only talk

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,520
about the different histories of separate
regions, but Columbus changed all of that,

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,450
and everything else. The Columbian Exchange
irrevocably homogenized the world's biological

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,780
landscape. Since Columbus, the number of plant
and animal species has continually diminished,

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,939
and the variation in species from place to
place has diminished dramatically. I mean,

14
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:52,579
the first European visitors to the Americas
had never seen a tomato or a catfish; Native

15
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,170
Americans had never seen a horse, and by making
our planet biologically singular, the Columbian

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,760
Exchange completely remade the populations
of animals, particularly humans. And vitally,

17
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,920
this cross-pollination also made possible
such wonders as contemporary pizza.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:14,719
[theme music]

19
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,780
So we're going to break the Columbian Exchange
down into four categories: Diseases, boy,

20
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,609
you're looking good Smallpox, I'm glad you've
been eliminated; Animals, Plants, and People.

21
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,879
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! People are animals.

22
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,189
Yeah, that's true, me from the past, but just
for the sake of simplicity we're--

23
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:30,658
Also, when you think about it, microbes are
kinda animals and plants are, too, I mean--

24
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,870
Oh my god, shut up before I kill you and create
a time travel paradox.

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,890
Microbes, like those hairy blokes back there,
were a definite negative in terms of the Columbian

26
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,090
Exchange. Terminology is hard here, but the
majority of Caribbean Islanders or Native

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,299
Americans or Amerindians had exactly one response
to the arrival of Europeans: death.

28
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,299
We can't be sure of how many natives died
as a result of European arrival but it was

29
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,420
definitely more than 50% and some estimates
place it as high as 90%. Historians used to

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,689
blame European brutality, which was definitely
a factor, but the main culprit was disease.

31
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,478
Smallpox is usually seen as the villain of
the story but it is more likely that a series

32
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,258
of diseases in combination did the damage.
Along with smallpox, Americans were killed

33
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:13,348
by measles and mumps, typhus, chicken pox,
none of which they had been previously exposed

34
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:18,328
to. This astonishing decrease of population
was definitely the worst effect of these diseases,

35
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,819
both psychologically and demographically.

36
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:24,608
But the secondary effects were almost as bad.
For one thing the deaths of Aztec and Incan

37
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:28,998
rulers touched off wars which made it easier
to spread disease, because you know, the number

38
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:33,778
one way to catch smallpox is via hand-to-hand
combat. Plus leaders kept dying. Huayna Capac,

39
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:38,229
the leader of the Incan empire, succumbed
to smallpox before Pizarro even arrived. His

40
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,598
death led to a violent succession struggle
between his sons which was won by Atahualpa,

41
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,638
who in turn was captured and killed by Pizarro.
And without that war, the Inca would have

42
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,499
had a much better chance against the Spaniards,
whose numbers were comparatively tiny. A similar

43
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:53,340
thing happened to the Aztecs. The Moctezuma
who eventually lost to Cortés was the nephew

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,009
of a much more powerful king who died of smallpox.
And the death of that great king encouraged

45
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:02,479
some of the smaller states in the Aztec empire to rebel,
and some of them even fought for the Spaniards.

46
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,280
And another effect of disease was starvation,
because there simply weren't enough people

47
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:10,168
left to grow crops to feed the living. And
the malnutrition made survivors that much

48
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,359
more susceptible to disease. In short, it
sucked.

49
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,680
The transmission of disease largely went one
way, from the Old World to the New, but the

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,849
Americans did have one gift for Europe: venereal
syphilis. It showed up in Europe around 1493,

51
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:27,518
and even though Europeans are very fond of
ascribing syphilis to each other: Italians

52
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,419
called it the French disease; the French called
it the disease of Naples; Poles called it

53
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,549
the German disease; Russians called it the
Polish disease. The truth is, venereal syphilis

54
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,909
was spread by sailors who'd returned from
the Americas.

55
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:41,620
In fact, in his book, The Columbian Exchange,
Crosby tells it like this: "Sailors, by the

56
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,558
nature of their profession, are men without
women and therefore men of many women. We

57
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:50,620
can imagine no group more perfectly suited
for guaranteeing that venereal syphilis would

58
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,769
have worldwide distribution." Who says history
books are boring? Syphilis would go on to

59
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,959
infect a veritable who's who of Europe: from
Baudelaire to Gauguin to Nietzsche, not to

60
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,949
mention numerous family members of the famously
infertile Tudor and Valois families, meaning

61
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:08,459
that syphilis may be responsible for many
of those miserably boring dynastic power struggles

62
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,218
of post-Columbus Europe. Anyway, nothing against
syphilis, but it pales in comparison to the

63
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,579
devastation wrought by Old World diseases
arriving in the New World.

64
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,358
But the New World did have one gift for the
Old World that was pretty destructive: tobacco.

65
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,378
Oh, it's time for the open letter and there's
been a costume change? That doesn't bode well.

66
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,680
An Open Letter to Tobacco.

67
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,990
But first let's see what's in the secret compartment
don't be cinnamon don't be cinnamon don't

68
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,259
be -- dang it!

69
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:44,199
I guess that I'm going to do the cinnamon
challenge. Oh, I am not happy about this Stan,

70
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,038
for the record -- alright, I'm going to do
the cinnamon challenge: one tablespoon of

71
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:55,949
cinnamon in my mouth, no water.

72
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,039
Huh, boy, that -- that sucked. I, I uh regret
r-regret doing that to be honest with you.

73
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,478
Dear Tobacco,
I just did something really stupid but at

74
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,628
least it was cheap. I'm gonna tell you two
stories about smoking, the first come from

75
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:17,340
my high school history teacher Raoul Meyer
who also writes Crash Course. When I was a

76
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,658
senior in high school he walked up to me and
he said, "I want you to keep smoking. I want

77
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:26,709
you to smoke until the day after your 65th
birthday, and then I want you to die so that

78
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:32,079
I collect all of your social security." That inspired me,
Mr. Meyer, to quit smoking just eight short years later.

79
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,120
Here is an amazing statistic: cigarettes were
handed out to American servicemen during World

80
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:42,689
War II and more soldiers who started smoking during
the war died from smoking than died from the war.

81
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:46,740
So if the New World was looking to extract
some measure of revenge for smallpox, and

82
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,220
measles, and chicken pox: Mission accomplished.

83
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,740
Best Wishes,
John Green

84
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,310
Now onto animals. American animals, like llamas
and guinea pigs, never really caught on in

85
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,589
Eurasia. But imports to the Americas, like
pigs, cows and horses were revolutionary.

86
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:01,839
Let's go to the thought bubble:

87
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,419
First of all, these animals, especially pigs,
completely remade the food supply. Pigs breed

88
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,370
really quickly, they eat anything and they
turn into bacon, which made them heroes to

89
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,829
the new world just as today they are heroes
to the internet. Here's how quickly pigs breed:

90
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:21,758
When Hernando de Soto arrived in Florida in
1539, he brought 13 pigs. By the time of his

91
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,340
death, there were 700 - that was 3 years later.
The abundance of meat and plentiful land for

92
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:32,209
agriculture and grazing meant that Europeans
in the Americas very rarely experienced famine,

93
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:35,839
and despite what you may have learned about
religious and political freedom, the main

94
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,649
reason Europeans came to America was to eat.

95
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,318
Large European animals also changed the nature
of work in the Americas. Before Europeans,

96
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,840
the largest beast of burden was the llama,
and at best it could carry like, 100 lbs.

97
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,568
This meant that for the long distance travel
that the Inca engaged in, the primary transportation

98
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:57,770
animal was Incas. Oxen, when combined with
their plows, made it possible to bring more

99
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:02,878
land under cultivation and also made transportation
easier and more efficient, and plus European

100
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,639
animals remade culture.

101
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,060
The grossly stereotypical American Indian,
like from the movies, riding the Great Plains

102
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,098
with an eagle feather headdress and war paint,
well he didn't exist before the Columbian

103
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:17,990
Exchange because there were no horses for
him to ride. And the introduction of horses

104
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,538
allowed many Native Americans to abandon agriculture
in favor of a nomadic lifestyle because riding

105
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:26,959
around hunting buffalo made them far richer
than farming ever had. Thanks Thought Bubble.

106
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,339
While animals and diseases completely reshaped
the New World, it was New World plants that

107
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:33,029
had the biggest effect on Eurasia.

108
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:37,059
Sure, Europeans brought over some crops that
we now grow here in the Americas like wheat

109
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,259
and grapes, both of which are necessary for
Catholic mass, but New World plants radically

110
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:46,620
changed the lives of millions, maybe hundreds
of millions of Africans, Asians and Europeans,

111
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,199
specifically by making pizza possible.

112
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,288
[Heavenly singing, "It was the greatest gift
of all."]

113
00:07:55,288 --> 00:08:00,259
I mean until 500 years ago Italians lived
without tomatoes, without modern pizza or

114
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:06,949
marinara sauce or pizza or ketchup or pizza
or even pizza. Indians lived without curry,

115
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,889
which contains chilies, a New World food.
Persians lived without corn, which is a New

116
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,569
World food, as are beans and potatoes and
avocados and peanuts and blueberries - the

117
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:16,759
list goes on and on.

118
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,310
And these New World crops led to probably
the greatest population increase in history.

119
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,800
To quote Crosby, "It is crudely true that
if man's caloric intake is sufficient, he

120
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,610
will somehow stagger to maturity, and he will
reproduce."

121
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,320
And New World food was far more caloric than
Old World food, which is the central reason

122
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,690
that the world population doubled between
1650 and 1850. Plants like corn and potatoes

123
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,720
could grow in soils that were useless for
Old World crops. Potatoes were actually introduced

124
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,190
to Europe as an aphrodisiac, but it turns
out that you have to distill those potatoes

125
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,100
into vodka before they have the desired effect.
Anyway, if potatoes are an aphrodisiac, the

126
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,379
Irish quickly became the hottest people on
Earth.

127
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,769
An acre and a half of potato cultivation could
feed an Irish family for a year, and the average

128
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:02,559
Irish worker often ate 10 lbs. of potatoes
every day. Surviving primarily on potatoes,

129
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,939
the Irish more than doubled their population
between 1754 and 1845, when the Potato Famine

130
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,440
showed up and ruined everything.

131
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,230
And it wasn't just Europe. Manioc, or cassava
is a New World plant with roots that provide

132
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,139
more calories than any other plant on Earth,
provided they are properly processed (otherwise

133
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,809
they're poisonous). Manioc is so prevalent
in Africa that many Africans swear that the

134
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:23,579
plant is native to the continent, but it isn't.

135
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,330
Nor are sweet potatoes, and while New World
grains never replaced rice in Southeast, or

136
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,780
East Asia, the sweet potato was so common
that it is known as the "poor person’s staple"

137
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,500
in China. Even in Japan, the tomb of the farmer
who is reputed to have first brought them

138
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,289
to the islands is known as the Temple of the
Sweet Potato. And it's also worth noting that

139
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:41,929
corn, while it may not feature prominently
in European diets, has been the central source

140
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,359
of food for animals in Europe for centuries.

141
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,009
And in fact, that's still the case. In 2005,
58% of the corn grown in America went to animal

142
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:52,159
feed (is the kind of thing you learn when
you live in Indiana).

143
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,449
Alright, so last but not least, the Columbian
exchange involved the transfer of lots of

144
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,259
people. Again, in the early stages this movement
was mostly one way, with Europeans and Africans

145
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:03,419
- the Africans usually against their will
- making their way to the Americas.

146
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,389
So the Columbian Exchange led to the re-population
of the New World following the disease devastation

147
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:10,529
of the initial encounter. And better nutrition
allowed the population of the Old World to

148
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:14,480
grow which in turn placed population pressure
on Eurasia which led to more people coming

149
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,060
to the Americas. In the process, the world's
human inhabitants became more genetically

150
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:21,709
and ethnically interconnected. But it also
led to the horrors of Atlantic slavery, which

151
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,870
we'll be discussing next week.

152
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,580
What are we to make of the Columbian Exchange?
It devastated the population of the Americas,

153
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,580
it led to the widespread slavery of Africans,
but it also allowed for a worldwide population

154
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,639
increase and the lives of some Natives including
Plains tribes like the Lakota became better

155
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,949
and more secure, at least for a while.

156
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,140
Fewer people have starved since the Columbian
Exchange began, but the diversity of life on

157
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,639
Earth has diminished dramatically and planting crops
where they don't belong has hurt the environment.

158
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,970
So on the whole, should we be grateful for
the Columbian Exchange? And should we work

159
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,440
to continue and deepen its legacy of globalism
and monoculture?

160
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,410
Crosby didn't think we were better off. "The
Columbian Exchange has included man, and he

161
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:59,969
has changed the Old and New Worlds sometimes
inadvertently, sometimes intentionally, often

162
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,920
brutally. It is possible that he and the plants
and animals he brings with him have caused

163
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,620
the extinction of more species of life forms
in the last four hundred years than the usual

164
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,940
processes of evolution might kill off in a
million... The Columbian Exchange has left

165
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,230
us with not a richer but a more impoverished
genetic pool. We, all of the life on the planet,

166
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,740
are the less for Columbus, and the impoverishment
will increase."

167
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,600
But let's give you the last word today: Do
you agree with Crosby? Are longer, healthier

168
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,330
lives for more humans worth the sacrifice
of an impoverished biosphere? And most importantly,

169
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,420
how will your conclusions about those questions
shape the way that you live your life?

170
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,000
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,600
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

172
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,940
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself, and our

173
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,500
graphics team is Thought Bubble.

174
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,629
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Mario
and Luigi,” thanks for that suggestion.

175
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:51,750
If you want to suggest future phrases of the
week you can do so in comments or you can

176
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,940
also guess at this week’s phrase of the
week, and ask questions about today's video

177
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,330
that will be answered by our team of historians.
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we

178
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,810
say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
