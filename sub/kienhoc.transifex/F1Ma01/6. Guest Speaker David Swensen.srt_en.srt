2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:04,220
We've already talked about
our guest today.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,260
This is David Swensen.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,30
Remember, I said he was the
inventor of the swap, which is

5
00:00:12,30 --> 00:00:17,610
a real claim to fame, because
swaps total in the hundreds of

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,30
billions --

7
00:00:18,30 --> 00:00:18,480
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN:
Trillions.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,802
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
It's amazing.

9
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:21,169
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: I
thought this was going to be a

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,530
polite introduction.

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,510
I used to be proud of the
swap thing, but that

12
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,535
was before the crisis.

13
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:30,659
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Well, that's financial

14
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:31,340
innovation.

15
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,360
I think, swaps are a very
important new technology.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,260
We've been talking about that.

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,449
So anyway, just to
remind you --

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,300
David Swensen came to Yale in
1985, when the portfolio was

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,663
worth less than $1 billion.

20
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:48,360


21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,375
And as of June, 2010,
it's $16.7 billion.

22
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,320
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN:
And climbing.

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,170
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
And climbing.

24
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,260
And this is a financial crisis,
but between 2009 and

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,880
2010, the portfolio went up $1.4
billion, so there's no

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,610
crisis around here.

27
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,182
Well, there was a little
hitch at one point.

28
00:01:12,182 --> 00:01:13,530
But that kind of
thing happens.

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,630


30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,750
I take pride in training young
people in finance.

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,580
David Swensen has done the same
with many young people.

32
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,688
Notably, Andrew Golden, who
heads the Princeton portfolio,

33
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:32,110
is one of your trainees.

34
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,230
And he's had an almost as
spectacular record as well.

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,230
Well, with that introduction,
I will turn it

36
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,688
over to David Swensen.

37
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:41,174
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN:
Thank you.

38
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:50,790
[APPLAUSE]

39
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,20
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: So,
I've been at Yale for, I

40
00:01:52,20 --> 00:01:54,560
guess, more than 25 years now.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,930
And for most of the 25 years,
if there was any publicity,

42
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,620
the publicity was pretty good.

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,350
For the past couple of years,
it's been a little bit mixed.

44
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,639
And, I liked it better, before
the publicity was mixed.

45
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,619
I liked it, when every article
that you would read had

46
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,500
something great to say about
the Yale Approach or the

47
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,280
Swensen Model.

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,490
But after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers and the onset

49
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,460
of the financial crisis, it
didn't take very long for the

50
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,702
negative headlines to appear.

51
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:35,790
As a matter of fact, I carry
around this Barron's article

52
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,799
that appeared in November
2008, and the title was

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,840
''Crash Course.'' And it talked
about colleges cutting

54
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,300
budgets, freezing
hiring, scaling

55
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,690
back building projects.

56
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,690
And it blamed the Yale Model and
the Swensen Approach for

57
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,370
being too aggressive.

58
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,10
They said in Barron's that
university endowment should

59
00:03:01,10 --> 00:03:05,510
own more stocks and bonds, less
in alternatives, because

60
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,440
the alternatives provided too
little diversification and too

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,590
little liquidity.

62
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,140
So, I thought what we could do
today as a jumping off point

63
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,510
is, talk about what it is that
Barron's meant when they were

64
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,200
talking about the Swensen
Approach or the

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,959
Yale Model and --

66
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,640
I think, when it was successful,
it was the Yale

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
Model, and when it failed, it
was the Swensen Approach,

68
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,620
which I really don't like.

69
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,180
There's an asymmetry there.

70
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,420
I keep thinking that I should
name it after one of the guys

71
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,49
in the office.

72
00:03:35,50 --> 00:03:37,60
Maybe it should be the Takahashi
Approach instead of

73
00:03:37,60 --> 00:03:37,850
the Swensen Approach.

74
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,670
It's time for him to have
some glory, right?

75
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,200


76
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,940
Talk about what it is that
Barron's meant by Swensen

77
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,910
Approach or the Yale Model, and
see, whether, indeed, the

78
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,970
criticisms that they levy,
that there's too little

79
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,440
diversification and two little
liquidity, whether those

80
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,270
criticisms are valid.

81
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,460
But to do that, let's go
back to 1985, when I

82
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,733
first arrived at Yale.

83
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:12,260
It was April 1, 1985, for those
of you who care about

84
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,790
April Fools' Day.

85
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:20,620
I came from a six-year stint on
Wall Street, and I had no

86
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,440
significant portfolio management
experience.

87
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,520
As Bob mentioned in his
introduction, I'd been

88
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,940
involved with structuring the
first swap transaction in

89
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,560
1981, when I worked for
Salomon Brothers.

90
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,730
It was a swap between IBM
and the World Bank.

91
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,860
And later, Lehman Brothers hired
me to set up their swap

92
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,130
operations.

93
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,840
So, generally what I was doing
on Wall Street was working

94
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,780
with new financial technologies
and being

95
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,30
involved with the early days
of swaps transactions.

96
00:04:55,30 --> 00:04:56,479
It was a much smaller
market then, it

97
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,650
wasn't hundreds of trillions.

98
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,500
And it was a much less efficient
market then, so the

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,550
trades were incredibly
profitable.

100
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,900
Commodity swaps today trade on
razor thin margins, and tend

101
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,239
not to be anywhere near as
profitable as they were when

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,750
the markets were much
less efficient.

103
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,650
How did I end up at Yale?

104
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,159
Well, one of my dissertation
advisors called me and said

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,940
they needed somebody to
manage the portfolio.

106
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,690
And after coming to New Haven
and talking to them about the

107
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,130
job, I realized that my heart
wasn't in Wall Street.

108
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,680
My heart was in the world of
education, and at Yale in

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,160
particular.

110
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:47,370
So I came up here, amazed that
I was responsible, as Chief

111
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,750
Investment Officer, for
this portfolio.

112
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,640
It was less than $1 billion,
but close to $1 billion.

113
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,770
And the first thing I did was,
I looked around to see what

114
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,830
other people were doing.

115
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,770
That seemed like a sensible way
to approach the portfolio

116
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,130
management problem.

117
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,480
There must be some smart people
at Harvard or Princeton

118
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,630
or Stanford putting together
portfolios that make sense for

119
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,130
endowed institutions.

120
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,930
What I saw was that colleges
and universities had, on

121
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:26,60
average, 50% of their portfolio
in U.S. stocks, 40%

122
00:06:26,60 --> 00:06:31,970
of their portfolio in U.S. bonds
and cash, and 10% in a

123
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,760
smattering of alternatives.

124
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,90
Even though I had no direct
portfolio management

125
00:06:38,90 --> 00:06:41,919
experience, I had studied at
Yale and Jim Tobin and Bill

126
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,250
Brainard were my dissertation
advisors.

127
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:50,30
And I understood some of
the basic principles

128
00:06:50,30 --> 00:06:52,289
of corporate finance.

129
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,330
And one of the first things that
you learn when you study

130
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,159
finance theory, is that

131
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,750
diversification is a great thing.

132
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,560
Jim Tobin won the Nobel Prize
in part for his work related

133
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
to the subject of
diversification.

134
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,900
In fact, when a New York Times
reporter asked Jim to explain,

135
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,400
in layman's terms, what it was
that he won the Nobel Prize

136
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,989
for, Jim said, well, I guess you
could say, don't put all

137
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,610
your eggs in one basket.

138
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,33
I didn't know you got a Nobel
Prize for that, but that's --

139
00:07:28,33 --> 00:07:28,150
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: We
told our students that that

140
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,215
phrase goes back to 1802.

141
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:28,280
[correction: Lecture
4 mentions an

142
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,332
investment manual from 1874.

143
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:28,384
According to
ngrams.googlelabs.com, the

144
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:33,126
phrase can actually be
traced back to 1800.]

145
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:35,140
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: OK,
so if it goes back to 1802,

146
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,719
Jim was just picking up on the
vernacular and used it as a

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,80
way to describe what it is
that he did his work for.

148
00:07:44,80 --> 00:07:48,469
And Harry Markowitz, who
actually did a fair amount of

149
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,280
his work on modern portfolio
theory at Yale's Cowles

150
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,729
Foundation, has said that

151
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,230
diversification is a free lunch.

152
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,20
I mean, didn't you learn in
introductory economics and

153
00:08:02,20 --> 00:08:03,180
intermediate [clarification:
intermediate economics]

154
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,430
that there ain't no such
thing as a free lunch?

155
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,600
Economists are always talking
about trade-offs.

156
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,30
If you want more of this,
you have less of that.

157
00:08:10,30 --> 00:08:13,640
Well, with diversification,
that's not true, right?

158
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,659
If you diversify your portfolio
for a given level of

159
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,590
return, you can generate that
return at lower risk.

160
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,859
If you diversify for a given
level of risk, you can

161
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,560
generate higher returns.

162
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
So, diversification is this
great thing, it's a free

163
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,580
lunch, it's something that
everybody should embrace.

164
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,659
Well, if you look at the
portfolios that I saw in the

165
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,890
world of endowment investing in
the mid-1980s, they weren't

166
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,840
diversified.

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,490
If you've got half of your
assets in a single asset

168
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,860
class, U.S. stocks, and you
have 90% of your assets in

169
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,610
U.S. marketable securities,
you're not diversified.

170
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,320
Half your assets in a single
asset class is way too much.

171
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,560
And the 90% that are in stocks
and bonds under many

172
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,199
circumstances will respond to
the same driver of returns,

173
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,550
interest rates, in
the same way.

174
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,599
Lower interest rates,
mathematically, are good for

175
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,970
bonds, and lower interest rates
lower the discount rate

176
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,440
that you use to discount future
earning streams, so

177
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,690
they're probably going to
be good for stocks too.

178
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,410
And vice versa.

179
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,760
And the second thing I thought
about was the notion that

180
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,980
endowments have a longer
time horizon than any

181
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,70
investor that I know.

182
00:09:40,70 --> 00:09:43,570
And if you've got a long time
horizon, you should be

183
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,450
rewarded by accepting
equity risks.

184
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,800
Because those equity risks,
even though they might not

185
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,520
reward you in the short
run, will reward

186
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,460
you in the long run.

187
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,940
So, with a mission, as a manager
of an endowment, to

188
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,940
preserve the purchasing power
of the portfolio in

189
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:12,320
perpetuity, I expected that
other endowments would have

190
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,160
substantial equity exposures, to
take advantage of the fact

191
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,600
that, in the long run, that's
where you're going to generate

192
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,720
the greatest returns.

193
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,640
But if you think about those
endowment allocations that I

194
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,862
saw in the mid-1980s, 40% of the
assets were in bonds and

195
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:36,660
cash, which are low expected
return assets.

196
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:43,890
So, the portfolios that I saw
when I got to Yale failed the

197
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,380
basic common sense test of
diversification and equity

198
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:56,250
orientation, and it prompted
me and my colleagues to go

199
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:02,930
down a different path, to put
together a portfolio that had

200
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,660
reasonable exposure to equities,
and put together a

201
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,770
portfolio that was sensibly
diversified.

202
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,20
So, I'd like to talk about how
it is that we got from where

203
00:11:17,20 --> 00:11:21,650
we were in the mid-80s to
where we ended up in the

204
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,790
early- to mid-90s, and where
we remain today.

205
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:32,540
And to do that, I'd like to put
it in the context of the

206
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,870
basic tools that we have
available to us as investors.

207
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,360
And these tools are the tools
that you can employ if you're

208
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,360
managing your portfolio as an
individual, or the tools that

209
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,790
I have to employ when I'm
managing Yale's portfolio as

210
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,449
an institutional investor.

211
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,390
And there are basically three
things that you can do to

212
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,69
affect your returns.

213
00:11:57,70 --> 00:11:59,990
First of all, you can decide
what assets you're going to

214
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,890
have in the portfolio and in
which proportions you'll hold

215
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,620
those assets.

216
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,560
So, that's the asset allocation
decision.

217
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,599
How much in domestic stocks,
how much in foreign stocks,

218
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,990
how much in real estate.

219
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,450
If you're an institutional
investor, how much in timber,

220
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,813
how much in leveraged buyouts,
how much in venture capital.

221
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:19,430


222
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,989
The fundamental decision of how
it is that the portfolio

223
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,660
assets are allocated.

224
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,480
The second thing that
you can do is make a

225
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,790
market timing decision.

226
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,199
So, if you establish targets
for your portfolio --

227
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,980
targets with respect to how much
in domestic socks, how

228
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,970
much in domestic bonds, how
much in foreign stocks.

229
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,560
And then, because in the short
run, you think that --

230
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,199
let's say domestic stocks are
expensive and foreign stocks

231
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,590
are cheap --

232
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,690
you decide to hold more foreign
stocks and less in

233
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,160
domestic stocks.

234
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,189
That bet, that short-term bet
against your long-term

235
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,720
targets, is a market
timing decision.

236
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,850
And the returns that are
attributable to that deviation

237
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,820
from your long-term targets are
the returns that would be

238
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,620
attributable to market timing.

239
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,250
And the third source of
returns has to do with

240
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,560
security selection.

241
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,500
So, you've got your allocation
to domestic equities.

242
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,230
If you buy the market -- and
the way that you buy the

243
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,510
market is to buy an index fund
that holds all the securities

244
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,000
in the market in the proportions
that they exist in

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,450
the market -- if you buy the
market, then your returns to

246
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,90
security selection are zero,
because your portfolio is

247
00:13:41,90 --> 00:13:43,412
going to perform in line
with the market.

248
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:47,820
But if you make security
selection bets, if you decide

249
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:53,300
that you want to try and beat
the market, then that bet or

250
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,180
that series of bets will
define your returns

251
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,640
attributable to security
selection.

252
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:05,350
So, if you decide that you think
the prospects of Ford

253
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,750
are superior to the prospects
of GM, well, you want to

254
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,620
overweight Ford and
underweight GM.

255
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,340
And if that turns out to be a
good bet and you're rewarded,

256
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,300
because Ford outperforms and
GM underperforms, then you

257
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,449
have a positive return to
security selection.

258
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,380
If the converse is true, then
you have a negative return to

259
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,280
security selection.

260
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,130
But one of the really important
facts about security

261
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,980
selection is that, if
you play for free,

262
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,970
it's a zero sum game.

263
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,450
Because if you've overweighted
Ford and underweighted GM,

264
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,490
there has to be some other
investor or group of investors

265
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,820
that are underweight Ford and
overweight GM, because this is

266
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,60
all relative to the market.

267
00:14:50,60 --> 00:14:54,459
And so, if you're overweight
Ford and underweight GM and

268
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,190
somebody else is underweight
Ford and overweight GM, well,

269
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,740
at the end of the day, the
amount by which the winner

270
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,910
wins equals the amount by
which the loser loses.

271
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,130
And so, it's a zero-sum game.

272
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,110
Of course, if you take into
account the fact that it costs

273
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,360
money to play the game,
it turns into a

274
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,710
negative-sum game.

275
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,880
And the negative-sum is the
amount that's siphoned off by

276
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,500
Wall Street.

277
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,700
And Wall Street takes its pound
of flesh in the form of

278
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,720
market impact, in the form of
commissions, in the form of

279
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,410
fees that are charged to manage
the portfolio actively,

280
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,500
and then sometimes there are
even fees to consultants to

281
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,460
choose the manager.

282
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,310
So, there's an enormous drain
from the system that causes

283
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:46,900
the active investment activity
to be a negative-sum game for

284
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,442
those investors that
decide to play.

285
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:54,860
So, let's take these in turn
and start out with asset

286
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,700
allocation.

287
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,710
Asset allocation is far and away
the most important tool

288
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,970
that we have available
to us as investors.

289
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:13,930
When I first started thinking
about this 25 years ago, I

290
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,000
thought, well, maybe there's
some financial law that says

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,100
that asset allocation is the
most important tool, because

292
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,860
it seems pretty obvious that
that was going to be the most

293
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,530
powerful determinant
of returns.

294
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,800
But it turns out, that it's not
really a law of finance

295
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,370
that asset allocation dominates
returns, it's a

296
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:38,160
behavioral result of how it
is that we as individual

297
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,770
investors, or we as
institutional investors,

298
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,110
manage our portfolios.

299
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,540
If I make it back to my office,
traversing these icy

300
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:59,20
sidewalks, I could take Yale's
$17 or $18 billion dollars and

301
00:16:59,20 --> 00:17:00,270
put it all in Google stock.

302
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,260


303
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,819
If I did that, I am not sure
how long I'd keep my job.

304
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,409
It might be fun for a while,
but that would probably be

305
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,240
damaging to my employment
prospects.

306
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,280
But if I did that, asset
allocation would have almost

307
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,910
nothing to say about
Yale's returns.

308
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,10
It would be the idiosyncratic
return associated with Google

309
00:17:25,10 --> 00:17:28,990
that would determine whether the
endowment went up or down

310
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,480
or stayed flat.

311
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,710
And so, security selection
would be the overwhelming

312
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:42,140
important determinant of returns
for Yale's endowment.

313
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,580
And if it wasn't exciting enough
to sell everything and

314
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,550
put it on Google stock, maybe
I could go back to my office

315
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:55,260
and start day trading
bond futures.

316
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,40
Well, if I took Yale's entire
$17 or $18 billion dollars and

317
00:18:00,40 --> 00:18:03,930
started trading bond futures
with it, asset allocation

318
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,690
would have very little to
say about Yale's return.

319
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,180
Security selection would
probably have very little to

320
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,20
say about Yale's return, so it
would all be about market

321
00:18:13,20 --> 00:18:14,660
timing ability.

322
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,120
And if I'm great at following
the trend -- the trend is your

323
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,129
friend -- of course, that's
true until it's not.

324
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,620
Or if I've got some sort of
marvelous scheme to outsmart

325
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,439
all the other smart people, who
are trading in the bond

326
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,550
market, I could generate
some nice returns.

327
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:39,710
But those returns would have
nothing to do with asset

328
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,930
allocation, nothing to do with
security selection, and

329
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,340
everything to do with
market timing.

330
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,899
Of course, these sound like
ridiculous things, right?

331
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,320
I mean, everybody in this room
knows, that I'm not going to

332
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,44
go back and put Yale's entire
endowment in one stock.

333
00:18:59,45 --> 00:19:03,140
And we also know, that I'm not
going to go back and day trade

334
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,670
futures with the endowment.

335
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,90
I'm going to go back, and the
portfolio is going to look a

336
00:19:09,90 --> 00:19:12,169
lot like it looked yesterday,
and the day before, and the

337
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:17,860
month before that, and the year
before that, because as

338
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,699
investors, whether we're
individual investors are

339
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,970
institutional investors, we
tend to have a sensible,

340
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,550
stable approach to
asset allocation.

341
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,590
And within the asset allocation
framework that we

342
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:40,30
employ, we tend to hold
well-diversified portfolios of

343
00:19:40,30 --> 00:19:44,450
securities within each
of the asset classes.

344
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,600
So, that means that asset
allocation is going to be the

345
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,719
predominant determinant
of returns.

346
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,940


347
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,252
Bob Shiller and I have a
colleague at the School of

348
00:19:58,252 --> 00:20:01,139
Management, Roger Ibbotson,
who's done a fair amount of

349
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,440
work looking at the
various sources

350
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,800
of returns for investors.

351
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,990
And a number of years ago, he
came out with a finding that

352
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,940
more than 90% of the variability
of returns in

353
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,600
institutional portfolios had
to do with the asset

354
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,695
allocation decision.

355
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:25,250
And that was a very widely
read, and widely accepted

356
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,70
conclusion.

357
00:20:27,70 --> 00:20:30,280
In that same study, I thought
that there was a more

358
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,110
interesting conclusion, and that
was that asset allocation

359
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:39,459
actually determined more than
100% of investor returns.

360
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,760
How could that be, how could
asset allocation determine

361
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,340
more than 100% of returns?

362
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,889
Well, it goes back to the
discussion that we had about

363
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,350
security selection and the fact
that it's not free to

364
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,600
play the game, and the
same thing's true

365
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,639
about market timing.

366
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,700
If somebody is overweighting
a particular asset class

367
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,280
relative to the long-term
targets that they've got,

368
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,160
well, there's got to
be an offsetting

369
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,470
position in the markets.

370
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,100
Market timing is expensive in
the same way that security

371
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,20
selection is expensive.

372
00:21:11,20 --> 00:21:17,990
And so, it, too, is a zero-sum
game, even though the analysis

373
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,190
that you'd apply to market
timing isn't quite as clear

374
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,300
and crisp as in the closed
system that you've got with

375
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,350
any individual securities
market.

376
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:33,40
So, if security selection
and market timing were

377
00:21:33,40 --> 00:21:39,510
negative-sum games, then asset
allocation would explain more

378
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,10
than 100% of the returns.

379
00:21:42,10 --> 00:21:47,690
And, on average, for the
community as a whole --

380
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,860
because investors do engage in
market timing, investors do

381
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,649
engage in security
selections --

382
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,50
those are going to be
negative-sum games, and you

383
00:21:56,50 --> 00:22:00,60
have to subtract the leakages
occurring because of security

384
00:22:00,60 --> 00:22:03,580
selection and market timing,
in order to get down to the

385
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,820
returns that you would get if
you just took your asset

386
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,280
allocation targets and
implemented them passively.

387
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,190


388
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:22,360
So, it turns out that asset
allocation is the most

389
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:32,409
important way that we express
our basic tenets of investment

390
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,950
philosophy.

391
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:39,470
I talked about the importance
of having an equity bias.

392
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,920
Well, these are some
of Ibbotson's data.

393
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,530
He's got this publication called
Stocks, Bonds, Bills,

394
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,620
and Inflation, although he
might have sold it to

395
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,179
Morningstar, so maybe it's
Morningstar's publication now.

396
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,740
And it actually is an outgrowth
of some academic

397
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,220
research that he did
decades ago.

398
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:11,60
And the basic drill was,
starting in 1925, looking at a

399
00:23:11,60 --> 00:23:12,899
number of asset classes --

400
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,720
the ones that I've got here are
Treasury bills, Treasury

401
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,650
bonds, large stocks, small
stocks, and then, as a

402
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,520
benchmark, inflation --

403
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,740
starting the investment at the
end of 1925, taking whatever

404
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,290
income was generated from that
investment, reinvesting it and

405
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,254
seeing where you end up at
the end of the period.

406
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:39,310
I've got here the numbers
from 1925 to 2009.

407
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,770
And if you did that with
Treasury bills, which are

408
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,970
short-term loans to the U.S.
government, one of the least

409
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,390
risky assets imaginable, you
would have ended up with 21

410
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,610
times your money over
the period.

411
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,679
If you think about that, 21
times your money, that's

412
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,410
pretty good.

413
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,440
But if you think about the fact
that inflation consumed a

414
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,790
multiple of 12, well,
you didn't end up

415
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,770
with a lot after inflation.

416
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,220
And if you're an institution
like Yale and you only want to

417
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,720
consume after-inflation returns,
so you can maintain

418
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,890
the purchasing power the
portfolio, well, 21 times, but

419
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,570
taking off 12 times for
inflation, not so good.

420
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,600
One of the interesting things
about the Stocks, Bonds,

421
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,40
Bills, and Inflation numbers
over long periods is that they

422
00:24:26,40 --> 00:24:30,220
correspond to our sense of the
relationship between the

423
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,360
riskiness of the asset, and the
notion that, if you except

424
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,120
more risk, you should
get higher returns.

425
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,530
And so, if you move up the risk
spectrum and, instead of

426
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,889
looking at Treasury bills, you
look at Treasury bonds, you

427
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,980
end up with a multiple
of 86 times.

428
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,550
That's pretty good, 86 times.

429
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:54,620
I mean, it's a lot better
than 21 times for bills.

430
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,570
It's still not a huge
return for decades

431
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,500
and decades of investing.

432
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,800
So, what happens if you move
away from lending money, in

433
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,889
this case lending money to the

434
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,940
government, to owning equities?

435
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,25
The multiple over this period --
and this includes the crash

436
00:25:16,25 --> 00:25:23,830
in 1929, the market collapse in
1987, and the most recent

437
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,949
financial crisis.

438
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,960
In spite of those blips, you
would've ended up with 2,592

439
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,370
times your money.

440
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,949
That's stunning, that's way
more than 86 times and way

441
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,170
more than 21 times.

442
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,90
So, over long periods of time,
you do end up being rewarded

443
00:25:43,90 --> 00:25:44,699
for accepting equity risk.

444
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,400
And what would've happened if
you would have put the money

445
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,60
in small stocks and
let her run?

446
00:25:49,60 --> 00:25:53,350
12,226 times your money.

447
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,730
So, the conclusion is
pretty obvious.

448
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,640
This notion that, if you've got
a long time horizon, you

449
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,10
want to expose your portfolio
to equities, it makes an

450
00:26:04,10 --> 00:26:05,936
enormous amount of sense.

451
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:09,429
As a matter of fact, the first
time I took a look at these

452
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:16,100
numbers was back in 1986,
when I was teaching --

453
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,209
probably a predecessor to the
class that Bob Shiller's

454
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:24,280
teaching, it was a lecture
class in finance --

455
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:32,100
and I was preparing the lecture
that had to do with

456
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,919
long-term investment
philosophy.

457
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,590
And that's when I first saw
these numbers, and I was

458
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,720
little bit disconcerted when
I put them together.

459
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,920
Because I thought, gee, 21 times
for bills, 86 times for

460
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,000
bonds, 12,226 times
for small stocks.

461
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,50
Maybe the right thing to do
is to just put the whole

462
00:26:55,50 --> 00:27:00,000
portfolio into small stocks
and forget about it.

463
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,900
And my first problem was that,
if that were true, what was I

464
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,790
going to say for the next
ten weeks of lectures?

465
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,300
My longer-term problem was,
that, if the investment

466
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,409
committee figured out, that all
we needed to do is put the

467
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,550
whole portfolio in small stocks,
and that that was the

468
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,629
way to investment success,
I wouldn't have a job.

469
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,280
They wouldn't need
me to do that.

470
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,500
And I had a wife and young
children, and I like getting a

471
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,675
paycheck and being able to
feed and house them.

472
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:30,850
So, I took a look at the data
more carefully, and there are

473
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:36,840
a number of examples of
what it is that I'm

474
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,860
going to talk about.

475
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,260
But the most profound example
remains around the

476
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,620
great crash in 1929.

477
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,639
And if you had your whole
portfolio in small stocks at

478
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,820
the peak, by the end of 1929,
you would have lost 54% of

479
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,620
your money.

480
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,520
By the end of 1930, you would
have lost another 38% of your

481
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,160
money, by the end of 1931,
you would have

482
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,110
lost another 50% percent.

483
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,139
And by June of 1932, for good
measure, you would've lost

484
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,330
another 32%.

485
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,540
So, for every dollar that you
had at the peak, at the trough

486
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,850
you would have had $0.10 left.

487
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,510
And it doesn't matter, whether
you're an investor with the

488
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,340
strongest stomach known to
mankind, or you're an

489
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,230
institutional investor with the
longest investment horizon

490
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,880
imaginable, at some point, when
the dollars are turning

491
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,630
into dimes, you're going to
say, this is a completely

492
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,20
ridiculous thing to accept this

493
00:28:42,20 --> 00:28:44,860
much risk in the portfolio.

494
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,310
I can't stand it.

495
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:51,899
I'm selling all my small stocks
and I'm going to buy

496
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,480
Treasury bonds or
Treasury bills.

497
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,780
And that's exactly
what people did.

498
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:04,180
And there was this sense in the
1930s, 1940s, even into

499
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:09,530
the '50s and '60s, that heavy
equity exposures weren't a

500
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,879
responsible thing
for a fiduciary.

501
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,910
When I was writing my book, I
was fooling around looking at

502
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,730
articles from the Saturday
Evening Post -- and I know

503
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,120
everybody here is too young to
have seen the Saturday Evening

504
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,229
Post when it was still
publishing, but you've all

505
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,900
seen Norman Rockwell
prints, right?

506
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,640
Well, he was famous for doing
covers for the Saturday

507
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,160
Evening Post. And there was this
article in the 1930s --

508
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,70
that's actually before my time,
so I was looking at

509
00:29:43,70 --> 00:29:45,620
things in the library, not
things that actually had been

510
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,639
delivered to my doorstep --

511
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,180
and the commentator said that it
was ridiculous that stocks

512
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,820
were called securities.

513
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,480
That they were so risky that
we should call stocks

514
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,490
insecurities.

515
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,960
There was just this visceral
dislike for the risks that

516
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,180
were associated with the stock
market, because it had caused

517
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,540
so many investors
so much pain.

518
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:19,629
So yes, stocks are a great thing
for investors with long

519
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:23,400
time horizons, but you need to
diversify, because you've got

520
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:29,410
to be able to live through
those inevitable periods,

521
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:35,920
where risky assets produce
results that are sometimes so

522
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,20
bad as to be frightening.

523
00:30:40,20 --> 00:30:43,770
Second source of return,
market timing.

524
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:50,960
A few years ago, a group of
former colleagues of mine gave

525
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,530
me a party at the Yale Club, and
they presented me with a

526
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:59,590
copy of Keynes's General
Theory --

527
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,230
because back, when I used to
teach a big finance class like

528
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:08,500
this, the last class always
involved reading from Keynes.

529
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,660
And I think Keynes is one of
the best authors about

530
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:18,460
investing and financial
markets, bar none.

531
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,100
I remember one of my students
telling me afterwards, that I

532
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,20
was reading from Keynes as if I
were reading from the Bible.

533
00:31:24,20 --> 00:31:28,490
And I had this paperback copy
that was falling apart, and my

534
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,830
former students remembered this
and they gave me this

535
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,360
beautiful first edition
of Keynes.

536
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,240
And I was on the train back from
New York, where the party

537
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:44,560
had occurred, to New Haven
and I found this quote.

538
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,250
"The idea of wholesale shifts
is, for various reasons,

539
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,180
impracticable and indeed
undesirable.

540
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,880
Most of those who attempt to,
sell too late and buy too late

541
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,20
and do both too often, incurring
heavy expenses" --

542
00:31:57,20 --> 00:31:59,740
there's that negative-sum game
thing -- "and developing too

543
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,140
unsettled and speculative a
state of mind." And as, in

544
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,380
most things, the data support
Keynes's conclusions.

545
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,990
Morningstar did a study of all
of the mutual funds in the

546
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,400
U.S. domestic equity market,
and there were 17

547
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,410
categories of funds.

548
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,630
And what they did with this
study is, they looked at 10

549
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,230
years of returns and compared
dollar-weighted returns to

550
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,810
time-weighted returns.

551
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,500
The time-weighted returns are
simply the returns that are

552
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,60
generated year in
and year out.

553
00:32:32,60 --> 00:32:34,780
If you get an offering
memorandum or a prospectus,

554
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,220
they'll show you the
time-weighted return.

555
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,910
If you look at the
advertisements, where Fidelity

556
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:47,70
is touting its latest, greatest
funds, the returns

557
00:32:47,70 --> 00:32:49,260
that you see are time-weighted
returns.

558
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,990
Dollar-weighted returns take
into account cash flow.

559
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,970
So, in a dollar-weighted return,
if investors put more

560
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,810
money into the fund in a
particular year, that year's

561
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,710
return will have a greater
weight in the calculation.

562
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,90
So, here we have all the mutual
funds in the U.S., 17

563
00:33:06,90 --> 00:33:09,310
categories, time-weighted
versus dollar-weighted.

564
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,840
In every one of those
categories, the

565
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,159
dollar-weighted returns
were less than the

566
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,900
time-weighted returns.

567
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,940
What does that mean?

568
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,630
That means, that investors
systematically made perverse

569
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:28,140
decisions, as to when to invest
and when to disinvest

570
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,350
from mutual funds.

571
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:37,100
What investors were doing, they
were buying in after a

572
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,340
fund had showed strong relative
performance and

573
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,159
selling after a fund had shown
poor relative performance.

574
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,670
So, they were systematically
buying high and selling low,

575
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,340
and it doesn't matter whether
you do that with great

576
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,310
enthusiasm and in great volume,
it's a really, really

577
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,679
bad way to make money.

578
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,210
Very difficult.

579
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:07,815
So, the conclusion for these
individuals that operate in

580
00:34:07,815 --> 00:34:12,760
the mutual fund market is that
their market timing decisions

581
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,275
were systematically perverse.

582
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:21,320
I also took a look at the top
10 internet funds during the

583
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,510
tech bubble, something I
published in my book for

584
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,70
individual investors.

585
00:34:27,70 --> 00:34:30,850
And if you looked at the top 10
internet funds three years

586
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,440
before and three years after the
bubble, the time weighted

587
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,786
return was 1.5% per year.

588
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:39,590
You look at that and you say,
1.5% per year, well, the

589
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,780
market went way up and way
down, but 1.5% per year,

590
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,760
that's not so bad.

591
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,420
No harm, no foul.

592
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:53,600
Investors invested $13.7 billion
and lost $9.9 billion,

593
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,870
so they lost 72% of what
they invested.

594
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,430
How could it be that they lost
72% of the money that they

595
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,149
invested, when the time-weighted
return was 1.5%

596
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,250
per year for six years?

597
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,160
Well, they weren't invested in
the internet funds in '97, and

598
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,000
they weren't invested in
'98, and they weren't

599
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,640
invested in early '99.

600
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,370
It was in late '99 and early
2000, that all the money piled

601
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,460
in at the very top.

602
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,50
And then, in 2001 and
2002, bitterly

603
00:35:23,50 --> 00:35:25,430
disappointed, they sold.

604
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,149
So, they lost 72% of what they
put in, even though the

605
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:34,640
time-weighted returns were
1.5% per year positive.

606
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:41,710
So, institutions don't get
a free pass either.

607
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:47,200
If you look at the crash in
October, 1987, which was an

608
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,310
extraordinary event --

609
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,170
I think, the calculation I did
put it at a 25 standard

610
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:59,400
deviation, which is essentially
an impossibility.

611
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,490
But however you measure it, it
was an extraordinary event.

612
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,740
And what happened on
October 19, 1987?

613
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,520
Well, stock markets the
world around went down

614
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,690
by more than 20%.

615
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,590
What people forget is, along
with the stock markets going

616
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,260
down, there was a huge
rally in government

617
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,680
bonds, flight to safety.

618
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,359
So, stocks were cheaper, bonds
were more expensive.

619
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,000
What did institutional
investors do?

620
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,440
Well, they got scared,
and they sold

621
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,310
stocks and bought bonds.

622
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,259
Same thing, buying high
and selling low.

623
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,610
As a matter of fact, endowments
took six years to

624
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:44,830
get their post-crash equity
allocations back up to where

625
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,700
they were before the crash,
arguably underweighted in

626
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,149
equities in the heart of one of
the greatest bull markets

627
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,610
of all time.

628
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,650
So, the teams of investors,
whether they're individual or

629
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:05,650
institutional, have this
perverse predilection to

630
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,530
chasing performance.

631
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,430
Buying something after it's
gone up, selling something

632
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,370
after it's gone down, and using
market timing to damage

633
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,490
portfolio returns.

634
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,750
The final tool that we have
available to us as investors

635
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,150
is security selection.

636
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:28,890
I cite a study in my book,
''Unconventional Success,''

637
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,60
conducted by Rob Arnott, that
does a very good job of

638
00:37:32,60 --> 00:37:36,170
looking at 20 years worth
of mutual fund returns.

639
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:41,690
And he says that there's about
a 14% chance that -- or

640
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,270
historically there was a 14%
chance -- of beating the

641
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:50,460
market after adjusting
for fees and taxes.

642
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,60
So, you think a zero-sum game
would be a coin flip, 50-50.

643
00:37:55,60 --> 00:37:57,950
But because of the leakages from
the system, and because

644
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,609
of taxes, the probability of
winning goes down to 14%.

645
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:08,280
But oh by the way, that
14% ignores two

646
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,350
very important things.

647
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,980
One is that a huge percentage
of mutual funds

648
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,600
have front-end loads.

649
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:19,360
If you call your friendly broker
to buy a mutual fund,

650
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,120
they'll extract a payment of
2% or 3% or 4% or 5% or 6%.

651
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,9
Those numbers aren't included,
so, if you included the loads,

652
00:38:27,10 --> 00:38:29,200
that would make the likelihood
of winning

653
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,879
substantially less than 14%.

654
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,490
But even more important is the
concept of survivorship bias.

655
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,830
If you look at 20 years worth
of returns, the only returns

656
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,69
you can look at are the returns
of the funds that

657
00:38:41,70 --> 00:38:43,40
survived for 20 years.

658
00:38:43,40 --> 00:38:46,140
Well, which funds
didn't survive?

659
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,480
Almost always, the
funds that don't

660
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,540
survive are the failures.

661
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,300
So, you're only looking
at the winners.

662
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,810
If you look at the winners and
you only have a 14% chance, if

663
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:02,390
you take into account the
losers, that 14% chance has to

664
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,740
go to, essentially, zero.

665
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,200
And is survivorship bias an
important phenomenon?

666
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,819
It is.

667
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:15,140
The Center for Research in
Securities Prices has a

668
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,770
survivorship bias-free U.S.
mutual fund database, meaning

669
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:24,509
that it tracks the
funds that fail.

670
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:29,10
There were 30,361 funds
in the database.

671
00:39:29,10 --> 00:39:32,840
19,129 were living.

672
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,900
11,232 were dead.

673
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:44,970
So, more than a third of the
funds in this survivorship

674
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,40
bias-free database were
ones that had died.

675
00:39:48,40 --> 00:39:52,980
And they died mostly,
because they failed.

676
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,860
And that's kind of an honorable
way to die.

677
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,710
There are other ways to die.

678
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,870
If you're a big mutual fund
complex like Fidelity and

679
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:04,620
you've got an underperforming
fund, what you tend to do is

680
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,259
something like, oh, let's merge
that into this fund that

681
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,780
has good performance.

682
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,660
And guess what happens?

683
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,180
Fidelity loses a fund that has
bad performance, and one that

684
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,390
has good performance has more
assets, because they merge the

685
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,350
underperforming fund into it,
and makes them look like

686
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,819
they're a more successful
fund management firm.

687
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,280
There's one other aspect of
security selection that's

688
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:34,670
important, an aspect other
than the fact that it's a

689
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:39,120
negative-sum game that's
very tough for

690
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,290
practitioners to win.

691
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,70
And that has to do with the
degree of opportunity that

692
00:40:46,70 --> 00:40:48,770
you've got in various
asset classes.

693
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,680
A number of years ago, I wanted
to come up with a way

694
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,220
of identifying, in an analytical
manner, where it is

695
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,140
that we could find the most
attractive investment

696
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,310
opportunities.

697
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:05,500
And, as far as I know, financial
economists haven't

698
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:13,160
determined a way to directly
measure, how efficient

699
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,950
individual markets are.

700
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:20,359
So, I took a look at
distributions of returns for

701
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,190
various asset classes.

702
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:26,370
And I had this notion that,
if a market priced assets

703
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:32,470
efficiently, the distribution
of returns around the market

704
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,790
return would be very tight.

705
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,910
Why would that be?

706
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,930
Well, if somebody makes a big
bet in an efficient market, by

707
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:46,290
definition, whether that
succeeds or fails has to do

708
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,400
with more luck than sense.

709
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,350
Because the premise is, that
these assets are efficiently

710
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,529
priced, and you don't make a big
win on a big bet, unless

711
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,150
there's an inefficiency that
you're exploiting.

712
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,680
So, if you're making big bets
in an efficiently priced

713
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,810
market, you might win one year
and gather more assets, and

714
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,950
you might win another year and
gather more assets, but,

715
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,990
ultimately, your luck is
going to run out and

716
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,209
you're going to fail.

717
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,250
And then, people will fire
you, and you'll lose your

718
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,800
assets, and lose your
income stream.

719
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,280
So, the right thing to do in an
efficiently priced market

720
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,700
is to hug the benchmark.

721
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,379
People call it Closet
Indexing, look

722
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,960
like everybody else.

723
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,720
And we're human beings, we don't
like firing people and

724
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,250
we don't like admitting
we're wrong.

725
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,760
And so, if somebody has
market-like performance, and

726
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,780
maybe it's not all that
outstanding, say, OK fine,

727
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,870
we'll just continue with this
particular investment

728
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:52,120
strategy, even though it's not
doing great things, at least

729
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,40
it's not doing terrible
things.

730
00:42:54,40 --> 00:42:57,290
On the other end of the
spectrum, maybe there's not

731
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,500
even a market that you
can match with

732
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,250
your investment strategy.

733
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,200
I mean, think about
venture capital.

734
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,9
I mean, how is it that you could
index venture capital?

735
00:43:10,10 --> 00:43:12,950
You can't, that's a bunch of
private partnerships and a

736
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,240
bunch of idiosyncratic
enterprises.

737
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,240
And even if you wanted to, you
couldn't match the market.

738
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,209
So, you're forced to go out and
forge your own path, and

739
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:30,770
live and die by the decisions
that you make.

740
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,690
So, how does this thought piece

741
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:37,170
translate into real numbers?

742
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,690
So again, we're looking at 10
years worth of returns for

743
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,000
various asset classes.

744
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,500
I look at the difference between
the top quartile

745
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,610
manager and the bottom
quartile --

746
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,890
the difference between first and
third [correction: fourth]

747
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,310
quartile, you can use
any measure of

748
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,880
distribution that you want.

749
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,290
And in the bond market, which
is probably the most

750
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,350
efficiently priced of all
markets -- and the reason it's

751
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,759
most efficiently priced
is, because bonds

752
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,430
are just math, right?

753
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,609
You've got coupons, you've
got principal, you've got

754
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:08,140
probabilities of default, it's
the most easily analyzed of

755
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,60
all the assets in
which we invest.

756
00:44:10,60 --> 00:44:12,320
The difference between top
quartile and bottom quartile

757
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,850
is 0.50% per annum.

758
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,549
Almost nothing.

759
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,880
All bond managers are jammed
together right in the heart of

760
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,830
the distribution, because if
they were out there making

761
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,740
crazy bets and generating
returns that were

762
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,879
fundamentally different from the
market, they'd be in that

763
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,110
category of, yes, sure, it's
great, when it works, but when

764
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,150
it doesn't, you're dead.

765
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,70
Large cap stocks, less
efficiently priced than bonds,

766
00:44:41,70 --> 00:44:43,820
but still pretty efficiently
priced, two percentage points

767
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,460
per annum difference first to
third [correction: fourth]

768
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,130
quartile over 10 years.

769
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,10
Foreign stocks, less efficiently
priced than those

770
00:44:50,10 --> 00:44:53,890
in the domestic markets,
four points per year.

771
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:57,29
Then you move into the hedge
fund world, the part of the

772
00:44:57,30 --> 00:45:01,590
hedge fund world that we call
absolute return at Yale, 7.1

773
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,120
percentage points, first to
third [correction: fourth]

774
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,160
quartile.

775
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,839
Real estate, much less
efficiently priced than

776
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,290
marketable securities, 9.3
percentage points, top to

777
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,9
bottom quartile.

778
00:45:12,10 --> 00:45:18,960
Leveraged buyouts, 13.7%
difference, top quartile to

779
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,450
bottom quartile.

780
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:25,669
And the venture capital, 43.2
percentage points difference,

781
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,980
top to bottom quartile.

782
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:33,220
So, the measure that we have
here of market inefficiency

783
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:38,919
points us toward spending our
time and energy trying to find

784
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,400
the best venture capital
managers, trying to find the

785
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,230
best leveraged buyout managers,
and spending far

786
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,650
less of our time and energy
trying to beat the bond market

787
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,760
or beat the stock market.

788
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,340
Because, even if you win there,
even if you end up in

789
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,600
the top quartile, you're not
adding an enormous amount of

790
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,910
value relative to what you would
have had, if you just

791
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,890
would have bought the market.

792
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:08,230
So, with that background, let's
revisit the criticisms

793
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,150
that Barron's leveled
at the Yale Model

794
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,340
and the Swensen Approach.

795
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,950
First of all, they talk about
diversification failing.

796
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:25,879
And the fact is that, in a
panic, only two things matter:

797
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,540
risk and safety.

798
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,900
And I saw this in 1987, saw it
in 1998 with the collapse of

799
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,70
Long Term Capital, and saw it in
2008 in a way that was even

800
00:46:38,70 --> 00:46:41,580
more profound than
in '87 and '98.

801
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:47,490
Investors sold everything that
had risk associated with it to

802
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,720
buy U.S. Treasuries.

803
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,759
Safety was all that mattered.

804
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,880
And of course, in that narrow
window of time,

805
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,150
diversification does fail.

806
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,710
The only diversification that
would matter in that instance

807
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,770
is owning U.S. Treasuries.

808
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,890
But if you owned a substantial
amount of U.S. Treasury bonds

809
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,950
-- and what's a substantial
amount?

810
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,910
25%, 30%, 35% of
your portfolio.

811
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,540
Then, under normal
circumstances, under the

812
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,259
circumstances, in which we live
most of our lives, you're

813
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,890
paying a huge opportunity
cost.

814
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:35,910
So, you could have a portfolio
with 30% in U.S. Treasuries,

815
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,940
and year in and year out you
would pay this opportunity

816
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,400
cost. And then, when the crisis
comes, you can be happy

817
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,730
for six or 12 or 18 months, and
then you go back to paying

818
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:52,160
the opportunity cost. And I
would argue that, if you

819
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:59,430
expand your time horizon to a
sensible length of time, that

820
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:04,100
the strategy, where you hold
relatively little in the high

821
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,710
opportunity cost U.S.
Treasuries, is the best

822
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:12,410
strategy for a long-term
investor.

823
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:16,310
And there are those, who say
that, well, diversification

824
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,970
doesn't protect you in
times of crisis.

825
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:18,669
What does it matter?

826
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,30
Why would you want
to diversify?

827
00:48:21,30 --> 00:48:22,280
Well, think about Japan.

828
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,480


829
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,150
If you were local Japanese
investor and you wanted to

830
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:32,420
have an equity bias in your
portfolio -- so, you owned

831
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,730
lots of Japanese stocks --

832
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:38,740
in 1989, at the end of the year,
the Nikkei closed at

833
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,640
about 38,000.

834
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,420
At the end of 2009, 20
years later, the

835
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,630
Nikkei closed at 10,500.

836
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:51,530
So, with your long time horizon
and equity bias in

837
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,730
your portfolio over
two decades, you

838
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,120
would have lost 73%.

839
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,640
So, diversification makes an
enormous amount of sense in

840
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:08,390
the long run, even if there are
occasional panics, where

841
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,40
you're disappointed that the
diversified approach that you

842
00:49:12,40 --> 00:49:18,930
had to managing the portfolio
didn't produce results.

843
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:21,430
The second criticism,
overemphasis on alternatives.

844
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,779
Let's just look at the last
decade in Yale's portfolio.

845
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,700
Over the 10 years ended June
30, 2010, domestic equities

846
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,730
produced returns of negative
0.7% per year, bonds produced

847
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:39,260
returns of 5.9% per year.

848
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,270
Let's look at the alternatives,
as opposed to

849
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,400
domestic marketable
securities.

850
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,900
Private equity, 6.2% per year,
real estate, 6.9% per year,

851
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,880
absolute return, 11.1% per year,
timber, 12.1% per year,

852
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,210
and oil and gas,
24.7% per year.

853
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,990
I think the numbers speak
for themselves.

854
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:06,770
If you have a sensibly long
time horizon, these basic

855
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,610
principles of equity
orientation and

856
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:13,310
diversification make an enormous
amount of sense.

857
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:19,330
And if you look at the bottom
line, which is performance,

858
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:26,200
when I began managing Yale's
endowment in 1985, it was less

859
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,750
than $1 billion.

860
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,970
The amount that we distributed
to support Yale's operations

861
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,629
that year was $45
million dollars.

862
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,250
For the year ended June 30,
2010, the endowment stood at a

863
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,780
little bit above $16
billion dollars.

864
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,850
The amount that we distributed
to Yale's

865
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,650
operations was $1.1 billion.

866
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:52,920
So, an enormous positive
change over 25 years.

867
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,550
If you look at Yale's
performance over the last 10

868
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:01,430
years, it's still better
than that of any other

869
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,299
institutional investor,
8.9% per annum.

870
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,120
And that compares to an average
for colleges and

871
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,920
universities of about
4.0% per annum.

872
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,40
And that translates into $7.9
billion of added value,

873
00:51:18,40 --> 00:51:20,810
relative to where we would have
been had we had average

874
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,490
returns over the
past 10 years.

875
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:27,125
And the comparable numbers for
20 years are Yale at 13.1% per

876
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:32,810
annum, again, the best record of
any institutional investor

877
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,450
in the United States.

878
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,790
Relative to an average for
colleges and universities of

879
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:43,850
8.8% per annum, and $12.1
billion of value added.

880
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:49,270
So, the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune.

881
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,60


882
00:51:52,60 --> 00:51:58,240
I would suggest that the
Barron's articles really took

883
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,810
far too short a time horizon.

884
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:05,870
And looking at Yale's
performance and then looking

885
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:11,990
at the Yale Model, which
emphasizes a portfolio that's

886
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:17,20
well diversified and has
a strong equity bias.

887
00:52:17,20 --> 00:52:20,960
And I think if we were back in
this room five years or 10

888
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,60
years from now, we'll see that
the portfolio will continue to

889
00:52:26,60 --> 00:52:30,130
produce the same kind of strong
long-run results as it

890
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:33,70
has for the past 10, 20 years.

891
00:52:33,70 --> 00:52:36,110
With that, I'd love to answer
any questions that you might

892
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:59,330
have.

893
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,480
STUDENT: How is your job similar
or different to what a

894
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,260
hedge fund manager would do?

895
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,530
And what are the concerns that
an institutional investor has

896
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,750
to have, versus a personal
investor, a wealthy

897
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,685
individual?

898
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:16,610
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: So,
the fundamental difference

899
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,990
between what we would be doing
at Yale, as opposed to a hedge

900
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:26,569
fund manager, or a domestic
stock manager, or a buyout

901
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:30,240
manager, is that we're
essentially one step removed

902
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,80
from the security selection
process.

903
00:53:33,80 --> 00:53:38,500
So, our job is to find the best
hedge fund managers, find

904
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,920
the best domestic equity
managers, find the best buyout

905
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:47,430
managers, and put together
partnerships that work for

906
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:52,620
them and work for
the university.

907
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,970
And it's a tricky thing to
do, because, in the funds

908
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:02,799
management world, there are
all sorts of issues with

909
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,450
respect to what economists
call the

910
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,839
principal-agent problem.

911
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:16,440
And we're principals for the
university engaging agents,

912
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,710
the hedge fund managers or the
buyout managers, and trying to

913
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:26,600
find ways to get those agents
to act primarily in the

914
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,310
university's interests, to get
rid of those agency issues.

915
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:37,420
And it's a challenge, but a
fascinating challenge, because

916
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:42,720
in doing this, you end up
meeting an enormous number of

917
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,509
incredibly intelligent,
engaged, thoughtful

918
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:51,280
individuals that are
involved in the

919
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,100
funds management business.

920
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:58,540
And it's a fabulous career, at
least from my perspective,

921
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,210
because I get to do this and
do it to benefit one of the

922
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,680
world's great institutions,
Yale.

923
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,730
In terms of differences between
individuals and

924
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:14,690
institutions, there's some
structural differences.

925
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,300
We don't pay taxes.

926
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,350
And taxes are an enormously
important determinant of

927
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,650
investment outcomes
for individuals.

928
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:29,510
As an individual, you want to
avoid paying taxes or defer

929
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:33,770
paying taxes, because taxes
are just a huge drag on

930
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:34,560
investment returns.

931
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,799
We don't have to worry about
that, by and large, in

932
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,830
managing Yale's portfolio.

933
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:44,950
Another very fundamental
difference has to do with the

934
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,930
resources that we
can bring to the

935
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,890
investment management problem.

936
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:55,80
Most individuals, and many
institutions, just don't have

937
00:55:55,80 --> 00:56:02,650
the wherewithal, either the
background or the time, to

938
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,20
make high quality active
management decisions.

939
00:56:06,20 --> 00:56:08,580
Markets are incredibly tough.

940
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:13,850
Beating those markets is an

941
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,319
incredibly difficult challenge.

942
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:21,790
And doing it, by spending a
couple of hours on a weekend

943
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:25,560
once a month, isn't
going to cut it.

944
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:31,130
And so at Yale, we've got
20, 21, 22 investment

945
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:34,320
professionals, who are
dedicating their careers to

946
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,380
trying to make these high
quality active management

947
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,600
decisions, so we can go out
and have a decent shot at

948
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,880
beating the domestic stock
market and the foreign stock

949
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,330
market, and putting together a
superior portfolio of venture

950
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:50,920
capital partnerships and
hedge fund managers.

951
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:58,130
And over the past five, 10, 15,
20 years, we've produced

952
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,460
market-beating results.

953
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:04,670
In contrast, an individual has
almost no chance of beating

954
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:06,390
the market.

955
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:09,89
So I've written two books,
one, Pioneering Portfolio

956
00:57:09,90 --> 00:57:12,200
Management that talks about
how it is that, I think,

957
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,270
institutions should manage
their portfolio.

958
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,660
And if they've got the resources
-- and it's not just

959
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,960
dollars, it's the human
resources --

960
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,640
to make those high quality
decisions.

961
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,480
They can follow what Barron's
referred to as the Yale Model

962
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,220
or the Swensen Approach.

963
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:32,839
But the book that I've written
ostensibly for individuals,

964
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,990
but it's really individuals and
institutions that don't

965
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:42,390
have the same resources that
Yale does to make these high

966
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:45,850
quality active decisions.

967
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,750
That book says, basically, what
you should do, is come up

968
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:53,190
with a sensible asset allocation
policy, and, then,

969
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:58,510
implement it using index funds,
which are low-cost ways

970
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,280
of mimicking the market.

971
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,380
And oh, by the way, because they
have very low turnover,

972
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,590
generate very little in terms
of tax consequences for the

973
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,950
holders of those funds.

974
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:15,399
So, it's kind of an interesting
world, where the

975
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,430
right solution is either one
extreme or the other extreme.

976
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:25,520
You're either completely
passive or you're

977
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,509
aggressively active.

978
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,280
But as in most things, most
people are kind of in the

979
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,550
middle, right?

980
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:37,330
They're neither aggressively
active nor completely passive,

981
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,740
but in the middle you lose.

982
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:44,359
Because you end up paying high
fees for mediocre active

983
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,970
results, and that's where most
people end up, and most

984
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:50,220
institutions.

985
00:58:50,220 --> 00:59:03,390


986
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:07,629
STUDENT: Hi, so, my question
is about -- given you were

987
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,815
talking about your equity
orientation and bias, and

988
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:14,920
given what's going on right
now with the stock market,

989
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,180
just what your views are.

990
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,299
Whether or not the stock market
is currently expensive,

991
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,430
and whether or not you have any
money in tech stocks, with

992
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,940
all the valuations and
IPOs that have been

993
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,70
going in that space.

994
00:59:26,70 --> 00:59:27,60
What do you think about that?

995
00:59:27,60 --> 00:59:31,620
And also, what would you do in
terms of investing it in

996
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,640
response to what your view is?

997
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,890
Thank you.

998
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:39,410
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: So, one
of the great things about

999
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:44,620
having a diversified portfolio
is that you can worry less

1000
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,660
about the relative level of
valuation of various assets in

1001
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:52,799
which you invest. So, if you
go back to the mid-'80s and

1002
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:58,420
you've got a portfolio that's
50% in domestic stocks, you

1003
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,380
have to worry a lot about the
valuation of that portfolio,

1004
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,980
because half of your
assets are in that

1005
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,460
single asset class.

1006
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,960
But if you've got a
well-diversified portfolio

1007
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,690
with, let's say, minimum
allocation of 5% to 10%, and

1008
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:16,180
now a maximum allocation of 25%
to 30% in an individual

1009
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:22,120
asset class, the relative
valuation of each of those

1010
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,460
asset classes matters less.

1011
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:31,947
And there's another
nice aspect to

1012
01:00:31,947 --> 01:00:34,890
a rebalancing policy.

1013
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:40,790
If you set up your targets and
you faithfully adhere to

1014
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,40
those targets --

1015
01:00:42,40 --> 01:00:45,110


1016
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:48,140
Suppose, the domestic equities
have poor relative

1017
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:49,270
performance.

1018
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:53,360
Well, then you're going to buy
domestic equities to get them

1019
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,960
back up to target, selling
whatever it is that had

1020
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,980
superior relative performance
to fund those purchases.

1021
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,725
And vice versa.

1022
01:01:00,725 --> 01:01:04,20
If domestic equities have great
relative performance,

1023
01:01:04,20 --> 01:01:09,190
you'll be selling to get back
to your long-term target and

1024
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:12,790
buying other assets that have
shown poor relative

1025
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:14,50
performance.

1026
01:01:14,50 --> 01:01:17,860
So, if you're in a circumstance,
where domestic

1027
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:23,370
stocks are expensive, where
you're selling into this

1028
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:28,299
superior relative performance
that the domestic equities are

1029
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,950
exhibiting, thereby maintaining
your risk exposure

1030
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:41,319
at a level that's consistent
with what's implicit in your

1031
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,10
policy asset allocation.

1032
01:01:43,10 --> 01:01:47,570
So, that's kind of a long way
of saying, that, if somebody

1033
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,310
asked me whether stocks are
expensive or cheap, my first

1034
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,259
line of defense, it doesn't
really matter all that much to

1035
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,960
me, because we're
well-diversified and because

1036
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,220
we do a great job
of rebalancing.

1037
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:02,240
But the reality is that those
questions are just incredibly

1038
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,700
tough to answer.

1039
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,339
If they were easier to answer,
I guess I'd be much more

1040
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:14,160
excited about market timing as
a way to generate returns.

1041
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,950
In terms of the second question,
with respect to

1042
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:24,319
technology, Yale's had a
long-standing commitment to

1043
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,970
venture capital.

1044
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:30,500
And over the decades, it's
produced extraordinary returns

1045
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,10
for the university.

1046
01:02:32,10 --> 01:02:38,240
And we continue to have a
world-class group of venture

1047
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:38,870
capitalists.

1048
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:44,700
We've got exposure to companies
like LinkedIn and

1049
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,549
Facebook and Groupon.

1050
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:51,540
And I hope that this wave of
IPOs that people are writing

1051
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,270
about in the press actually
occurs, because that would be

1052
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,730
very good for the university's
portfolio.

1053
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,200
It's been a long time, right?

1054
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,629
We benefited enormously in the
internet bubble in the late

1055
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:08,120
90s, and the last decade
has been a bit fallow.

1056
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,140
We also find, on the marketable
securities side,

1057
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:17,299
that technology stocks tend to
be less efficiently priced

1058
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,180
than many other securities.

1059
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:24,430
And so, we have a manager that
is heavily focused on

1060
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,120
information technology stocks
and another manager that's

1061
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,759
very heavily focused on
biotechnology stocks.

1062
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,590
And both those managers have
produced very handsome

1063
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,130
absolute and relative returns.

1064
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:37,580
And that's an important
part of our

1065
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,830
domestic equity strategy.

1066
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:48,720


1067
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,970
STUDENT: Thanks for coming.

1068
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:53,109


1069
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:56,300
So, in recent years, the number
of hedge funds, private

1070
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,590
equity firms, has gone up.

1071
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:02,30
And I wasn't sure, how that's
changed the efficiencies of

1072
01:04:02,30 --> 01:04:05,920
these alternative asset
allocation markets.

1073
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,210
And if it's changed the
efficiencies, how have you

1074
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:11,940
changed your investment
philosophies?

1075
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,150
And I was wondering, also,
what are the structural

1076
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:18,820
patterns of these markets that
would prevent the market from

1077
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:23,520
becoming very efficient, even if
there are a lot hedge funds

1078
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,90
and a lot of funds of funds.

1079
01:04:25,90 --> 01:04:27,100
Thanks.

1080
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,89
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: That's
a really good question.

1081
01:04:30,90 --> 01:04:34,190
I think, the most fundamental
issue with the explosion of

1082
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:37,630
hedge funds and the explosion of
private equity funds has to

1083
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:41,170
do with this negative-sum game
that we were talking about.

1084
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:47,700
If you go back to the 1950s,
the most common way that

1085
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,230
institutional assets were
managed would be for an

1086
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:54,790
institution like Yale
to go to a bank like

1087
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,570
Chemical Bank or JP Morgan.

1088
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:03,740
And they would pay a small
fraction of 1% for a

1089
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:07,705
reasonably diversified
portfolio, stocks, bonds, and

1090
01:05:07,705 --> 01:05:10,529
there'd probably be some foreign
stocks, and some

1091
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,410
domestic stocks.

1092
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:16,750
But the leakage from the
system was very small.

1093
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:20,760
You look at hedge funds and
private equity funds, they're

1094
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,910
essentially dealing with the
same set of securities that an

1095
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:28,910
institution used to pay two
tenths of a percent a year, or

1096
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:35,109
three tenths of a percent a
year for admittedly sleepy

1097
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,000
bank management.

1098
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,550
But it's the same set
of securities.

1099
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:43,160
Now, those securities are traded
in a hedge fund format,

1100
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:47,839
or taken in a private
equity fund format.

1101
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:53,350
And the fees that you are paying
are a point, a point

1102
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:56,509
and a half, two points.

1103
01:05:56,510 --> 01:06:00,10
The typical ''two and 20.''
And you're paying a

1104
01:06:00,10 --> 01:06:03,120
significant percentage
of the profits.

1105
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:07,549
The 20 in the ''two and 20.''
Think about that.

1106
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:14,120
The leakage from the system that
goes to Wall Street is

1107
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:17,490
enormous, compared to what it
was 10 years ago, or 20 years

1108
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:18,899
ago, or 30 years ago.

1109
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:25,830
So, there's that much less
left for us as investors.

1110
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:30,779
And I think that has huge
consequences for endowments,

1111
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:35,230
foundations, pension plans,
institutions of all stripes.

1112
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:38,50
And to the extent that
individuals get exposure to

1113
01:06:38,50 --> 01:06:40,140
these types of assets -- and
they're largely wealthy

1114
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:44,20
individuals that end up getting
the exposure --

1115
01:06:44,20 --> 01:06:50,466
they're going to suffer the same
consequences of this huge

1116
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:54,200
leakage of higher fees
and the profits

1117
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,870
interest to Wall Street.

1118
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:02,120
The question as to whether or
not the money flowing to hedge

1119
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,484
funds is going to make the
markets more efficient and

1120
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:05,740
take away opportunities --

1121
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,370
I don't worry too
much about that.

1122
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:11,140
I think, the best talent is
going to hedge funds, because

1123
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:15,109
if they're in a long only
domestic equity environment,

1124
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:17,570
maybe they can charge three
quarters of a percent or a

1125
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:20,400
percent, or if they're in the
mutual fund world, maybe they

1126
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,430
charge a percent and a half,
or something like that.

1127
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,299
Well, you'd rather have ''two
and 20'' than 0.75, right?

1128
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,510
That's easy.

1129
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,810
So, there's a huge migration
of talent to

1130
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:35,200
the hedge fund world.

1131
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,799
But what I care about, when
I look at the degree of

1132
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,200
investment opportunities, is
this dispersion we talked

1133
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:48,189
about, and I haven't seen the
dispersion of results, top

1134
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,490
quartile to bottom quartile,
compress at all.

1135
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:57,229
So, I don't think, that we're
increasing the efficiency of

1136
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,600
the pricing of assets.

1137
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,860
I still need to go out there and
be able to identify people

1138
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:06,430
in the top quartile or top
decile, so that we can win

1139
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:11,520
relative to the markets, after
adjustment for the

1140
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,90
risk that we take.

1141
01:08:13,90 --> 01:08:19,229
So, as long as we have plenty of
dispersion in the results,

1142
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:22,894
it's still an interesting
activity for us to pursue.

1143
01:08:22,894 --> 01:08:29,914


1144
01:08:29,913 --> 01:08:31,854
STUDENT: Can I ask?

1145
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:32,950
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN:
It better be good,

1146
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,63
it's the last question.

1147
01:08:35,63 --> 01:08:38,590
STUDENT: I'll try.

1148
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:41,200
So, my question is about
performance of the Yale

1149
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:47,260
portfolio, and we heard that
it grew from less than $1

1150
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,810
billion -- but close to
it, apparently --

1151
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:54,319
in 1985, to $16 billion, which
is very impressive.

1152
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:59,170
And it's documented in
newspapers, it's online,

1153
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:02,80
Wikipedia, Professor
Shiller introduced

1154
01:09:02,80 --> 01:09:04,979
you with these facts.

1155
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:07,800
But what about the
Sharpe ratio?

1156
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:12,850
And why do you think that people
talk more about total

1157
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:16,674
returns than, say,
the Sharpe ratio?

1158
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:19,69
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: So, I
think that one of the things

1159
01:09:19,69 --> 01:09:23,229
that needs to happen in the
funds management world is,

1160
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:26,609
that we need to have better
measures of risk.

1161
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:31,420
And so, one of the reasons,
why I don't talk about the

1162
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:34,764
Sharpe ratio, is, that just
looking at standard deviation

1163
01:09:34,764 --> 01:09:41,330
of returns doesn't capture
risk in a way that is

1164
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:41,950
meaningful.

1165
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:44,620
I mean, I've seen other people
do an analysis of the Yale

1166
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:47,430
portfolio, and show relative
Sharpe ratios.

1167
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:52,890
And, obviously, because our
returns have been so good, if

1168
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:57,810
you just look at the pattern
of those returns, we end up

1169
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:04,650
scoring high when looking at
Sharpe ratios across different

1170
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:06,339
institutional portfolios.

1171
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:16,770
But the risks that exist in the
portfolio aren't really

1172
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:21,650
captured by the standard
deviation of the returns.

1173
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:27,740
Just a quick example: If you
look at real estate, or

1174
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:33,150
timber, or even any of our
illiquid assets, they're

1175
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,469
appraised relatively
infrequently.

1176
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:42,260
There tends to be a huge
stability bias in the

1177
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,790
appraisals.

1178
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:49,50
If somebody looks at a piece of
real estate 12 months ago,

1179
01:10:49,50 --> 01:10:52,540
six months ago, and today,
they're likely to see pretty

1180
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,890
much the same thing that they
saw over that period.

1181
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:58,790
You can compare and contrast
that to the volatility they've

1182
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:01,170
got in the stock market.

1183
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:04,740
I think Bob Shiller deserves
credit for coining the term

1184
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:09,340
"excess volatility." There's no
question that stock prices

1185
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:15,370
are way more variable than they
need to be to adjust for

1186
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:17,720
changes in the underlying
fundamentals.

1187
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,470
So, if you've got a portfolio
that's largely marketable

1188
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:24,320
securities, you're going to
see a lot more standard

1189
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:28,160
deviation of returns than if
you've got one of illiquid

1190
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:32,380
assets, where you've got this
stability built in because of

1191
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:35,890
the appraisal nature of
the valuation process.

1192
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:42,10
And if you end up comparing
those two portfolios, one

1193
01:11:42,10 --> 01:11:44,310
dominated by marketable
securities, one dominated by

1194
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:48,800
private assets, you're going to
end up with measures that

1195
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,360
are apples and oranges.

1196
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,130
Thank you very much.

1197
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:53,660
[APPLAUSE]

1198
01:11:53,660 --> 01:12:26,999
