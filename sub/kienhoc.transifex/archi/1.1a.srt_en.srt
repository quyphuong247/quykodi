K. MICHAEL HAYS: I'm in Gund Hall, which is the home of the Graduate

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,630
School of Design.

3
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,900
And I'm in the studio space, which is where the most intense activity takes

4
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,110
place of design, of analysis and research, of imagination.

5
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,660
We'll speak about the architectural imagination.

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,920
And I'm going to suggest that some concept like the imagination

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,530
is necessary if we want to treat architecture as a mode of knowledge.

8
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,200
The classical philosophers said, the soul

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,360
never thinks without phantasm, which is to say that thought needs a material

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,690
image, something to carry the thought.

11
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,970
So we begin to think of the imagination as bridging the gap between perception

12
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,200
and understanding.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,190
What's implied is that there is actually a space in the mind

14
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,030
where the work of picturing takes place.

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,540
The imagination is different from other mental processes

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,880
like perceiving or remembering insofar as to perceive something requires

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,950
that something has to be there.

18
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,050
And that's not required of the imagination.

19
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,950
And even to remember something-- the event or the object or the person--

20
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,120
it had to have already been there in order to remember.

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,640
But the imagination creates its image.

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,500
The image isn't there until the imagination produces it.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,080
The imagination is also different from a concept

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,500
because the imagination requires the materialization of thought.

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,110
For example, I can conceptualize freedom.

26
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,710
I can even explain to you what freedom is as a concept.

27
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,020
But it's very difficult to show you freedom.

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,290
In order to show you freedom, I would have to construct a picture.

29
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,180
I would have to construct a scene.

30
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,650
Then I could help you imagine freedom in that materialization, in that scene,

31
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,610
in that picturing.

32
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,120
So we should think of the imagination as the capacity

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,640
for producing images, the mental capacity to picture things.

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,740
And what we want to show is that there is a specific kind of imagination,

35
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,320
which is the architectural imagination.

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,037
Look at these two images.

37
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:29,620
Let's say you know nothing about them.

38
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,203
You don't know what their function is.

39
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:32,950
You don't know who their patron was.

40
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,420
You don't know where they are.

41
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,960
But you can already start to compare them nevertheless.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,530
One is made of stone.

43
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,740
The other one is made of white stuff and glass, probably wood or steel.

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,600
Look at how they meet the ground.

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,460
One is nestled into the ground.

46
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,550
It almost seems to be emerging from the earth.

47
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,350
Indeed, some scholars would say that it even compares itself to the landscape

48
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,730
and to the mountains around it.

49
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,890
It almost wants to become like a mountain.

50
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,190
Now, the other one is also very conscious of the landscape,

51
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,840
but it's lifted off the earth.

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,260
It doesn't emerge from the earth, but it kind of perches on the earth.

53
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,260
But both of them are conscious of the ground.

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,430
Already, the architectural imagination is starting to emerge.

55
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,490
And then we could also say they have something else in common.

56
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,980
They both have a kind of wrapper, which encloses a single volume.

57
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,460
But the wrapper is very special.

58
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,250
It's a modulated wrapper.

59
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,630
It's made of columns.

60
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,510
Even though one has stone columns, one has steel columns,

61
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,880
even though the columns have different spacings,

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,180
the space in between the columns is important.

63
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,500
The proportion of space in between the columns and the rhythm of the columns

64
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,460
is important.

65
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,390
And then look at how the columns meet the horizontal beam,

66
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,340
or what we call the entablature.

67
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,180
In one case, there's a very articulated picture

68
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,350
of the joinery, the way the vertical column meets the entablature.

69
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,870
And there are several pieces in between that

70
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,039
make that transition from horizontal to vertical articulate.

71
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,080
Now, the other one doesn't have all those pieces.

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,560
But it almost seems like there's still great thought about the pieces.

73
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,960
But it's a kind of negation of all the articulation.

74
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,668
And yet, in the very negation, the intensity of that joint is still made.

75
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:20,459
So what do we have?

76
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,400
They're both empty, rectangular volumes defined by a wrapper.

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,870
And the wrapper is articulated by columns

78
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,150
and space that have a geometry, a kind of geometrical, proportional system.

79
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,330
They both pay a lot of attention of how they meet the ground.

80
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,740
And they both pay a lot of attention about how they're in a landscape.

81
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,540
So what has happened is that we have constructed.

82
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,840
And what has started to emerge is a very particular kind of imagination

83
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,760
that is purely architectural.

84
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,710
It's independent of the materials.

85
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,510
It's independent of the function.

86
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,520
It's independent of who paid for it.

87
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,200
And we have adapted a set of assumptions about one building

88
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,960
to a set of perceptions about another building.

89
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,480
We've worked across those two buildings.

90
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,010
Now, what's implied here is that template of things, in some sense,

91
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,810
had to preexist our understanding of those buildings.

92
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,880
That set of architectural characteristics

93
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,710
that they share in common had to, in some sense, already be there when

94
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,860
we start to perceive those buildings.

95
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,730
This is nothing less than the architectural imagination at work.

96
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,380
And what we have arrived at is a fundamental instance

97
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,320
of aesthetic judgment.

98
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,440
In the comparison, that set of assumptions emerged.

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,720
And it is as if it preexisted in order that you could

100
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,680
make the comparison in the first place.

101
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,120
So what's happening is that, let's say, a very old building

102
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,970
is shaping our perception of a very new building,

103
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,970
but also that that more modern building is shaping

104
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,400
our perception of the old building.

105
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,540
And it seems as if that template of items and assumptions

106
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,930
that we made about the wrapper, about the ground, about the landscape--

107
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,440
it seems as if those assumptions preexisted our perception.
