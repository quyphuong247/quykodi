K. MICHAEL HAYS: One of the most fundamental concepts
https://youtu.be/nMOwhf7eB8g
1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,290
that you'll learn in architectural design

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,410
is the concept of typology, which literally just means

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,300
the logic of types.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,010
When we think of typology, we might think

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,131
in terms of a functional typology, like the warehouse type or the apartment

6
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:24,630
type.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,570
Now this is not wrong, but it's very, very limiting.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,550
A warehouse might be converted into an apartment building,

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,600
and an apartment building is converted into a boutique,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,970
and a palazzo is converted into a hospital, and a hospital into a school.

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,340
A more interesting notion of typology comes

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,540
from the French architectural theorist QuatremÃ©re de Quincy.

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,830
"The word 'type' does not represent so much the image of something

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,220
that must be copied or imitated perfectly

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:00,150
as the idea of an element that must itself serve as a rule for the model."

16
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,010
The functional type is not wrong, but we need a theory of type

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,240
that's more fundamental.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
We need a theory of type that would account

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,900
for the way Palladio's diagram generates multiple variations of the villa.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,410
One of Palladio's villas is not a model for the other.

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,830
It's rather the case that a single rule exists--

22
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,840
a single set of procedures--

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,950
a geometrical organization that produces variations on the villa type.

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,720
It's important that Palladio's villas serve a social function.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,020
They're farmhouses.

26
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,640
They're also representations of a gentry class that's emerging into its own

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,680
at a particular moment in history.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,240
But all that substratum of conventions, of patronage,

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,850
of social codes and conventions is emerging through the very appearance

30
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,500
of the villa type.

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,190
That is to say, the social conventions are

32
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,050
represented through the architecture.
