00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:13,550
K. MICHAEL HAYS: Those who chronicle the two-part competition, through which

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,730
Eisenman won the commission, have said again

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,960
and again that Eisenman's project was the most abstract

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,120
of the 19 submissions.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,690
We want to ask, now-- why did the architect choose abstraction

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,470
over some more realistic depiction of the abject suffering of the victims?

7
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,850
We're told that abstract art is an art that

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,760
doesn't allow us interpretation with reference to something in reality

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,200
that's being depicted.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,130
Is the choice of abstraction, then, just a vague refusal

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,410
to represent what should be-- what could be-- represented realistically?

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,910
Or is it more than that?

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,090
While the Holocaust and abstraction have not often

14
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,030
been put together in art history, there is a very powerful body of literature,

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,330
in philosophy, and in theoretical writing,

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:13,280
that often sanctions and even recommends abstract art over realistic art.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,890
The thinking goes something like this.

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,150
To represent the victim suffering, realistically,

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,810
gives us an image that fixes--

20
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,920
that stabilizes-- the victim's condition,

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,340
rather than actually inviting us and requiring us an active living memory.

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,750
To wrest any kind of aesthetic pleasure out of a realistic depiction

23
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,740
would just further victimize those who suffered.

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,230
And then, finally-- to try to find some redemption, to try to find some relief,

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:51,480
as if we could project our collective guilt onto these realistic images,

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,765
to try to find some redemption-- would just falsify the actual horror, itself.

27
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:59,940


28
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,560
Abstract architecture tends to focus more on form and structure,

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,080
rather than content and subject matter.

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,490
With this interpretation, we might begin to get at the hidden meanings--

31
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,550
those things that are unsayable, and unthinkable,

32
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,860
and perhaps, even, unrepresentable.

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,100
This can be quite productive in a project like this.

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,410
If we make the structure of denial part of the content of the work--

35
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,830
we make denial, itself, part of the content of the work--

36
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,600
then the architecture might be able to bear the device of denial, itself.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,270


38
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,330
The abstract tends toward a higher degree of autonomy.

39
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,040
But we don't want to say that the abstract denies signification, itself.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,820
What we have to do, now, is find other ways of explaining,

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,110
let's say, the operations of abstraction and how abstraction produces

42
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,256
different kinds of signification.

43
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:58,130
The first of these-- and maybe, in some ways,

44
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,900
the most important in this project--

45
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,280
is repetition.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,810
It's very important that the way these blocks are repeated--

47
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,620
the repetition takes our focus away from the attention on the object.

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,450
It's not like looking at the facade of a church.

49
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,980
It's not like studying a single piece of sculpture.

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,130
The representation takes the attention away from the object

51
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,820
and puts it on the process of repetition, itself.

52
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,900
The process of reproduction.

53
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,100
There's also a kind of randomness that results

54
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,410
from this process of repetition.

55
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,770
The way the blocks seem to come up, out of the earth,

56
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,140
even though there is a limit to the site.

57
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,600
It's almost implied that the blocks continue under the earth,

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,890
almost to infinity.

59
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,030
As if, just this particular site has revealed the blocks that,

60
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,620
otherwise, might be spread to infinity.

61
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,010
So repetition also gives a kind of randomness

62
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,760
and then limitlessness to the project.

63
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,610
Repetition takes away any center, or any central moment of focus.

64
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,410
It distributes space sort of evenly and horizontally.

65
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,030
There's no clear route.

66
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,200
There's no directed place to go.

67
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,459
And yet, the field of blocks doesn't seem homogeneous.

68
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,760
Rather-- because of the randomness, because of the tilts,

69
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,500
because of the difference in heights--

70
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,960
you actually feel like what's been created

71
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,220
is a field of difference, a field that's charged with difference.

72
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,380


73
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,010
Even though this project is a memorial, it's not monumental.

74
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,460
Indeed, it's this kind of undoing of monumentality.

75
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,920
For a monument, we expect it to be stable.

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,950
We expect it to be intense.

77
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,990
We expect it to have a center and a focus.

78
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,660
But, in this project, there is no center.

79
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,310
There's no clear direction.

80
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,630
There's no spot.

81
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,030
There's no marked site.

82
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,510
In comparison, think of a monument like the Washington Monument, which

83
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,800
marks a definite spot, which gives a kind of specificity of place,

84
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,400
which gives a fixity to the experience.

85
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,740
The Memorial to the Murdered Jews gives you no direction.

86
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,050
It gives you no center.

87
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,490
It gives you no focus.

88
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,330
It doesn't tell you where to go.

89
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,760
It doesn't tell you how to stabilize or fix the image.

90
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,040


91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,830
So the first operation of abstraction is repetition.

92
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,560
The second aspect of abstraction involves us

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,870
with a different dimension of the project.

94
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,540
And that is the fact that it has a temporal dimension.

95
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,630
The memorial has to be experienced in time.

96
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,690
The architecture has to be performed.

97
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,170
When you come up on the site, you're almost in the project

98
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,010
before you know it.

99
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,740
The blocks start off very low.

100
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,970
But, very, very quickly, the ground moves down, the blocks move up,

101
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,790
and the outside world is shut out.

102
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,450
Once you're in the project, and lose the horizon, and lose the surroundings,

103
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,540
the project actually becomes very enclosing.

104
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,720
And then you're required to focus on things

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,440
that are immediate-- that are right there in experience, right

106
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,970
there in the present.

107
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,620
You focus on the textures, the inert coolness of the blocks.

108
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,890
You focus on the way the light is constantly changing,

109
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,350
the way there are bright spots and shadows.

110
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,890
You focus on the ground, on the crunch of the gravel,

111
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,550
and the undulation of the ground.

112
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,050
And your whole experience becomes not a kind of constructed image

113
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:40,320
of past history, but it becomes an intensified experience of the present--

114
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,580
of this moment.

115
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,600
You remember just a moment ago, you project forward just

116
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,760
to just a moment from now.

117
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,170
But mainly, you're in the present.

118
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,570
And I think this is a way--

119
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,570
we might call this a sort of peripatetic architecture,

120
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,930
an architecture that you have to walk through,

121
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,290
an architecture that you experience really as much with your body

122
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,910
as you do your mind.

123
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,220
And this peripatetic architecture is the way

124
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,700
that Eisenman doesn't give us a fixed history of the Holocaust,

125
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,520
in the same way he doesn't give us an image of the Holocaust.

126
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,740
But he gives us a way of remembering-- a living memory.

127
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,500
Or, perhaps, maybe it's just a way not to forget--

128
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,080
to keep the mental flows, the energies, the thoughts active.

129
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,180


130
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,150
The third aspect of abstraction has to do

131
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,220
with the treatment of the ground in the memorial.

132
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,340
There's something very important about the ground for the human body.

133
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,645
The ground-- a stable ground-- gives us a bodily security, as well as

134
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:51,060
a mental certainty.

135
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,600
When the ground is disturbed, that certainty is taken away.

136
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,460
Think about the experience of an earthquake.

137
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,970
There's nothing more disturbing, more horrifying,

138
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,160
than the sense that the very ground underneath you has become arbitrary,

139
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,810
has become uncertain.

140
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,540
There's a particular characteristic in Germany,

141
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,520
of the ground, that has to do with the Nazis' tendency to make a fetish out

142
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,600
of the earth, itself--

143
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,320
out of the German soil.

144
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,650
And these two things, together, are important,

145
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,810
because the operation that the memorial performs on the ground

146
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,700
is a disturbance.

147
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,620
And the fact that this German soil--

148
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,240
in the center of Berlin--

149
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,570
has been disturbed, has been made arbitrary.

150
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,919
The ground-- though, first, it seems to give you that bodily security,

151
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,610
it quickly gives way.

152
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,260
The undulations are a little too strong.

153
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,240
The architects also placed very coarse gravel

154
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,990
on the ground that focuses your attention, both acoustically as well

155
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,010
as visually, on the surface of the ground, on this kind of crunch.

156
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,610
And it's the crunch, the sliding, the undulations,

157
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,960
that disturbs the sense of ground, that disturbs the sense of security.

158
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,320
And that's a very important part of the way the abstraction,

159
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,190
again, works in a bodily way, as well as a conceptual way.

160
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,150
And it's something that, even though the experience is an individual bodily

161
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,790
experience, there's a kind of collectivity,

162
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,460
there's a kind of ideological collective that

163
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,595
is also being disturbed and manipulated in that operation on the ground.

164
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:32,500


165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,650
The aspects of abstraction that we've talked about,

166
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,890
so far, have been primarily phenomenological.

167
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:44,130
And I mean that they primarily derive from an experience of the body,

168
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,850
of the individual body moving through space.

169
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,360
The fourth dimension of abstraction moves

170
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,440
from the phenomenal, or the experiential, toward the structural.

171
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,920
This is, in some ways, perhaps the most abstract

172
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,520
of these operations of abstraction-- that is the grid itself.

173
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,720
It's very important that this project is fundamentally, simply,

174
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,190
the superimposition of an abstract grid on the specific concrete site

175
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,120
in Berlin.

176
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,800
It is the superimposition that marks the site as a site.

177
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,220
Let's think about the grid.

178
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,520
The grid is anti-natural.

179
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,420
It's systematic.

180
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,240
It is highly constructed.

181
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,280
It's highly artificial.

182
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,910
It's calibrated.

183
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:39,180
In some ways, the grid is a kind of lowest common denominator

184
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,710
of architecture, itself.

185
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:46,470
Architecture, in all its geometrical qualities, and its calibration,

186
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:52,440
and its measured qualities-- the grid is just the sign of architecture, itself.

187
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,780
The grid doesn't represent.

188
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,710
It relates.

189
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,560
If you have a grid, anything you put in a grid

190
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,910
relates to everything else on the grid.

191
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,950
So its extremely relational, even though its non-representational.

192
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,800
But the grid in Eisenman's project is even more complex,

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,740
because there are actually two grids.

194
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,190
We talked a little bit about the tilt in the blocks

195
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,250
and the different height of the blocks.

196
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,360
The project was conceptualized as-- in Eisenman's words--

197
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,170
as the product of two topographies.

198
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,560
There's one topography-- which is the ground, itself.

199
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,180
The undulating ground, itself.

200
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,030
But there's another topography, which you

201
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,560
can kind of see from the aerial photographs of the project, that

202
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,920
is a topography that seems to be laid over the top of the project.

203
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,830
And the way the project was conceptualized,

204
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,650
were that there were these two grids--

205
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,530
equal, but shifted, relative, to one another.

206
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:57,300
And then the grids were thrown into a topographical undulation.

207
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,770
And in each grid--

208
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,580
the grid on the ground and the grid above--

209
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,390
each is undulating at different rates.

210
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,560
And they're also not lining up.

211
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,630
They're slightly misaligned.

212
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,620
And then the blocks are nothing other than the connection

213
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,750
of the points of those two grids.

214
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,780
So that's what gives the blocks its tilt.

215
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,050
And that's what gives the blocks this random height.

216
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,940
This is really interesting, the effect of that.

217
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:32,220
It's an absolutely systematic procedure--

218
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,590
it's not subjective, it's not authored.

219
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,470
It's not like the creation of some--

220
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,500
you don't sense that someone has created this grid.

221
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,650
It seems to be totally constructed, artificial, and systematic,

222
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,990
and yet it produces the effect of randomness.

223
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,410
And I think it's this interaction of systematicity and randomness

224
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,670
that really focuses the abstraction of this project.

225
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,740
Now, notice that you can't actually perceive these two grids.

226
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,750
You can't actually see the two grids at the same time.

227
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,200
You can't photograph the two grids together.

228
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,530
The understanding of the operations of the grids

229
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,010
and this operation of abstraction must take place

230
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,200
in the architectural imagination.

231
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,830
As we walk through it, we start to construct, in our minds,

232
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,760
the interaction of these two grids.

233
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,120


234
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,870
So let's think about what we've done so far in our operations of abstraction.

235
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,570
We've moved from an attention on the object to a field.

236
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,980
We've moved from a single object as a focus

237
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:57,940
to the process of repetition as a focus, and the process by which these two

238
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,660
undulating grids create these objects.

239
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,820
And we've moved from phenomenon and experience to structure

240
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,660
and the imagination, to the idea that the concept

241
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,030
of this project and the organization of this project can only take place,

242
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,360
can only be known, in the architectural imagination

243
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,940
as a kind of summing up and a gathering together of the spatial information

244
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,150
that we receive in our experience of the building.

245
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,810


246
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,580
Now we'll look at the fifth and final dimension of abstraction.

247
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,700
But first, let's start in a slightly different way

248
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,190
and start with some associations.

249
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,780
I want to think about two sites that, perhaps, Eisenman is attempting

250
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,990
to evoke, or refer to, in his project.

251
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,900
Think about the Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague.

252
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,030
This is a very old cemetery, on a relatively small site,

253
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,530
and it's existed for centuries.

254
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,320
According to Jewish law, you cannot disinter a body.

255
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,870
So, when the Prague cemetery was filled--

256
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,290
when there was no more room--

257
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,600
rather than disinter the bodies, they simply

258
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,560
piled more earth on top of the bodies so they could bury more.

259
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,860
And this was done, like, seven or eight times, until this large mound formed.

260
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,260
Now, also according to Jewish law, there cannot be a grave without a headstone.

261
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,170
So the old headstones of the first few layers--

262
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,190
when the additional layers of earth were piled on top--

263
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,220
the old headstones had to be brought up.

264
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,400
And the effect of this is--

265
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,130
two things.

266
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,030
One, the headstones are showing where.

267
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,490
They're also tilting because of age.

268
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,660
They're tilting because they've been moved.

269
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,910
And I think there's some association with these headstones, and their tilt,

270
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,030
and their crowdedness, and the kind of randomness,

271
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,050
that we have an association, perhaps, with the memorial in Berlin.

272
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,500
But there's a very, very important difference.

273
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,270
Again, according to Jewish law, the headstones have to have a name.

274
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,770
The person buried there has to be named.

275
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,000
One of the most striking things about the memorial in Berlin

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,840
is that there are no names.

277
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,390
In Prague-- because of the age of the headstones,

278
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,840
because of the movement and replacement of the headstones--

279
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,050
slowly, over time, the names have been erased.

280
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,720
The inscriptions have been muted.

281
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,720
By contrast, in Berlin, the names have been refused.

282
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,420


283
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,250
Look at a second cemetery.

284
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,990
This is the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.

285
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,210
And this is the site of the Second Coming of the Messiah.

286
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,840
And, again, because the crypts are above ground, because of the way

287
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,780
they're organized in the grid--

288
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,820
again, I think there's some association, some possible association,

289
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,310
to the memorial in Berlin.

290
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,850
But it's important that, in the memorial in Berlin, there are no bodies.

291
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,380
At the Mount of Olives, the actual bodies are there.

292
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,810
And, again, the bodies are named.

293
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:15,060
One of the most striking things about Berlin is the refusal of names.

294
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,119
It's almost like, because of these other precedents,

295
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,930
because of these other associations, we expect to find names.

296
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,319
And the fact that the names have been refused--

297
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,900
it's almost like the names have been erased.

298
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,760
It's that negation of the names which comes as a kind of shock,

299
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,390
as a kind of a negative force.

300
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,330
Now, there are reasons for this refusal to name.

301
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,520
First of all, in the case of the Holocaust,

302
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,720
we don't know all the victims.

303
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,180
We couldn't.

304
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,500
Even if Eisenman had wanted to, we couldn't name all the victims.

305
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,000
The records aren't complete.

306
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,550
Many of the victims were unknown.

307
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,000
But, more important, the absence of inscription

308
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,850
signifies a requirement for critical memory.

309
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,830
Think of it this way.

310
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,230
If we had an archive--

311
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,340
if we had all the names and we represented the Holocaust

312
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,320
through this archive--

313
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,960
that would fix the history of the Holocaust.

314
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,820
It would make it certain.

315
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,330
It would make it, in some way, over and done with

316
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,210
and, in that way, forgettable.

317
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,240
But the Holocaust exceeds its archive.

318
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,860
The Holocaust-- and the living memory of the Holocaust--

319
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,780
must exceed the archive.

320
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,730
So, in refusing inscription, in refusing to try to represent the archive,

321
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,260
Eisenman has forced us to continue to remember--

322
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,860
to refuse to forget.

323
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:52,630
