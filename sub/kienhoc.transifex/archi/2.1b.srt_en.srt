ERIKA NAGINSKI: So let's turn to Wittkower's analysis of Alberti, and on particular,
https://youtu.be/8EHkrqgkv4s
1
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,700
Alberti's relationship to antiquity.

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,230
What does it mean for a Renaissance architect

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,570
to look back to the classical past and deploy those forms in the context

4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,670
of religious architecture?

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,120
If you think about it, this is not self-evident.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,650
What does it mean to take classicism, which is a pagan idiom,

7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,060
and introduce it to the context of Christian architecture?

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,770
This symbolic aspect is not so much Wittkower's problem.

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:51,150
He's after explaining how to match up one formal system against another.

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,900
He begins his inquiry with a problem, and that problem

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,720
is related to what we call a trabeated system or a post-and-lintel system,

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,240
which indicates classicism's reliance on horizontal beams or lintels

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,120
that are held up by columns or pillars.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,220
Now, one of the curious aspects of Alberti's architectural theory

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,590
is the distinction he draws between a notion of an architecture of the wall,

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,040
on the one hand, which is a structural statement, and on the other hand,

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,170
the question of the column, which crucially for Alberti-- and this

18
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,220
may seem counter-intuitive-- belongs to the realm of ornament,

19
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,390
of the decorative.

20
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,440
And by relegating the column to the realm of the decorative, Alberti,

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,670
according to Wittkower, confronted one of the fundamental problems

22
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,570
of Renaissance architecture.

23
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,710
How do you define a wall?

24
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,710
So to explain this, Wittkower offers the diagram

25
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,020
that you see here with the following explanation.

26
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,730
These are his words.

27
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,380
"In his religious buildings.

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,840
Alberti consistently avoided the combination of arch and column."

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,690
That's what you see on the right-hand side of the diagram.

30
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:13,250
"When Alberti uses columns, he did, in fact, give them a straight entablature,

31
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,120
while when he introduced arches, he made them rest on pillars."

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,290
And that's what you see on the left-hand side of the diagram.

33
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,160
Sometimes these pillars had half columns adossed to them,

34
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,830
emphasizing their decorative role.

35
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,240
Wittkower continues,

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,150
"Whereas the first motif is Greek, the second is Roman."

37
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,180
The first motif is based on the functional meaning of the column.

38
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,440
It's supporting those arches.

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,750
The second is based on the cohesion and unity of the wall.

40
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,050
To explain the latter point, in the Coliseum,

41
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,360
the arch pillars may be interpreted as residues of a pierced wall

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,610
with half columns which carry the straight entablatures placed on them

43
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,770
entirely as ornament.

44
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,060
That's very explicitly carried out at the Coliseum.

45
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,160
Arches rest on pillars.

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,900
The column and the entablature are purely decorative.

47
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,920
Ultimately, Wittkower's argument will be that in the architecture of churches,

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,000
Alberti is going to reject the column entirely and turn

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,520
towards a pure expression of the wall, a kind of architecture of the wall.

50
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,150
And he's going to do this by examining four commissions.

51
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,620
The first is the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini.

52
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,970
The second is Santa Maria Novella in Florence.

53
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:50,710
The third and fourth, both in Mantua, are San Sebastiano and Sant'Andrea.

54
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,200
What is convenient about these four commissions

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,110
is that they offer a neat chronology.

56
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,460
They offer a sequence in time, and Wittkower takes this chronology

57
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,180
to trace out the development of Alberti's thinking on architecture.

58
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,120
Buildings, in other words, become part of a single investigation

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,960
of classical modalities in the context of religious structures.
