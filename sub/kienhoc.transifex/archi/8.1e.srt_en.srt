ERIKA NAGINSKI: Now the historical exchange between the real and the ideal does not apply in the case of
https://youtu.be/lu1YcNu4stE
1
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:23,700
the last project that I want to talk about, which is completely radical and, in some sense,

2
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,730
out of control.

3
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:34,260
This is a project in which the manipulation of dark and light actually manufactured Boullée's

4
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,290
most emblematic project.

5
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,700
It's called the Cenotaph to Newton.

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,480
It exemplifies Boullée's interest in how buildings that are dark and gloomy can produce

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,120
a transcendent effect-- in other words, produce the sublime-- and how architects can actually

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,430
calculate abrupt passages from lightness to darkness to narrowness, to hugeness as it were,

9
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,800
in order to manipulate human responses to space.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,990
The first thing to note is the unprecedented radicalism of the image of the complete globe.

11
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,670
This is the very first design of its kind.

12
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,420
The subject is equally grandiose.

13
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,260
It is nothing less than the order of the cosmos.

14
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,350
Think back to the medieval image of the city and the universe.

15
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,890
And all the kinds of properties or characteristics that we've enumerated so far that relate to

16
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,990
a sublime architecture are reunited in this project, that literally transforms the sphere--

17
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,310
that sphere, that central sphere-- into a double emblem of the earth from the outside

18
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:52,439
and the universe from the inside, only to stress our very precarious metaphysical place

19
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,729
in that universe.

20
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:59,720
Lastly, Boullée ingeniously put nature to work.

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:08,440
Instead of using columns, he imagined an ascending succession of double concentric rings of funeral

22
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,769
cypresses-- trees, in other words, which turn the building into a kind of natural Elysium

23
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,930
and conflate landscape and architecture.

24
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,450
Now the building has a deeply complex processional space.

25
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,160
And this is revealed in the section rather than the elevation, which cuts through the

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,860
center of the building.

27
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:37,790
What you do is that you enter from the sides, and you experience varied architecture.

28
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:46,629
Boullée is imagining, forcing us to navigate downwards and then proceed down a long, dark,

29
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,200
and seemingly endless or infinite corridor.

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,750
And then transcendence is suggested at the end.

31
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,950
We climb a stairs in darkness.

32
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,910
And when you emerge into the space, you're emerging into the sacred center, as it were,

33
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,290
which is marked by a platform on which is Newton's tomb.

34
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,301
And this is where we see this absolutely ingenious manipulation of light and dark, and how the

35
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:14,819
building literally kind of oscillates between day and night.

36
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,570
Remember Boullée's claim that the architect "creates light."

37
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,650
What he did was to imagine piercing the skin of the globe so that during the day, light

38
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,030
would come in, would filter in, to recreate the patterns of the stars, the constellations

39
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,300
themselves.

40
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,129
In other words, daylight here theatrically illuminates and creates the inside effect

41
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,060
of a night sky, brightly lit up by the stars.

42
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,700
By doing so, what Boullée is in fact, somehow, theatricalizing is an oscillation between

43
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:58,709
the subject, the person in the building, and the object, the cosmos itself; between inside

44
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,349
and outside; between earth and sun.

45
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:08,480
He's also displacing, and this is where he's referring to Newton of course, the drama of

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,569
the Copernican revolution, of the idea that the sun actually displaced the earth as the

47
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,799
center of the universe.

48
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,280
This is the idea of the sublime.

49
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:25,100
The structure of the universe is mapped out before our eyes, only somehow to shake to

50
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,810
its very foundation our sense of where we belong, what is our place in that universe.

51
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,790
This is Boullée's description.

52
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:39,990
"With the drawing before your eyes, you would see what would have been deemed impossible.

53
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,990
You would see a monument in which the spectator would find himself... transported in the air

54
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,250
and carried on the mist of clouds in the immensity of space.

55
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,580
The interior form of this monument is... that of a vast sphere, into which you arrive at

56
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:04,100
the center of gravity by an opening in the podium on which is placed the tomb.

57
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,610
...just as in nature, no matter where you look, you see only a continuous surface which offers

58
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:18,000
no beginning and no end, and which, the more you peruse it, the larger it becomes."

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,690
This is of course, the mechanism of the sublime.

60
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:30,020
And here for the first time, I think, we have an architecture that actually performs infinity.

61
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:37,160
So to conclude, how would we think of the legacy of Boullée's designs of this approach,

62
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,600
these visionary drawings that were conceived for a recreation of society, that were conceived

63
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,810
to illustrate an entire typology of public edifices?

64
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,030
It's important, in this context, to realize that Boullée actually made these drawings

65
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,580
for students.

66
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,430
Their pretext is pedagogical.

67
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:04,030
They were intended for the students at the academy, and serve to exemplify ideas about

68
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,729
buildings, not actual buildings.

69
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:14,479
This kind of architectural imagination underscores the importance of ephemeral or unbuildable

70
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,590
architecture, of architecture on paper.

71
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,470
And the extraordinary thing is to see how one continues to track it down to our moment.

72
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,950
Take for example, Le Corbusier's plan for the city of Chandigarh, whose urban grid he

73
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:35,139
also set up in front of a mountain range to evoke the sublime that we see in Boullée's

74
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,919
City of the Dead.

75
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:42,240
And then if you look at the rooftop of the Palace of the Assembly, Le Corbusier played

76
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,860
with the possibility of "seeing God" by means of the sheer monumentally of

77
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:54,380
those forms that emerge both from something deeply archaic-- you have the pyramid-- and

78
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,330
something deeply futuristic.

79
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:03,949
The promise of technology, in this case, carried forth in the suggestion of nuclear power,

80
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,819
which is alluded to by the truncated cone.

81
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:13,620
Or, finally, with someone like the Italian architect Aldo Rossi, whose own architecture

82
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:20,470
of death relied on the pyramidal form this time in plan, what one critic dubbed the

83
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,090
"neo-Enlightenment attitude in his work."

84
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:31,940
And what I think he meant by this is an architectural imagination in which architecture, geometry,

85
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:40,490
and philosophy collide and coalesce, work in concert to create an image of transcendence.

86
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,990
This is an attitude or an architectural imagination that was directly inherited from Enlightenment

87
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,430
architects who are trying to re-make the world around them.
