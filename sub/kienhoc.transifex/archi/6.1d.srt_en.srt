K. MICHAEL HAYS: Behrens's AEG turbine factory was a seminal building.
https://youtu.be/yOmXtb4dCRQ
1
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,050
It was enormously influential.

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,170
There isn't an architect in Europe-- a modern architect in Europe--

3
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,000
who wasn't influenced by the building.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,680
One of those was Walter Gropius.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,930
Walter Gropius, of course, would later become the founder and the first director of the

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,320
Bauhaus, the school in Germany.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,960
And, later, when Gropius left the Bauhaus, he would become the Director of Architecture

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,059
at the Graduate School of Design.

9
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,020
But we're at a time much before that.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,560
The young Walter Gropius worked for Peter Behrens exactly at the time

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,660
that the design of the AEG factory was underway.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:55,660
And, of course, Gropius absorbed many of Behrens's ideas.

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,840
Gropius would, eventually, become much more interested

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,000
in sort of technical rationalism, industrialized processes of construction, the mass production

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,710
of building components.

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,750
Behrens was never really interested in that kind of technology.

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,960
But, nevertheless, Gropius shared Behrens's position

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:21,020
that technology had to be transformed by Spirit, that architecture was not

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,820
just building, but was building raised to the level of art,

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,719
and that the intellectual task of the architect in modernity

21
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:36,749
was to invent new forms of a new machine age that would not only understand

22
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:42,899
architecture as representing a social totality, but that would also put architecture in the

23
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:50,020
continuum of architecture as an art practice.

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,150
What I now want to look at very briefly is a project

25
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,209
that Gropius did early in his career, just after leaving Behrens's office, that shows

26
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:06,249
how the seminal ideas of the AEG factory could be transformed, elaborated,

27
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:11,930
varied, and even, in some way, criticized, but still continued

28
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,540
as part of a general aesthetic project of designing the factory building.

29
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,780
This is Gropius's building for the Fagus Factory, which was a small factory which manufactured

30
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,500
shoe lasts, that is, these wooden inserts around which a shoe is

31
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
constructed.

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,849
It was a very high-level, high-quality, known for high-quality products.

33
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,629
And the owner of the Fagus Factory wanted, again,

34
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:47,299
like AEG had before, wanted to use the factory as a kind of advertisement

35
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:51,770
for the quality of the production of the corporation itself.

36
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:57,469
Gropius, unlike Behrens, did not have control of the entire factory.

37
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,799
He was only asked to do what amounts to a, kind of, addition,

38
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,030
but it was the main building; it was the face of the factory toward the

39
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,030
street.

40
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,640
He starts very much like Behrens, putting his attention on the glass wall

41
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,680
and on the masonry construction that supports the glass wall.

42
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,599
The corners, as in the turbine factory, are still a kind

43
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,480
of primary anchor for the building.

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,349
But the big difference is where Behrens had to use concrete on the corners--

45
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,340
even though it's true that the concrete was set back,

46
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,260
and the idea of its load-bearing properties was put into a kind of ambiguity or a tension--

47
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,580
in Gropius's case, though the corners still kind of anchor the

48
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,390
composition, the corners are emphatically transparent.

49
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,810
They're sharply constructed.

50
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,739
The glass and steel come together at very sharp points.

51
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,620
At the corner, the glass bay is bent exactly in half,

52
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,250
so that the glass seems to wrap around the corner.

53
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,640
It looks very familiar to the contemporary eye,

54
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,060
but this was so original that the contractors and the builders

55
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:12,249
of the factory had a very hard time even understanding how they would build this to actually make

56
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,250
those glass corners stand up.

57
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,840
Again, following these ideas of contrasts between the opaque

58
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:25,800
and the transparent that Behrens developed, Gropius also sort of pushes in a solid masonry

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,380
block that contains the entry to the building, sort of pushes it into that glass envelope

60
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,050
or that glass membrane.

61
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:41,430
Another difference, and almost like a reversal, is that while Behrens canted the glass at

62
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,490
a slight angle, and kept the face of the columns-- in his

63
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,520
case, steel columns-- straight, Gropius does, in a way, the opposite.

64
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,720
The glass face is emphatically vertical and plumb.

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,480
And it's the masonry piers that are battered so that they seem to lean in.

66
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,700
This does two things: at the very top part of the building, it brings

67
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,210
the face out well in front of its masonry support, so that

68
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,310
the glass seems to hang like a thin curtain from the

69
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,020
top parapet.

70
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,430
But the other thing it does is it casts a shadow.

71
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,520
And it makes it look like the glass planes are kind of cut or sheared,

72
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,910
and are almost free standing.

73
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:35,100
Like Behrens in the front part of the AEG, this technique of isolating the plane of glass

74
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:41,300
puts enormous visual emphasis on the glass as this tactile plane.

75
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,930
In Behrens case, though it's not properly a curtain wall of glass,

76
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,900
the pane was continuous.

77
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,970
But it only went through one story.

78
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,270
As high as the turbine factory is, it's only a single story.

79
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,690
Gropius is working with-- there was a smaller building--

80
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,190
it's three stories.

81
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,770
But he makes it look as if the glass curtain wall goes

82
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,710
all the way through three stories.

83
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,830
This is very dramatic because it is one of the first times

84
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,090
that this technique was used.

85
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,310
He wants it to look like the glass is continuous in hanging,

86
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,650
when in fact it's actually three separate panels.

87
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,370
And then finally, he puts the staircases in the corner of the building wrapped

88
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,060
by this glass curtain wall.

89
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,990
The visitor can see these freestanding staircases behind the glass wall

90
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,831
even before he enters the building.

91
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:43,700
Now, the effect of battering the brick piers and, thereby, getting the glass to set in

92
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,340
front of the brick piers, and also by making the glass in the same plane

93
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,350
as the parapet and in front of the base, the visual effect

94
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,870
of all that is to make it seem like there's an entire plane of glass

95
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:04,830
hanging from the parapet, rather than resting on the base.

96
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,520
The visual effect is that of what we call a curtain wall.

97
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,470
Now, a proper curtain wall, as we see in any contemporary skyscraper,

98
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:21,350
is actually a continuous network of glass that stands in front of the structure.

99
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:28,050
In the case of the Fagus Factory, it's not a proper curtain wall in that sense.

100
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:34,730
The individual panes of glass are still attached to the structure

101
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,280
just behind them.

102
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,290
But the appearance, the visual appearance, is that they're hanging free of the structure.

103
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,070
And this is very clear, that it was more important to Gropius

104
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:52,140
to get that appearance than it was the empirical fact of a curtain wall.

105
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,550
While Gropius would insist that, like Behrens, he wants his building

106
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,170
to be seen in a continuum that begins with classical architecture

107
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,830
and runs through modern times, through what amounts to a kind of critique

108
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,240
of Behrens's system, he manages to design a variation

109
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,770
that we might think of as even more modern than the AEG factory,

110
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:21,900
moving architecture even further to an industrial glass and steel aesthetic.
