K. MICHAEL HAYS: The central claims of Hegel's philosophy of art
https://youtu.be/Num-IUqMWEY
1
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,260
are constructed in his famously opaque terminology, primarily

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,680
the idea of the Spirit or the "Geist."

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,380
And sometimes you'll hear it as "Zeitgeist," which

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,500
is literally the "spirit of the time."

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,770
And the time, the temporal dimension we'll come back to.

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,930
There are a couple of ways we can understand this.

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,450
The first way, which I would call the traditionalist or the conservative way,

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,710
is to see the Geist or the Spirit as a kind of all-encompassing substance

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,300
that determines reality.

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,420
Now that substance, that substantial view,

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,680
that traditional view of the Geist as being like a thing

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,970
would almost understand the Geist as a person-like.

13
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,650
You could even say it comes very close to the idea of a god,

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,660
especially in Western literature.

15
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,780
Now that's fine, except the idea of spirit as god

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,960
is just not helpful for us as historians.

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,900
Mainly because if god is controlling everything,

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,746
there's just not much that we can do about it.

19
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:25,620
Now a different way of understanding Hegel's Spirit is better for us,

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,800
but it's also a little more difficult to summarize.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,670
The idea is still that everything real is

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:40,350
with hindsight determined by organizing principles, organizing

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,350
principles of a whole, of a totality.

24
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,780
Think of it, it could be modeled as a structure.

25
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,470
Or it could be modeled as sort of conditions of possibility.

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,840
That the whole of reality is organized by a structure

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,320
that establishes the conditions of possibility.

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,610
But this structure can only be known in hindsight.

29
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,710
I mean, we can use it to make speculations

30
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,500
and to make predictions about the future,

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,120
but we can't systematically conceive of this structure

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,440
until everything has already happened.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,120
So all of the connectivities, all of the butterfly effects,

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,710
all of the chaos theories, all of the ways

35
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,710
we might model the way everything in the world

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,000
is connected, theoretically, it would be possible to give

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,760
that a structure, an organizing structure,

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,790
but only after everything is already passed.

39
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,730
Now this idea, the idea of Spirit as this organizing structure which is

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,390
constantly being produced, it's never--

41
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,100
it is a structure that is never settled.

42
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,770
It's a structure, the Spirit on this model

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,930
would be more of a process than a thing.

44
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,010
It's not a substance, it's a process.

45
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,330
So and then that Spirit, that organizing structure

46
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,590
learns about itself in stages.

47
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,340
And it learns about itself through art.

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,090
So think of it like this.

49
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,240
The Spirit initially sort of doesn't know itself.

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,790
It can't represent itself.

51
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,390
So it, as it were, reaches down into the material world

52
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:28,100
and creates through collective community human activity as its kind of vehicle.

53
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,590
It creates art forms, collective art forms.

54
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,580
And it sees itself.

55
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,890
It says, Oh, this is what I am.

56
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,760
But by the time it sees that, it actually has already grown.

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,770
It's already changed.

58
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,080
It's already developed.

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,450
So it's not satisfied with that art form, and it moves to the next one.

60
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,780
This is how Hegel gives history a kind of telos and a propeller and a movement

61
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,540
forward.

62
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,030
And then Spirit looks down and says, Oh so this is what I am.

63
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,500
But now it's even more refined, it's more developed.

64
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,390
And it wants to keep moving forward.

65
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,150
Now this understanding of history as a sort of determinant object and spirit

66
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,050
as the subjective structure that as it were

67
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,470
interprets and learns from that object, sends Hegel in two directions.

68
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:25,140
First of all, he defends a form of holism in which the forms of thought

69
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:34,680
and an art as a form of thought depend on their identity in a network.

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,700
That is to say, that forms of art only take

71
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,250
on their characteristics in relation to other forms of art in other times

72
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,440
and other epochs in a network.

73
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,100
And second, Hegel argues that the conditions of possibility

74
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,260
or the sort of understanding of objects includes

75
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,080
the participation of individuals in collective social life.

76
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,690
In other words, the Spirit, for Hegel, it

77
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,800
is the Spirit that is propelling art forward.

78
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,560
But the Spirit needs the participation of individuals in social life

79
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,890
to help it make those art objects.

80
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,020
And then Hegel constructs three epochs in which

81
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,330
Spirit learns about itself through art.

82
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,570
The first epoch is what he calls the symbolic, which is basically

83
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,480
everything prior to Ancient Greece.

84
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,590
The second epoch is the classical, which is centered in Greece

85
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,650
in the fifth century Before Common Era.

86
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,940
And the third is the romantic.

87
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,730
Now what Hegel means by the romantic is basically art after the Roman Empire,

88
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,510
or art in the countries of the Romance languages.

89
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,060
So what he calls "romantic" is actually what

90
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,870
we would call late medieval and Renaissance as well as 18th century

91
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,370
art.

92
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,400
So the romantic is a very big period after the Roman Empire

93
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
that comes up to Hegel's own time.

94
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,860
So the Romantic art is also the art of Hegel's own time.

95
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,430
As art moves through these epochs, initially art

96
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,520
is very, very close to nature.

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,940
Initially, art deals very much with the earth.

98
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,570
And so for Hegel, and this is very important for us, of course.

99
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,790
Architecture is the primary art.

100
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,070
Architecture is the inaugural art.

101
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,270
Because architecture is the art that deals most closely with the earth.

102
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,400
It's made of stone and brick and wood, which are all from the earth.

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,110
But also, architecture is a very bodily art for Hegel.

104
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,120
And for Hegel, the art moves from the more bodily, the more sensuous,

105
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,160
the more material forms.

106
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,490
As it moves through time, it becomes less material.

107
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,530
It dematerializes itself.

108
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,680
And it becomes higher and higher in the conceptual, spiritual realm

109
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,610
and starts to move away from the body.

110
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,410
Let's see in a little more detail how he constructs this.

111
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,825
Hegel starts with the Tower of Babel.

112
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:13,950
And for him, the Tower of Babel, which is, of course, an architectural art,

113
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,120
is important because it's the art of a community.

114
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,420
It started with a community effort to build a tower.

115
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,940
But of course, the choice of Babel as an exemplary symbol of national unity

116
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,310
is difficult, because, as we know from the legend, the community of Babel

117
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,110
started speaking different languages.

118
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,000
The tower was never complete.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,880
The community dispersed across the globe.

120
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,880
For Hegel, it is the very failure of the project that he finds interesting.

121
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,020
Because it's in the failure of the project,

122
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,200
it's in the impossibility of the project, that

123
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,340
then compels the community to continue.

124
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,240
Humans didn't stop making art after the failure of Babel.

125
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,190
On the contrary, they made art, in a way, with more intensity.

126
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,360
And so it gives Hegel the idea of community.

127
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,610
It gives him the idea of collective building.

128
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,660
But it also gives him the propeller that he needs to move art through time.
