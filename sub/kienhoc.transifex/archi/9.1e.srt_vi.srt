K. MICHAEL HAYS: The Centre Pompidou in the city of Paris is Baudrillard's example of the architecture
https://youtu.be/iQSW3xXRVtE
1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,680
in the third order of the simulacra.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,470
For Baudrillard, the Centre Pompidou is a museum that's not a museum.

3
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,189
It's a sort of monument that's not a monument.

4
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:30,520
He sees the Centre Pompidou as a building embedded in a series of contradictions.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,930
On the one hand, he sees the building, he says, like a kind of nuclear power plant.

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,890
It draws in cultural energy from outside.

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,490
It pulls people's attention in, with the promise of art.

8
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,790
And yet at the same time, he sees it as is dissuading art, as deterring culture.

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,929
It surrounds itself, he says, like a security zone, just like a nuclear reactor surrounds

10
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:57,399
itself with security, to protect the art that's inside.

11
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,321
He says that on the one hand, it looks like an oil refinery, and on the other hand, its

12
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:04,400
interior is like a warehouse.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,910
So it is a contradictory idea about functionality, about storage.

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,250
But then it promises to house art.

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,730
So it's a curatorial problem that Baudrillard finds contradictory.

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,080
What kind of art do you put in a building like this?

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,220
The building produces a mass audience.

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,140
It invites all of the masses to come to witness the art.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,370
And yet when they arrive in this enormous plaza, what happens is just a spectacle.

20
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,080
It's not art at all.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,420
It's just a spectacle of the mass arrival.

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,650
The building promises an explosion, a kind of revolutionary event, he says.

23
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,160
But when the masses arrive, the opposite happens.

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,430
It's an implosion.

25
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,180
The whole thing begins to collapse under its own weight, a radical cultural implosion.

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,100
I think it's helpful that Baudrillard actually compares the Centre Pompidou

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,110
to the Eiffel Tower.

28
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,040
The Eiffel Tower is a monument, but it's a monument to nothing.

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,780
It doesn't house a museum.

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,470
It just marks a place.

31
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,819
But by marking that place so monumentally, it creates, too, a spectacle.

32
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,430
Baudrillard doesn't mention, it but Roland Barthes, another French philosopher, talks

33
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,350
about the Eiffel Tower as being the degree zero of monumentality.

34
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,390
The Centre Pompidou does something very similar.

35
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,390
It marks a place.

36
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,470
It announces a spectacle.

37
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,570
And yet it's not really a monument to art.

38
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,230
It's monumentally anti-monumental.

39
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,270
It's a sort of degree zero of monument.

40
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:43,640
It tries to represent the power of an art and a culture which is not actually there.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,710
To understand Baudrillard's claims about the Centre Pompidou, it would be helpful to have

42
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,120
a counter-example.

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,060
Let's take the Whitney Museum in New York by comparison.

44
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,400
It was designed in 1966 by Marcel Breuer.

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,000
It was the first museum in Manhattan after Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,180
And when Breuer recounted his first ideas for the museum, he said he asked himself this

47
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,270
question-- what should a museum look like in New York City?

48
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,960
What should be the relationship of a museum to the city, to a city like Manhattan?

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,620
Then he answers his question.

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,790
He says, well, it's easier to say what it shouldn't be.

51
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,709
He said, it should not be like a business.

52
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,970
It should not be like an office building.

53
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,410
It should not be a commercial building.

54
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,110
It should convey the sincerity and profundity of art.

55
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,760
It should convert, he said, the vitality of the street into the sincerity and profundity

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
of art.

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,720
Breuer's reflections, although they maybe seem a little bland at first, they actually

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,650
take on an urgency if you think about the context.

59
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:54,770
At this moment American affluence in the 1960s was the motor of a growing consumerism like

60
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,150
the world had never seen.

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,459
And of course, Madison Avenue, which was the site of the Whitney, symbolized through its

62
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,360
ad agencies, through its boutiques, this growing consumerism.

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:12,090
And it was this consumerism that Breuer was afraid would encroach upon art, would invade

64
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,010
the more elite space of art.

65
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,630
Breuer wasn't the only one concerned about what he called the sincerity and profundity

66
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,320
of art as a sort of defense against consumerism.

67
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,580
The critic Peter Blake had this to say about the Whitney Museum.

68
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,060
"Here on Madison Avenue, Breuer is about to mount a massive attack on all those who have

69
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,120
made the name of this avenue synonymous with their racket.

70
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,599
The new Whitney will be art's answer to the huckster, where the ad agencies operate behind

71
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:49,389
flimsy glass walls, the Whitney will be wrapped in concrete faced with granite; where the

72
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:54,240
commercial ziggurats push the pedestrians off the sidewalk, the Whitney will invite

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,539
them in; and where the right-side-up ziggurats down the avenue"-- the ziggurats he is referring

74
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:04,860
to are products of the Manhattan zoning laws that require buildings to step back to allow

75
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
light down in.

76
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,589
So "the right-side-up ziggurats," he said, "now symbolize the huckster's perversion of

77
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:18,219
art, whereas the Whitney's upside-down monolith becomes a powerful symbol of sailing against

78
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:19,979
the current of the time."

79
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,979
So it's funny, sort of 1950s, 1960s language about hucksters and their racket.

80
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:29,479
But you see the point, that the Whitney would become a refuge for art.

81
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:37,900
The Whitney would be a defense mechanism to protect the elite power of artistic experience.

82
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,520
The photographer Ezra Stoller took the photographs of the interior.

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,020
And even though some of these spaces are very, very large, Stoller is able to capture what

84
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,210
I think was Breuer's intent, was that it was almost a domesticity to the Whitney's galleries.

85
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,060
This is important, because the Whitney Museum actually began in a residential area, in a

86
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,740
residential building, in downtown Manhattan.

87
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,879
And when they moved up on Madison Avenue, they wanted to keep this idea that the experience

88
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,300
of art, both personal and as a group, was something that would happen in the parlor.

89
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,139
It's something that would happen in the living room.

90
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,180
So the Whitney is actually-- with the moat around it, with its cladding of granite, of

91
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,909
stone-- is actually trying to protect a very elite understanding of art and the preciousness

92
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:30,849
of art.

93
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:36,319
The contrast between the Whitney's elitism and the Centre Pompidou's inviting the masses

94
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,419
and the populace into art could not be more different.
