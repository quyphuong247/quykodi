ANTOINE PICON: The overall organization of the building is quite simple.
https://youtu.be/hOmCJWqsGS8
1
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,390
It is actually strangely reminiscent of the structure

2
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,550
of a church with a central nave, which is 72 feet large,

3
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,490
and rises at the height of 64 feet.

4
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,300
But which is actually four times longer than the greatest church

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,570
in the United Kingdom, St. Paul's.

6
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,330
And, of course, with a much thinner structure.

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,450
This made a very spectacular impression on all the visitors.

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,130
This is the Crystal Palace immediately after the end of the Great Exhibition.

9
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,610
And we can see this kind of impression of infinity.

10
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,280
It was, perhaps, the first time that a building

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,760
gave this impression of being infinite.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,120
This repetitive, almost infinite space, in which the eye got almost lost.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,390
I mentioned the trees.

14
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,960
Here, we have the transept of the Crystal Palace with one of the trees.

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,990
And we are, by the same token, introduced

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,410
to another theme that will play an important role throughout the Great

17
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,990
Exhibition, which is the juxtaposition of the natural and the artificial,

18
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,870
with the suggestion that human industry is actually

19
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,460
an extension of a kind of fecundity of nature itself.

20
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,240
The main entrance of the exhibition was through the transept.

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,370
And people immediately discovered the trees, but also fountains, colors.

22
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,680
I'll come back to the ambience of the Great Exhibition,

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,850
because this is also an important aspect that gave the building also

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,560
its mythical character.

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,770
Because of its scale, the building confronted its designers two completely

26
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,980
unexpected problems.

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:00,120
One was actually how to evacuate water, the rain that fell on the roof.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,940
Because of the surface the building covered,

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,980
this problem of how to get rid of the water was actually pretty crucial.

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,490
The solution adopted, which Paxton had tested,

31
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,360
but at a much, much smaller scale in his lily house,

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,860
was actually to use hollow columns, in which the water would actually

33
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,060
be evacuated.

34
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,490
The new thing was actually that, at the bottom of the column,

35
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,440
you found pipes that were directly related to the sewers of the city.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,120
So we understand another thing, which is that this is actually

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,160
the beginning of the merging between the buildings and infrastructure.

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,980
The building is so large that it becomes commensurable

39
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,040
with the urban infrastructure as a whole.

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,020
Since the construction of the Crystal Palace in 1851,

41
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,060
this potential blurring between architecture and the infrastructure

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,410
has been with us repeatedly.

43
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,200
This has been the case, for example, with the Kansai

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,420
Airport built by Renzo Piano in Japan,

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,330
which was, at the time of its completion,

46
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,430
one of the largest buildings in the world--

47
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,080
A few kilometers long.

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,180
It's quite revealing that, Ove Arup, in order

49
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,380
to give an idea of the scale of the building, actually used Hyde Park.

50
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,290
The very site where the Crystal Palace was constructed,

51
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,690
as if large large contemporary buildings, like the Kansai Airport terminal,

52
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,970
were actually the inheritor, and they are indeed,

53
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,250
of these kind of giant gigantism that was introduced

54
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,840
at the time of the Crystal Palace.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,510
Another interesting aspect to note is actually

56
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,060
the double level of reading of a structure like this one.

57
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,910
Let pay attention, for example, to the node.

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,660
In order to additionally stabilize the structure,

59
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,080
you have these giant ties that intersect,

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,540
and there you have a node in the middle.

61
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,760
Look at the complexity of the node.

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,860
Of course, you don't discover it immediately.

63
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,070
But actually, iron construction will be marked

64
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:16,670
by this kind of tension between the overall appearance and the details

65
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,310
and the secret of complementarity between the two.

66
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,080
This is something to keep in mind is that, in iron,

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,870
because of the very repetitive nature, etc.,

68
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,760
details do matter.

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,580
"God is in the detail," as some famous architect would later say,

70
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,280
and Paxton is somebody who worked, one again, both

71
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,390
about the overall scheme, but also in these very minute details.

72
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,850
In order to understand that, you know, another building, built much later, actually,

73
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,480
the Eiffel Tower of 1889, the overall impression

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,470
is actually very much dependent of the type of node used.

75
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,350
Here, you have the typical node of the Eiffel Tower.

76
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,670
And again, there is this complementarity between the overall impression

77
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,260
and details that are kind of almost subliminal, but do play actually

78
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,970
quite an important role in the reading of the structure.

79
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,350
The famous art critic and theorist John Ruskin

80
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,880
had a very mixed feeling about the Crystal Palace,

81
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,890
because, of course, he was impressed by the performance as if, as he said,

82
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,520
"...the whole world had been encompassed by a single building."

83
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,300
But at the same time, and we'll return to that,

84
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,690
he was critical because iron was not his favorite material,

85
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,450
and he despised industrialization.

86
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,020
Nevertheless, saying that the whole world could now

87
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,470
be sheltered in a single building introduces

88
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,470
another very important dimension of this building, which

89
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,300
is a kind of environmental quality.

90
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,580
This is a building in which ventilation, the control of humidity,

91
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,230
all these questions that we think have arisen only recently

92
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,910
were already present.

93
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,450
You have to imagine millions of people sweating, etc.

94
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,300
You have to imagine the heat.

95
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,050
Even in London, sometimes, you can get sun

96
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,330
and the building can get pretty hot.

97
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,190
So the typical problem of a greenhouse,

98
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,390
but of course, it was a greenhouse not for tropical plants, but for people.

99
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,250
This is actually one of the louvers of Paxton.

100
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,110
And, actually, the building is inseparable from problems, complex problems,

101
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,910
of ventilation that, there again, we take for granted.

102
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:41,640
But where, for the first time, really addressed at such a scale

103
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,160
The Crystal Palace was mythical, not only

104
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,350
because of the very unique ambience it offered to its visitors,

105
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,330
but also because of the construction.

106
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,740
The construction is an integral part of the myth.

107
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,370
One could even say that it was the first time that construction was really

108
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,500
as much associated with the meaning of the building.

109
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,780
The contemporaries were completely struck

110
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,810
by how these standardized pieces arrived on site, were assembled.

111
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,140
This is the beginning, also, of the fascination for dry assemblage.

112
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,490
So nothing having to do with the wetness of mortar.

113
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,830
Nothing like, you know, all these traditional construction techniques,

114
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,170
but something like a magic dance of parts, pieces.

115
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,460
Not yet machines--

116
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,360
horses were still the main source of power on the construction.

117
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,280
In some ways, the Marxian notion of forces of production

118
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:49,590
was probably almost illustrated by such a ballet of industrial components.

119
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,210
Throughout the construction, Paxton was, of course, present,

120
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:00,660
and had multiple opportunities to show his ingeniosity.

121
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,670
For example, putting in place the barrel vault elements of the transept

122
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,260
was not such a simple process, as we can see on this engraving.

123
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,840
The barrel vault elements were actually in wood.

124
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,380
There again, we find this complexity, and this mix

125
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,530
of traditional and more modern elements.

126
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,820
The construction site was, by the way, really a spectacle.

127
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,150
And Fox and Henderson sold, actually, tickets

128
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,110
in order for the public to come and visit and see what was going on.

129
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,549
Speaking of ingeniosity, Paxton also designed a number

130
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,059
of machine [for raising, glazing], for all kinds

131
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:41,669
of purposes on the construction site.

132
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,150
Here we find also another interesting aspect

133
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,460
of what the Crystal Palace was about, which

134
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,020
is a kind of continuity between structural and mechanical engineering.

135
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,530
Something very specific to the British scene in many respects.

136
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:02,250
On the continent, engineers or builders did not always imagine machines.

137
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,160
Here, to design a machine and to design a building

138
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,460
are part of the same continuum.

139
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,120
And this is also a very important aspect,

140
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,940
an aspect that might explain, in some ways,

141
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,420
why the high-tech expression was a product of Great

142
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,430
Britain in the 20th century.

143
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:29,040
As if this legacy of articulation between machines and buildings had

144
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,890
remained an enduring tradition.

145
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,660
Putting in place the glass for the roof was also quite something.

146
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,580
An enormous enterprise in which, of course, risk was present.

147
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,490
The glass could break, could fall on the workers working below.

148
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,850
So special precautions had to be taken.

149
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,910
There again, innovative techniques were put into place.

150
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,920
For example, you have these little carriages

151
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,150
on rails that enabled, actually, to go a bit faster when

152
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,830
putting in place the large sheets of glass produced by the Chance Brothers

153
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,520
Factory.

154
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,500
Here on this vision, if you pay closer attention,

155
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,980
you will see actually the little carriages

156
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,630
circulating on top of the building on the rails, and putting in place

157
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,290
the glass.

158
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,790
While on the front of the picture, you have horses, which

159
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,200
are used to lift a girder of the nave.

160
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,680
So we can see there, again, this mix of innovation and tradition.

161
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,775
Mechanization would take over far later on construction sites.

162
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,050
The result was a completely strange space for the contemporaries,

163
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:46,200
something fascinating, but something that was not easy to categorize.

164
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,850
Was it architecture?

165
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,620
Was it something else?

166
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,150
I have mentioned the blurring between architecture and infrastructure.

167
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,910
In some ways, the Crystal Palace was sublime.

168
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,040
That's to say, something that escaped usual aesthetic categories.

169
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,260
And Paxton himself was never fully recognized as a fully-fledged designer.

170
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,590
It's quite revealing that, despite the spectacular achievement,

171
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,000
he was never awarded the Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,500
As if the nature of what he had produced remained uncertain.

173
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:27,910
This strangely repetitive, fascinating space... but was it really an architectural creation?

174
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,830
And there, of course, we understand why John Ruskin was so reluctant.

175
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,310
Was it still art in the traditional sense?

176
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,470
Where was the hand of the craftsmen that Ruskin praised above everything?

177
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,580
All these traditional dimensions of art and architecture

178
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,110
had vanished in this enchantment of iron and glass

179
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,010
that would fascinate millions of people, but the status of which

180
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,280
remained very unclear in the eyes of the professional.

181
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,370
One can say that the Crystal Palace marks

182
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,500
the beginning of the split between the taste of the public at large

183
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,020
and what professionals, like architects, care about.

184
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,260
The Crystal Palace is sublime because it's spectacular in terms of size,

185
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,660
because of the emotion it gave to the people who practiced it.

186
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,520
But it's also something that doesn't have a clear status in terms

187
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,870
of architecture.

188
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,610
On this view, we can almost feel the sublimity

189
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,420
linked to the idea of infinity, of transparency.

190
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,030
And we can also understand why people who

191
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,860
appreciated Greek temples or Gothic churches could feel a bit ill at ease

192
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,830
in front of such a construction that did not

193
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:49,340
enter any clear category of the history of architecture.
