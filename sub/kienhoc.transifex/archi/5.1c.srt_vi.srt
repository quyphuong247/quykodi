ANTOINE PICON: Joseph Paxton is a kind of quintessential British hero
https://youtu.be/qZg3_uXHey4
1
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,350
of those years insofar that he had no traditional training.

2
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,690
He was neither an engineer nor an architect, but actually

3
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,240
somebody who had risen pretty much by himself.

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,689
Queen Victoria was to call him a gardener

5
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,710
in a dismissive way in her memoirs.

6
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,890
Actually, Joseph Paxton was far more than a gardener;

7
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,230
he was somebody, indeed, interested in botany,

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,830
but somebody who had realized construction of all kinds, somebody

9
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,740
also who launched press enterprises.

10
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,960
He created a couple of journals.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,860
And above all-- and that's true he was a gardener in that respect--

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,060
he had become the chief gardener of the Duke of Devonshire

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,030
and responsible for the management of the main estate

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,129
of the Duke in Chatsworth.

15
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,090
Chatsworth was a magnificent castle, but it was also...it

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,990
hosted a very large botanical collection.

17
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,820
The Duke himself commissioned expedition to bring tropical species

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,490
and acclimate them in Chatsworth.

19
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,640
If Chatsworth is mostly known today for its beautiful grounds,

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,390
it was also a highly experimental place where Paxton realized,

21
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,290
in particular, two experimental greenhouses,

22
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,680
which would play a role in the initial design of the Crystal Palace.

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,450
Paxton's main realization in Chatsworth was the Great Stove, a giant greenhouse

24
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,650
started in 1838 and completed in 1840.

25
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,700
It was, at the time, one of the largest greenhouses ever built.

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,390
The Great Stove was not only important because of its dimension,

27
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,010
but because also of a number of technological achievements, among which

28
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:07,430
the use of very large sheets of glass, very different from the smaller pieces

29
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,229
that had been used before Paxton.

30
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,190
Paxton worked actually in close relation with the Chance Brother

31
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,100
Company, a company who produced glass.

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,290
And actually, the Chance Brother Company will be working for the Crystal Palace.

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,510
The Great Stove has disappeared today, but it

34
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,170
was much admired by the contemporaries, among other things

35
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,620
not only because of the technology, but also its sheer size.

36
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,670
You have to imagine that it was as high as the vault of a Gothic church,

37
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,790
something quite impressive, which enabled the greenhouse

38
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,850
to host trees inside.

39
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,630
Here we have, for example, a drawing made by a German architect

40
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,630
while touring Chatsworth, which says a lot about the kind of European-wide reception

41
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,970
of Paxton's work.

42
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,630
So gardener, perhaps according to Queen Victoria, but a gardener

43
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,910
of a very special and elevated type.

44
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,020
Another key realization of Paxton at Chatsworth

45
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,690
was the 1850 lily house that he built to host the giant lily

46
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,330
plant called the Victoria regia.

47
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,720
This was actually a very rapidly growing plant,

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,360
which entailed actually rebuilding an entire greenhouse for it alone.

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,190
There, Paxton actually used a completely innovative roof principles,

50
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:33,940
using much longer sash bars supported by cast iron trusses, that would actually

51
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,320
be the very principle for the Crystal Palace roof techniques.

52
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,330
One of the key intuitions behind the lily house

53
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,950
was that a great resistance could be achieved by thinking of structure

54
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,250
not necessarily in terms of very large and massive structural members,

55
00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,520
but through a more web or lattice-like way of thinking, something that

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,560
was inspired, allegedly to Paxton, by the very lily flower he

57
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,950
had to shelter in the lily house.

58
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,980
Here we have Paxton's daughter sitting on one

59
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,590
of the leaves of the Victoria regia.

60
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,110
And these leaves were rigidified through these kind of intricate webs, which

61
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,140
was a source of inspiration for Paxton.

62
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,660
And the whole lily house is actually a complex system

63
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,470
that functions a little bit like what we would call today

64
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,510
a kind of space structure.

65
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,840
As we can see here, they have relatively long sash bars, which

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,390
are supported by cast iron girders.

67
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,220
But the whole thing functions a little bit

68
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,940
like a web, which was one of the principles at work in the Crystal

69
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,720
Palace.

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,250
Here we have a more detailed view of the Paxton roofing principles,

71
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,370
which may look simple, but which is full of refinement.

72
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,760
For example, the wood beam are actually rigidified through iron cables

73
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,890
a little bit like a truss.

74
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,180
You may note also the grooves at the base of the wood beams.

75
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,240
They are actually meant to allow for the water produced

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,540
by condensation to be evacuated.

77
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:20,930
The genius of Paxton lies not only in the general conception of his building

78
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:27,150
but also in the very close attention paid to details.

79
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,350
And as we will see, details at the scale of the Crystal Palace

80
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,130
become no longer negligible.

81
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:43,270
I have insisted on the use of large sheets of glass by Paxton,

82
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,450
glass produced by the Chance Brother factory.

83
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,600
It's quite interesting that glass, which is, with iron, one

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,020
of the most emblematic materials of the Industrial Era,

85
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,480
remained relatively artisanal.

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,100
It was blown.

87
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,780
Typically, people blew cylinders that were then opened and flattened in order

88
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,260
to produce sheets of glass, while iron, of course,

89
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,980
knew very important transformation in terms of processing.

90
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,070
So we understand also that a process like the first Industrial Revolution

91
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,280
is actually a mix of very spectacular technological advances and more

92
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,570
incremental, more minute changes, like those

93
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,620
that characterize glass manufacturing.

94
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:37,370
So how did Paxton enter the story of the Great Exhibition?

95
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,820
Actually, through a series of serendipitous coincidences.

96
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,090
Paxton actually had begun sketching.

97
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,620
He was actually appalled by the official scheme of the committee in charge

98
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,970
of the exhibition.

99
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:59,060
And imagined that actually a greenhouse-like solution would actually

100
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,840
function much better at that scale, and especially

101
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,800
would be lighter and less expensive.

102
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,180
He had begun to sketch.

103
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,620
And here is one of the most famous sketches in which we find

104
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,450
the principle of the Crystal Palace.

105
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,800
It's a kind of cross-section,

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,480
and it's a kind of giant lily house with the same roof principles

107
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,480
but, of course, at a completely different scale.

108
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,920
Among the many interests of Paxton, one found railways.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,820
Once again, he was a very special kind of gardener,

110
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,510
and he had become an expert in railways.

111
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,380
And he had traveled in order to participate to a discussion

112
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:45,440
at a trial regarding some kind of contentious issues on railway

113
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,150
construction and management.

114
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,550
And traveling back to London, he met with one

115
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,930
of the members of the committee, Robert Stephenson, the famous engineer, who

116
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,770
had been involved in a number of enterprises--

117
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,620
railway, but also bridges.

118
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,840
He's the author of the Britannia Tubular Bridge.

119
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,780
And Paxton showed his scheme to Stephenson,

120
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,300
who got completely enthusiastic and thought

121
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,001
that this could be the solution to the conundrum in which the committee found

122
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:12,500
themselves.

123
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,180
So Stephenson did encourage Paxton to actually submit

124
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,540
his proposal for the realization of the great building of the exhibition.

125
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:29,000
There was only one problem, which is that the call for proposals

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,559
were actually proposals to build the project elaborated by the committee.

127
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:41,630
Fortunately, in the contract, it was stipulated

128
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:49,160
that if the building companies had an alternative idea that was cheaper,

129
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,280
they could actually submit it in parallel with their proposal

130
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,860
to build the project of the committee.

131
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,530
So Paxton partnered with a firm called Fox and Henderson

132
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,160
and proposed his scheme as an alternative

133
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,360
to the construction of the committee.

134
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,590
Paxton's proposal was roughly 60% to 80% cheaper

135
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:22,790
than building the project with brick and mortar of the committee.

136
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,440
But it was not only cheaper.

137
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,350
It was actually much more seductive.

138
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,860
And the images published by the press immediately gathered

139
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,720
momentum around what appeared more and more as the solution

140
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,820
to the difficult problem of how to host the Great Exhibition.

141
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,960
Let's not forget that we're in something like in June 1850.

142
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,290
And they're barely one year and a half in order

143
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,740
to complete the construction to open the exhibition.

144
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,890
So actually, things were pretty much in rush.

145
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,710
This image, published in the press, is actually

146
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,860
the first version of Paxton's project.

147
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,480
As we can see, this is a very repetitive building

148
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,850
in which there is a certain indistinction

149
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,120
between the various parts of the buildings, something

150
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,370
that was wanted by Paxton.

151
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,330
In some ways, the Crystal Palace also marks the emergence

152
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,630
of a totally new idea in architecture, which

153
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,640
is the idea of flexibility, an idea that we, there again, become completely

154
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,420
accustomed to.

155
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,200
Flexibility seems a key notion when thinking

156
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,300
in terms of very large building.

157
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:39,210
But once again, this was the first time that such ideas ever emerged.

158
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,120
An odd thing to notice, there is no transept,

159
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,220
contrary to the final buildings in which we can see a transept with a barrel

160
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,390
vault in the middle of the building.

161
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,110
The transept was actually an idea that emerged

162
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,840
at the intersection of a couple of concerns.

163
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,960
One was that the ground on which the building was to be constructed

164
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,330
was actually leased.

165
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:09,600
But it had to be brought back in its initial shape.

166
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
And there were a number of trees on that ground,

167
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,330
and the British are very attached to trees, as we all know.

168
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,780
So trees have not to be destroyed.

169
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:24,040
So there was a problem on how actually to put the trees inside the building.

170
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,000
So the additional height provided by the barrel vault

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,940
was an elegant solution to that.

172
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,580
A second role played by the transept was actually

173
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,060
to improve a little bit the lateral bracing.

174
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,330
It did improve the bracing.

175
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,980
But one has to say that actually Paxton and Fox and Henderson, his builder,

176
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,060
were quite lucky because the bracing was still pretty imperfect.

177
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,420
And had a storm or something happened, the Crystal Palace

178
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,940
could have been in serious trouble.

179
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,880
This was a building very rapidly designed

180
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,040
and with a number of structural flaws that

181
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,090
have become evident to the eye of historians studying retrospectively

182
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,660
how it was designed.

183
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,630
I said that the building was enormous.

184
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,100
It covered on the ground something like 800,000 square feet,

185
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,900
something quite unheard of at that time.

186
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,810
In addition to that, a second floor brought some additional 200,000

187
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,540
square feet.

188
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,420
So in total, it was almost 1 million square feet,

189
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,470
something that enabled to display all the artifacts that

190
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,450
had been secured by the organization committee for the Great Exhibition,

191
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:45,290
but there again, something that one had never seen before that building.
