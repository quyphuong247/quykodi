K. MICHAEL HAYS: The Villa Stein-de-Monzie, usually called
https://youtu.be/oZFSKZTimzQ
1
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,580
simply by its location, Garches, is a very different kind

2
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,930
of translation of the Dom-ino system into a suburban house.

3
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,310
And here, we can see all the features of Dom-ino: the column

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:33,380
grid and its supporting horizontal slabs, its relationship to the earth,

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,570
the separation of the structural columns from the interior walls that

6
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,680
allows a free arrangement of the plan, the implication

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,730
now fulfilled of a non-load-bearing wall in front of the slab on the long side.

8
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,130
And the fact that it's a non-load-bearing

9
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,710
wall being indexed by windows that go across the entire width

10
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,470
of the facade, what Le Corbusier would call

11
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,890
ribbon windows or elongated windows.

12
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,120
And then, there's even a balcony that projects in front of the wall plane

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,850
that, in a way, further develops, or fulfills,

14
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,270
this implication of pulling the columns back

15
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,250
from that slightly cantilevered slab, that in front of that slab,

16
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,215
one is free to put a kind of wrapper, or a facade, of different types.

17
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,410
We will see again this idea of an itinerary of movement and stasis,

18
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,840
of frontality and rotation.

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,310
This time, however, that itinerary begins well beyond the house,

20
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,720
at the entrance to the entire site, that is marked by a little concierge

21
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,690
building with a find of skeletal canopy, or skeletal gate, through which you first

22
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,920
enter, and where we're initially fixed by the frontality

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,710
of this rectangular facade in the distance.

24
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,930
But we're fixed just off center, so that already the idea of frontality

25
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,310
and an implied need for rotation is introduced.

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,380
From that vantage, we can start to perceive, even if it's unconsciously,

27
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,760
what Le Corbusier called "regulating lines" of the facades.

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,390
For example, there are diagonals that go from the top corner

29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,870
to the opposite bottom corner, and then other lines

30
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,530
that are developed off that diagonal, that are either parallel,

31
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,170
or perpendicular, to that diagonal.

32
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,070
And these give the facade a sensation of a very strict order.

33
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,140
But at the same time, it allows enormous variations of openings, and punctures,

34
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,990
and balconies, in the wall.

35
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,580
The wall envelope defines that all-important volumetric quality

36
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,220
that Le Corbusier sees as defining objet-type.

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,180
The column grid at Garches is not the square column grid of the Dom-ino plan.

38
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,120
It's rather a kind of geometric grid that

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,650
has a rhythm of base sizes, A, B, A, B, A. Or the proportion of the base

40
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,090
is 2 to 1, 2 to 1, and 2.

41
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,400
The English historian and critic, Colin Rowe,

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,010
compared this patterned geometric grid with Palladio's Villa Malcontenta,

43
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,560
that we saw earlier in this course.

44
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Within that column grid, and free of the structuring function of that column

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,090
grid, are these curvilinear stairwells, and rooms

46
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,210
with curved partition, that are very, very similar

47
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,240
to the objet-type of Purist paintings.

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,570
And many critics have actually seen the villa as something

49
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,510
like a three-dimensional Purist painting.

50
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,140
Le Corbusier himself saw these curved shapes inside the column grid

51
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,980
as what he called "compressed organs" of the house.

52
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,930
And indeed, often the curves will indicate

53
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,220
spaces of intense bodily performance, for example like a stairwell.

54
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,500
Coming back to the front facade, the main entrance to the villa

55
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,870
is fitted with a big, cantilevered awning.

56
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,390
Located symmetrically to the main entrance

57
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,820
is another smaller service entrance.

58
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,120
But above the service entrance is placed a balcony.

59
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,250
So there's a kind of symmetry, or better, there's

60
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,290
a kind of balance to the two entries around the center of the facade.

61
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,360
But it's not an exact repetition.

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,190
It's not an exact symmetry.

63
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,640
The two large, elongated windows register the fact

64
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,850
that it is a non-load-bearing wall.

65
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,380
And the balcony that punctures through the surface at the very top, again,

66
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,480
starts a kind of plasticity.

67
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,200
It starts a kind of layering of the wall that will be carried out

68
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,625
on the interior of the house.

69
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,150
The first floor accommodates a large entry hall, as well as

70
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,550
a garage and various service spaces.

71
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,640
When we enter the entry hall, we come into contact

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,760
then with the freestanding columns, or what Le Corbusier

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,470
called the freestanding pilotis.

74
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,630
And here because the columns are freestanding apart from the wall,

75
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,510
they operate almost like a little framing device

76
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,490
that creates a moment of stasis, after the long movement through the side,

77
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,790
and through the front door into the entry.

78
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,220
At that moment of stasis, we confront a curved wall, symmetrically placed

79
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,900
within that frame, as well as a diagonal wall just to the left.

80
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,090
And the spatial forces of the curved wall and the diagonal wall

81
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,910
almost compel us to turn to the right to find the main stair that will take us

82
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,590
up to the primary second floor.

83
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,040
The second floor has the main living spaces, the dining room,

84
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,450
and the kitchen.

85
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,480
Given the elongated windows, we might expect

86
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,710
that the second floor would comprise a very large living

87
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,190
space that would run parallel to the front wall,

88
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,320
or parallel to the garden wall.

89
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,190
In fact, Le Corbusier has divided it up in exactly the opposite way.

90
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,010
The vertical surfaces that divide the space

91
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,690
are perpendicular to the two long outside walls.

92
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,660
The curvilinear wall of the dining room at once

93
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,320
makes an enclosing space for the dining room, that

94
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,570
has a view out the back to the garden.

95
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,330
But the curve also sets up an axis, which

96
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,090
defines the center of the living room on the opposite side.

97
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,820
At the front of the living room, is a gallery,

98
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,540
from which we can move out onto a sheltered terrace, which

99
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,840
can be seen from the living room and the dining room, but not accessed.

100
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,270
Once again, we have now a more complicated version

101
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,330
of rotation and frontality.

102
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:05,450
The whole weight, or energy, of the main floor plan

103
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,250
seems to be on the periphery.

104
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:13,790
There seems to be an energetic swirling of space around that central living

105
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,780
room.

106
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,270
And that swirling of space, which creates now a rotation, almost

107
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,970
virtual rotation, that parallels our bodily rotation through the spaces.

108
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,420
Against that are these vertical surfaces, often given

109
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,870
a kind of figuration, because of a certain kind of curve,

110
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,410
or a certain kind of opening, that creates moments of stasis,

111
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,135
within that peripheral swirl.

112
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,640
The third floor accommodates the bedrooms.

113
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,070
And then, finally, on the top floor, there's

114
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,470
an enormous terrace with a sauna.

115
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,830
And here, we can really get the sense of what Le Corbusier meant

116
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,990
when he talked about compressed organs.

117
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,810
The sauna is a very intense bodily space.

118
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,970
It's where the hot, wet air, and what, for Corbusier,

119
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,430
was an important hygienic function of the sauna, would be performed.

120
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,070
And he gives the sauna a little lozenge-ish shape,

121
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,210
again like a little organ placed on top of the roof terrace,

122
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,780
which itself then would provide dry air and sunlight,

123
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,660
again for a hygienic function.

124
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,960
The top terrace has often reminded commentators of

125
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,100
not just the hygienic health functions that Corbusier

126
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,250
wanted to be performed there, but also of an ocean liner,

127
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,170
the deck of an ocean liner.

128
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,159
Where beyond the function of, sort of a healthy space that's provided,

129
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,100
it was also an industrial space, a new kind

130
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,909
of space, on top of an ocean liner, which

131
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,950
along with automobiles and airplanes, were the objet-type that Corbusier

132
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,100
thought represented modern industry and modern spirit.
