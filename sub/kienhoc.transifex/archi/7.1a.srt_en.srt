K. MICHAEL HAYS: Beginning in 1921, in his magazine "L'Esprit Nouveau" and later in his book

2
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,550
"Vers une Architecture" or "Toward an Architecture" the French-Swiss architect Charles-Ã‰douard Jeanneret, or

3
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,360
Le Corbusier as he called himself, wrote what amounted to brilliant pieces of propaganda

4
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,540
for what he called "a new architecture."

5
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,530
"A great epoch has begun.

6
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,680
There exists a new spirit.

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,040
Industry, overwhelming us like a flood which rolls on toward its destined ends, has furnished

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,289
us with new tools, adapted to this new epoch, animated by a new spirit.

9
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,820
The problem of the house is the problem of the epoch."

10
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,080
We must create the mass-production spirit for the mass-produced house.

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,500
Le Corbusier was beginning here to conjure a new architecture.

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,670
One that would respond to the challenges imposed by modern industrialization, the mass production

13
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,460
of houses using standardized building parts, building components.

14
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:33,120
But at the same time, he wanted to reconcile these challenges with the great architecture

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,450
of the past.

16
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,070
Which for him, meant the classical architecture of Greece and Rome.

17
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,200
The new architecture, Le Corbusier said, would be "a machine for living."

18
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,180
Years earlier, in 1914, he had conceived what he called the Dom-ino house.

19
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,970
The name is constructed from the Latin word "domus" for house, and innovation.

20
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,940
The Dom-ino is really more of a diagram than a building.

21
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,819
You can see it's really a superstructure.

22
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:36,069
Le Corbusier called it a chassis onto which any number of variations of houses could be

23
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,069
outfitted.

24
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:43,380
It's a diagram that is not yet bound by room layout or any kind of decorative trim.

25
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,379
Actually, it doesn't even have an enclosure yet.

26
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:48,420
The walls, the elevations, are not on.

27
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,659
It's all plan and all section.

28
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:57,810
Nevertheless, the Dom-ino would be understood as a kind of primitive hut of the modern.

29
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,550
As I say, the Dom-ino is all plan and section-- no elevation or surfaces, no wrapper.

30
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,889
It's proper to understand it really as an emblem, as much as a building--

31
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:15,940
a diagram of a new technological and constructional paradigm of mass production, standardization,

32
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,939
repetition, and so forth.

33
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:24,680
It's really a prototype of potential of the new technology of reinforced concrete, glass,

34
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,870
and steel.

35
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:33,629
But this diagram, with it's sort of concentrated energy of slab, column, circulation, and base,

36
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:39,260
contains a lot of implication that Le Corbusier will explore for the next several decades

37
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,120
in his houses.

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,519
So let's look at the Dom-ino in some detail.

39
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,360
The diagram comprises three horizontal slabs.

40
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,419
The first floor slab is on six box-like footings that raises it slightly above the ground.

41
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,150
And then the columns, that seem to go through the slabs, hold up the next two slabs.

42
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,680
It's really initially to be read as a constructional integer, a constructional unit, that would

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,579
be the basis for any building.

44
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,379
Let's look at it in more detail.

45
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,299
The columns are set back from the long side of the slab.

46
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,310
And yet they're very, very close to the short sides of the slab.

47
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,090
This makes a clear differentiation between front and side.

48
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,030
We should remember this because it'll become very important when we see how Le Corbusier

49
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,280
develops that.

50
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,630
The columns also mark off equal bays.

51
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,970
There's a kind of rhythm.

52
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,970
There's a rigor.

53
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,139
There's a mathematical underpinning to the spacing of the columns, and there's actually

54
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,710
a proportional relationship between the bays.

55
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,980
The footings emphasize the building's relation to the ground.

56
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,970
It's neither buried in the ground, nor is it yet suspended from the ground.

57
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,680
It's just pulled up so that there's a distinction between the slab and the earth.

58
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,029
The Dom-ino is an example of what Le Corbusier called an "objet-type"

59
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,770
or a typal object or an object type.

60
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,300
In his early sketches and essay, Le Corbusier celebrates the grain silos in North

61
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,680
America, these big cylindrical storage containers--

62
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,340
along with automobiles, ocean liners, and other accessories of the machine age that

63
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,060
he saw as the materialization of pure form.

64
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,229
It was in part the volume of these objet-type that was important for him.

65
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,920
But also the fact that they had been refined over time.

66
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:46,889
That they had become pure forms, or these figural volumes, through an evolution of use and production.

67
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,410
In his paintings too, ordinary objects of daily life, like glasses and plates, or pipes

68
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,460
and bottles, guitars and pianos, these appear to him intensely interesting.

69
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,139
First and foremost because of their simple shape, their contour.

70
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:08,979
But he thought that volumes viewed in light, even simple everyday objects that were volumetric

71
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:15,470
figures viewed in light, could trigger deep fundamental sensations and affects.

72
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:24,000
As an example of what he regarded as this universal reach of the concept of objet-type,

73
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,039
Le Corbusier made this comparison.

74
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,360
On the left top you see the Greek temple at Paestum.

75
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,629
On the right is the Parthenon.

76
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:36,849
He understood the Greek temple as a kind of objet-type that had, over centuries,

77
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:38,930
been evolved and refined.

78
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,800
But out of a basic rule, had become more and more perfect.

79
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,980
Below the Greek temple, you see two automobiles.

80
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,409
On the left is the Humbert Cabriolet; this is around 1907.

81
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,569
On the right is the Delage Grand-Sport of 1921.

82
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:04,259
He compared the Greek temple with the modern automobile, with the machine, to say that

83
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,220
they are both objet-type, that they are refined over time.

84
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,719
But also to make the point that, in both cases, one has to start with the standard of a strict

85
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:21,069
diagram of the object in order to move forward toward perfection.

86
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,000
The lesson is that the ancient temple and the modern automobile are

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,419
objet-type that can be refined over time.

88
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:34,009
But you have to start with a standard, a kind of inaugural diagram, in order to achieve

89
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:34,750
that perfection.
