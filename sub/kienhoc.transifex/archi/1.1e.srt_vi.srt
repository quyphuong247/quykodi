K. MICHAEL HAYS: Tôi dẫn các bạn đến văn phòng của tôi
https://youtu.be/FUMOfq819ps
1
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,800
một phần là để khẳng định rằng

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,750
 nghiên cứu về kiến trúc không chỉ là làm việc trong xưởng

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,290
mà vòn bao gồm việc đọc và viết văn bản. 

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,100
Nhưng chủ yếu, tôi muốn cho các bạn thấy một cuốn sách đặc biệt. 

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,210
Nếu các bạn dự định 

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,360
hay coi như một 

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,190
các bạn có thể bỏ qua cuốn sách từ những năm 1920 

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,300
được viết bởi Erwin Panofsky, có nhan đề "Luật phối cảnh như một dạng biểu tượng"

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,810
Nhan đề này xuất phát từ triết học về dạng biểu tượng, 

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,730
Bây giờ, nếu suy nghĩ về những kiến thức khoa học, 

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,450
các bạn sẽ nghĩ tới những kiến thức chủ yếu liên quan đến những sự thật của khoa học, 

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,980
hay những thực tế của tự nhiên 

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,980
Nhưng trong nghiên cứu về dạng biểu tượng, 

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,170
kiến thức lại liên quan tới những thực tế văn hóa. 

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,750
Panofsky quan tâm đến những cách mà luật phối cảnh 

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,200
giống như một văn hóa.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,670
không chỉ mô tả một thế giới dã tồn tại. 

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,290
mà thực sự xây dựng một thế giới cho một người xem. 

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,330
Đó là một 

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,100
Tôi muốn đọc cho các bạn nghe một đoạn văn từ cuốn "Luật phối cảnh như dạng biểu tượng".

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,700
thực hiện hai việc trong doạn văn này. 

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,390
Thứ nhất, thực sự so sánh luật phối cảnh 

23
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,890
với những thành tựu nhận thức của việc khám phá ra vô cực, 

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,610
hay khám phá ra hình học. 

25
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,260
Thứ hai, so sánh luật phối cảnh và những kiến thức

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,590
mà chúng ta có được từ luật phối cảnh với triết học. 

27
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,250
Hãy lắng nghe. 

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,120
"...luật phối cảnh không chỉ nâng nghệ thuật lên tầm khoa học..

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,920
ấn tượng thị giác chủ quan thực sự dã được 

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,220
ấn tượng này có thể trở thành 

31
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,090
nền tảng 

32
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,380
in an entirely modern sense, 'infinite' experiential world."

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,830
so sánh luật phối cảnh với việc khám phá 

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,169
và những hiểu biết về vô cực. 

35
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,350
Sau đó, ông cho biết, "Một người thậm chí có thể so sánh 

36
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,170
chức năng của luật phối cảnh thời phục hưng với của triết học phê phán". 

37
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,650
là một từ mật mã 

38
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,110
The reason they call it critical philosophy is for Kant,

39
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,920
triêt học không chỉ giải thích hay nghiên cứu phản ánh mọi thứ 

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,140
trên thế giới. 

41
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,980
phản ảnh 

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,600
on the very possibility of experience.

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,710
And it's these conditions of possibility that Panofsky

44
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,980
is comparing a perspective to, that perspective

45
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,310
is like a condition of possibility for knowing itself,

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,140
or for experience itself.

47
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,530
And then finally, he says, "The result was

48
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:59,040
a translation of psychophysiological space into mathematical space;

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,780
nói cách khác, 

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,310
Panofsky  

51
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,920
that we made earlier, which is that perspective,

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,550
trong một hệ thống quan niệm gần như độc nhất, 

53
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,400
brings viewer and the world together.

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,210
Now, if we're going to think of perspective as this structure,

55
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,980
as this template, as this mechanism for constructing knowledge about the world,

56
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,330
not just for describing a world that already exists,

57
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,740
then we need a couple of things.

58
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,390
We need a system.

59
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,820
And the system should have both a structure,

60
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,750
and that structure should relate elements one

61
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,730
to another within the system.

62
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,070
So imagine the perspective of a city.

63
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,310
In that perspective of the city, you not only

64
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,840
would use perspective to regulate buildings or to describe buildings,

65
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,900
perspective would also relate buildings to one another,

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,930
and indeed, following Panofsky, would open up,

67
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,940
would expand almost to infinity the possibility of spatial perception

68
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,900
and spatial experience.

69
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,560
What I'd like to do as one final example of perspective

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,279
as the architectural imagination, or as a component

71
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,970
of the architectural imagination, is look at three paintings

72
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,890
from the Italian Renaissance.

73
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,110
These paintings are normally referred to now as "The Ideal City" paintings.

74
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,290
You'll sometimes hear them called the Urbino panel, the Baltimore

75
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,850
panel, and the Berlin panel.

76
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,400
We think they were all painted in Urbino,

77
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,370
but now we describe the three different panels from the cities

78
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,050
that they're located in now.

79
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,590
The important point is that the three panels seem to be--

80
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,800
or we can be certain they are actually paintings

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,730
in a series that show systematic transformations of urban space

82
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,940
through the technique of perspective.

83
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,940
Let's look at these now.

84
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,100
The first one is the Urbino panel.

85
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,850
And you can see that it describes an urban space, very symmetrical

86
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,840
urban space, with this amazing circular temple,

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,460
or temple shape, right in the center.

88
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,450
The space itself is like a T shape.

89
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,280
You can see that it comes up toward the viewer

90
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,500
and then flares out like a T shape.

91
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,800
And that T shape then is framed by the surfaces of these various palazzi.

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,990
Now, if you look into the background, it's really a closed perspective.

93
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,350
Just to the right of the round temple, you can just

94
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,100
barely see hints of sky and mountains.

95
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,040
But more or less, it's a closed perspective.

96
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,750
In this panel, the floor of the space, the piazza itself, is only one level.

97
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,440
Notice that the buildings are on plinths, raised slightly.

98
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,297
And then look at the style of the buildings.

99
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:56,380
If you know a little more about stylistic history,

100
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,000
you would see that the style of buildings is very uniform.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,670
And for the 15th century, it's very modern.

102
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,230
So this is a very modern, almost avant-garde, and very homogeneous

103
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,170
style of architecture that's used in this perspective painting.

104
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,290
And then one final thing I'll point out--

105
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,300
this will become important a little bit later--

106
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,900
is that the light, which perspective also controls,

107
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,655
is actually coming from the left and actually coming pretty high.

108
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,560
The second panel I want to show is called the Baltimore panel.

109
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,150
It's a very different scene.

110
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,780
It's a variation on the scene we just saw insofar as again,

111
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,090
the piazza itself is T shaped.

112
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,450
It comes forward from the center and then flares out.

113
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,800
But notice, rather than a single level floor, this floor has two levels.

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,190
It really looks like a proscenium.

115
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,760
And it was thought at some point that these paintings might be

116
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,617
prototypes for theatrical stage sets.

117
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:56,200
We now think that that's not the case.

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,450
We think they're actually almost like objects of meditation.

119
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,070
They probably would have become part of furniture.

120
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,440
In any case, look at the space that I've described as proscenium space.

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,500
And you notice that in the Urbino panel, the entire front

122
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,620
part of the painting, let's say the stage part of the painting,

123
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,630
is unoccupied by architecture.

124
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,020
The architecture is pushed back into the middle ground.

125
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,150
In the Baltimore panel, the proscenium is also absent of architecture as such,

126
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,800
but there are four columns.

127
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,817
And these are very, very symbolic columns.

128
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:27,150
They're not holding up anything.

129
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,440
They're just describing space.

130
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,990
Instead of those columns, what you get in the Urbino panel

131
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,640
are just these two wells.

132
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,320
And these wells are spread out very, very far to the edge of the space.

133
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,650
But the important thing is that where in the Urbino panel

134
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,960
the floor was flat, in the Baltimore panel, the floor has two levels.

135
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,450
All of the architecture is on the second level.

136
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,940
The rest of the architecture is removed from,

137
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,630
let's call it the proscenium or the stage.

138
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,880
Now, look at the architecture.

139
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,520
Look at the style of the architecture.

140
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,330
Compared to the Urbino panel, it's very, very eclectic.

141
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,390
You have this ancient triumphal arch.

142
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,340
You have what looks like an ancient coliseum,

143
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,650
but it's really too small to be a coliseum.

144
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,110
So it's sort of like an amphitheater probably.

145
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,740
On the other hand, to the right of the axis, this almost futuristic,

146
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,370
kind of stacked polygonal temple, and then the modern palazzi.

147
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,550
The backgrounds seem to vary as well because you

148
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,310
can see in the background of the Baltimore panel,

149
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,390
the triumphal arch is almost like a semi-transparent screen.

150
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,770
You can see through it, whereas the temple in the Urbino panel was closed.

151
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,780
Also, where the background in the Urbino panel

152
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,289
was closed, in the Baltimore panel, you can actually see through the city

153
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,860
to hills.

154
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,110
Here, some of the buildings are on plinths, some of them not.

155
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,452
So that may not be consequential yet.

156
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,660
But stylistically, as I said, they're very different.

157
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,600
This one's very eclectic, whereas the Urbino panel is very homogeneous.

158
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,790
And then finally-- and here's where the whole set,

159
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,980
the whole transformational process comes together-- is the Berlin panel.

160
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,840
The Berlin panel, in terms of where the architecture is

161
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,080
relative to the point of view, it's almost the inverse

162
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,910
because in the Berlin panel, we're not standing looking at a triumphal arch

163
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,480
or looking at a temple.

164
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,400
We're in this architectural organization.

165
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,840
And the four columns, though they relate to the four columns of the Baltimore

166
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,540
panel, now they're actually part of the architecture.

167
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,320
They're actually structural or constructional.

168
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,240
And you can see--

169
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,800
if you know stylistically-- we're standing in a very, very modern,

170
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,740
advanced Renaissance building.

171
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,030
The Berlin panel, in contrast to the single level of Urbino,

172
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:48,190
the two level Baltimore floor, now Berlin has three levels.

173
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,340
We're standing now not in the lowest level as before.

174
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,170
But we're standing in the highest level.

175
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,140
We can see that right after you step out of the triumphal arch--

176
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,470
or we think it's this construction that we're standing in--

177
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,940
just as you step off, you go down some steps.

178
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,630
The steps are hidden by the edge of the floor.

179
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,890
And then you're down a level.

180
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,080
The buildings here don't have plinths.

181
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,580
So we have a comparison that in Urbino, all the buildings had plinths.

182
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,950
In Baltimore, some of the buildings had plinths.

183
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,870
In Berlin, none of the buildings have plinths.

184
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,590
And then the background of the painting-- in Urbino, it was closed.

185
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,080
In Baltimore, it was semi-open.

186
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,030
And in Berlin, it's totally open.

187
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,890
What we're seeing is almost like an experiment in perspective,

188
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,400
or almost like a kind of combination of perspective and typology,

189
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,210
where what we're seeing are variations of an urban fabric,

190
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:42,190
variations of an urban form that, through perspective, can

191
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,990
be controlled in a highly systematic way, an almost mathematical way,

192
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,860
but at the same time proves capable of almost infinite variation.

193
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,180
And the important thing is that the variation is architectural variation.

194
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,410
It's spatial variation.

195
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:02,065
It's variation on the way the urban place or the urban form--

196
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:06,180
it's variation on the way the urban form works.

197
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,950
So in this example, we can see both that the system of perspective, because it

198
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,755
is a system, allows for variation in the arrangement of urban space,

199
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:21,720
and that that arrangement, because of the systematicity of perspective,

200
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,120
starts to construct a typology.

201
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,350
So again, this is why we think of typology and perspective, or typology

202
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,270
and perspective together, as examples of the architectural imagination.

203
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,570
But there's one more thing about a system like perspective,

204
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,840
a system that constructs knowledge rather than just

205
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,610
describing objects that already exist.

206
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,510
A system, if it's going to work, will always contain its other.

207
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,970
It will always contain, let's say, the undoing of the system.

208
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,690
Now, perspective represents this, or contains this, in a very dramatic way.

209
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,240
Think about that point of convergence, that point

210
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,180
where all lines converge in infinity.

211
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,670
And then think of that picture plane where we actually

212
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,060
see the representation that perspective gives us.

213
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,500
When we try to go back into infinity, and that picture plane blocks our way,

214
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,640
and we realize that we, of course, can't reach infinity,

215
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,650
but that somehow, we get the strange sense

216
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,130
that there's something looking back at us at the other end

217
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,840
of that line of vision.

218
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,770
That thing looking back at us might be perspective's other.

219
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,800
It might be the city itself, the social city that's

220
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,350
looking back at us as individuals, that we're

221
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,020
locked into this perspectival system by that point of view,

222
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,210
but that somehow, the social city and the collective is looking back at us.

223
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:48,360
Or it might just be the thing, that unthinkable thing that is not us.

224
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,500
And it's very interesting if we go back to the Urbino panel one last time

225
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,530
and look at a close-up of the door to that temple.

226
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,640
And notice that the painter painted that door slightly ajar.

227
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,170
Now, look even more closely.

228
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,940
When they cleaned the painting a few years ago,

229
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,450
they discovered-- you see that little spot just

230
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,900
to the right of the door in that space of very deep shadow.

231
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,630
They discovered the nail hole where the nail

232
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,600
had been from which the painters would pull

233
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,430
the string that represented all the converging lines of the perspective.

234
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,650
But that hole, that point of convergence,

235
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,430
that point where the thing exists that's looking back at us,

236
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,090
is inside the temple, inside the darkness, the void,

237
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,830
that the temple is enclosing.

238
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,340
It's almost as if architecture itself is somehow--

239
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,660
the whole reason for architecture is to contain that void and that moment

240
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,825
of convergence where the thing that's looking back at us,

241
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:47,720
that's challenging our very existence as subject, resides.
