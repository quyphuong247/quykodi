00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,010
K. MICHAEL HAYS: The idea of periodization is useful here.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,960
Periodization is a very old idea, but it's a fairly new word.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,740
It's really just the idea of dividing or partitioning

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,100
the past into chunks or into separate moments,

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,430
that each have their own sort of different identity.

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,920
We're familiar with the period of the ancient world or medieval times.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,470
The Renaissance is a very famous--

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,087
in most art history, the Renaissance period.

9
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:39,170
The Baroque may be different from the Renaissance,

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,730
distinct from the Renaissance.

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:46,190
Modernism itself occurs in art history occurs at a certain moment in time,

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,740
and maybe even the Postmodern is a period.

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,830
Now, there's some risk with this idea of periodization.

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,440
The risk is that you understand the period

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,340
as a sort of homogeneous, monolithic moment that

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,080
produces like a single style or that produces a single way of thinking.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,525
So there's a risk in the notion of periodization

18
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:12,920
of denying that the period has a diversity and a heterogeneity.

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,570
But without some notion of period and if the differences

20
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,600
in historical moments in historical times,

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,690
you really can't have history itself.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:30,270
The path would just seem like a sort of a random array of individual events.

23
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,620
So you need some notion of a period in order to do history itself.

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,420
Today, in this lecture, we're going to use

25
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,040
the periodization of a French philosopher, Jean Baudrillard.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,060
Now, Baudrillard's periods in terms of their date, in terms of time

27
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,520
were actually fairly standard.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,970
He has three periods that we'll talk about.

29
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,850
The interest for us here is that he sees these periods

30
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,780
as being defined by how we use signs and symbols,

31
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,550
how we represent the reality or the historical reality

32
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,255
to ourselves and to each other.

33
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:07,510


34
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,960
Baudrillard characterizes his periods as what

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,700
he calls "three orders of the simulacra,"

36
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,210
or we could just think of three periods where

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,890
the sign is used in different ways.

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,080
The first order is what he calls "imitation" or "counterfeit."

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,190
And here, the idea is that we can make representations

40
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:33,240
that refer to a reality, and we try to make those representations look

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,590
like that reality.

42
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,820
It's interesting that he gives the material of stucco as an example.

43
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,810
And when you make an angel or a unicorn or some imitation,

44
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,610
even if there's not a real thing like that in the world--

45
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,970
if we don't actually see angels in the world--

46
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,800
the angels still look like things we would expect to see in the world.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,420
They're made of stucco, which is, of course, an artificial material.

48
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,940
And the idea is that, even though they look

49
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,900
like things we might find in the world, we know that they're artificial.

50
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,730
We know that they're imitations.

51
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,820
So it's that slight difference between seeing a real person

52
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,670
and seeing a stucco angel.

53
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,320
It's that slight difference that actually-- in a way,

54
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,420
paradoxically-- assures us that reality is real and that these are imitations.

55
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,530
So that's the first order of the sign or the first order of the simulacrum.

56
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,590
The first order of the simulacrum occurs in time

57
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,880
really from the Renaissance up until the Industrial Revolution.

58
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,750


59
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,410
The second order the simulacrum is what he calls "production."

60
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,200
And here, the beginning of the second order

61
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,040
is sometimes around the Industrial Revolution

62
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,430
when industrialized manufacturing becomes possible.

63
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,620
Here, it's the ability to produce standardized objects

64
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,190
to reproduce the same thing over and over

65
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,670
that characterizes how we represent.

66
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,430
Here, the whole notion of an original goes away-- or the distinction

67
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,890
between an original and a copy.

68
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,589
Think of photography which is a technique or a technology that's part

69
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,690
of the second order of the simulacrum.

70
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,200
Even though you might have a single, authentic negative,

71
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,950
there's no difference in terms of the photographs

72
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,500
from one photograph to the next.

73
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,790
There is no original photograph.

74
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,310
Maybe in some way, the negative still assures you

75
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,780
that it's an imprint of the real itself, but there's no original.

76
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,760
There are only copies.

77
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,030
The mass produced commodity, of course, is the paradigm

78
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,100
for the second order of the simulacra.

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,140
Ready-made cigarettes, Model T Fords, printed newspapers--

80
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,534
all of these are products of production and reproduction.

81
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:55,190


82
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,000
Of course, in architecture, architects start to make buildings

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,460
with standardized building components.

84
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,840
You get a lot of repetition.

85
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,350
You get a lot of standardization and a sort of calibration.

86
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,902
So architecture itself becomes part of the second order of sign.

87
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:13,610
With production and reproduction, there's

88
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,930
no longer any nostalgia for a disappearing natural order.

89
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,990
All commodities, all standardized mass produced goods are the same.

90
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,010
So the system of value here becomes a monetary system.

91
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,650
How much is a commodity worth rather than how

92
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:36,530
useful is something or how relevant symbolically a stucco angel is?

93
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,557
It becomes only a matter of the commodity's monetary worth

94
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:41,390
in the second order.

95
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,700


96
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,950
The difference in the first order and the second order

97
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,030
can also be seen in the difference between an automaton and a robot.

98
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,580
During the late Renaissance, early Baroque,

99
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,870
people used automatons to sort of imitate humans.

100
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,390
They were often made by clock-makers, for example.

101
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,110
They could move.

102
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,100
They could play chess.

103
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,410
They might even be able to write or to type.

104
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,820
They had jerky movements.

105
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,390
They would be the same size as a human, but their movements wouldn't be smooth.

106
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,440
They would be jerky.

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,940
So again, it was actually the difference between the automaton and the human

108
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,900
that assured us, in a way, that we were human-- that we weren't mechanical.

109
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,960
Compare the automaton to a robot.

110
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,970
A robot starts to be able, not just to be like a human,

111
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,190
not just to be a metaphor or an analog of the human,

112
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,700
but it actually is able to begin to replace the human.

113
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,830
Robots on an assembly line replace workers.

114
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,850
So here, the relationship between the human and the robot

115
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,030
is on the order of equivalence or even replacement

116
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,070
as opposed to analogy or likeness.

117
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,800


118
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,770
Then Baudrillard says that the reigning order in our current lives--

119
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,790
the third order of the simulacra--

120
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,810
is what he calls "simulation."

121
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,380
What happens in simulation is that the variability

122
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,960
to distinguish between the representation and the real goes away.

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,730
One of the best examples, I think we could

124
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,700
think of the actual loss of a sense of a grounded reality

125
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,530
comes in the model of DNA.

126
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,720
Let's say that biologically our very foundation,

127
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,490
our reality at a molecular level has to do with the DNA.

128
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,060
And yet, Baudrillard reminds us DNA is a kind of writing.

129
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,530
DNA is a code.

130
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,220
So DNA, in effect, writes our bodies.

131
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,150
So there's no there's no way of conceptualizing

132
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,630
a reality that's deeper than that.

133
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,110
We can only conceptualize a system of representation

134
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,750
that is the basis for our own bodies.

135
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,790
This is the third order of the simulacra,

136
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,840
when we lose the ability to distinguish the real from the simulation.

137
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,260
We can see the effects of simulation in a lot of everyday examples.

138
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,870
Think of reality TV.

139
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,900
Is this television about a real situation,

140
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,100
or is it a total construction, a total simulation of a reality

141
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,040
that has no basis in reality?

142
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,820
Another example that I like is, at the ends of old movies,

143
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,380
they used to put bloopers.

144
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,060
They used that put outtakes.

145
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,870
And then, of course, when movies became animations, like Shrek, then

146
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,000
the bloopers themselves are animated.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
So the very "real mistakes" that were taken out

148
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,179
were actually simulations of mistakes.

149
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,659
Simulation even affects how we understand history.

150
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,950
In simulation, the past cannot be recovered.

151
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,870
We're not able to represent a true past.

152
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,000
But at the same time then, the future is just being consumed.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,770
There's no way of projecting alternative futures.

154
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,270
We sort of have to live in a suspended present.

155
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,540
So then our sense of heightened expectation

156
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,860
about the future, our sense of moving forward, having progress

157
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,920
starts to go away.

158
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,800
There's a waning of affect.

159
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,050
There's a loss of the sense of what is at stake in the future.
