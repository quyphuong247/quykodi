K. MICHAEL HAYS: It's important to note here that what
https://youtu.be/ZATpXlLiTvo
1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,990
Rossi calls the autonomy of architecture, architecture on its own,

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,770
so to speak, appears as an aesthetic and technical solution

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,990
to a problem that's neither aesthetic nor technological,

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,410
but is historical.

5
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,000
Rossi understands architecture as the material actualization of Spirit.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,130
As a kind of manifestation of the human community's

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,540
wish and desire to organize itself and represent itself.

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,950
Listen to how Rossi thinks of Spirit's appearance in architecture:

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,770
"The monument, having overcome its relation to history, becomes geography.

10
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,460
Perhaps, is not the light that creates shadows

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,030
the same light that consumes matter, giving us

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,070
a more authentic image of that which artists themselves want to give us?

13
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,360
For this, more than because it's personal and collective at once,

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,170
architecture is the most important of the arts and sciences, for its cycle

15
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,640
is natural, like the cycle of man..."

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,800
Let me read that again and unpack it.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,210
"The monument, having overcome its relation to history,

18
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,070
becomes geography."

19
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,820
So architecture, for Rossi, emerges in history,

20
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,540
but it shows forth something that's beyond history,

21
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,570
something more universal.

22
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,360
But just as quickly, just as quickly as it's shown that forth, it also leaves,

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,890
it leaves its status as art and it moves back into the earth

24
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,230
and becomes geography.

25
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,630
And then Rossi, "Perhaps, is not the light that creates the shadows

26
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,810
the same light that consumes matter, giving us

27
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,610
a more authentic image of that which artists themselves want to give us?"

28
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,750
It seems here that, for Rossi, art is beyond the natural.

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,410
Art is more authentic than nature itself.

30
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,330
But art has a destructive force.

31
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,240
This idea that the light that consumes matter.

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,910
And that destructive force gives it a way

33
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,990
of moving beyond nature, of superseding nature.

34
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,680
And then he says, "For this, more than because it's personal and collective

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,100
at once, architecture is the most important of sciences, for its cycle

36
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,910
is natural like the cycle of man,

37
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,715
but it is what remains of man."

38
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:44,260
Now this last sentence, "This is what remains of man" is highly ambiguous.

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,230
Think again of the cemetery, the city of the dead.

40
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:54,040
It's quite literally where the remains of human individuals have been placed,

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,430
but, at the same time, the architecture of the cemetery

42
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,870
diagrams human patterns of existence, human activities and human values,

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,850
and it also outlives humans.

44
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,940
Architecture is what remains of man.

45
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,290
Look at this drawing that Rossi made late in his career.

46
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,400
It's entitled in German and Italian: "Dieses ist lange her, Ora questo

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,480
Ã¨ perduto."

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,410
"This is long ago, and now this is past."

49
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,180
It gives you a sense, again, of architecture

50
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,060
not just continuing in time, but of architecture lingering

51
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,300
beyond its rightful passing.

52
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,570
Architecture remaining after it should have ended,

53
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,850
after its legitimacy and maybe even its need or its representational power

54
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,780
has ended.

55
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,590
But what's important about Rossi's project, I think,

56
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,300
is not that architecture has an end or architecture is coming to an end,

57
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,030
but that architecture has installed the kernel of history in its very core.

58
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,250
Architecture doesn't come to an end because architecture exist in time.

59
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,230
It unfolds in time.

60
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,970
Architecture is what remains of man.
