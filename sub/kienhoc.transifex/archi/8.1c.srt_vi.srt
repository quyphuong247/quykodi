ERIKA NAGINSKI: So what was this first ideal city of the Renaissance?
https://youtu.be/hd2l6zAZQGk
1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,320
Where does it come from?

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,110
Where does it appear?

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,640
It was invented by an architectural theorist-- he was also a sculptor-- by the name of Filarete.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,910
He wrote a treatise on architecture which was actually never published.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:35,280
It remains in manuscript form, but was hugely influential on his generation and the generations

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,000
that followed.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,199
What he invents here is a fictitious city, and what you're looking at, in fact, is a

8
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:49,270
page from that treatise describing the contours of his city.

9
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:55,350
It's an eight-pointed star-- there's the principle of eight, again-- enclosed in a circle.

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,530
The fact that we have an eight-pointed star makes clear that he's recuperating the Vitruvian

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:06,230
objection to the eight prevailing winds and the idea of the hygienic city which is counteracted

12
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,220
in this case by streets and canals which alternate-- he tells us in the text.

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,530
The circles in the drawing are defensive towers.

14
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:22,460
The context for this, or the context for the treatise here, is the fact that, at this moment

15
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,310
in the 1460s, Filarete was, actually, in the employ of the Duke of Milan-- a man by the

16
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:38,100
name of Francesco Sforza, therefore the name of the city: Sforzinda-- and the fiction here,

17
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,590
which is described in the treatise is that Filarete's patron, the Duke of Milan, has

18
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:51,329
asked him to design a city, to imagine a new city with a name that honors him.

19
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:59,130
So Sforzinda here is described in plan and described in terms of institutions, in terms

20
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,430
of materials that are necessary, and in terms of the general organization of the city.

21
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:10,580
What's curious about the treatise is that it doesn't proceed in terms of principles,

22
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,610
in terms of ideas, in terms of the orders, but rather it relays... it unfolds as a fiction,

23
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,840
much like More's own novel.

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:28,780
It relates that as the construction of the city port of this Sforzinda began a kind of

25
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,360
archaeological discovery was made: a golden book is unearthed, which described an ancient

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,400
mythical city.

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,140
This is what we call a kind of "mise-en-abÃ®me" or a kind of fictional ploy: a book in a book,

28
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:49,310
and this mythical city, of course, becomes, in turn, the model for the planning of Filarete's

29
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,690
Sforzinda.

30
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,430
What Filarete, essentially, was doing was emulating the ancients, inventing an ancient

31
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:03,630
authority with which to legitimate his own design, and this is where the key role of

32
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,090
illustration of the image emerges in a textual context.

33
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,520
In other words, again this exchange between words and images, or architectures relationship

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,290
to language and its own visual codes.

35
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:26,860
So the images here become a way to carry or illustrate the principles.

36
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:34,570
Here we see, clearly, the triumph of the kind of diagrammatic imagination that, ultimately,

37
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,320
Ledoux will carry forward in his city of Chaux.

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:46,760
Sforzinda is composed of a walled circle which encloses intersecting quadrangles at its center.

39
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,860
You'll see that in one of the illustrations it's actually hovering like an abstract shape

40
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,570
over this undulating landscape.

41
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:01,960
So it's clear that the plan, highly geometric, isn't actually integrated into the topography.

42
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,140
It then reappears as a second larger, more geometrically determined form, an abstract

43
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:15,490
diagram with a double circumference, and, finally, we come to the most authoritative

44
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,750
plate, the most detailed illustration, which is most like a city plan.

45
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,080
Here you have two squares, which create a star, and, if you look closely at the drawing,

46
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,129
you can see the pencil lines which will then be emphasized in ink.

47
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:36,229
The star is emphasized and enclosed in a circle.

48
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:39,900
Both the circle and the star are forcefully delineated.

49
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,370
The wall of the city is, in fact, that star shape, and it follows a pattern that touches

50
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,370
the circle, which is a moat.

51
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,169
The texts describe how canals and streets converge on the city center, but, actually,

52
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,660
this part is not made explicit in the plan.

53
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,080
Well, we do see, however, at the center of the star is the beginning of a city fabric.

54
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:11,139
So here a kind of multi-focal city planning is just beginning to show inside this abstract

55
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,139
diagram.

56
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:18,460
So think of this as a kind of encounter between ideal geometries and the beginnings of thinking

57
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,919
through how institutions will find their place in the city fabric.

58
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,169
It's worth mentioning here that Vitruvius was not the only source, however, for this

59
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,599
kind of abstraction or diagrammatic imagination.

60
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:40,599
the idea of enclosing the city in a circle is also interestingly based on the medieval

61
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:43,460
image of the world and the universe.

62
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:52,539
The ideal city here is automatically compared to the shape of the cosmos, and you have the

63
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,840
pretense of the architect alluding to the cosmos or having some kind of cosmological

64
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,680
intention for the design of his city.

65
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,650
Let's think a little bit more about the shape of Sforzinda and the kind of planning that

66
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,099
it's beginning to suggest.

67
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:17,759
We see the moat in the circle; we see the angular wall of the ramparts with their angular

68
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,660
circuit; we see one circular ring street and then the central core.

69
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,629
That central core is actually following the ancient Roman model of the public forum or

70
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:33,800
the public market, which is a central square and marks the kind of center of business,

71
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,569
judicial affairs, power, and also spiritual authority.

72
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:44,830
In the text, Filarete describes the kind of grandeur of this public space.

73
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:51,490
He describes colonnades, and that the fact that the main thoroughfares are going to lead

74
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,300
from that central space to the outlying city districts.

75
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,289
In other words, he's beginning to develop, for the first time, a kind of notion of ordered

76
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:03,159
and triumphant public space.

77
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,360
But if we focus in on the layout of the center, we'll see that he's, actually, incorporating

78
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
three squares.

79
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,919
There's the central one, which is a main piazza, and then just to the north and to the south

80
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,710
are smaller squares.

81
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:21,939
If you look at the organization, you'll see a Greek cross set in a square that is a sure

82
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:25,479
signal that this is where the church is-- a central plan church.

83
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,969
Opposite the church, on the other end, is the prince's palace.

84
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:36,610
On the southern end, we have a kind of activity of the market; we have a bank; we have merchants.

85
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,759
And to the north, we have judicial authorities.

86
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,770
So there's a very clear symbolic marking in this central square of the kinds of institutions

87
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:54,719
that make up a society: spiritual, political, economic, and judicial.

88
00:07:54,719 --> 00:08:01,180
This is the germinating idea of what will, ultimately, be called multi-focal urban planning

89
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,189
in the modern city.

90
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:13,369
This insertion of institutions in the fabric of the city is remarkable and to be noted.

91
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:21,439
Not only does Filarete's city include a palace, many churches, a hall of justice, and banks;

92
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,759
he, also, envisioned separate schools for boys and girls, which was very forward-looking.

93
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,849
He was also interested in the perfection of the citizenry, and says so in his text, which

94
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,690
is why he comes up with what you see here a "House of Vice and Virtue."

95
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:45,410
I want to point out, formally, that this drawing is strange; it is an attempt at perspective.

96
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,310
It's not in any way systematic or precise or mathematically determined, but instead

97
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,209
an approximation.

98
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:59,509
But what's so curious about it is the way it combines and confuses multiple visual conventions.

99
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:04,940
If you look at the ground floor, you see the line of plan traced out as a circle.

100
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,990
If you look at the side wings, you'll see that he's actually cut through the building

101
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,810
and is showing a section.

102
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,610
And then the bulge of the tower-- perspectival, not properly orthographic-- is, of course,

103
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,990
an attempt at perspectival elevation, in this case.

104
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:30,180
This building is defined by the ring of ten stories that is mounted on a base and, ultimately,

105
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,730
crowned by a statue of virtue-- again this emblematization of the importance of the morality

106
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,870
of the social body.

107
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,110
It functions on the principle of ascension.

108
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:47,170
As you climb up the stairs, you move from the world of the mundane to the world of the

109
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:54,110
intellect in the soul, and you'll find at the top, of course, an astronomical observatory,

110
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,320
as a way to emphasize that our path through life, inevitably, will lead from the physical

111
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,490
to the intellectual.
