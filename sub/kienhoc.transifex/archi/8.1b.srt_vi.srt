ERIKA NAGINSKI: So let's begin with the frontispiece
https://youtu.be/tYmAeEP87Dk
1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,420
to a book that remains profoundly important for architects--

2
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,000
in fact, all architects should read it--

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,380
and also important in terms of architecture's relationship to language

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,110
because, in fact, it defined the literary genre of the utopian novel.

5
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,680
I'm talking about Sir Thomas More's "Utopia."

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,080
More was a jurist,

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,730
and he also had a diplomatic career.

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,660
He became an envoy to Flanders.

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:49,770
And in 1516, he published in Latin a novel, simply called "Utopia."

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,390
It saw a second edition in 1518 and then began

11
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,670
to be translated, which is a testimony to its immense success

12
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,320
in the 16th century.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,260
What is crucial about this book, and what

14
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:10,580
I mean to say when I say that it defined the genre of utopian writing,

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,260
is its literary structure.

16
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,390
It is essentially a binary structure.

17
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,860
It is divided into two parts.

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,440
The first unfolds as a conversation, a conversation

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,390
which ultimately ends up as a critique of contemporary society

20
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,210
and of kingship as a model of governance, as a model for the state,

21
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,670
and as a principle, as a political principle.

22
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:42,370
The second part-- we encounter there a traveler,

23
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,750
a traveler who describes the island of Utopia that he's visited.

24
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,370
In other words, what is happening because of this binary structure

25
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,300
is the idea that a criticism of the real is

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,740
embedded in the imagining of an ideal, of a utopia.

27
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,900
So utopia is not simply a word that evokes a kind of social fiction

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,550
or a kind of delusion.

29
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,830
Instead, key to the idea of utopia, whether it's in a novel,

30
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,360
or whether it appears in architecture, as with Ledoux,

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,710
is that it always stems, always stems from a critique

32
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,660
of current social conditions.

33
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,760
Embedded in the principle of utopia is a critical intentionality.

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,130
We also want to add to this the fact that the word utopia, etymologically,

35
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,480
has two meanings.

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,790
It stems from the Greek.

37
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,940
And it can mean "no place" or "happy place," which

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,990
is a kind of fascinating collision, a collision underscoring

39
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,960
that utopia is necessarily unrealizable, but that it establishes conditions

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,600
of possibility, whether they are architectural

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:02,190
or whether they are in terms of social, legal, or political policy.

42
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,810
To look back at the woodcuts that functioned as a frontispiece

43
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,360
for the novel, we can see that it actually

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,750
responded to the literary trope that More was unfurling in the novel.

45
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,990
If you look at the title, you'll see that essentially it

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,590
is called the "Figure of the Island of Utopia,"

47
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,720
meaning that utopia here finds its figure in the island.

48
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,050
What does this mean?

49
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,320
It means that it is somewhere else.

50
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,160
It is only accessible by a ship.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,466
It is only part of, or the outcome of, a voyage of discovery.

52
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,340
If you also look more closely, though, you'll

53
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,420
see that the island slowly morphs into the figure of a skull.

54
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,030
In other words, it is a "memento mori."

55
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,210
It is the image of death in Arcadia, if you

56
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:57,360
will, a way to say that utopia has never happened and can never happen.

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,750
But we can dream of the possibilities it offers.

58
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,440
Now, in addition to this literary tradition,

59
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,590
or this relationship, as it were, to language,

60
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:17,899
we also have a very specific lineage that is more relevant, directly

61
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,760
relevant, to architecture-- in other words, a visual tradition.

62
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,290
We can go back to the classical world, in fact,

63
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,350
and look at the architectural treatise of Vitruvius,

64
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,710
where Vitruvius was a Roman architect and engineer from the first century BC.

65
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,490
And in his treatise, which is actually still today really

66
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,460
the most complete classical treatise we have on architecture,

67
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,420
we will find a section devoted to the ideal city, or to city planning,

68
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,010
as it were.

69
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,550
What's important for us is that this treatise was, as it were,

70
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,510
rediscovered during the Renaissance.

71
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,740
And the curious part of this is that the illustrations,

72
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,180
the original illustrations in the classical text, were lost.

73
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,850
So what Renaissance architects did, in fact,

74
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,280
was represent the ideas that they found in the text.

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,990
They drew from the language of the text to imagine in diagrammatic form,

76
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,900
in terms of visual representation, what the text was

77
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,280
saying about the ideal city.

78
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,380
So if we look at a 1511 edition, with illustrations

79
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,170
added in by the Renaissance author, we see here a Renaissance version

80
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,520
of Vitruvian ideas.

81
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,340
What's very clear from the text and the images that were inserted

82
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,780
is that Vitruvius seems to have put aside practical issues when

83
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,270
he dealt with town planning.

84
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,930
Instead, the diagram shows us an ideal form

85
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,860
enclosed by a protective wall like a kind of military fort--

86
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,200
think forward to Ledoux's ramparts--

87
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,920
with reinforced towers for strategic purposes.

88
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,290
This is a radial arrangement.

89
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,890
It's a radial arrangement that will affect the image of the city

90
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,150
throughout the Renaissance and be carried over into the Enlightenment.

91
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,290
It's also a very specific kind of radial arrangement.

92
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,000
It is essentially octagonal.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,560
It's based on the eight directions of the prevailing winds, which

94
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,340
are avoided, Vitruvius tells us, for hygienic purposes,

95
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,260
by eight streets that bisect them.

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,570
Here, in other words, the octagon, the notion of the eight-sided city,

97
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:41,420
emerges as an ideal geometry for the contour of the urban fabric--

98
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,960
which brings us really to this example, which

99
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,600
is the very first ideal city conceived in the Renaissance.

100
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,010
It's called Sforzinda, the town of Sforzinda.

101
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,750
What we have here is a plan that's not based on any actual surroundings,

102
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,440
any real surroundings, but rather made to obey those principles of harmony,

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:14,510
of regularity, and of enclosure, whose seeds were found in Vitruvius's text.

104
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,270
In other words, you could argue that this is not exactly

105
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,540
a utopia, but rather a formal pattern.

106
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,610
We can see Vitruvian principles being extended and imagined

107
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,800
in the Italian Renaissance with the military fortress of the ancients still

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,140
the dominant metaphor for urban planning.
