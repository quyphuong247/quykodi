K. MICHAEL HAYS: Another primary example of the architectural imagination

1
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,450
is the system of perspective.

2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,170
I want to tell the story of the invention of perspective

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,360
by the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,210
Brunelleschi was an architect in Florence.

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,150
He was actually trained first as a silversmith.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,260
And Brunelleschi noticed that when he stood in the doorway of the Florence

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,040
Cathedral and looked out at the Florence Baptistery, which was just

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,260
across the piazza, he noticed something about orthogonal lines--

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:46,030
that all orthogonal lines converge to a point in infinity.

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,430
Brunelleschi wanted to make his observation scientific.

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,940
Now, as a silversmith, Brunelleschi could

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,080
make a very highly polished silver surface

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,880
that would reflect like a mirror.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,610
Brunelleschi turned his back to the baptistery, put the mirror on an easel,

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,440
and if he fixed his vision--

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,860
if he made a kind of aperture that fixed his vision--

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,700
then he would be able to etch in the points

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,620
on the silver surface which were the corners of the baptistery.

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,630
And then he would be able to draw and etch on the surface the way

20
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,250
the orthogonal lines of the baptistery converged toward a single vanishing

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,090
point.

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,440
And then, he would finish and paint over the silver perspectival

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,840
image of the baptistery, so that when he held the image up

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,310
before the baptistery, he could match exactly the image to the actual thing

25
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,700
and see that it was a scientifically constructed linear perspective.

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,230
So perspective as a system brings together self and the world.

27
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,200
It brings them all together and organizes them

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,240
according to a single point of view.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,940
It's important that perspective anticipates

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,060
a modern rationalized conception of space,

31
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,140
but it's even more important that the viewing mind is productively

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,780
caught up in its own world.

33
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,060
It challenges the view of a separation of a preexisting stable world that's

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,040
separate from the viewing mind.

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
It brings those two together.
