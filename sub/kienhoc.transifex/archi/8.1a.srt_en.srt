00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,929
ERIKA NAGINSKI: One of the central themes of architectural history is the way in which architecture relates

2
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:36,680
to its own representation, whether this is through visual material; its conventions:

3
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,640
orthography, perspective; or whether it is through language.

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,690
I want to focus today on a period in the late 18th century, and on a group of architects

5
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,019
called the visionary architects.

6
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:54,829
Visionary, because not only did they rethink architecture's relationship to representation,

7
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:00,960
to words and to images, but also because they began to invent utopia.

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,640
We're going to look at the works of Ledoux, and, especially, of Étienne-Louis Boullée and

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,100
what eventually was called "architecture parlante," or "speaking architecture."

10
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,240
So I want to begin here with one of these visionary architects by the name of

11
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,240
Claude Nicolas Ledoux.

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,890
He is someone who is probably best known today for having built the first modern factory.

13
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:37,640
And this factory was conceived as a place to manufacture salt in the late 18th century.

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,270
And I want to start there because I want to make a point about one of the more curious

15
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,190
aspects of 18th-century architecture.

16
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:50,280
Today, when we think of the architectural process, an architect has an idea, they set

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,670
it down on paper, they will build a model.

18
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,000
They move through a sequence of highly conventionalized representations:

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,110
the plan, the section, the elevation.

20
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,840
Sometimes they will come up with images that are more perspectival, that evoke somehow

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,599
a real through the image.

22
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,480
And, lastly, if they're lucky, the building gets built.

23
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,690
One of the strange things about the late 18th century is that you'll see architects reverse

24
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,349
the process.

25
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:25,180
They will go through the commission.

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,060
They will build a building.

27
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,370
And from the real, they will imagine a fictional architecture.

28
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,640
So, for example, if we take the Saltworks, which today actually received the status of

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,200
a World Heritage Monument through UNESCO.

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,370
It exists.

31
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,370
It was built.

32
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,130
It functioned as a factory in the late 18th and into the 19th century.

33
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:53,370
But what Claude-Nicolas did is that he took that factory and he imagined an ideal city.

34
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,319
He imagined a utopia that he called the Ideal City of Chaux.

35
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,190
So I want to grapple with this idea in the late Enlightenment.

36
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:10,270
But I want to do so by going back in time and looking at a broad range of examples.

37
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,230
And in fact, the tradition of the ideal city.

38
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:22,810
So let's begin by looking at another book, a book that Ledoux published in 1804, towards

39
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,520
the end of his life, as a kind of opus to his own work.

40
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:34,020
He entitled it "Architecture Considered in Relation to the Arts, to Social Mores, and

41
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,400
to Legislation."

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,170
And, in this book, you will find a map and a perspectival view of the Ideal City of Chaux

43
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,709
that he extrapolated from his saltworks factory.

44
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,410
Now these are two different visual strategies.

45
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,760
A map is topographic.

46
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,550
The second is really a bird's eye perspective, as if we were flying over the town and seeing

47
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,240
it unfold into the countryside.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,670
But if we compare them, there are other differences that strike us.

49
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:13,130
So when you look at the map, what you see is a highly geometric configuration.

50
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,769
It's strongly felt in this cartographic setting.

51
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,650
And the theater of production-- of the production of salt-- is sitting right in the middle here

52
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,710
in a fully enclosed, heavily circumscribed oval.

53
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,000
It's as if the town were actually fortified.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,660
And in fact, it is.

55
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,870
The ramparts are indicated in the plan, and even in the legend.

56
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,220
We see that the saltworks are identified at the heart of it all.

57
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:46,610
We learn from the list on the right-- the insert here-- that a parish church appears

58
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,910
on the right.

59
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,460
To the left, there is a hall of justice.

60
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,020
The oval shape is so circumscribed that it actually casts a shadow on the landscape.

61
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:04,560
It's a highly paranoid configuration, as though to get into the city is an act of enclosure.

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,560
So, we have only two roads to get in and out of town.

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,449
And the sense that these roads are highly sort of a diagrammatic.

64
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,430
We have one road running north to south from the forest to the river.

65
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,370
And then another running east to west.

66
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,229
These are the only points of access into the city of Chaux.

67
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:33,110
However, if you look at the perspectival view, the "Vue perspective de la ville de Chaux,"

68
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,189
you're going to see an entirely different kind of experience.

69
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:41,259
Here, the topography unveils and reveals mountains in the background.

70
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,539
You'll see that there's a far more open sense.

71
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,029
The ramparts are, in fact, gone.

72
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:49,930
And kind of integration of the landscape with the town.

73
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,129
So the kind of stifling geometric character of the map is replaced by a far more open

74
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,699
feel.

75
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:03,800
The semicircle, just like the map, is sort of fully elaborated into its elliptical form.

76
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,599
But there's a far more seamless movement between the center-- the focal point, the saltworks--

77
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,250
and the farms that dot the countryside.

78
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,520
Now what's clear in the view and less clear in the map is that Ledoux is actually working

79
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,060
out a design for public space, for "res publica,"

80
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,580
and trying to depict a harmonious living environment.

81
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,970
So we see troops gathering onto the esplanade.

82
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,180
We see the factory smoke rising out of the chimneys to sort of indicate that production

83
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,620
is happening.

84
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:44,379
In a sense, activities unfold here and emphasize that life thrives as a result of this ideal

85
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,740
city.

86
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,550
And, as a result, also, of the proper exploitation of nature's resources.

87
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,369
So when we look here, it's the buildings that speak, not the legend.

88
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:01,999
You have two large public squares, semi-circular.

89
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:06,349
You see that there's a church to the west, a market to the east.

90
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:11,809
If you look to the north, you will see on the one hand, public baths and a stock exchange.

91
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:17,719
And if you look below the church, there is a structure with a kind of semicircular auditorium.

92
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,899
This is actually part of the university that he is imagining here.

93
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,169
It's an auditorium for a medical school.

94
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:29,780
The other thing that's clear as you move out to the countryside, is that he's mixing old

95
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:36,080
and new structures, kind of Neo-Palladian villas and old farms, old churches.

96
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:43,629
What's happening here is that the saltworks-- the real saltworks-- have generated a vision

97
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,169
of an ideal society.

98
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,180
It's a utopian gesture.

99
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:55,009
Representation comes after the built structure to generate a perfect social world.

100
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,089
And here, the geometry is what's capturing us.

101
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,889
All of its variations-- the semicircle, the oval, the ellipse-- all of this becomes a

102
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:10,300
kind of formal metaphor for the harmony of human existence with nature.

103
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,199
You can even evoke the elliptical course of the planets, or think about the economic metaphor

104
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,309
of the circle of production.

105
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,389
This is utopia in Ledoux's terms.

106
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:27,610
And so let's just wrap this up by quoting Ledoux himself, and understanding the reason

107
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,830
for which he looks at the circular model to generate society.

108
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,080
This is Ledoux.

109
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,090
"Everything is circular in nature;

110
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,750
The stone that falls into the water propagates infinite circles;

111
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,730
centripetal force is incessantly countered by a rotary motion;

112
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,940
the air and the seas move in perpetual circles...

113
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:00,500
so the town of Chaux is an immense circle with a form as pure as that described by the sun...

114
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,450
The line intersecting the diameter of the salt works crosses the Loue river, immense

115
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,370
plains, the town, the forest, the Geneva canal, the Swiss pastures;

116
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,370
to the left lie [the great rivers], the port of Antwerp, and the North Seas carry the first

117
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:24,990
and much desired fruits of our labor, commerce and arts, to the very deserts of Siberia."

118
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,930
It's an extraordinary quote.

119
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,459
And what I find most moving in this is the dream of the global reach of this tiny little

120
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:38,870
utopia in the countryside, which is generated by a saltworks factory.

121
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:45,269
And in this language is this insistence on geometric forms, on nature, and on the rewriting

122
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:46,870
of society.

123
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,660
So what I am going to do now is discuss the repercussions of all of this.

124
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,670
But also its sources.

125
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,899
So I want to think about the roots of Ledoux's imagined society by actually turning back

126
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:04,560
the clock quite a bit, going back to the Renaissance, where we see the visual tradition of utopia

127
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,699
emerging in geometric terms, and also in literature.

128
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:15,550
And then I'll sit on the drawings of one of Ledoux's great contemporaries, the visionary

129
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:23,730
architect Étienne-Louis Boullée, who is most often used to represent architecture's relationship

130
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,580
to language.

131
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,500
In other words, what we call, "architecture parlante," or "speaking architecture."
