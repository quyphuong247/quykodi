K. MICHAEL HAYS: Khoảng giữa thế kỉ 19, có một xu hướng mạnh trong việc ứng dụng 
https://youtu.be/-QDpnXyF9M4
1
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,390
sản xuất thiết kế nghệ thuật với các khu vực trong những khu công nghiệp lớn.

2
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,230
Một mặt, xu hướng này được thúc đẩy bởi sự ra đời của các loại vật liệu mới.

3
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,650
mặt khác, là do mong muốn hợp nhất khu liên hiệp các nhà máy

4
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,660
thành một khu vực, hoặc thậm chí là một khu đô thị

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,760
nhạy bén

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,830
Nó cũng được phát triển thành xu hướng bởi tầm quan trọng ngày càng tăng

7
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:49,699
của việc các công ti đã chi trả cho mong muốn có được hìn ảnh riêng cho công ti của mình.

8
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:53,750
Vì vậy kiến trúc ra đời khoảng cuối thế kỉ 19 

9
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:00,430
và phát triển mạnh vào thế kỉ 20 đã bắt đầu được sử dụng cho mục đích thương mại 

10
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,080
Phần lớn các nhà nghiên cứu đều đồng ý rằng các nhà máy tua-bin

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,350
Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft, hay công ti General Electric , ở Đức--

12
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,140
đều có trụ sở chính ở các khu đô thị nổi bật ở Berlin

13
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:22,110
đó là ví dụ cho việc kiến trúc thâm nhập vào .........

14
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,480
cũng như mong muốn sử dụng các vât liệu mớinhư thép và thủy tinh,

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,640
tuy nhiên nhấn mạnh rằng những vật liệu này được đưa vào

16
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,310
một loại biểu hiện nghệ thuật phù hợp với công ti đó

17
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,130
Năm 1907, Kiến trúc sư Peter Behrens được bổ nhiệm làm giám đốc nghệ thuật

18
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,250
chịu trách nhiệm việc sáng tạo toàn bộ hệ thống hình ảnh, hay các gói xây dựng thương hiệu

19
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,990
cho công ti quốc tế.

20
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,610
Ông thiết kế nhãn hiệu và chịu trách nhiệm về tất cả các ấn phẩm

21
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,100
cũng như việc thiết kế-- ít nhất là các kiểu dáng thẩm mỹ,

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,310
nếu không phải cac thiết kế kĩ thuât của các loại thiết bị gia dụng

23
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,970
như quạt, lò sưởi và đèn.

24
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:13,420
Ông cũng chịu trách nhiệm đối với tất cả các cơ sở bán lẻ và thậm chí là thiết kế các câu lạc bộ cho nhân viên,

25
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,879
cũng như các tòa nhà của nhà máy

26
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,560
Điều quan trọng là phải nhớ rằng các nhà máy ở thời điểm này

27
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,349
vẫn không được coi là kiến trúc loại "A". Các nhà máy bắt đầu 

28
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:35,239
sử dụng vật liệu mới từ thép và thủy tinh, đặc biệt là để mở rộng các khu vực

29
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,680
mà thiết bị có thể được sản xuất và lưu trữ, nhưng các nhà máy bằng kính và thép

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,189
bị cho là một loại hình xây dựng chiếu lệ

31
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:52,950
Trách nhiệm của Behren là đưa ra các loại hình xây dựng  như loại hình công nghiệp hay chức năng 

32
00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:00,280
vào trạng thái kiến trúc nghệ thuật.

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,200
Behrens hoàn toàn rõ về ước mơ nâng cao kiến trúc nhà máy lên trạng thái

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,849
of serious, profound architecture.

35
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,980
The architecture that he desired, he himself called industrial neoclassicism.

36
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:22,950
It's a kind of reduced, abstracted classicism that would be a new-- that would also be a

37
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,900
new German architecture.

38
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,840
This last point is important because it expresses a desire not only

39
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,000
to represent the economic status and economic importance of the company,

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,120
but it was also an understanding of the company's role

41
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,510
as a primary force in the creation of state identity,

42
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,209
and even in social change.

43
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,659
In order to conceptualize this representational role

44
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:55,340
that this new architecture would play, which would be on the one hand

45
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,329
representing the commercial power of these great corporations,

46
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,749
these energy-producing corporations, but also to even participate

47
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:07,519
in creating a larger national identity.

48
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,180
In order to accomplish that, Behrens needed the help of architecture theory.

49
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,980
The theory that he turned to first was his own version

50
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,170
of Hegel's theory, which we've seen earlier in the beginning of this course.

51
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:29,800
It has to do with the way architecture appears in history as a representation

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,140
of a sort of cultural ethos, and that representational role, or representational

53
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,220
vocation of architecture, has to move and change through

54
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,090
time as culture itself changes, or as history itself moves

55
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,090
forward.

56
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,030
For example, in Greek times we know that the temple

57
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,450
is the primary architectural paradigm.

58
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:59,620
The temple for Behrens was the exquisite representation of the ethos of democracy, of intellectual

59
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,800
life, in the polis-- in the Greek polis.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,790
Then we move into medieval times.

61
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,980
There it's the Christian church that is the dominant authority, that

62
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,690
is the dominant power, and the architecture is the cathedral.

63
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,990
The architectural paradigm is the cathedral that adequately represents that ethos.

64
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,090
With the secularization in the Renaissance, but also the move in power a little bit away

65
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,360
from the church and toward the aristocracy, then the palazzo

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,840
becomes the architectural type to represent that emerging and developing

67
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,150
aristocracy.

68
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,790
So, with this kind of Hegelian understanding of this teleological development of architecture

69
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,860
in relation to a social ethos, or a kind of cultural ethos,

70
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,660
he looked at his own time.

71
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:52,170
It was clear that in his work for the AEG, it was industrial capitalism which was the

72
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,170
new authority.

73
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,060
It was industrial capitalism that needed to assert itself

74
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,620
as I say both a power, a commercial power, but also even a cultural power in the creation

75
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,780
of a new kind of German identity.

76
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,460
What was then the architectural paradigm that would be adequate to this new ethos?

77
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,650
The factory.

78
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,190
Not just any factory, though.

79
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,360
The turbine factory.

80
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,490
The turbine factory which would house the construction, the manufacture,

81
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,940
of these giant steam turbines.

82
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:33,150
It was the biggest machine for producing electricity, for producing the power of Berlin, the power

83
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,880
of the whole of the country of Germany.

84
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,390
How do you represent that kind of production of power

85
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,460
adequately in a building?

86
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,340
For that he turned to another theorist.

87
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:55,100
The second theorist that Behrens turned to was the architect and historian Gottfried Semper.

88
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,470
He was a practicing architect, but also an architecture theorist

89
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,530
whose primary interest was in the very beginnings of architecture,

90
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,620
and how the beginnings of architecture could influence and help

91
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,650
structure and conceptualize architectural practice in the present.

92
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,980
To study those beginnings, he visited the Exhibition of 1851,

93
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,880
in London, housed by the Crystal Palace.

94
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:28,940
There, in one of the exhibitions, he saw a full-scale replica of a primitive hut

95
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,520
from the Caribbean islands.

96
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,560
And the sort of empirical fact of this primordial shelter

97
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,210
exhibited in what, at the time, was the most advanced building--

98
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,680
in the sense of new materials and industrialized production

99
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,990
of the architectural elements -- the contrast of the most advanced and the

100
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:57,389
most primitive sort of prompted Semper to turn to a kind of materialist

101
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:03,139
but also anthropological model of architecture's beginnings, and a

102
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:08,780
kind of model of how architecture could move from those

103
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,889
beginnings to the present.

104
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:16,530
The way he did this was to reduce the building down to four elements.

105
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,030
But each of those-- four sort of formal architectural elements.

106
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,590
But each of those elements would also have associated with it

107
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,330
a technique, a means of production.

108
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,710
A certain kind of material, but also a certain technical skill that

109
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,050
manipulates and forms that material.

110
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:41,370
The first element-- and he considered it first a social or cultural element--

111
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,130
which is fire, is the beginning, he thought, of society itself.

112
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:52,300
It's fire that provides both the formal centering device, but also the warmth,

113
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,090
the protection that the group can then gather around and form itself

114
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,180
as a tribe, as a group, as a community.

115
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,800
But the fire needs the help of architecture.

116
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,050
In order that the fire can be lifted up off the damp earth, lifted up

117
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,650
into the sort of vicinity of the group gathered around the fire,

118
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:19,440
another material in another form is required: something like a bowl, or a pot, or a hearth

119
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,590
that contains the fire.

120
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,190
And that container would, therefore, require the technique of ceramics.

121
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,310
Or perhaps later in history, it would require the techniques of metallurgy.

122
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,510
Now to hold that pot, that ceramic or metal pot, off the earth,

123
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,650
some kind of base is required.

124
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,880
And Semper theorized that the base would be made of masonry.

125
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,250
That the technique associated with the base that raises up

126
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,590
the hearth would be masonry.

127
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,880
Masonry has an inherent weight, a kind of inherent attachment to the earth,

128
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,950
because the bricks themselves are made out of the earth,

129
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,930
but they also bear on the earth with compressive forces.

130
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,660
Bricks are blocks that have to be put in a row and stacked,

131
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:12,089
and that cutting and stacking and the composition of solid, crystalline blocks is referred to

132
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,800
by the term stereotomy.

133
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,290
Stereotomy, in German, refers to the composition made of building up

134
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,310
with blocks, with chunks of materials.

135
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,850
It is almost naturally monumental.

136
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,980
It's almost naturally-- it also obviously deals with compression;

137
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,600
it deals with stacking; it's naturally related to the earth because of the weight of the blocks.

138
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,050
So stereotomy becomes a kind of automatic way

139
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,800
of producing monumentality.

140
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,570
But it's also associated with Semper with this idea of a base.

141
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,220
Now, in contrast to stereotomy, which is a kind

142
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:00,420
of-- also has a kind of inertness, also has a kind of idea of crystalline pieces-- opposed

143
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,560
to that is an architecture of an elastic frame.

144
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,500
Semper called this tectonics.

145
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,380
And this tectonic frame becomes the third element in this typology.

146
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,140
Semper deviated from the classical understanding of a trabeated system,

147
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,130
where the column and the entablature, or the column and the roof,

148
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,680
are two separate elements tied together at a joint.

149
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,930
He, rather, theorized a kind of tectonic assembly that would rise from this masonry base, where

150
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:37,690
the walls and the roof together made the tectonic system.

151
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:43,290
The other association or connotation of tectonic is that we're dealing with relatively small

152
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,630
elements that can operate not so much in a compressive way,

153
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,160
but that have tensile strength.

154
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,130
And these individual elements would be connected by a knot or a tying

155
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,190
together.

156
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,070
So this is what he called a tectonic system.

157
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,290
As the craft associated with stereotomy is masonry,

158
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,320
the craft associated with tectonics is carpentry.

159
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,460
So again, each part of the system has a technique associated with it.

160
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,071
Interestingly, too, it was in the knot, that the

161
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:20,570
joining together of two pieces of wood with a knot

162
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,450
that Semper saw the origin of architectural ornament.

163
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,170
The joint is the origin of ornament.

164
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:34,130
The final element in his system, the final typology,

165
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,220
is then the enclosing membrane that would wrap

166
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,630
this tectonic system of walls and roof.

167
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:51,520
Interestingly, again, Semper didn't imagine the enclosing membrane would be the same as

168
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,540
the stereotomic system of masonry.

169
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,279
Rather, he imagined that the enclosing membrane was a cloth or a tapestry

170
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,660
or some sort of woven material.

171
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:08,080
So the enclosing membrane, no matter how thick it was-- it could be thin and porous in some

172
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,750
climates, it could be thick and heavy and insulating

173
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,450
in other climates-- but in either case, that would be associated

174
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,470
with weaving.

175
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,240
The other interesting thing that Semper added to this

176
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,410
is that he knew that, as he had seen with the primitive hut in the Crystal

177
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,980
Palace, he knew that these architectural elements, formally,

178
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,471
would develop over time, but he also knew that, materially, they

179
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:33,360
would develop over time.

180
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,350
So what he theorized was, for example, if you

181
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:42,220
take the woven cladding, or the woven membrane, he knew that at some point that would become

182
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,900
made of brick.

183
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,610
But he imagined that the brick would carry some of the legacy of the weaving.

184
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,230
And maybe the way the mason would then use the brick in a more decorative way,

185
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,170
creating patterns, creating different textures, rather than just piling up in a straightforward

186
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,820
way, the legacy of the decorative surface of the carpet,

187
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,750
or the mat, or the cloth would continue into the masonry,

188
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,279
into the new material of masonry.

189
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:20,260
These four elements-- the fire, the base, the tectonic system that rests on the base,

190
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,550
and the cladding system or the membrane that then keeps out

191
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:32,850
the wind and the rain-- were Semper's four anthropological, materialist

192
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,980
types that are the very beginning of architecture.
