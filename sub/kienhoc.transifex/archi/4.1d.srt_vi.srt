K. MICHAEL HAYS: I've mentioned the persistence of types, what
https://youtu.be/KFhooDK6UDA
1
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,810
Rossi calls "typological permanence."

2
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,790
But there's another dimension, another sort of temporality to type

3
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,510
that we might call the "anteriority of type,"

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,020
for it's not the case in Rossi's thinking

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,550
that the type just continues-- that once it emerges, once it's manifest,

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,780
that the type simply continues.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,020
The type for Rossi is already there before the design effort,

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,140
before the actual construction, perhaps, even

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,340
before the architect's imagination of it--

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,100
that the type pre-exist the architectural act.

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,040
The best example of the anteriority of type

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,560
comes in Rossi's explanation of what he means by "the analogous city."

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,260
And to make this explanation, he asks us to look at a painting

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,370
by Canaletto of Venice.

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,930
If you look at this painting, you'll see a building to the left of the painting.

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,600
That's the corner of the Chiericati Palace of Andrea Palladio.

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,850
If you look in the very center of the painting,

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,700
is a project that Palladio made for the Rialto Bridge of Venice,

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,620
but never actually executed.

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,430
The Chiericati Palace is not in Venice;

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,430
it's in Vicenza, as is the very large building on the right, which

22
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,380
is Palladio's Basilica.

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,870
Now, these projects are important.

24
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,180
They have, already, various associations.

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,550
The Basilica, for example, was really just a kind of large classical wrapper

26
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,400
around an existing medieval building.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,810
What Palladio did in the Basilica was sort of bring classicism

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,540
into an urban-- it's urban form, it's modern urban form.

29
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,200
And in the Chiericati Palace--

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,150
which is simply, in a way, a house--

31
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,180
he also used the classical language in the same way

32
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,360
to give the house a certain status, and all of these things

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,610
would have been important to Rossi.

34
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,910
I'll read Rossi's passage on this painting.

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,700
"To illustrate the concept of analogous city,

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,640
I give the example of Canaletto's fantasy view of Venice:

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,400
a Capriccio in which Palladio's projects for the Ponte di Rialto,

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,230
the Basilica of Venice, and the Palazzo Chiericati are set next to each other

39
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,000
and described as if the painter were rendering an urban scene

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,820
he had actually observed.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,260
These three Palladian monuments, none of which are actually in Venice

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,960
and one of which is a project, nevertheless

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,470
constitute an analogous Venice--

44
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,710
formed of specific elements, associated it

45
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,730
with the history of both architecture and the city.

46
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,720
The geographical transposition of the monuments within the painting

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,010
constitutes a city that we recognize even

48
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,380
though it is a place of purely architectural references.

49
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,900
This example enabled me to demonstrate how a logical-formal operation could

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,670
be translated into (both) a design method and then

51
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,570
into a hypothesis for a theory of architectural design

52
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,490
in which the elements were preestablished and formally defined,

53
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,990
but where the significance that sprung forth at the end of the operation

54
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:34,460
was the authentic, unforeseen, and original meaning of the work."

55
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,050
There's an epistemological claim made in this passage, the claim

56
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,360
that architecture produces knowledge.

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,990
The type, though it's pre-theoretical and pre-conceptual,

58
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,240
nevertheless gives the form of social experience and collective

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,090
understanding.

60
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,450
The type sort of schematizes aesthetic experience, sensual

61
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,770
encounters, in such a way that it can be scanned

62
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,770
by the collective human understanding.

63
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,230
A city, of course, is a social and material object in its own right.

64
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,390
It's the most concrete of realities that architecture deals with.

65
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:20,170
But for Rossi, the city is also an invisible, abstract, virtual reality.

66
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,720
Every act of architecture can only come from the city, and every act

67
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,080
of architecture returns to the city.

68
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,290
We can imagine Rossi looking at this painting by Canaletto

69
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,280
and saying, "That is architecture"-- just as Loos looked at the mound

70
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,200
and said, "That is architecture."

71
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,150
But where is the "that"?

72
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,326
It seems that, for Rossi, architecture resides in a virtuality.

73
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:49,000
It's this virtuality that he calls the "analogous city."

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,260
So Rossi is making not only an epistemological claim--

75
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,380
that type produces social, experiential knowledge--

76
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,320
he's also making an ontological claim:

77
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,490
Architecture exists.

78
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:10,990
It exists as a virtuality that is manifest in the form of type.

79
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,550
You can imagine the ontological existing on a kind of vertical plane and history

80
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,240
unfolding through time, and it's at the intersection

81
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,320
of the ontological plane that this field of potential, this field of possibility

82
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,930
as it intersects historical time, we get the actualization of architecture

83
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,760
at that intersection.

84
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,750
But the ontological is folded into history from the start.
