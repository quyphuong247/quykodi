K. MICHAEL HAYS: The historian Sigfried Giedion emphasizes the difficulties

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,190
in coming to terms with the new architectural potentialities

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,910
of new materials and construction technologies

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,860
in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,020
The Crystal Palace produces, perhaps, almost unintentional

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,950
architectural effects out of this new technology.

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:33,950
Next, we'll pursue examples of the refinement of the aesthetic intention

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,510
and the very willful expression of the representational power

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,490
of the new architecture of metal and glass.
