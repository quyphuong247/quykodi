ERIKA NAGINSKI: Wittkower's first case study
https://youtu.be/8rZLI_9XWJ0
1
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,910
is what you see here. It's a small church in the city of Rimini

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,660
Italy on the Adriatic Coast. It was originally

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,710
a 13th century Gothic structure, so belonged to an entirely

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,200
different stylistic and cultural moment. The structure named

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,140
San Francesco, in other words, St. Francis, was run by the Franciscan Order,

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,200
and, since the 19th century, it's been known

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,920
as the Tempio Malatestiano, after the man you also see, Sigismondo Malatesta.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,150
He was an extraordinary character.

9
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,640
This is a portrait by Piero della Francesca from about 1451.

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,640
Malatesta was a Renaissance nobleman who became Lord Rimini at the age of 14,

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,550
and became its sole ruler after abolishing

12
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,990
the authority of his brothers.

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,790
He was a notorious despot, and politically savvy vis-Ã -vis much more

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,680
powerful city-states.

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,560
And this earned him actually a temporary spot

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,430
as commander in chief of the nothing less than the papal armies.

17
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,130
Eventually, the Vatican was going to turn against him,

18
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,660
going so far as to condemn him to Hell for the rest of his lifetime.

19
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,360
This was obviously not commissioned at this moment.

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,470
The church was essentially a reconstruction

21
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,110
of the original structure, and it dates from about the time of Piero's portrait

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,120
from about 1450.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,600
The archival evidence is scanty, which in many ways

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,240
makes this a perfect case study for Wittkower who's

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,970
less interested in those historical documents.

26
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,540
It's not clear, for example, when Alberti came on board,

27
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,100
nor what requirements there were for the design, what

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,360
they were meant to be like.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,390
Was a dome part of the equation?

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,600
Or how the relationship played out between Alberti

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:10,039
as designer and his forceful patron, along with the builder in question,

32
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,680
Matteo de' Pasti.

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,420
What we do know is that in addition to making detailed drawings,

34
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,820
Alberti had a wooden model made--

35
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,530
this is lost today--

36
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,750
and a good part of the facade was up by 1454,

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,700
so work progressed rather quickly.

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,520
It's important to underscore that this was Alberti's very

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,910
first ecclesiastical commission. The patron's aim was

40
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:44,600
to turn the Church of St. Francis into a mausoleum for himself and his wife.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,220
So it had a kind of personal commemorative function.

42
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,660
It's an unfinished project.

43
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,390
You can see this by the picture of the facade.

44
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,349
There was perhaps a projected dome, which was supposed to be hemispherical,

45
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,140
and it's a shape that was meant, therefore,

46
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,420
to mimic the Pantheon in Rome and, therefore,

47
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,660
allude to the classical past in a very grandiose way.

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,580
That dome was never built, and Alberti's facade was never finished.

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,970
This is, in large part, because of the question of the patron.

50
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,800
The patron's fortunes went awry.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,395
He was actually excommunicated in 1460, so a mere six years after the facade

52
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:25,880
was, for the most part, erected, and he died in 1468.

53
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,790
Now, if you look at the facade, you'll see

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,540
that to either side of the entrance, there are two blind arcades.

55
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,640
We know that these were originally meant to house a sarcophagus for Malatesta

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,530
as well as another one for his wife, although there

57
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,170
is some disagreement about this.

58
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,440
But the idea adds consistency to the explanation

59
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,710
offered by Wittkower of a united whole, of a united

60
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,470
monumental and commemorative purpose for the whole.

61
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,320
What's interesting here is to do what Wittkower didn't

62
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,900
do, to think about the context of this.

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,960
For example, the pope at the time thought

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,110
this was a blasphemous structure, a blasphemous idea.

65
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,020
He decided that to plaster a classical facade on this church,

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,310
to turn it into an evocation of the Pantheon

67
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,430
was actually turning the church into something that was quote,

68
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,810
and this is the pope himself, "Full of pagan gods and profane things.

69
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,410
So full of pagan images that it seems like a temple

70
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,840
for the worshippers of demons."

71
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,900
This is obviously a conflicted commission.

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,810
Again, Wittkower's not interested in these issues.

73
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,710
What he sees in the Tempio is the first in a sequence

74
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,310
of four churches in which Alberti is carrying out

75
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:43,090
a systematic investigation of the fusion of classical system,

76
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,970
or classical principles in Christian buildings.

77
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,380
The building poses a problem, and he offers

78
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,200
a certain kind of answer or solution.

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,150
So problem one:

80
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,960
The Tempio, or how to impose a classical aspect

81
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,610
onto or over a preexisting medieval structure.

82
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,820
How do you do that?

83
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,710
Alberti's answer is to introduce to the facade

84
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,630
a variation on the Roman triumphal arch while reconsidering

85
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,830
the entire envelope of the building as an antique temple--

86
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,050
almost putting a classical box around the whole structure.

87
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,850
This is the first isolated church facade to do this in the Renaissance,

88
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,360
and this is why it's such an important example.

89
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,560
It started a trend, in other words.

90
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,410
And in Wittkower's words, Alberti was grafting the idea of the triumphal arch

91
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,610
right up onto the wall.

92
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,060
So given the patron's demands, this actually makes sense.

93
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,140
It's a clever response.

94
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,540
The idea of the triumph over death,

95
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,470
and you have a triple arch motif on the facade, with the central arch

96
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,640
over the door, and side arches for the sarcophagi.

97
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,270
You get a sense of what this Pantheon effect would have been like when

98
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,730
you look at the side of the church.

99
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,640
Both sides offered a deep arcade.

100
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,200
Think back to the Coliseum

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,980
here.

102
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,420
This deep arcade was based on a pillar and arch construction.

103
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,470
You have pillars and you have arches springing from them.

104
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,070
This is actually a form of construction that

105
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,660
stems from ancient Roman aqueducts.

106
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,370
Now, Malatesta planned to have the sarcophagi of this sort of illustrious men--

107
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,820
the poets, the artists, the scholars of his court--

108
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:37,560
inserted into the deep recesses offered by the arches.

109
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,310
Now, if you look at the plan, you'll notice that the original church,

110
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,880
conveniently, has a rectangular format.

111
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,470
It's a medieval church with a single nave and no side aisles,

112
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,130
extending into a large, semicircular apse.

113
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,880
Now, part of Alberti's plan was to transform

114
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,940
this basically simple and straight rectangle

115
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:05,490
by means of a large rotunda that would support a massive dome at the crossing.

116
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,900
The nave was meant to be covered over by a barrel vault made

117
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,904
of timber, and over this, a pitched roof over the side chapels and the nave.

118
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:17,820
One of the things you'll notice about the plan

119
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,080
is that the windows are actually unevenly distributed at the sides,

120
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,930
and Alberti screens this asymmetry, if you will, with the Roman arches

121
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,080
held up by piers, and the whole, as it were,

122
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,400
is elevated on a kind of antique-style podium.

123
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,480
He's, in other words, putting his own theory into practice.

124
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,130
If we turn to Alberti's own theoretical treatise in his Book

125
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,660
7 on Sacred Buildings, he writes, quote, "In my opinion,

126
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,890
the space taken up by the portico and indeed the whole temple

127
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,370
should be raised above the level of the city.

128
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,040
This will give it a greater air of dignity."

129
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,450
This idea of elevating the church and placing it on a podium, of making it

130
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,070
function as the sacred center of an urban context.

131
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,690
You see the podium effect here.

132
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,940
What remains of Alberti's design is most visible actually on the outside

133
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,010
rather than on the interior.

134
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,650
And you also can gather the repercussions

135
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:25,680
of what it means to impose a triumphal arch idea on a church facade.

136
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,480
The other important aspect of all of this

137
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,300
is that his classical source was local.

138
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,170
It's what you see:

139
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,860
The arch of the Roman emperor, Augustus.

140
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,760
What Alberti is doing here is that he's playing with classical motifs.

141
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,470
He's not copying them verbatim.

142
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,770
He keeps the roundels of the arch--

143
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,160
he transposes them onto the facade--

144
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,580
as well as the relation of the arch, the fluted

145
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,950
engaged columns, and the spandrel.

146
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,940
The spandrel is actually the space between a curved element

147
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,160
and a rectangular boundary.

148
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,290
And then he places a triangular pediment over the door, inside

149
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,750
of the arch on the facade rather than above it, as you see in the actual arch.

150
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,280
The capitals are in the spirit of anticomenia and in the playfulness

151
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,250
that we see with Wittkower, completely his invention.

152
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,030
Now for Wittkower, Alberti's approach to architecture

153
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,440
is to create a series of problems to solve.

154
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,160
The first challenge is that a triumphal arch is essentially

155
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,620
a one-story structure.

156
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,600
But when a church facade has to screen a very high central nave

157
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,300
between the chapels or lower aisles to either side,

158
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,780
the screen needs to be a two-story structure.

159
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,650
So how do you transform a triumphal arch,

160
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,240
which is a one-story structure, into a two-story structure

161
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,630
to mask the entirety of the church?

162
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:03,420
You're faced, as an architect, with the problem of extending a one-story system

163
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,850
to a two-story system.

164
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,950
There were Venetian precedents for this.

165
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,350
They were Byzantine and Gothic, such as Saint Mark's in Venice or the Frari.

166
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,220
So when Alberti tries to plaster a classical system on this,

167
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,010
what Wittkower does is to engage in a kind of game

168
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,270
to reconstruct what Alberti's intentions were.

169
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,360
He surmises the elements of the facade and the composition

170
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,810
of the facade that were never completed but must,

171
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,240
if you follow Wittkower's logic, have aimed

172
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,150
for unity in its classical scheme.

173
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,670
There's a key piece of evidence in the story.

174
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,480
It's a medal by a sculptor and medalist Matteo de' Pasti,

175
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,390
who collaborated with Alberti on the design

176
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,460
and the construction of the church.

177
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,030
That medal shows a huge hemispherical dome,

178
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:56,940
low curved walls placed above a heavily articulated entablature over the side

179
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,720
bays.

180
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,100
What the medal reveals is a fully elaborated second-story

181
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,240
arch over the central bay, above the entrance,

182
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,310
and it's clearly articulated as a small shrine, what we call an aedicula,

183
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,110
with a window divided into three parts sitting in the niche,

184
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,290
and the whole is crowned by a floral motif.

185
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,640
We see the legacy of this idea in Venice

186
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,610
in a monastery church of San Michele in Isola.

187
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:32,310
The evidence is that, in 1454, Alberti actually changed his mind

188
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,490
and switched the curved walls of the upper part

189
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,380
for straight sloping walls, decorated with large scrolls.

190
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,160
Still, ultimately, Alberti's scheme reveals

191
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,790
a classically derived system on the lower story,

192
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,010
and essentially a kind of medieval concept

193
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,040
above, despite the classical details.

194
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,280
By classicism, it's important to underscore

195
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,240
that I don't mean some generic notion of the classic,

196
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,230
but that we're referring very specifically to the Greco-Roman past

197
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,270
of Western civilization.

198
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,210
Now, for Italian Renaissance architects, this really

199
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,240
meant ancient Rome, not Greece.

200
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,610
Italian architects did not go to Ancient Greece.

201
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,220
They did not see the Acropolis firsthand,

202
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,200
but what they had around them, surrounding them in Florence, in Rome,

203
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,970
were the remnants of Republican and Imperial Rome:

204
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,040
the Pantheon, the Coliseum.

205
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
Problem number two:

206
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,410
How the entablature at the point at which it projects above each column

207
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:45,340
confounds the attempt to coordinate the lower story with the upper story.

208
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,700
And this is where the work of the diagram comes in.

209
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:54,190
When Wittkower has demonstrated in his schematization of the facade

210
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,520
is an attempt to resolve the contradiction of the lower

211
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,960
story with the upper story.

212
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,130
On the one hand, the composition as a whole

213
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,220
is rigorously faithful to Alberti's theory of architecture.

214
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,870
Remember that for him, columns were decorative,

215
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,230
and here, the columns remain, in principle,

216
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,940
the decoration of the facade, following his sense that the column needed

217
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,640
to be ornamental and not structural.

218
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,720
This is Alberti.

219
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,230
Quote: "The principal ornament in all architecture

220
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,810
certainly lies in the column."

221
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,480
While on the side of the building, as we saw,

222
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,920
the wall is aligned with a pillar arch construction.

223
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,640
He derives the design of the sides from the facade,

224
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,700
but strips the sides of the columns.

225
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,470
That's one side of the story.

226
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,280
On the other hand, there's what Wittkower is showing with his diagram,

227
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,010
with his lines, which actually have different weight if you look at them.

228
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,040
What his diagram foregrounds is actually a series

229
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,220
of disrupted rhythms, which come from his assessment

230
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,860
of the visual essence of the element.

231
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,800
The entablatures should, by a logic, create a horizontal barrier

232
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,950
between the lower register and above.

233
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,030
The interesting thing is that you also expect a vertical continuation,

234
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,480
and that's what you see in the central bay with the entrance

235
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,240
and that niche, or aedicula, above it.

236
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,600
This part accentuates the verticality of the building,

237
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,810
not the horizontality of the building.

238
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:35,590
What happens here is that fundamentally, we are left with a contradiction.

239
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,130
While the central vertical thrust remains apparent,

240
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,800
it is challenged, according to Wittkower,

241
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,670
by the high base, that podium on which all of the columns rest,

242
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,580
as well as the side bays, which emphasize

243
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,390
a horizontal aspect to the facade.

244
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,850
You can see him drawing the lines in bold

245
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,750
to emphasize this contradictory state to prove his point.

246
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,630
The result, for Wittkower, is that the outer bays

247
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,520
are closed off by the common base that links them, but left open at the top.

248
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,780
There's nothing above them.

249
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,060
There's nothing that closes them off.

250
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,580
And according to Wittkower, exactly the opposite happens in the central bay--

251
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,530
where there is no podium linking the two central columns, but their verticality

252
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,940
is emphasized.

253
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,510
Ultimately for Wittkower, these complicated rhythms

254
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:31,690
of the Tempio's facade leave its quote unquote "unity" completely unresolved.

255
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,890
And this is the point of the diagram, to show us, in the most distilled

256
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:41,650
way possible, that Alberti's daring, imaginative, but ultimately

257
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,890
failed project, was an attempt to resolve two incompatible systems.

258
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,030
What does it mean to put a classical envelope on a medieval structure?

259
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:58,210
What does it mean to impose a one-story logic taken from the Roman triumphal

260
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:03,790
arch, and impose it on a structure that required a two-story solution?

261
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,580
Ultimately, the diagram demonstrates Alberti's attempt

262
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,050
to capture an ideal formula.
