K. MICHAEL HAYS: When you're walking through the city of Berlin,

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,750
you're almost in it before you know it.

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,510


6
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,310
The blocks at the edges of the site are very, very low, almost like benches,

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,160
almost like park benches.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,000
But very, very quickly, this undulating ground descends,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,940
and the height of the blocks begins to change and come up very quickly.

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,540
At first, the project identifies itself with the city.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,200
There's something about the gridded blocks that are kind of echoed

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,960
in some of those surrounding facades.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,700
The abstraction of the blocks also creates a contrast with the greenery,

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,980
with the trees and plants of the Tiergarten.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,530
At first, the project identifies itself with the city.

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,640
But then, when you get into the project, you begin to lose the horizon.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,640
The last trees of the Tiergarten start to be

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,000
submerged below the horizon or the blocks raise up to cover the horizon.

20
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:27,250


21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,260
Very quickly, you lose the sense of a grid, and the sense of a labyrinth

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,220
starts to take over, and you lose orientation.

24
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:39,320


25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,900
Because there is no marked entry, there are

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,940
many places you can enter the project.

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,190
There's also no clear exit.

28
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,320
And very, very quickly, you feel like you're

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,508
in an enclosed world with no exit.

00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:57,990


32
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,560
In May 2005, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,250
opened in Berlin Mitte, which is the centermost borough

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,760
of the city of Berlin.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,050
The project was designed by the American architect Peter Eisenman.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,470
In some ways, it's a fairly simple project to describe.

37
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,870
It comprises almost 3,000 stelae, which are these concrete pillars

38
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,820
or blocks, arrayed across a site of undulating ground,

39
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,930
on a site that's almost the size of three football fields.

40
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:36,710
In other ways, it's a very difficult, both conceptually and materially,

41
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,260
a very difficult project to describe.

42
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,090
It took almost 17 years to complete, not only because of construction issues,

43
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,930
but because of debates surrounding the project, which we'll talk about later.

44
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,810
The memorial is dedicated to the Jewish victims

45
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,090
of Nazi genocide in World War II.

46
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,100


47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,460
We haven't seen a project quite like this in this course.

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,150
For one thing, it's the first 21st-century project that we've seen.

49
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,330
But second, the project really doesn't have a program,

50
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,400
like a factory or a church.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,920
It doesn't have to provide or house the function of worship,

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,730
as it would a church, or the function of work, as it would in a factory.

53
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,310
The project is an architectural memorial.

54
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,210
But what it memorializes is not the life of a single person,

55
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,080
like some great leader or humanitarian, and it's not really

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,260
even the lives of a people, notwithstanding

57
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,560
that it is a memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe.

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,260
What the program actually calls for is to induce memory of a structural

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,090
condition of society, of an event in history that should not be forgotten,

60
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,850
that cannot be forgotten, because of the horror of the event itself.

61
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,100
I'll try to show how the project constructs

62
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,410
what I'll be calling critical memory--

63
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:03,370
a kind of memory that is reflective, is contemplative.

64
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,300
And critical memory will be one of the themes of this presentation.

65
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,380
The second theme is the abstraction of the architecture

66
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,880
as a response to the need for critical memory, or abstraction as a way

67
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,399
of producing critical memory.

68
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,660
Scholars who have documented and chronicled the two-stage competition

69
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,230
process by which Peter Eisenman received the commission

70
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,880
have noted, again and again, that Eisenman was the most abstract

71
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,670
of the 19 entries to the competition.

72
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,950
And we'll want to ask why abstraction was the sort of mode of architecture

73
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:46,450
that was chosen to produce this work or invite this work of critical memory.

74
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,819
