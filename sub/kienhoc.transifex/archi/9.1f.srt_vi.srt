00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,760
K. MICHAEL HAYS: We can Baudrillard's analysis as helpful.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,100
But I don't think we have to completely accept his cynicism.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,140
Baudrillard finds the center duplicitous in a way,

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,180
because it invites us to come to an experience of art

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,750
or an experience of culture that no longer exists.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,450
But his idea of art and culture is actually not

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,230
so different, it seems to me, than the conservative one expressed

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,080
at the Whitney.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,820
Baudrillard expects art to be different from everyday life.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,770
He expects, like Breuer, that art have a sincerity and a profundity

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,330
that he thinks is no longer possible in the third order of the simulacra.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,040
But this is the depth model of art that it seems to me has been displaced.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,870
What happens at the Centre Pompidou is more of a horizontal model of art.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,970
It's where the center gathers up sites from different parts of the city,

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,520
makes those connection.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,010
It's where it gathers up different kinds of events and activities

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,130
and brings them together on a horizontal plane

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,400
or expresses them in the surface of the facade.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,730
The Place Bauberg is a counter-site.

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,160
It's a site of difference and alterity, where

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,780
an enormous amount of cultural power and energy is generated,

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,050
as if on a horizontal plane or as if on a surface

23
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,200
of networks of information and flow.

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,010
It's a place where different sites in the city, different spaces in the city

25
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,800
can be brought together, can be connected, can be examined, contested

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,348
but also represented.

27
00:01:42,348 --> 00:01:42,848
