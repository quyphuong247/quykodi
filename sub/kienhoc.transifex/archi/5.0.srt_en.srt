K. MICHAEL HAYS: In our first set of modules, we

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,220
discussed some of the primary examples of what

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,300
we might think of as the techniques of the architectural imagination.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,090
We discussed typology, which allows comparison of deep, formal structures

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,860
of architectural projects.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,590
We talked about the system of perspective--

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,770
again, understood as a formal construction

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,950
that links subject to object.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,710
And we saw how these formal constructs can

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,500
be used both by the historian as analytical tools and by the designer

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,370
as ways of rationalizing architectural decisions.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,970
Then we discussed how these formal constructs must always

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,440
be understood as arising in history, as carrying

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,030
values and ways of understanding that arise in history,

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,050
but they're not exhausted by those historical origins.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,319
Architecture is deeply historical, but it also exceeds its formative origins.

17
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,860
It produces memories, but it also produces possible futures.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,540
So we have architecture as an aesthetic construct,

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,310
and we have architecture as being deeply implicated in history.

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,910
In the next three modules, we'll focus on how architecture has

21
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,450
a fundamental relation to materiality.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,180
We'll look at how it uses the technical advance of materials for construction--

23
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,890
mainly iron, steel, and glass, but also reinforced concrete--

24
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,940
and we'll look at the modern development of industrial building components

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,330
and how architecture uses that to advance

26
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,340
its own expressive possibilities.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,990
We'll discuss how technology gets mediated

28
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:56,600
by the compositional and typological intentions and operations

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,800
of the architectural imagination.
