K. MICHAEL HAYS: One can almost say that the choreographed movement through space
https://youtu.be/a_YYPZE4BSE
1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,300
punctuated by moments of pause, this itinerary of rotation and frontality

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,100
that we've been discussing, itself constitutes

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,690
another point of the new architecture.

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,340
Le Corbusier will later give this principle a name.

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,490
He calls it the "architectural promenade."

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,540
"You enter:

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,590
the architectural spectacle at once offers itself to the eye:

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,350
you follow an itinerary and the perspectives

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,640
develop with great variety; developing a play of light on the walls

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,300
or making pools of shadow.

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,420
Large windows open up views of the exterior

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,620
where the architectural unity is re-asserted."

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:00,080
"Here, reborn for our modern eye, are historic architectural discoveries:

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,105
the pilotis, the long windows, the roof garden, the glass facade."

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,140
Le Corbusier is describing the Villa Savoye at Poissy.

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,370
While at the Villa La Roche, the spatial articulations of the interior

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,090
were conceived in relation to an exterior that was still

18
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,560
itself plastic, and still could move around and be varied.

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,080
Now at the Villa Savoye the villa has become

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,065
a total object, through which the will of the epoch could be affirmed.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,760
The signs of Purist composition that we saw in the prospects of frontality

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,660
at La Roche, and through the kind of energetic swirling at Garches, here

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,080
take on a more material consistency.

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,640
At the same time, the prismatic envelope of Garches

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,340
is re-asserted to contain the equally variability of surfaces at La Roche.

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,490
The architectural solutions of this elementary ribbon window,

27
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:13,760
of the enclosed terrace, become a kind of insistence of this total object.

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,770
And at the same time, while we have this kind

29
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,650
of functional minimalism of the interior,

30
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,740
almost like railway sleeping cars, like ship cabins, like airplane cockpits.

31
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,250
At the same time, there is an architectural solution

32
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,290
that shows its real concern to be the relation of people

33
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,020
to these new conditions.

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,510
The Villa Savoye is the epitome of the functional stratification

35
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,620
of the section.

36
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,150
Of raising the pilotis, freeing the ground plane for movement,

37
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,840
for transportation, for recreation, for vegetation.

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,190
The house above is completely ordered and controlled,

39
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,830
while the earth below is free and available for collective occupation,

40
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,500
for collective use.

41
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,750
And now for the first time at the Villa Savoye

42
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,330
is a coupling of objet-type, of which the Villa Savoye is only one.

43
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,750
For example, the automobile, itself a paradigm of the objet-type,

44
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,470
now comes into the site, and moves under the building through the pilotis

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,660
to interact spatially and functionally with the house itself.

46
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,980
At the lower level, that the entrance level, the curved surface

47
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,200
of the industrialized glass which defines the volume of the entry hall

48
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,230
is itself determined by the curving radius,

49
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,220
the turning radius of the automobile.

50
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,490
Here, two object types come together and interact.

51
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,620
As you penetrate that glass wall and enter the entry hall,

52
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,720
you see first on the one side a ramp that leads you up to the piano nobile,

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,520
up to the main floor.

54
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,530
Adjacent to the ramp is a sink, assembled together

55
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,180
with one of the pilotis, a very large industrial ramp,

56
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,970
and a table attached to the piloti.

57
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,640
There's a kind of assemblage of objet-type.

58
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,060
The sink itself is a mass-produced, highly refined, functional vessel

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,230
for cleansing that stands as almost like it's

60
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,470
one of the objet-type of his Purist paintings.

61
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,220
And the sink is juxtaposed, like in an assemblage,

62
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,060
with this industrial lamp, which, at first, seems out of scale.

63
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,400
It doesn't seem domestic at first.

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,170
But it kind of gets domesticated in its assemblage by its interaction

65
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,990
with the small table, with the piloti, and with the sink.

66
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,120
But the combination of sink and ramp, as unusual as that is,

67
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,020
it's not just two industrial types coming together.

68
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,010
The place that you find the combination of sink and ramp

69
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,330
is at the entry to a religious building, like a mosque, or a synagogue,

70
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,070
or a church, where you first cleanse yourself and then enter, slowly,

71
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,310
and ascend to a sacred space.

72
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,790
The juxtaposition of these various object types

73
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,910
creates a kind of metonymic relationship,

74
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,750
or an assemblage, that makes connectivities

75
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:30,490
that extend the domain of the house itself out into the industrial world.

76
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,300
The "architectural promenade" begins at the moment of stasis

77
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,870
where the sink and the ramp have come together at the entry.

78
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,120
Remember the name architectural promenade

79
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,120
is the name Le Corbusier gave to this itinerary of movement, rotation,

80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,150
and frontality through a building.

81
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,440
In the case of the Savoye, the ramp becomes the instrument

82
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,930
of that architectural promenade.

83
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,040
And it operates in two ways.

84
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,100
First of all, it operates as a path, or as a space of vertical space

85
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,700
that cuts through the horizontal slabs.

86
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,340
In the Dom-ino system, the horizontal slabs are determinate,

87
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,920
and you move through those through a stairway or other circulations.

88
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,160
But the ramp cuts through those horizontal slabs,

89
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,290
and establishes a vertical slice of space

90
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,280
that unites the slabs in a different way than the stair.

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,660
Now, it is the case that even at the Villa Savoye,

92
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,400
there's also a stair that provides a parallel,

93
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,310
but different, kind of vertical circulation

94
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,080
through the horizontal slabs.

95
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,980
And that combination of ramp and stair-- they're actually very, very close

96
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,580
to one another and they connect with each other as you move through.

97
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,750
That's also an important apparatus of the architectural promenade.

98
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,650
So as you get on the ramp and go through, and then turn around

99
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,800
and come back, still inside the house,

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,320
but at the top of the second part of the ramp,

101
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,900
you reach a moment where the stair has also come up and made a landing.

102
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,870
So the ramp and the stair connect at that point.

103
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,130
At that landing, you have a choice.

104
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,900
Either you go into the main living space of the house,

105
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:20,460
or you move through the glass curtain wall outside into a very large terrace.

106
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,070
That living space and the terrace interact

107
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,640
in a very porous and transparent way.

108
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,420
There's almost no distinction between the space of the living

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,280
room and the space of the terrace.

110
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,820
And indeed, in good weather, you can slide the glass doors open

111
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,640
and it would become the same space.

112
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,500
The ramp then moves from an interior ramp

113
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,490
into an exterior ramp that looks out onto the terrace.

114
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,490
It again loops back on itself one more time.

115
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,040
And you get to the top of the ramp, which

116
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,880
is at the highest point of a second roof terrace

117
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,280
where Le Corbusier put a warped kind of curvilinear surface, punctured

118
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,790
by a single aperture that frames a view out into the distant fields and woods

119
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,540
beyond.

120
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,620
So you've moved through an environment of industrialized

121
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:23,930
glass, of industrialized lamps, of automobiles, into a more refined space.

122
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,860
But still a kind of minimalist space of white walls, out onto a terrace,

123
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,919
and then moving up into an area that you get

124
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,820
glimpses now of the natural landscape, and then finally

125
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,059
to the final moment of pause at this aperture where the landscape opens up.

126
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,160
In Villa La Roche and Villa Garches, there

127
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,140
is this itinerary of rotation and frontality.

128
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,410
There, the rotation is initiated by the surfaces of the walls themselves,

129
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,700
by balconies puncturing through the walls, by apertures in the walls,

130
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,060
by a curvilinear surface that comes and confronts us and makes

131
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,230
a kind of pressure on the space.

132
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,170
So the wall surfaces control that, or ply that rotation.

133
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,860
In the Villa Savoye, the ramp becomes the armature

134
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,170
that more immediately and strictly controls that rotation.

135
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,320
But it still opens up variability.

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,390
Now it's not just the variability of the walking through the space,

137
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,200
but it's a variability, a vision, that is constantly

138
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,480
framed by the interaction of the ramp as an armature

139
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,270
with the vertical walls and apertures as framing devices.

140
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,200
And as you move through the house, moments, not so much strictly

141
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,490
frontal but now framed in a more variable way,

142
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,500
moments are framed and pauses are caused because of the ramp

143
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,090
itself and its interaction with other parts of the house.

144
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,850
The ramp is the primary device that Le Corbusier

145
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,760
uses to connect different parts of the house,

146
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,540
setting up these interactions with different parts of the house.

147
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,240
The ramp diagrams potentials for occupation.

148
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,830
But the ramp is also a device for connecting

149
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,080
with conditions outside the house.

150
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,710
What Le Corbusier would consider the eternal goods,

151
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:38,890
like access to the earth, access to the sky, open air for physical health.

152
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,600
All these are made possible by what he called a "machine for living."

153
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,310
A machine, this object type, the house itself,

154
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,640
that diagrams potentials for occupation.

155
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,520
The diagram, which is the house, constructs a world.

156
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,010
But it's not a world--

157
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,510
just an immediate world-- it also is a world yet to come.

158
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,340
The machine for living constructs a real world that is yet to come.

159
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,110
A new type of reality.

160
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:13,280
A reality that will find its ultimate fulfillment in a future.

161
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,550
In 1930, Le Corbusier pondered over the houses

162
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,250
he had built over the previous decade.

163
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,320
And he singled out what he called compositions,

164
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,610
which are the sort of different ways that the houses had responded

165
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,340
to the initial Dom-ino diagram.

166
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,450
He contrasted what he called the somewhat facile, picturesque,

167
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,810
and hectic genre of the Villa La Roche, to the very difficult design

168
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,060
of the prism of Garches,

169
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,170
which then led, he said, to the spiritual satisfaction

170
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,150
which came at Villa Savoye.

171
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:53,330
The very easy, practical, combinable type, which was the synthesis
