K. MICHAEL HAYS: The thinking about the relationship

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,940
between architecture and language actually has a very long history.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,500
But in the 20th century, the interest in architecture as a language

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,720
and how linguistic theory could help interpret architecture was focused,

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,140
and it became a very important part of architectural theory, which we still

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,970
use today.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,330
I think understanding this linguistic theory can

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:39,180
help us further understand the nature of the abstraction of the Holocaust

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,230
Memorial.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,350
The first is the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure,

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,700
who gave lectures in linguistics right around the turn of the 20th century,

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,030
in the first decade of the 20th century, and whose work was published

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,240
by his students after he died.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,440
Saussure is one of the most important influences on architectural theory

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,310
in this regard, because of his theory of the sign.

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,670
In some ways Saussurean theory of the sign is very, very simple.

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,930
There are two components to Saussurean sign.

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,850
One is the signifier.

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,160
The other is the signified.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,930
The signifier is just a sound image or its graphic equivalent,

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,470
just an acoustical image that refers to something outside itself.

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,290
That's something, that concept, that idea,

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,110
that condition is called the signified.

24
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,440
Now there's a lot of slippage between the signifier and the signified.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,370
There's no there's no direct natural relation.

26
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,320
There's no causal relation.

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,820
Saussure said the relationship between the signifier, say the word cat,

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,660
and the signified, say the concept of cat

29
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,300
or the concept of domesticated animal, is arbitrary.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,570
There's no natural, or causal, or functional connection.

31
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:02,640
But it's the very arbitrariness that makes the theory of the sign so robust.

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,639
We now, in semiotics, think, not just of linguistic signifiers,

33
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,440
but we think of graphic signifiers.

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,230
We think of we think of spatial signifiers.

35
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,210
Anything that can refer to something else can be called a signifier.

36
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:25,920
And when we think about the interaction of a representation, the thing

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,130
representing and the thing being represented,

38
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,080
when we think about that relationship, we're in the realm of the sign.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,810
Now the theory of the sign can be elaborated.

40
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,770
One of the most important elaborations really attending

41
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,100
to the formal aspect of the theory of the sign

42
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,020
was made by the French theorist Roland Barthes in 1957

43
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,120
in an essay called "Myth Today."

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,710
What Barthes noticed is that because of this resonance,

45
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:01,290
this slipperiness, this arbitrariness between the signifier and signified,

46
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,280
that a signified or a sign, let's say if the sign is

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,820
a unit, the unit of signifier and signified,

48
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,480
that sign can become another signifier.

49
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,940
In other words, the very arbitrariness is also

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,410
a kind of robustness that makes a signified or a sign

51
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,180
also function as a signifier.

52
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,610
I'll give an example.

53
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,140
If, at a literal level, the signifier or the sound image, cat,

54
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,000
refers to the concept of the domesticated animal, at another level,

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,650
at a kind of allegorical or what Roland Barthes called a connotative level,

56
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,020
a cat, a black cat, say can be itself the signifier of bad luck.

57
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:52,380
So the first level, the literal level, is a fairly stable relationship,

58
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,900
but the second level, the level of connotation,

59
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,030
can have even more resonance.

60
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,770
So Barthes imagined this, or he sort of diagrammed

61
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,040
this idea is a staggering of the sign.

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,150
And in principle, the sign can keep staggering

63
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,100
and keep referring to greater and greater and more complex

64
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,579
associations and connotations.

65
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,529
I'll give you the example that Roland Barthes

66
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,860
himself gave of these two levels.

67
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,330
Once at a barbershop, at a Parisian barbershop,

68
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,240
he came across a copy of the magazine, Paris Match.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,450
This was sort of like the Life magazine of Paris of the 1950s.

70
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,210
On the cover was an image of a young black soldier dressed in French army

71
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,430
uniform, saluting the French flag, so an African French soldier

72
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,230
dressed in military uniform.

73
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,260
Now at the literal level, the sign is simply

74
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,820
that, French African dressed in French military uniform,

75
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,560
saluting the Tricolore.

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,730
That's the literal level.

77
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,960
At the connotative level, Barthes says he actually

78
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,820
makes a kind of ideological reading of the level of connotation, which

79
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,610
is that the French-African demonstrates to black and white French people alike

80
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,160
that whatever the unpatriotic criticism from the far-left

81
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,150
is about French occupation of Algiers that French France is

82
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,990
a great country, whose patriots include French Africans,

83
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,670
as well as white French.

84
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:32,190
So you see, at that point, at the level of connotation, the associations

85
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,360
and the work of the sign actually becomes ideological.

86
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,320
This is not to say that ideology can't happen at a literal stage,

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,130
at the first stage.

88
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,250
There could be, as it were, ideology all the way down.

89
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,890
But it's what's interesting about Barthes comment is

90
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,480
that is that it's an understanding of ideology that's

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:01,230
based on the structure of the sign, on the form of the sign, not the content.

92
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,540
So it's not it's not the particular content of French occupation of Algiers

93
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,890
that Barthes is interested in.

94
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,340
That's just one example.

95
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:16,260
It's the form, that staggered repetitive form reiterative form that the sign can

96
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,190
take that he's interested in.

97
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,730
We come now to a third moment in the theory of sign

98
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,310
in the work of the American linguist Charles Sanders Peirce.

99
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:35,280
Peirce thought that there were three distinct modes to the sign.

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
The first mode, which he called the symbolic

101
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,970
is really the only mode that Saussure himself considered.

102
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,990
So Peirce, in some way is expanding on Saussure's model.

103
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:54,300
A symbol is a sign that requires this conventional consensual understanding

104
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,000
of the signifier signified relationship.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,750
Let's say the bald eagle is a symbol for American spirit.

106
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,880
The bald eagle got nothing to do directly, causally, functionally

107
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,500
with American spirit.

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,140
It just means that Americans and others, as a kind of collective consensus,

109
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,200
agree that bald eagle is going to stand for, is going to represent,

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,100
is going to signify American spirit.

111
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,130
So symbol requires --

112
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,130
and the symbol to do its work as a sign requires an audience.

113
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,200
It requires an interpreter.

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,260
An interpreter of some sort, either individual or collective,

115
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,080
has to be present for the symbol to operate,

116
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,880
for the symbol to do its work of representing.

117
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,160
The second sign or mode of signification that Peirce refers to he

118
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,780
called the index.

119
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,750
The index is different from the symbol in a couple of ways.

120
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,990
The index is the direct trace of an effect of one object

121
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,920
on another, say a bullet hole is an index of the fact

122
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,420
that a bullet has been shot.

123
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,870
So the bullet hole is an index.

124
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,720
And an index, unlike a symbol, does not require the interpreter to be present.

125
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,790
The bullet hole is an index of a shot, whether or not anyone sees it.

126
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,300
Smoke is an index of fire, whether or not

127
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,080
there's someone there to see and interpret the smoke.

128
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,640
The trace of the index is always a material trace.

129
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,870
It can be visible.

130
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,190
It can be acoustic.

131
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:40,429
For example, the knock on the door is an index of someone at the door.

132
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:47,060
But unlike a symbol, which let's say a statue of a unicorn, which

133
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,660
doesn't actually exist can still be symbolic of unicorns,

134
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:56,460
an index requires a material trace.

135
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,100
The final mode of signification or the final kind of sign for Peirce

136
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,910
is what he called the icon.

137
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,510
An icon simply looks like the thing that it represents.

138
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,240
So a statue of a soldier holding a rifle in a helmet, in a uniform,

139
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,020
looks like a soldier holding a rifle in that uniform.

140
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,485
So that statue does its work as a sign in an iconic mode.

141
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,020


142
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,590
What's more interesting for us is that Peirce recognized

143
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,810
that there were special kinds of icons, which didn't just

144
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:39,830
look like the thing itself, but actually captured the relationship

145
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,300
of the parts of the thing.

146
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,740
So for example, a map is a very special kind of icon.

147
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,320
A map doesn't look like the city that it's signifying.

148
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,120
It is still a signifier of the city, but not because it looks like the city,

149
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,200
but because it shows the structural relationships

150
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,530
of the parts of the city connected by the different monuments,

151
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,070
the different plazas, the different buildings connected by a transportation

152
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,800
network.

153
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,370
It shows the structural relationship of its parts.

154
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,230
This special kind of icon Peirce referred to as a diagram.

155
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,100
So a map of a city is a special case of icon, which Peirce called a diagram.

156
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,320
A map operates as a diagram, not because it looks exactly

157
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,870
like the city that it's representing, but because it

158
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,970
captures the relationship of the parts of the city.

159
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,320
I want to argue that Eisenman's project for the Holocaust Memorial

160
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,330
is also a diagram, or better that in its status as a sign,

161
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,580
it operates according to what Peirce called a diagram.

162
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,270
Think again of the different operations of abstraction:

163
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,610
the repetition, the event, or the temporal experiential quality

164
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,800
of the project, the grid, the ground, and finally the names,

165
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,720
or the erasure of names.

166
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,850
Now these are very particular operations.

167
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,210
Not every abstract architecture or piece of abstract art

168
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,200
would necessarily have those same operations of abstraction.

169
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,680
They are abstract operations, but they're very particular

170
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,250
in their effect, because the effect that they produce,

171
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,230
the relentlessness, the repetition, the randomness, the temporal quality,

172
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,860
the scale, the enormity of the scale, and the relentlessness,

173
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,540
the nameless of it's victims.

174
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,150
We don't want too cut this too narrowly or make this too direct,

175
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,670
but the effect of those different operations of abstraction,

176
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:46,420
the deep structure of that abstraction has a diagrammatic relationship

177
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,620
to the system of National Socialism itself, at least, insofar as it

178
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,510
produced the Holocaust, the genocide.

179
00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:00,384
