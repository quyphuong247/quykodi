ANTOINE PICON: At the beginning of October 1851,
https://youtu.be/1UJj4XB51pc
1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,150
the exhibition was declared officially closed,

2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,560
and the problem then arose of what to do with the Crystal Palace.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,700
Here we have another caricature showing the dispersion

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,650
of the work of all nations--

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,640
steam engine, but also elephants, and all kinds of other things

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,000
leaving the Crystal Palace to return home.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,310
Emptied, the building seemed magnificent.

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,580
Queen Victoria, in her journal, describes

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,160
a visit she paid to the building once emptied,

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,490
saying that this was so beautiful.

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,230
And Queen Victoria was not super sentimental about architecture,

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,940
but she declared that it was so beautiful that it

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,720
was almost a pity that it had to go.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,520
For the building had been conceived as a temporary structure.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,260
But, of course, the temptation was great to try to make it permanent.

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,690
And proposals were made in that sense.

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,100
Paxton himself tried to convince the authorities to keep it to, for example,

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,860
transform it into a giant winter garden, something

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,040
in which Londoners could experience the charm of spring throughout the seasons.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,350
And we're back to this environmental theme

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,460
that I already mentioned that has, of course,

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,090
to do with the relation between the Crystal Palace

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,710
design and the greenhouse design.

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,700
The decision was, nevertheless, made to dismantle the Crystal Palace

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,430
and to free the garden at Hyde Park, and to restore Hyde Park as it was before.

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,140
But Paxton was definitely an entrepreneur.

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,100
In parallel with working with the Duke of Devonshire,

28
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,490
he had launched a series of enterprises-- journals, as I mentioned,

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,150
and a number of other things.

30
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:01,890
And he decided actually to rebuild another Crystal Palace -- larger, more

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,310
beautiful, and to transform it into a private venue

32
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,100
for the entertainment of the crowds.

33
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,880
This was done in Sydenham, in the suburb of London,

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,220
where he built a structure which is often confused

35
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,470
with the first structure, although it is actually quite different.

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,200
The new Crystal Palace was actually a much more complex structure: higher

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,170
with, actually, three transepts--

38
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,760
a main one and two lateral ones--

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,980
a kind of Crystal Palace on steroids that was conceived

40
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,010
as a permanent entertainment place.

41
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,920
And the genealogy that I mentioned earlier

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,260
between theme park and the Crystal Palace

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,230
is actually a reality through Sydenham, which

44
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,960
can be, in some ways, described as one of the earliest theme parks ever conceived.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,450
So this larger Crystal Palace did not have the crisp edges

46
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,190
that we found so alluring in the 1851 buildings.

47
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,270
But it was, nevertheless, a very large construction. Better built.

48
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,360
This time, Paxton had the time to work out all the details of the assemblage;

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,500
and much more stable.

50
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,610
Actually, the building survived until the 1930s,

51
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,430
in which a fire consumed it entirely.

52
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,990
So, this was a theme park.

53
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,030
Here you have a painting of the time.

54
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,710
You arrived through railways,

55
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,980
and you had garden, fountains, and all kinds

56
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,390
of displays linked to ideas of exotic travel,

57
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,150
traveling time -- ideas that are very close to this ideal for entertainment

58
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,120
that characterize still theme parks today.

59
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,000
Inside the Sydenham Crystal Palace, one found a mix of plantation, statues, etc.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,850


61
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,000
One could travel to ancient Egypt, as here, but also

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,820
to Rome, Greece, etc.

63
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,790
The new Sydenham Crystal Palace was not as strikingly modern

64
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,710
as the first construction, probably because the hurry of 1851

65
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,520
made the building less ornamented than its later version.

66
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,310
With the new Crystal Palace, there were more concessions

67
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,769
made to the 19th-century taste because one had more time to refine the design.

68
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,079
But nevertheless, the Sydenham Crystal Palace

69
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,110
was to remain also an icon of modernity,

70
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,020
and it was photographed in a way suggesting

71
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,800
a kind of genealogy between 19th-century construction

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,170
and 20th-century modernity.

73
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,680
This is a photograph taken by two photographers linked

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,290
to the modern movement in the United Kingdom.

75
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,190
And we can see the suggestion of modernity going

76
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,330
from the 19th century to the 20th.

77
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,650
1851-- the London Great Exhibition- the first

78
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,390
of a series of events that rhythm the life

79
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,620
of the second half of the 19th century.

80
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,040
The Crystal Palace was the first of a series of monumental construction

81
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,940
that marked the epoch of world fair.

82
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,240
This was, rapidly, an international phenomenon.

83
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,140
America, for example, had an exhibition in New York

84
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,750
a few years after the London exhibition.

85
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,600
This is the New York Crystal Palace, actually quite

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,720
an intriguing structure with the central dome,

87
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,660
but pretty much based on the Crystal Palace idea.

88
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,360
Nowhere were world exhibition as important as in Paris.

89
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,810
Paris became the capital of world exhibition

90
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,510
during the second half of the 19th century,

91
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:43,740
with exhibitions in 1855, 1867, 1878, 1889, 1900.

92
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,010
Here we have the 1867 exhibition, which is also the last Parisian exhibition

93
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,620
to be hosted mostly in a single giant building, a much more complex pattern,

94
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,860
these giant ovals, than the initial Crystal Palace,

95
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,820
but still following the idea of a world inside a building.

96
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,440
Later, exhibition would explode the single building

97
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,870
into a series of massive pavilions, but this is another story.

98
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,850
What's the meaning of all that?

99
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:21,250
Probably, of course, the ideas of technology, progress, human industry,

100
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,350
all these things we've seen.

101
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,900
But I'd like to evoke a number of other themes

102
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,410
that are linked to the rise of world exhibition.

103
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,900
The first one is, of course, the need for symbols.

104
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,800
And I mention Paris.

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,110
It's quite revealing, it's quite fitting,

106
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,440
that actually the most famous Parisian monument is actually

107
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,410
a legacy of a world exhibition.

108
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:51,460
The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 for the exhibition held in Paris that year.

109
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,310
Technology remained throughout the 19th century

110
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,070
a major theme of world exhibition, where the largest building of the 1889

111
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,040
Parisian exhibition was not actually the Eiffel Tower,

112
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,620
but the great Gallery of Machines, which was actually

113
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,190
the largest gallery of that time ever built.

114
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,920
We often keep in mind the trusses and the ballet, once again, of iron pieces.

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,110
But one must not forget the ornamentation and the intricate link

116
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,440
between ornament and structural performance

117
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,260
that characterized world exhibition.

118
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,200
World exhibitions were super ornamental, because this was also provided also

119
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,420
an opportunity to try to re-articulate art and technology, architecture

120
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,210
and engineering, ornament, and structural expression.

121
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,370
This is actually the entrance of the Great Gallery of 1889.

122
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,250
And as we can see, this is very different from the black and white

123
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,490
picture we're often provided with.

124
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,150
World exhibition also provided a way, because they

125
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:03,090
became much more complex urban venues, almost like districts in the city.

126
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,090
They provided, gradually, an opportunity to rethink

127
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,250
not only of industry, but also of the city that hosted the exhibition.

128
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,530
For example, the Chicago 1893 Exhibition provided an opportunity

129
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,630
for American urbanists and architects to test ideas that would later give birth

130
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,700
to the City Beautiful Movement.

131
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,550
It is well known that the Burnham Plan for Chicago

132
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,910
owes something to this seminal experience,

133
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,080
as if the city itself was becoming a giant exhibition.

134
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,600
I've seen a number of times throughout this presentation

135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,799
that the Crystal Palace was mythical.

136
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,980
Part of the paradox of history of architecture

137
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,110
is that it feeds upon the concrete objective relation

138
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,520
between a building and its period, between a building

139
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,270
and the social and political forces of the time.

140
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,310
But history of architecture feeds also upon myth because architecture is not

141
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,890
only a question of materiality.

142
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,520
It's inseparably about materiality and imagination.

143
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,490
From that perspective, the Crystal Palace

144
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,330
is definitely a very important moment, for this building actually

145
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:29,390
was, for a very short period, at least for its 1851 avatar, material reality.

146
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,920
It remained for a much longer time, probably

147
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:40,140
until today, an important landmark in our architectural imagination.
