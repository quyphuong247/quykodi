00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:08,960
K MICHAEL HAYS: During this time, Georges Pompidou

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,840
was the Prime Minister of President Charles de Gaulle

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,340
and actually became his successor as president after the events of May.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,790
Pompidou himself was a student of French literature

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,960
he was famously love poetry and art he also famously loved

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,850
technology and progressive technology, including the use of the automobile.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,420
Charles de Gaulle had wanted a public library on the site,

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,950
and Pompidou, after being so affected by the events of May,

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,450
expanded that program.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,990
He now wanted a center for cultural production,

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,530
a center that would include cinema to show avant garde films,

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,560
would include a bookstore as well as the library.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,410
It would include children's play rooms.

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:57,470
It would include parking for 20,000 cars and I think like 1,500 buses.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,680
What he was proposing was an anti-monumental facility,

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,740
available to the general public, that would invite the public

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,890
into the Center for Advanced art.

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,640
And international competition was launched.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,020
received almost 700 entries from all over the world.

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,340
And the team of Renzo Piano and Richard Rodgers won.

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,000
From the very first sketch you can see how radical their proposal was.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,650
They put an enormous emphasis on the plaza in front of the building.

23
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,460
Slightly sloped toward the building so that the surface

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,040
of the building and the plaza worked together

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,120
to form this outdoor urban space.

26
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,440
In the original scheme, the ground floor was completely open to the air

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,470
as, if to extend that plaza under the building.

28
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,840
They later had to enclose it in for security reasons,

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,070
but the idea of the freedom of that space is still there.

30
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,680
The public library occupies the first three levels.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,030
The museum and the library overlap on the third floor,

32
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,480
and the museum continues up to the fourth and the fifth floor.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,510
On the fourth and fifth floor, there are terraces that you can actually

34
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,080
move outside of the museum into, again, the space of the city,

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,790
and from the very top floor, you get this amazing view of the city of Paris,

36
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,520
including, of course, the Eiffel Tower.

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,690


38
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,122
The building is extremely flexible.

39
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:22,830
It was even meant that the building could

40
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,160
be dismantled, that the mechanical equipment, which,

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,500
of course, would quickly become obsolete,

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,870
could be very easily replaced.

43
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,950
It's an open work.

44
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,030
It's an open assemblage that completely changed the standards

45
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,600
in the construction industry.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,090
The building itself comprised the series of floors, uncluttered by columns,

47
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,280
supported by enormous trusses.

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,430
The trusses were almost 50 feet spanning,

49
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,430
and then an additional zone on the outside you

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,730
can see where mechanical services and circulation escalators were provided.

51
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,310
The construction employs a pre-fabricated cast steel,

52
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,950
which was actually quite unusual.

53
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,430
You can see that the trusses are held up then by the columns.

54
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,580
At the end of the building, there's this diagrid

55
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,370
which sort of ends the short side of the building.

56
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,570
You could argue that the building doesn't have a facade as such.

57
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,290
It's not the facade, say, of Palladio of Alberti.

58
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,100
On the other hand, it's a surface that in some wave functions

59
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,680
like a traditional architectural facade.

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,090
On the east elevation is where all of the mechanical services are,

61
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,440
and they're color-coded.

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,990
Yellow for the electrical, blue for the heating and ventilation,

63
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,510
green for plumbing.

64
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,260
The point here is not just to make the services legible.

65
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,690
The point is coding itself, because this building is a network of information,

66
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,750
of languages, of signs and symbols.

67
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,230
The steel and glass gives a certain sort of transparency.

68
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,170
There's a transparency between inside and outside.

69
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,530
In front of that, supported by these brackets,

70
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,840
is a thin, thin network of horizontals, verticals, and diagonals

71
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,280
that operates mainly in tension together with these little brackets

72
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,440
and struts to give stability.

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,380
The floors, which are steel and concrete also give lateral stability.

74
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,310
But what's important about the surface in front of the Place Beaubourg

75
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,870
is that it becomes a kind of scaffolding or a support structure

76
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,760
for different kinds of information.

77
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,300
You can read it as a kind of diagram of tensile forces

78
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,750
an engineer would see that as a kind of structural force field.

79
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,970
It's also a kind of surface that you can hang urban scaled art.

80
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,980
Of course, in between those two levels of material

81
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,440
are the famous escalators that symbolically show the flow of people

82
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,170
into and out of the center.

83
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,690
As a person ascends on the escalator, you

84
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,490
come into very, very close contact with these enormous cast steel pieces.

85
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,870
You see each element.

86
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,170
I think it's very important that there's very, very little field welding.

87
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,550
Almost everything is connected with bolts so that the connectivity is

88
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,550
very apparent, the idea of connection.

89
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,100
But then there's also other kinds of connectivity as you ascend.

90
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,510
As you go into the terraces, you start visually connecting with urban spaces

91
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,230
itself.

92
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,520
It's as if all different sorts of spaces of the city

93
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,700
can have somehow conceptually been brought together

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,070
into this single sort of heterotopia, which is the Centre Pompidou.

95
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,610
So while the building is rhetorically very technical and functional,

96
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,540
it's also very architectural, as architectural as Alberti's facade.

97
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,660
But the way it provides the surface onto which this kind of ornamentation

98
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,460
is applied.

99
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,220
It could be understood as a sort of laminate.

100
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,250
It's almost like a series of x-rays that have become

101
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,030
collapsed together where all these different kinds of information

102
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,056
is connected.

103
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:08,070


104
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,050
In some ways, the interiors are unremarkable

105
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,260
except for their enormous flexibility, but on the other hand,

106
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,270
they recognize that a younger generation of artists, a generation of artists

107
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,000
is coming into their own in the 1960s and '70s,

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,630
or are actually looking for different kinds of spaces.

109
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,090
Not like the Whitney's galleries, but spaces where different kinds of art

110
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,260
could be produced, where the distinction between painting and sculpture

111
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,270
and performance starts to break down.

112
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,800
Where have the very distinction between the interior gallery space

113
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,550
and the spaces of the city begin to break down.

114
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,980
And the pompidou tries to find a new architectural space

115
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,550
to represent those changes.
