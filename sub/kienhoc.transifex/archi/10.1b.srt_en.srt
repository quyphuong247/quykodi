00:00:08,937 --> 00:00:11,020
K. MICHAEL HAYS: First, let's talk about the site.

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,140
It's a very unusual site, and it's kind of amazing

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,630
that the site right in the center of Berlin

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,240
was actually made available for this project.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,700
And the reason is basically that between 1963 and 1989

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,690
the site was occupied by the Berlin Wall, which separated

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,160
eastern Berlin from western Berlin.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,510
The site to the north is bounded by the Brandenburg Gate and the Unter den

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,010
Linden.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,900
The Unter den Linden, or Under the Linden Trees,

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,590
is one of the main boulevards of Berlin, and it

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,470
leads right to the heart of the cultural area of Berlin.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,940
On the south is the Potsdamer Platz, which before the Berlin Wall went up

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,290
was the main commercial center of Berlin.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,940
So it's an extremely important site, which, after the Berlin Wall came down,

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:06,180
was just like this 17-acre wasteland with grass and weeds

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,180
and some remnants of pavement, but also some ghosts.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,710
The site during the Nazi occupation of Berlin

19
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,060
was the command center of the National Socialist Party, really the command

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,430
center of the Holocaust itself.

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,440
And it's reported that even buried in the site with no entrance to it

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,720
is the bunker in which Hitler committed suicide.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,490
So the site is saturated, is deep with these this history and these

24
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,840
memories, these contradictory memories.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,260
So from this remarkable site for the memorial

26
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,250
emerges as if from the earth itself these stelae,

27
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,910
2,711 blocks that seem to come somehow out of the earth

28
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:59,700
and create this sober, gray, awesome field.

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,440
Each block is about three feet wide and almost eight feet long,

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,600
and they vary in height from very, very low, almost bench-like height

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,090
to over 13 feet in height.

32
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,540
So there's a lot of variability in size.

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,940
There's also the blocks' tilt, up to almost a half a degree in some cases.

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,100
In some cases, much, much less.

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,690
But this tilting and the number give a kind of randomness to the field.

36
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,740


37
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,560
It's important that the number of blocks, the number of stelae,

38
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,090
2,711, doesn't signify anything.

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,370
It's not a date.

40
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,710
It's not the number of victims.

41
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,110
It's purely random.

42
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,040
The size of the blocks is also random, though of course there

43
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,360
is some association perhaps with a crypt or a coffin.

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,110
But it's important that the site doesn't literally hold bodies.

45
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,250
This is not the cemetery.

46
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,850
It's not a mausoleum.

47
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,670
It's a rather inert field of blocks.

48
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,318
