K. MICHAEL HAYS: Just as the visionary architects of the Enlightenment

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,660
gave form to new subject positions and new social institutions

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,950
that arose from the developing economy in the 18th century,

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,850
so architects of the 20th century gave representation

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,730
to conditions of their context.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,440
The late 20th century economy sponsored not only an industry

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,240
that produced machines like Behrens's turbine factory or Henry Ford's

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,120
assembly line, but also what philosophers

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,320
called the culture industry, which is akin to a factory,

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,950
but one that produces mass cultural goods--

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,800
music, movies, art, entertainment.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,200
Just as the architecture of Ledoux, theatricalized the salt industry,

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,550
so would late modern architecture inevitably come

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,730
to be involved with its own new cultural ethos.

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:06,262
