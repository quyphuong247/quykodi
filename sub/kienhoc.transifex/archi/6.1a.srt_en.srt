K. MICHAEL HAYS: Architecture, from its very beginning, has been made of stone, and when it hasn't been

2
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,910
made of stone, it's been made to look like it's made of stone.

3
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,480
Windows may have glass in them, but windows in a stone wall are simply openings.

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,120
The glass itself is not important.

5
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,830
The development of technologies that allow the production of large sheets of glass and

6
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:49,010
the materials with tensile strength, like steel, had the power to enormously change

7
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,180
the way buildings are made.

8
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,660
But how would that necessarily affect architecture?

9
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,837
How would that change architecture's

10
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:58,410
representational function?

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,229
How would that change architecture as the art of building?

12
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,270
The advances in modern technology and the invention of new materials

13
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,530
were not an inevitable helpful contributor to the goals of architecture culture.

14
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,810
How can one apply a symbolic language, an already existing symbolic architectural language

15
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,950
that was developed over thousands of years as an expression of the heavy compressive

16
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,360
forces in masonry, to lightweight

17
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,259
and thin structures

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,359
of metal and glass?

19
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:42,520
How does one achieve the requisite monumentality and profundity with such flimsy materials?

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,159
This was the primary problem for the architects of the 20th century.
