ANTOINE PICON: In February 1851 -- and note how quickly this whole story's unfolding --
https://youtu.be/-ViZz_CZ734
1
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,950
the construction of the building was almost complete.

2
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,200
But what Fox and Henderson were delivering was actually a shell.

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,910
A shell that had to be now accommodated for the exhibition,

4
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,910
beginning with a big problem that had never been

5
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,850
encountered there again at that scale.

6
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,440
Which is which color, what kind of painting, in order

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,530
to animate the entire building.

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,550
The 19th century was obsessed with color.

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,970
It's 19th century architects such as Jacques Hittorff,

10
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,780
the German-born, French architect who discovered,

11
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,710
or rather rediscovered, that Greek architecture was inseparable

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,930
from color scheme.

13
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,319
This interest in polychromy was a widely shared notion

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,950
in the 19th century.

15
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,620
So painting the Crystal Palace was at stake, but what color [to] use?

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,540
And what kind of "parti,"

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,170
what kind of general choice in order to orient oneself?

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,560
To paint the Crystal Palace, one to had to move between two extremes.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,690
One extreme could have been to accentuate

20
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,130
the immateriality of the constructions, such a theme construction.

21
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,200
Let's not forget that iron is something like 60 times more resistant

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,220
than stone, which basically means that a column in iron can be 60 times smaller.

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,150
So this impression of immateriality could have been reinforced by painting,

24
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,730
for instance, everything in white.

25
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:57,540
To the contrary, one could try to rather give substance to the iron.

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,670
Another possibility would have been to use

27
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,190
red, which is a color that has a tendency to make things

28
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,570
look more closer and more present.

29
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,240
So to paint everything in red.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,930
The color scheme that was finally chosen is actually a pretty elegant solution

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,880
moving in between these two extremes.

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,790
It was the work of artist Owen Jones, who

33
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,180
was asked by Paxton and the organizer of the exhibition

34
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,050
to actually propose a solution to paint the Crystal Palace.

35
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,800
And here we have one of the drawings submitted by Owen Jones

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,880
in order to explain his ideas.

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,170
What Owen Jones proposed was actually a mix of three fundamental colors:

38
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,080
red, blue, and yellow.

39
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,000
Owen Jones's research and project was actually

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,730
linked to also an interest in the optical and physiological properties

41
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,050
of colors.

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,650
Something that had been initiated in the late 18th century,

43
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,100
illustrated by the work of someone like Goethe,

44
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,520
with his famous theory of colors, and a question that was

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,610
very much on the table in the 1850s.

46
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,240
Owen Jones decided, actually, to use the blue for the web

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,500
to create an impression of a complex but distant maze, with this notion

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,780
that blues tend to make things recede in the background.

49
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,070
He used the yellow as the counterpoint to make things more vividly present.

50
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,560
And in his own approach of color, the red was kind of intermediate.

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,280
The columns were actually painted in blue and yellow,

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,010
so that actually they would appear having

53
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,050
much more relief, much more movement than what they had in reality.

54
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,870
Here we can see how complex is the scheme.

55
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,790
You may notice, for example, the girders of the main nave are in blue.

56
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,080
But you may notice that the beam they're supporting are painted in red.

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,360
So something that, once again, through a tendency

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,420
to make some objects appear receding in the background

59
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,930
and other appear as coming rather towards the observer,

60
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,960
created once again this impression of animation.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:17,589
The Crystal Palace had presented some analogies with church, or more

62
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,720
generally, religious architecture.

63
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,350
One must not forget that in those years, polychromy

64
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,400
was seen as one of the characteristics of religious buildings.

65
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,280
For example, Greek temples that already mentioned here.

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,630
We have a Beaux-Arts reconstitution of a Greek temple.

67
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,200
And in which we see, by the way, some of the primary colors used in the Crystal

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,920
Palace.

69
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,570
So to paint was by no means a culturally neutral decision.

70
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,420
It really was about imparting meaning to these new constructions.

71
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,300
Of course, speaking of colors...

72
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,970
How not to be struck by the fact that this question has

73
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,290
re-emerged with buildings, like for example, the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

74
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,830
And more generally-- I mentioned high-tech architecture.

75
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,090
High-tech architecture very often plays on colors

76
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,220
and the contrast between colors.

77
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,810
As if a form of modernity, a form of pleasure

78
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,340
linked to the perception of simple colored ambiences

79
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,730
was born with the Crystal Palace, and is still with us today.

80
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,980
If painting the Crystal Palace was already a complex problem,

81
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,900
organizing the exhibition was another.

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,940
How to classify, how to bring some order to millions of artifacts.

83
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,080
How to structure things that range from raw materials

84
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,440
to machines, and to even works of art.

85
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,470
Initially, the organizers had foreseen a very clear organization

86
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,990
of the displays, an organization reminiscent of the order used

87
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,430
in publications like the great Encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert.

88
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,570
So the exhibition would have been organized in four parts,

89
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,410
with the first one being raw materials;

90
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,850
then machinery, so the machines;

91
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,450
then manufacturers, so basically, industrial product;

92
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,590
and then something very important in throughout the 19th century, which

93
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,550
is these industrial productions that were close to art,

94
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,460
such as, for example, stained glasses, enamel production --

95
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,420
all kinds of things in between manufacturing and art.

96
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,880
This very logical order created at least two problems.

97
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,570
The first one was that, actually, the four sections

98
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,130
were not of equivalent size.

99
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,220
Second, such a division blurred national distinction,

100
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:57,990
which was clearly something some nations did not want.

101
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,710
The final organization was actually a compromise.

102
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,930
It was a compromise in which national logic emerged very strongly.

103
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,940
There again, there is in this building almost something emblematic

104
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:19,560
of these nuanced, very spectacular rise both of nation and internationalism.

105
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,220
It was an international exhibition, but an international exhibition

106
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,560
that showcased the industry of the various nations.

107
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,010
The United Kingdom and its colonies occupied

108
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,260
pretty much half of the exhibition.

109
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,930
This is what you have on the left.

110
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,420
And on the right, the rest of the world,

111
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,970
which pretty much reflected, at the time,

112
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,600
the difference between the industry of the United Kingdom

113
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,820
and the industry of the rest of the world.

114
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,010
At the time, England's industry produced something

115
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,230
like half of the iron production of the world.

116
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,690
So this is by no means far fetched, in many respects.

117
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:03,390
Now, in order to have some logic in the way things were displayed,

118
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,100
a number of choices were made.

119
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,730
Machines were grouped on one side of the building.

120
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,660
On the other side of the building, one found raw materials.

121
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,480
And in order to make the exhibition more spectacular,

122
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,180
the most interesting and spectacular artifacts

123
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,640
were grouped, actually, in the nave.

124
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,440
So that the final organization was a kind of compromise between national,

125
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,650
thematic, and in some ways, a logic of spectacle.

126
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,909
And this is what made also the exhibition quite a success.

127
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:42,370
Here, a couple of photographs of what was on display, especially in the nave.

128
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,660
Some of the these artifacts may seem purely artistic,

129
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,450
like the dome that is in the rear.

130
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,720
But which was actually a very large piece of iron

131
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,740
produced by Coalbrookdale, the place where the first iron bridge had been

132
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,470
built at the end of the 18th century,

133
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:05,020
and which epitomized in the way the supremacy of the English iron works.

134
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,520
In the front, you have actually a lighthouse lantern,

135
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,250
which was there again, something pretty high tech at the time.

136
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,630
And you can see sculptures.

137
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,690
You can see a whole mix of objects, which

138
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,490
are pretty typical of what may have looked, at the time,

139
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,460
as a bazaar at the scale of the planet.

140
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,350
I just showed you the British side.

141
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,740
Now we have the rest of the world's side of the nave --

142
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,700
were there again a number of artifacts kind of surprising.

143
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,520
For example, the two statues of horses that

144
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,310
were presented by the Duke of Württemberg, which

145
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,960
are clearly not industrial, but in between industry and traditional craft,

146
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,240
as many of the things displayed.

147
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,170
I won't to enter into all the details of the organization that

148
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:56,350
was necessary to receive all these objects coming from the entire world,

149
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,980
to organize them, to sort them, etc.

150
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,985
Let's just say a few things.

151
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:09,490
A number of people, pretty much all kinds of resources were mobilized.

152
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,660
The military, for example.

153
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,220
Troops were used in order just to check in objects.

154
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,870
There were so many of them.

155
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,260
Also, to mark things on the floor and to be sure

156
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,610
that things were following the proper order, and were

157
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,510
brought where they had to be.

158
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,400
But also, all kinds of curators:

159
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,120
geologists from the natural science museum;

160
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,250
artists; etc.

161
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,360
Specialists of the history of art were mobilized.

162
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,250
The whole [of] London was busy cataloging, putting in place the artifacts.

163
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,920
Despite that, and although the organizers had announced

164
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,400
that no object would be allowed to enter the Crystal

165
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,190
Palace after the official opening, actually

166
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,210
took a few weeks more after the opening to put everything in place.

167
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:03,340
There again, the most formidable museum that the planet had ever seen

168
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,500
was put in place in a few weeks.

169
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,100
Probably not completely on time, but quite an achievement.

170
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,750
Which is as much about logistics than architecture,

171
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,180
than the rest of the things we've been evoking so far.

172
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,190
Between the 1st of May, 1851, and the 11th of October of the same year--

173
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,280
day on which the exhibition was declared officially

174
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,250
closed, some six million people visited the Crystal Palace.

175
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,610
Six million people might not seem enormous by today's standard.

176
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,990
At the time, it was completely unprecedented.

177
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,850
Let's also remember that it was a transcontinental exhibition.

178
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,540
Artifacts came from Asia, from the Americas, pretty much

179
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,350
every part of the world.

180
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,810
So in some ways, one could say that 1851 and the Great Exhibition

181
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,000
was the first global event.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,400
Here we have a caricature of the journal Punch,

183
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,120
which is titled "All the World Going to See the Great Exhibition of 1851."

184
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,680
And in some ways, this was actually pretty accurate.

185
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,000
The exhibition was also an event in which

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,520
social classes were a bit blurred.

187
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,450
It was not only global in terms of being international.

188
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:29,910
It was also global because peasant, worker came along with aristocrats,

189
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,170
with the bourgeois.

190
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,900
And here, you have another caricature with people

191
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,750
gawking at all these marvelous things.

192
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,170
There again, we've got completely accustomed to this kind of spectacle.

193
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,830
But just try to be, for five minutes, someone from 1851.

194
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,070
You had never seen a building that large.

195
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,680
You had never seen so much glass, so much light, so much transparency.

196
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,960
You entered, actually, through a pretty cramped door.

197
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,880
But then, all of a sudden, the magic operated.

198
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,280
You found yourself under this magnificent glass

199
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:08,010
dome in a kind of church of crystal with trees, with fountains.

200
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,990
With this mix of artificial and natural objects.

201
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,550
And this was only the transept.

202
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,980
You've not yet discovered the whole thing.

203
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,470
And then you arrive at the middle of the transept

204
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,190
and then the two sides of the nave, the great nave, appear.

205
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,670
This magic world full of fascinating objects.

206
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,650
The whole thing was an enchantment.

207
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,240
It was a kind of magic world.

208
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
The first wonderland.

209
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,540
In a way, the first theme park.

210
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,120
And as we will see, Paxton did actually envisage something like a theme park

211
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,810
in his later version of the Crystal Palace.

212
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:48,510
So there again, we find this idea of a giant entertainment for everyone --

213
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,440
mixing classes,

214
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,580
and this is probably also the great ambiguity

215
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,880
of the industrial world that arised at the same time.

216
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,810
That's to say, a socially stratified world in which capitalists

217
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,760
are more and more capitalistic.

218
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,060
But also a world in which the spectacle is for everyone.

219
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,090
It was a magical world,

220
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,210
a world full of objects, of things, of stuff.

221
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,370
This is where -- to use a kind of Marxian grid of analysis --

222
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,240
this is where the realm of merchandise began to emerge.

223
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,520
All this stuff accumulated.

224
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,530
And of course, with the pleasure that has

225
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,030
to do with the never-exhausted desire to see,

226
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,300
to possess, to touch, to experience.

227
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,920
A world in which, by the way, repetition and uniqueness go together.

228
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,360
We have again, the horses of the Duke of Württemberg in the middle of all

229
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,930
these repetitive girders and columns.

230
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,440
This world in which would invent psychoanalysis

231
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:58,210
to try to understand what was at stake in this endless mix of repetition

232
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,470
and uniqueness, desire, and monotony.

233
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,580
Walter Benjamin, the German late 19th-century, early 20th-century

234
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,320
German philosopher, wrote a number of pages about the flâneur

235
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,940
and how Parisian it is.

236
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,890
But one must imagine that actually, the flâneur was as much a London creature,

237
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,230
one of the visitors of this world contained into a single building,

238
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,620
as Ruskin would have it, in the moments in which he did not

239
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,280
find the whole enterprise completely disputable.

240
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,200
The Crystal Palace and the Great Exhibition

241
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,850
played also a seminal role in the development of the new design

242
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,890
ideal of the industrial world.

243
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:47,500
Among which, we found the desire to return to a quality of craft

244
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,870
that industry seemed to challenge.

245
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,530
Such was, for example, the meaning of the Medieval Court

246
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,520
organized by Pugin, in which the idea was

247
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,450
to suggest that one could reconcile the industrial age

248
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,140
with the quality of former ages, beginning with the craft of the Middle

249
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,460
Ages.

250
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,290
Many of these artifacts can still be seen today in the Victoria and Albert

251
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,140
Museum, where they have been carefully preserved.

252
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,910
I mentioned the role of craft.

253
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,270
Here is the section on stained glasses.

254
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,140
Let's not forget, by the way, that the 19th century built hundreds,

255
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,000
if not thousands, of churches,

256
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,860
and stained glasses... Was stained glasses a craft or an industry?

257
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,720
We are there confronted with another of the ambiguity of the Industrial Age.

258
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:43,170
Here we see, again, this strange world of magnificent, surprising objects.

259
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,310
Something almost-- of course, this is not yet

260
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,990
the period of department stores,

261
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,390
but we can understand also the continuity

262
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,250
between the waters of 19th century department stores

263
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:03,000
and a place like the Crystal Palace and the Great Exhibition.
