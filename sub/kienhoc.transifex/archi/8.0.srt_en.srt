K. MICHAEL HAYS: The control of movement and view in the work of Le Corbusier

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,370
produces an almost cinematic representation.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,910
It's this dynamic spatiality that in some ways

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,620
supersedes the one-point perspectival calibrations and mathematical stability

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,350
of Brunelleschi or Alberti.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,680
The account of Le Corbusier, then, is a good transition

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,430
to the final set of modules in this course.

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,240
Here, we'll deal more directly with architecture's relationship

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,990
to its various social and historical contexts.

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,140
And we'll account for what we've been calling

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,320
architecture's power of representation.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,080
We've already seen this power at work.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,660
In fact, the first set of modules developed

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,510
the two fundamental prerequisites for representation: form and history.

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,360
And then in our second set of modules, we added to that materiality.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,390
And with these three prerequisites, we can recall Hegel's great argument

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,520
that with these techniques or devices, architecture

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,780
is called upon to do nothing less than represent

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,126
the truth of its historical context.

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,750
But representation can mean other things as well.

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,630
It can mean that architecture sometimes performs like a linguistic metaphor.

22
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,050
In the upcoming module, we'll look at the visionary architects

23
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,830
of the 18th century and their use of architecture

24
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,490
as a way of speaking to communicate meaning--

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,810
what they call "l'architecture parlante," or "speaking architecture."

26
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,080
One of the exercises in another module asked

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,340
you to list some of the dozens of metaphors used by a critic

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,610
to characterize an architectural project.

29
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,860
Representation can also point to the mnemonic function of architecture--

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,070
that is, its power to carry memories that are historical and contextual,

31
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,980
its power to carry collective memories.

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,930
But, in general, representation means that architecture performs

33
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,930
like a cognitive map of society.

34
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:27,010
It gives us a rational diagram of society's deep, complex structures.

35
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,760
It gives shape to an epoch's particular character and nature,

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,090
and it links the memory of pasts to possible futures.
