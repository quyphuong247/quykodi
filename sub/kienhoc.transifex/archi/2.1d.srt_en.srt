ERIKA NAGINSKI: This brings us to the second building
https://youtu.be/IceGxabawEo
1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,270
in Wittkower's sequence--

2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,920
Santa Maria Novella in Florence,

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,140
which, to his mind, is offering an alternative solution

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,180
to the problem of what it means to fuse an Italian medieval structure

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,640
and a classical idiom.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,810
Now, Santa Maria Novella was a building originally

7
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,280
erected under the auspices not of the Franciscan Order, as in the Tempio,

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,260
but of the Dominican Order.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,140
It was completed around 1360,

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,760
and the commission came to Alberti a century later

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,250
from a rich Florentine textile merchant by the name of Giovanni Rucellai.

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,680
Santa Maria Novella confronted Alberti with a similar set of issues to those

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,260
he had faced at the Tempio in Rimini.

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,580
Again, he relied on the ornamental capacities

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,140
of pilasters and engaged columns, refusing the idea

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,450
that the column should have a structural function.

17
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,700
He also relied on the idea of a cornice projecting over half columns

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,300
on pedestals at each side of the entrance.

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,660
He inserted-- and this is different from the Tempio--

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:31,160
a high attic zone, which separates the lower story from the upper story.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,980
One thing we do know is that he had to incorporate

22
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,190
that large, round Gothic window.

23
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,840
He didn't have any choice about that.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,800
And what he did instead was reiterate it, in some sense.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,050
It gets reiterated by the decorative motif in the triangular pediment,

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,010
as well as the gigantic scrolls to either side.

27
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,380
This, in other words, is actualizing something

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,750
that he had entertained at Rimini.

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,560
Now, one of the things that's striking about Santa Maria Novella

30
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,440
is that despite its classical forms--

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,190
we see columns, we see elaborate capitals--

32
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,900
it is a church that maintains Tuscan formal traditions.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,320
You have multi-colored marble encrustations.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,100
You have pointed arches. You have even the ornament

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,510
of the capitals and the scrolls, which all have Florentine prototypes.

36
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,940
Now, if you take Wittkower's interpretation of this building,

37
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,600
Alberti's goal was to, quote unquote, "harmonize" the medieval facade,

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,850
to find what he called a "mutual accord" between the old

39
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,820
and the new-- between the old structure and the new idea.

40
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,810
It's important here, also, to underscore that Alberti was even more

41
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,840
limited than he had been at the Tempio.

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,960
Not only could he not make an envelope for the entire building--

43
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,990
he was really only looking at the facade--

44
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,190
but he had to incorporate aspects of the facade that were standing:

45
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,260
the aforementioned window, the side entrance's under-pointed arches,

46
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,640
which is as far removed from the classical idiom as you can imagine,

47
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,020
the high blind arcades, in which the arches are simply part of the wall.

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,400
He also carried over the original color scheme of the marble encrustation--

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
white panels with green bands--

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,310
into his own additions.

51
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,040
One thing we might want to do is to pay attention

52
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,170
to what might be called the kind of civic, or patriotic, historicism

53
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,320
of the facade's stylistic aspect.

54
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,760
The pillars at Santa Maria Novella actually refer back

55
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,870
to the corners of the 11th-century Baptistery, which

56
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,110
had similar horizontal encrustations.

57
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,895
And you might also want to turn to the Romanesque church of San Miniato al

58
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:53,440
Monte, begun in the early 11th century.

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,330
Its facade is from the 12th century.

60
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,580
It's clear that Alberti seems to have been looking at that source

61
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,730
as he developed the idea of a two-story disposition

62
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,440
for the facade with a pedimented upper level for screening the nave.

63
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,880
In this sense, Alberti's design for the facade of Santa Maria Novella

64
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,890
is deeply traditional.

65
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:20,820
It's local, it's historiated, and it is patriotically Florentine.

66
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,160
This more vernacular aspect is completely uninteresting to Wittkower.

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,060
He's not interested in recovering those sources

68
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,480
and talking about the local and patriotic aspects of the commission--

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,300
he wants to see something else at work.

70
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,290
And this is what he reveals by means, of course, of his diagrams.

71
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,230
Now, his argument is that by focusing on the noticeably high attic separating

72
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,020
the lower register from the upper register,

73
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,270
we can see how Alberti actually, quote, "overcame"--

74
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,060
and this is Wittkower-- "some of the difficulties

75
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,860
which had remained unresolved in Rimini," end of quote.

76
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,460
So, somehow that strong attic zone, that strong horizontal band for Wittkower

77
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,040
is what detracts from the fact that, although the inner piers are

78
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,940
continued down below by the columns, the outer piers are not,

79
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,620
and this might offer the same kind of visual dead end

80
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,840
and confrontation between verticality and horizontally that we had at Rimini.

81
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,400
By inserting that attic zone, the problem, as it were, disappears.

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,100
In other words, we have alighted the discrepancy between the entrance

83
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,220
register and the upper story.

84
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,040
And what could have been a pastiche effect

85
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,370
becomes patently obvious to what Wittkower calls

86
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,330
the, quote unquote, "classical eye."

87
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,480
This needs explanation, and here's Wittkower to do so.

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,470
Quote, "The attic in Santa Maria Novella is

89
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,700
at the same time effective as a horizontal barrier

90
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,410
and neutralizes the vertical tendency of the projecting entablature

91
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,030
above the columns,

92
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,100
the motif which had led to such difficulties...in Rimini."

93
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,650
In other words, Wittkower sees Alberti as able

94
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,880
to offer here, at Santa Maria Novella, the colossal columns

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,480
as an ornamental vehicle without the kind of confusion

96
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,550
that he ran into at the Tempio.

97
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:34,330
In other words, Santa Maria Novella solves the problem of the Tempio.

98
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,360
After focusing on the attic, Wittkower focuses

99
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,000
on the complexities of the entrance, framed

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,330
by those two colossal green columns.

101
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:49,720
Now, like the Tempio in Rimini, you have two pilasters carrying up to an arch.

102
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,220
But there's no pediment over the door, as there was at the Tempio.

103
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,510
And what instead asserts itself is a much deeper space that

104
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,050
lets a highly decorative ornate entablature

105
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,480
course its way back into the recesses of the entrance depth.

106
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,200
This not only makes the entrance closer to an antique prototype,

107
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,050
in fact, the Pantheon in Rome,

108
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,470
but, more to the point, and this is again Wittkower's language,

109
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,060
it makes the composition, quote unquote, "tighter somehow, as opposed to vague

110
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,330
and floating and surface-oriented in Rimini."

111
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,170
This is very noticeable in Wittkower's language, this kind of seeking out

112
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,360
of compactness, of legibility, of coherence, in this second example,

113
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,070
as opposed to Rimini.

114
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,180
It's a way to describe in language the kind of developmental terms

115
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,340
of Alberti's quest to apply a classical idiom to the facade

116
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,460
and seek out tightness and unity in the end result.

117
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,710
The other advantage of turning to Santa Maria Novella after Rimini

118
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,250
is that it imposes an immaculate chronology.

119
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,940
It says that, somehow, the Tempio in Rimini--

120
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:07,330
you'll remember that the commission dates from about 1450 to 1454--

121
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,870
is followed, then, by Santa Maria Novella,

122
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,110
which unfolded as a commission between 1456 and about 1470.

123
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,020
Wittkower is allowed to conclude along these lines.

124
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,170
Quote, "The entrance to [the Tempio], is only the first step

125
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,820
leading to the fully developed classical composition displayed

126
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,550
in that of Santa Maria Novella."

127
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:37,600
So given the allegiance to Tuscan precedences, to Tuscan motifs,

128
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,690
to 12th-century sources like San Miniato,

129
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,750
like the Baptistery in Florence, one might

130
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,840
be led to ask what manner of classicism is this

131
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,270
beyond entablatures and columns?

132
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,870
In other words, is there really a system here?

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,540
This is where Wittkower's diagram steps in, of course,

134
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,730
and where he unveils his explanation of classical harmony.

135
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,800
"Harmony, the essence of beauty, consists... in the relation of the parts

136
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,140
to each other and to the whole,

137
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,270
and, in fact, a single system of proportion permeates the facade,

138
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,170
and the pace and size of every single part and detail

139
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,230
is fixed and defined by it.

140
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:31,600
Proportions recommended by Alberti are the simple relations of one to one, one to two, one to three,

141
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,940
two to three, three to four," and so on.

142
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,770
"...which Alberti had found in classical buildings.

143
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,350
The diameter of the Pantheon, for instance,

144
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,720
corresponds exactly to its height,

145
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,560
half its diameter corresponds to the height of the substructure,

146
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,850
as well as to that of the dome," and so on and so forth.

147
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,230
In view of this kind of explanation, in view of this scheme of things,

148
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,520
simple ratios--

149
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,600
the idea of simple ratios, emerge as the principle dictating

150
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,210
the configuration of the facade.

151
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,630
So for example, in that diagram, Wittkower

152
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,160
inscribes the entire facade in a square.

153
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,410
That rectangle cuts the large square in half,

154
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,680
explains the relation of the two stories to each other.

155
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,800
The lower story encompasses two of the squares,

156
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,590
while the upper centralizes one of them.

157
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,160
What this means is a ratio of 1:2.

158
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,740
In figure four, another diagram,

159
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,320
the same ratio is shown in the sub-units of each of the stories.

160
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,670
The central bay of the upper story is a perfect square

161
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,890
whose sides correspond precisely to half the width of the whole story.

162
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,850
The whole story can be summed divided into four equal squares: two

163
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,510
corresponding to the pediment and to the entablature,

164
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,780
and then two to the pilastered wall below.

165
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,890
The subdividing continues on and on, with the smaller four squares

166
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,010
defined in dashes in Wittkower's diagram

167
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:08,530
becoming the fundamental module for the attic and the entrance door.

168
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,170
And then there are the 1:3 ratios.

169
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,310
The height of the entrance bay is exactly 1 and 1/2 time its width.

170
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,870
Furthermore, the small square encrustations of the attic

171
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,940
are 1/3 of the attic's height, and are related in a ratio of 2:1

172
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,660
to the actual diameter of the columns, and so on, and so forth.

173
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,550
The story of ratios of modules unfolds.

174
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,410
And the whole point of this diagrammatic demonstration of Santa Maria Novella's

175
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,960
ostensive geometrical harmony is to introduce the conceptual basis

176
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,840
of an otherwise stylistically retrograde and confusing, or eclectic, facade

177
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,450
with Tuscan and medieval roots.

178
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,520
Here's Wittkower again--

179
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,590
"The whole facade is geometrically built up of a progressive duplication,

180
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,870
or, alternatively, a progressive halving of ratios.

181
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,170
It is clear that Alberti's theoretical precept

182
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,620
that the same proportion be kept throughout the building

183
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,150
has here been fulfilled.

184
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,590
It is the strict application of an unbroken series

185
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,720
of ratios that marks the unmedieval character of this... facade

186
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,390
and makes it the first great Renaissance example of eurythmia."

187
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,660
What is "eurythmia" in this context?

188
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,400
In Greek, eurythmy designates graceful movement or the graceful movement

189
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,440
of a well-proportioned object.

190
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,030
And we can even turn to the Hellenistic architectural theorist and engineer

191
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,400
Vitruvius, for an explanation of this architectural concept.

192
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,610
For Vitruvius, architecture consists actually,

193
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,590
in six fundamental principles.

194
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:59,650
The first is order, the second is arrangement or disposition,

195
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:05,080
the third is eurythmy, the fourth is symmetry, the fifth is decor,

196
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,590
and the sixth is distribution.

197
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:14,200
For Vitruvius, eurythmia quote, "depends on the beautiful shape of the building,

198
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,200
and on the proper appearance achieved by the arrangement

199
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,390
of its individual parts.

200
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,840
It is achieved when the elements of the work are proportionate in height

201
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,510
to width, length to breadth, and every element corresponds in its dimensions

202
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,190
to the total symmetries of the whole."

203
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,080
Eurythmia, put another way, speaks to the beautiful relation

204
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,470
of parts as an architectural principle, as a geometric necessity.

205
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,400
So eurythmy is associated with the appearance of visual beauty,

206
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,840
as opposed to symmetry, which belongs to something more abstract.

207
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,660
It is defined as a kind of illusion of grace,

208
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,000
or the quality of being well-shaped.

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,420
It signifies an aesthetic sense of wholeness,

210
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,060
of an overall coherence of the work.

211
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,190
Eurythmy is crucially based on the aesthetic apprehension of a composition

212
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,230
in proportional terms.

213
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,740
Because of this eurythmy, because of this appearance

214
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,480
of the beauty of the ratios in Santa Maria Novella,

215
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,290
we come to this conclusion.

216
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,600
The Tempio poses the problem of aesthetic apprehension,

217
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,550
and Santa Maria Novella solves it.
