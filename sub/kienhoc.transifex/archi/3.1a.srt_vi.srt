K. MICHAEL HAYS: In our consideration of the architectural imagination,

2
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,060
có hai điểm chính sau.

3
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,290
First of all, the imagination is productive.

4
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,840
It constructs schema that-- from sense data--

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,090
that it presents to the understanding.

6
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,410
So the imagination, which is part of the subjective realm, is productive.

7
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,700
The imagination doesn't actually produce knowledge.

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,770
It doesn't deal with concepts,

9
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,070
but it sets us on the path to knowledge.

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,880
Now, what we have there is a very powerful model

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,440
for aesthetic experience.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,420
But there's a serious omission,

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,090
and that is, on this model, architecture doesn't have a history.

14
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,430
Aesthetics doesn't have a history.

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:20,440
We owe the conceptualization and the model for a philosophy of art history

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,710
to the German idealist philosopher Hegel.

17
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:30,380
In aesthetic experience, we have to distinguish between aesthetic pleasure,

18
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,440
và sự thật.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,840
Hegel is after a model where art deals with truth--

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,980
that art discloses truths about the world

21
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,410
bằng cách cho những sự thật ấy một diện mạo.

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,930
And art in its highest vocation is an art in which the truth of beings, that

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,630
is to say of individuals, but also being as a whole--

24
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,430
that is the unconditioned, the absolute, the totality

25
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,340
in which that being opens itself up.

26
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,920
It appears,

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,670
and its historical existence is made manifest through art.

28
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,560
Now, another way of saying this is that cultures learn about themselves

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,060
qua nghệ thuật của họ.

30
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,570
They learn about their objectives.

31
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,770
They learn about how they function.

32
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,030
Cultures represent themselves-- to themselves through their art.

33
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,160
And what Hegel imagines is that all the cultures through time

34
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,270
and all of the epochs of art can be assembled together

35
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,670
in this giant global mechanism.

36
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,970
Hegel is a very systematic philosopher,

37
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,000
and he wants a total system, a mechanism that

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,210
gathers up all the cultures and all the epochs of art

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,670
into a single, coherent, unified system.

40
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,530
Now, the idea that architecture should be thought of as having a history

41
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,450
is itself a historical accomplishment.

42
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,480
Hegel writing in the 19th century, earlier philosophers

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,760
writing in the 18th century--

44
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,710
they gave us the concept that architecture has a history.

45
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,340
Before that, we had manuals of building;

46
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,270
we had treatises that told us theories about building;

47
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,990
we had biographies of artists.

48
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,020
But we didn't have history as such.

49
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,400
I mean, why should it be that architecture is in the flux of history?

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,300
I mean, why don't we just have buildings,

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,820
and we refine how we make those buildings,

52
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,190
and we keep making the same kind of building

53
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,610
until we get the building as best that it can be?

54
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,720
Why, instead of that, should we think that architecture has to progress,

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,340
that architecture has to change?

56
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,510
But more important, how can it be that architecture, and art generally,

57
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,682
is involved with thought?

58
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:04,210
Not how can we think about architecture, but how can architecture

59
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,780
be thought-like?

60
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,290
What that involves-- and we owe this also to Hegel--

61
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,830
is a very special relationship of subject to object.

62
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,860
In our earlier model, the subject was dominant.

63
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,209
The subject is productive.

64
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,710
The imagination is constructing its reality.

65
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,680
Hegel, who is concerned with the truth of art, wants the object to push back.

66
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,250
He wants the subject to react to the object, the subject

67
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,440
being the categories, the interpretations, the way

68
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,090
we are in the world.

69
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,540
He wants the subjective realm to react back to the object,

70
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,280
so that the object takes on a more primary role

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,870
and, therefore, the subject can know truths

72
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,480
about the object, truths about the world,

73
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,430
because the subject makes those truths appear.
