K. MICHAEL HAYS: Glass became, for modern architects, the essential material of the future.
https://youtu.be/jf1LzUh-elQ
1
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,950
Glass was endowed not only with material visual qualities,

2
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,500
but also with spiritual qualities.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,440
The German architect Mies van der Rohe would design buildings in America that would become

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,420
the epitome of glass and steel skyscrapers.

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,540
But Mies started his work in Germany.

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,730
In fact, Mies also worked in the office of Peter Behrens,

7
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,350
when the AEG factory was being designed.

8
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:49,020
And, yet, Mies was much more experimental than either Gropius or Behrens.

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:58,070
We have photographs of Mies in Behrens's office constructing models of glass skyscrapers and

10
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:05,040
then holding those models against the window in Behrens's office and twisting and turning

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,560
them to study and experiment with the reflective and refractive qualities of the tall glass

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,120
building-- kind of amazing moment in architecture.

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,560
Mies would continue these experiments in two projects for downtown Berlin-- one

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,869
on the Friedrichstrasse and the other on Alexanderplatz.

15
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,610
In both of these projects, Mies was looking to see how new building types could be derived

16
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:41,299
that would respond more adequately to the visual potentials of steel and glass and this

17
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:45,660
continuingly emergent technology of steel and glass.

18
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,450
But it wasn't until 1954 in New York in his project for the Seagram Building

19
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,350
where these experiments were first realized in a commercial office tower.

20
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,320
The Seagram Building was the administrative headquarters of the Canadian distillery Seagram's,

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,080
and it was located on Park Avenue in downtown New York.

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,500
Though the site of course is very, very different from the AEG factory, Mies-- like Behrens--

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,670
wanted very much for his building to engage the city

24
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,569
and even confront the city-- confront the city

25
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:27,030
with the representational power of architecture in the overall urban fabric.

26
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,150
Mies was not working on a corner as Behrens was in the AEG site.

27
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,600
He was working mid block.

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,150
So he confronted the city in a very different way.

29
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,330
He first sets the building back from the street line,

30
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,980
creating a fairly deep plaza in front of the building.

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,940
You don't actually see the Seagram Building as you're coming down Park Avenue.

32
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,770
You first see only the gap.

33
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,360
According to people that worked with Mies on the project,

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,720
that gap in the street line was very important for him.

35
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,310
It created a kind of anticipation, a kind of mystery.

36
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,160
But as soon as you enter that gap and turn 90 degrees,

37
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,190
the slab of the high-rise building confronts you

38
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,800
in a very, almost aggressively, frontal way.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,420
The building appears now almost as a pure surface.

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,550
It's a pure network of steel and glass.

41
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,270
So let's look more closely at that surface.

42
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,870
The first thing we realize is that while most steel and glass

43
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:38,769
buildings of the time articulate the frame and use the glass as a kind of contrasting

44
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,820
transparency to the opacity of the steel frame, in the

45
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,080
Seagram's case, the glass is bronzed, and the steel is bronzed,

46
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,890
and the effect of that homogeneous treatment of the two materials actually bring the materials

47
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,129
closer together.

48
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:01,860
Of course, you can still see the articulation of the frame against the glass, but it brings

49
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,549
the materials a little bit closer together.

50
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:13,370
It gives the glass, at certain angles, also, a kind of opacity rather than a transparency.

51
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:20,440
The essential thing to be expressed by a high-rise building in steel and glass, for Mies, is

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,680
the idea of structure.

53
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,290
Of course, the structure of the Seagram Building is based on a steel frame.

54
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,150
The issue is that because of American building code,

55
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,420
the steel cannot be exposed.

56
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,460
It cannot even be made visible.

57
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:45,930
The reason is that a steel frame, in the case of an accidental fire-- exposed steel runs

58
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,080
the risk of softening and failing structurally.

59
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,220
So building codes require that the steel frame be clad in an insulating material, usually

60
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,220
concrete.

61
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,500
And that's the case at Seagram.

62
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,919
Even though it's actually made of a steel frame,

63
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,640
the entire steel frame is encased in concrete.

64
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,979
So how then do you make the essence of the building, which is structure,

65
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,610
how do you make that visible?

66
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,490
Mies's solution is to add an additional steel I-section.

67
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,810
We call it an I-section because if you cut through the steel member, its section is shaped

68
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,080
like an "I."

69
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,340
And that I-section is laid in a plane in front of the glass.

70
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,820
It actually has no structural function whatsoever.

71
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,820
It is an ornament.

72
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,770
It's an architectural ornament.

73
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,110
And, yet, as an ornament, as a non-functional element,

74
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,450
it represents the structure even more emphatically-- if you

75
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,580
will-- than the structure itself.

76
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,750
It's a more true representation of the structure than the structure itself.

77
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,850
And this is a very, very interesting development in the idea of architectural ornament.

78
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:06,600
We're a long way from Semper's knot, but what is similar to Semper's knot, or the ornament

79
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,610
of Semper's weaving, is its representational function for what

80
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:18,810
is, in fact, a constructional and structural vocation.

81
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,759
This I-section in front of the glass is playing the role

82
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,340
that in architectural terms, we call a mullion.

83
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,389
And the series of mullions in front of the glass--

84
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:38,850
because of that one flat plane of the I-section-- actually creates a virtual plane that is parallel

85
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,210
to, but in front of, the glass itself.

86
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:49,819
Visually, also, under the right lighting conditions, the mullions cast a shadow on the glass in

87
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,330
a very, very similar way-- but a much more delicate way-- than the columns

88
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,050
in Behrens's AEG factory cast a shadow on the glass.

89
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:05,479
In Mies's case, because of the delicacy of the fabric, the effect that this has

90
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:12,539
is to prevent us, in a away, from measuring-- from calibrating-- the distance from that

91
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,950
virtual plane to the actual plane of glass.

92
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,389
And the visual effect of that, under the right lighting conditions, is a kind of oscillation

93
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,590
of the surface.

94
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:28,590
It's as if the surface has a kind of optical depth and an optical movement

95
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:36,540
or a kind of shimmering that belies the simplicity of the actual architectural elements of the

96
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,540
surface.

97
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,139
Despite the large amount of glass in the Seagram Building

98
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,710
and the thinness of the material, the Seagram nevertheless

99
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,000
has a kind of corporeality and a presence that's actually very, very dense.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,780
Now part of this is due to the proportions of the slab.

101
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,610
The sides of the slab have a sort of three to five ratio of width two frontality.

102
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,889
And that gives it a kind of chunkiness.

103
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:09,129
But, more important, the bronzing of the glass and the metal gives a totality to the surface

104
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,460
and a singularity to the surface that also contributes to the

105
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,980
visual weight.

106
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,610
The bronzing also does one more thing.

107
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,800
Bronze actually has a quality of aging.

108
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,850
And over time, rather than appearing more and more like a new building, the Seagram

109
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,419
has actually taken on an almost archaic quality.

110
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:37,550
Whereas Behrens used the resonance of his building with a Greek temple

111
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:48,660
to insert his building into a continuum of architecture as an art, Mies almost pushes

112
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:57,030
the associations back prior to Greece to some kind of ancient archaic slab that is older

113
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,440
than history itself, even as it's very much part of the present.

114
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,529
This haptic plane is completely abstract, but it still has a resonance with the architecture

115
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:13,650
of the past-- a grandeur in glass and steel, first begun by Peter Behrens.
