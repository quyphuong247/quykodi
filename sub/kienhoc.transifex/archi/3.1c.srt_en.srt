K. MICHAEL HAYS: In the earliest architecture, which is the symbolic,
https://youtu.be/zDh0F2K6-Q0
1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,670
Spirit is still trying to free itself in away from nature.

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,040
So architecture has to deal with nature.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,580
But it's very important for Hegel that the earliest architecture, the Tower

4
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,040
of Babel, but also he talks a lot about the pyramids,

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,290
it's very important that the pyramids are not natural,

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,870
but they're dealing with nature.

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,100
The pyramids for Hegel is architecture representing the Spirit

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,390
trying to free itself from nature.

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,680
So it's important that the pyramids are a very abstract form.

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,610
They don't mimic nature.

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,560
Now there are times when other ancient arts like Egyptian art,

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,280
think of the Sphinx, famously in a way confuses human forms with animal forms.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,310
And the Egyptians would often repeat them, have sort of a line of sphinxs

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,020
or a line of animal forms.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,510
Hegel sees this as a struggle of the Spirit,

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,290
trying to free itself from nature.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,390
So it repeats itself.

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,320
It's not certain.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,000
It can't come to a conclusion.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,850
And that's why you get repetition, but you also at its height,

21
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,300
you get abstraction.

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,840
Symbolic art does not directly express its spiritual content.

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,550
It rather points to it.

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,460
Therefore, it's symbolic it.

25
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,910
It indexes art.

26
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:34,070
In a way, spirit is still external to symbolic art.

27
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,310
It's also interesting that early architecture for Hegel

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,010
doesn't enclose volumes.

29
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,270
Now he does talk about the Ellora Caves of India, which is sort of, let's say,

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,980
late symbolic for Hegel.

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,640
In the Ellora Caves, architecture does start to enclose volumes.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,580
But it's important that early architecture, symbolic architecture,

33
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,570
for Hegel is really an object in space.

34
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,740
It's not a construction of volume.

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,630
So architecture doesn't enclose volume.

36
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,500
For Hegel the primary symbolic architectural act

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,440
is marking or assembling.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
And I think actually assemblage is important.

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,660
Because if you think about it, the sites of Egyptian architecture,

40
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,400
they're often--

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,090
it's an assemblage of very different and distinct objects.

42
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,750
So the symbolic architecture is the architecture of marking and assembling.
