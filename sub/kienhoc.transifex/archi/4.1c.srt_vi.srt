K. MICHAEL HAYS: Rossi spent his entire career thinking
https://youtu.be/qDBqsDjUTU0
1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,770
about the relationships between individual elements of architecture

2
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,550
and architecture as a discipline, the very beginnings of architecture

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,290
and the ends of architecture.

4
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,050
And he spent his career exploring the relationship

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,790
between architectural practice and the kind of everyday level and architecture

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,910
as a theoretical intellectual project.

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,410
He came to the conclusion that what he called the architectural type was

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,840
the beginning and the end of architecture,

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,750
but that the architectural type could never

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,080
be exhausted either by architectural practice or by architectural theory.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,430
That the type, this unavailable, but real object

12
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:02,130
that both generated and, sort of, became the reference for all of architecture

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,640
was itself inaccessible and inexhaustible.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,360
When Rossi thought about type, he was considering architecture

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,700
as its manifest in history in various examples

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,560
and, sort of, recurring patterns and recurring forms

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,390
that emerge at different times in history but seem correlated.

18
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,000
But he was also thinking about architecture in the city.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,530
For him, the architectural elements constitute the city.

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,620
But at the same time, the city is this, kind of, determinant matrix or fabrics

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,020
that bring the elements into being.

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,610
In his book "Architecture of the City,"

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,310
he emphasizes the continuity of these urban types.

24
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:53,360
He uses the word "permanences" to convey the sense of persistence

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,820
of types over time through various different kinds of uses.

26
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,330
One of the examples he gives is the Roman coliseum

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,300
at Lucca, which first of all, in medieval times

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,730
was used as a, kind of, quarry.

29
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,355
The stones from the Roman

30
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:11,240
coliseum were taken as spoils

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,250
to construct medieval churches,

32
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,760
and then it later became a market, and then later housing,

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,370
but, as you can see in the photograph, the diagram

34
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,660
or the "type" of the coliseum remains over all those functional changes.

35
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,250
This is an example of what Rossi calls a "propelling permanence."

36
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,510
The form remains, but it carries us through changes in history,

37
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,300
changes in function, and even changes in the way

38
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,720
that the coliseum is inhabited.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,750
In his own work, the idea of architectural type

40
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,970
and its relationship to city can best be seen in his most famous project, which

41
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,390
is a cemetery, the Cemetery of San Cataldo in Modena

42
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,080
for which he won the competition in 1971.

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,390
The site for the cemetery is exactly adjacent to an existing 19th-century

44
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,760
cemetery by Cesare Costa.

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,250
In between Rossi's cemetery and Costa's cemetery

46
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,270
is a much smaller Jewish cemetery,

47
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,070
and so the three cemeteries together make up this set.

48
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,140
Rossi's cemetery is almost exactly the same size and shape

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,700
as Costa's cemetery.

50
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,960
It's about 325 by 175 meters.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,780
It's surrounded by a two story wall, which

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,180
later was changed to three stories.

53
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,600
You can enter at either south gate or the north gate.

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,430
Along this north/south axis, Rossi's places

55
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,410
three distinct architectural types.

56
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,920
First of all, very like the monument of Cuneo, is a large cube:

57
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,672
a large empty -- Rossi even said, abandoned cube.

58
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:47,630
It doesn't have a roof.

59
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,190
It's open to the sky.

60
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,870
Rather than the strip windows or the narrow windows of Cuneo,

61
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,680
it now has these punched repetitive square windows.

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,190
There are no mullions, no frames to the windows.

63
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,520
If we continue along the axis, we confront another feature:

64
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,000
this triangular shape in plan, but consists

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,820
of vertical rectangular slabs that increase in height

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,430
as they decrease in width.

67
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,870
These would be the ossuaries, which would house the remains of the body,

68
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,870
and we can walk through those ossuaries along the axis

69
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,800
until we finally come to the third feature, which

70
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,410
is a large truncated cone.

71
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,700
The cone is higher than any of the other features.

72
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,420
The cube was intended by Rossi to be used for funeral ceremonies, but also

73
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,850
civil ceremonies.

74
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,870
As I said, the slabs were intended as ossuaries,

75
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,420
and then the top part of the cone is a chapel.

76
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,510
But then in a room, at the bottom part of the cone,

77
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,920
would be a place for the ashes, for the remains of the indigent.

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,360
Now this is an important feature.

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,520
If we compare this to the cemetery of Costa, certain contrast arise.

80
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,730
In the cemetery of Costa, which is typical of 19th-century

81
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,960
Italian cemeteries, usually in the center would be a chapel,

82
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,890
and this chapel would be where the remains of the upper-class families

83
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,820
would be buried.

84
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
Along the porticoes to the side of the chapel

85
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,220
would be for other, perhaps not noble families,

86
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,050
but other upper-class families,

87
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,710
and the indigent who may not have been even known

88
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,130
or who may not have had families would be placed in the earth.

89
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,880
But, of course, the earth, the graves of the earth filled up very, very quickly,

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,100
and it was allowed that, every eight years, the bones

91
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,760
could be taken out and put in a common grave.

92
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,930
So Rossi in a way has reversed that hierarchy.

93
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,200
The truncated cone, which is higher than any other feature,

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,780
now houses the remains of the indigent, and exactly along the axis,

95
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,730
along that central axis where previously the noble families and the upper class

96
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,150
would have been buried.

97
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,320
And I think that contrast is very intentional and very sharp.

98
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,320
The walls around the cemetery are very, very stark.

99
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,210
Again, they have openings without muntins or mullions or window frames.

100
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,620
It reminds you of some of the German architect Ludwig Hilberseimer work,

101
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,140
except that Rossi places a kind of sharply

102
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,270
steeply pitched triangular roof on top of these otherwise austere walls.

103
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,530
Rossi talks about the tops of Etruscan funerary urns,

104
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,820
which have a similar triangular shape.

105
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,560
So he's getting multiple references, references to Etruscan urns,

106
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,940
references to modern architecture, but also he's

107
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,670
making references to his own work.

108
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,600
Rossi compared the walls to his own housing project

109
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,420
called the Gallaratese just outside Milan,

110
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,170
and he makes the point that, in very, very early times,

111
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,280
the grave was just thought of as a kind of house for the dead,

112
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,190
or the tomb was thought of as a room for the dead.

113
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,900
So for him, this contrast between the housing of living bodies,

114
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,390
the housing of dead remains, is part of what

115
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,560
he means when he thinks of the cemetery as an "analogous city."

116
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,850
The graves are analogues of houses, houses for the dead.

117
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,781
The monuments are analogues of the permanent monuments

118
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:22,030
that would take place in a city, though in a city there

119
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,650
would be inhabited monuments.

120
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,480
So the cemetery is a city of the dead, but it's also

121
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,020
what Rossi calls an "analogous city."

122
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,080
In this aerial perspective, which Rossi uses

123
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,860
to show both the elevational perspective of the building

124
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,380
and also, at the same time, its plan, you can

125
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,290
see that that triangular feature in the middle

126
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,050
almost takes on the characteristics of a stepped pyramid.

127
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,620
It seems to be rising up from the ground.

128
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,400
And I think this reference somehow is--

129
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,740
there are other references that are to architecture

130
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,690
in its most primitive state.

131
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,780
I even think of Hegel who thought of the pyramid

132
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,880
as a very beginning of architecture,

133
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,610
and I can't imagine that this reference to Hegel

134
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,640
and to the beginnings of architecture is lost on Rossi.

135
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,340
Look at the way Rossi cast the shadows.

136
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,030
It's very interesting that he cast the shadows toward the viewer.

137
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,160
I think what he's thinking of here is something

138
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,830
that he referred to in his own essay on the French architect Étienne Boullée.

139
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,510
He's thinking about Boullée's own funerary architecture,

140
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,090
and he says, "It does not seem possible to me

141
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,350
to conceive anything sadder than a monument composed

142
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:44,560
of a smooth, naked and unadorned surface, of a light absorbent material,

143
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,820
absolutely bare of details, and of which the decoration is

144
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:57,020
formed by a composition of shadows, drawn by shadows still darker."

145
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,830
Look again, at Rossi's drawing, how dark the shadows are.

146
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,890
It's as if the shadows are the only inhabitants of the city.
