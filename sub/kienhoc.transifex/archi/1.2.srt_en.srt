PETER SEALY: Hello.
https://youtu.be/WFpTDOdWCic
1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,100
I'm Peter Sealy, and I'm a PhD student here

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,530
at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,340
Architects use several different kinds of drawings to represent buildings,

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,490
and we're going to look at several of those types right now.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,520
The first thing we have to understand is that all architectural drawings

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,020
are abstractions.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,030
No one single drawing can give a perfect picture or understanding of a building.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,570
As students and scholars and people interested in architecture,

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,450
we have to first remember that no one drawing can perfectly

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,790
represent or capture a building.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,280
When we look at the drawings that architects produce

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,880
or the drawings that are made of existing or projected buildings,

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,130
we have to, in our own mind, put them together.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,290
We take information from the different drawings.

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,647
In some ways, they're abstract representations of a real object.

16
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:52,480
And it's when we bring them together that we

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,140
can gain a greater understanding of what actually is going on in a building.

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,220
We'll begin with what we call the orthographic drawings.

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,710
They're called orthographic because they're orthogonal or perpendicular

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,640
to each other.

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,560
And these are the major drawings that are

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,560
made to represent buildings abstractly.

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,672
They are the plan, the section, and the elevation.

24
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,380
We're going to use the Villa Rotonda, which is a late Renaissance

25
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,140
villa designed by Andrea Palladio, which we can see here,

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,870
to discuss these different kinds of orthographic drawings,

27
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,940
and we're going to start with the plan.

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,240
Now, the plan is a horizontal cut through the building

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,880
that lets us see how the different rooms and spaces are arranged.

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,310
In general, you make the plan cut--

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,920
it's almost like you're slicing through the building at 1 meter 20 or around

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,975
four feet above the floor.

33
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:39,850
So we're not quite at the level of the floor.

34
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,480
We're a little bit higher.

35
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,950
And as we look at the plan that we now see has been cut,

36
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,000
we noticed how the area that's enclosed by the walls or by the columns

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,360
has been darkened.

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,810
There is a single line when we have a window,

39
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,870
and there's a solid infill when we have a solid wall.

40
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,020
So as we look at the plan, we can see how the different spaces connect

41
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,550
to each other, through which doorways we could move,

42
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,880
how we enter the building by going up the steps,

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,320
by turning left or turning right to go into a different space.

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,500
Looking again at the plan, we notice, as I've mentioned,

45
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,160
how these darker areas represent where we're cutting through a wall.

46
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,640
Lighter lines show us things that are below the plan cut.

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,250
So for instance, the tiling on the floor or the arrangement

48
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,110
of furniture, et cetera.

49
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,900
Sometimes we'll even use a dashed line to tell us

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,430
that something is going on ahead.

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,590
For instance, the shape of the dome that covers the central space.

52
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,756
The second of the orthographic projections is the section.

53
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:36,880
This is very similar to the plan, except this time we're cutting vertically

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,410
through the building.

55
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,437
Once again, the solid wall that's been cut through has been darkened.

56
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,770
And it's important to note that when you make a section,

57
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,020
you should never cut through a column because that'll

58
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,740
make it look like a wall, and you won't be able to tell the difference.

59
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,589
Once again, windows and doorways have been drawn with a single line

60
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:55,630
so we can see that it's actually possible to move

61
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,010
between spaces through there.

62
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,090
In general, you will cut a section on the most important axis

63
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,870
of the building.

64
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,120
So in this case with the Villa Rotonda, we've cut it right through the middle,

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,450
so you can see the different symmetries and massings that are at play,

66
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,320
and how the peripheral spaces relate to the main central space.

67
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,930
If you really want to properly describe a building,

68
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,840
it will take several sections to show us how

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,030
the different spaces relate in the major areas, the minor areas, et cetera.

70
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,880
The third of the orthographic drawings is the elevation.

71
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,250
This is similar to a section, except this time we're

72
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,530
cutting well in front of the building.

73
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,290
And sometimes on elevations, they show the ground being cut,

74
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,010
and other times it's more of just a line that the building's sitting upon.

75
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,650
Here, everything is drawn in the light line weight

76
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,070
because nothing is being cut, except for perhaps the ground.

77
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,310
The elevation is particularly useful for seeing how the facade has

78
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,120
been composed by the architect.
