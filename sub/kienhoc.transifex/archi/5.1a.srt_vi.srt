ANTOINE PICON: Tôi là Antoine Picon.

2
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,760
I'm the G. Ware Travelstead Professor of the History of Architecture

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,300
and Technology at Harvard's Graduate School of Design,

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,189
where I teach classes in the history of architecture, urbanism, and technology.

5
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,640
Few buildings have marked as important a moment in the history of architecture

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,530
as the Crystal Palace.

7
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,920
Not only was the building emblematic of a new way to build,

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,490
using iron at a scale unprecedented, it was also a major turning point

9
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,110
in terms of its use since it hosted the first world fair

10
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,930
and introduced a whole new spatial experience.

11
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,140
The revolutionary nature of the building was immediately

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,240
felt by the contemporaries.

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,740
Not only was the building immense, but it introduced the public

14
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,940
to the new realm of merchandise, to this capitalist world full of wonders.

15
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,190
As some critics of the time wrote, the building

16
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,420
"seemed as large as the entire planet."

17
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,790
This class is about the changes brought by the first Industrial Revolution

18
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,100
to architecture, both to the production of buildings and to their use.

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,470
As we will see, the Crystal Palace is, indeed,

20
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:48,050
emblematic of major changes in construction with the adoption of iron,

21
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,640
as well as in the perception of architecture.

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,710
To understand the scope of the changes brought by the Crystal Palace,

23
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,540
it's necessary to say a few words on the progress of iron construction.

24
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,140
Of course, iron had been known for thousands of years,

25
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,199
but its use at a massive scale in construction

26
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,230
really started at the end of the 18th century.

27
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,660
In 1779, was, for instance, constructed the first bridge entirely

28
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,290
in cast iron in Coalbrookdale in England.

29
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,910
Later, iron would develop both in very utilitarian construction

30
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,220
like bridges, but also in more pleasurable venues,

31
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,660
such as greenhouses.

32
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,600
As we will see, greenhouses have an intimate link

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,880
with the conception of the Crystal Palace.

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,710
Here we have the interior of Kew Garden greenhouse by Richard Turner.

35
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,570
Today we find the use of iron totally normal in construction.

36
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,440
We tend to forget, by the same token, that this was not

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,690
the case prior to the 18th century.

38
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,790
Iron was used mainly for machines, for guns, for cannons, but certainly

39
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,800
not in the very large quantities required by iron construction.

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,880
The modern story of iron in buildings and infrastructure

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,000
really begins during the second half of the 18th century.

42
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,020
The Crystal Palace was built to host the first Great

43
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,040
Exhibition that opened in 1851.

44
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,410
The Great Exhibition was unique because it was

45
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,540
the first worldwide show of that size.

46
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,080
But it was actually rooted in a longer tradition that

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,270
really started in the 18th century with a greater and greater interest taken

48
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,870
in technology by all European elites.

49
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,150
The Encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert

50
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,300
was typical of these interests for technology in general,

51
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,930
with its very minute description of fabrication,

52
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,970
like here, for example, pin making in an 18th-century factory.

53
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,760
This interest led the European elites to try

54
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,470
to organize exhibitions showcasing the industrial production

55
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,510
of their respective countries.

56
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,620
The ambition to showcase the products of national industry

57
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,740
was especially pronounced in France.

58
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,480
In 1798, the first exhibition was organized in Paris

59
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,440
and, later on, exhibitions of that type were regularly

60
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,930
organized in the French capital.

61
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,230
The last one of these exhibitions, the one preceding immediately

62
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,400
the Great Exhibition of 1851, was a pretty massive endeavor

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,080
hosted in a large temporary construction near the Invalides right

64
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,910
in the middle of Paris.

65
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,340
At the time, the term "industry" actually

66
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,310
did not cover only manufacturing, but also all the human activities related

67
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,630
to technology.

68
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,680
Also noticeable was the presence of agricultural products.

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,750
In 1849, for example, cattle was displayed along with machines.

70
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,970
So this related really to the 18th century sense of industry

71
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,060
as everything linked to the productive activities of man and not

72
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,760
only manufacture, as we know it today.

73
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,440
As we will see, this extended meaning will characterize still

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,600
the Great 1851 Exhibition.
