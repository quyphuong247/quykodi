K. MICHAEL HAYS: The late 20th-century architect Aldo Rossi
https://youtu.be/28RhEqf2hWI
1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,330
was very taken with this aphorism of Loos.

2
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,100
We can almost imagine Rossi presenting his own architecture

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,900
and making a similar claim.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,560
"That is architecture."

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,400
Let's take a look at a first project by Rossi.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,060
It's an unbuilt monument to the Italian partisans.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,750
These were the fighters who were against the fascist government

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,630
in Germany and also the fascist government in Italy

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,540
and against the sort of axis that brought Italy

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,180
into contact with the Nazis.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,660
It's in a little town called Cuneo, which is in the northern part of Italy.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,640
It's a cube, 12 meters, open to the sky, and it

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,150
has these very steep steps ascending up into what is a relatively small room.

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,990
It has the effect of being thought of as a kind of urban room,

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,690
because it's situated at the edge of the city in a very

16
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,420
precise relationship to a piazza.

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,150
When you see the elevation, the first thing you notice

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,440
is a blank surface, which is held by very, very thin corners of concrete--

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,010
so thin that the surface appears to be floating

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,850
and the steps ascend up behind the surface.

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,420
As you move into the room, first onto the steps,

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,960
there's an almost oppressive weight of this giant 12 meter cube hovering over

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,680
you.

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,220
But then when you get to the room, though it's relatively small,

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,630
it opens up to the sky.

26
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,830
There's no roof.

27
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,090
And at first, the perception would be that you only see the sky.

28
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,610
And then you notice a very small, very narrow sort of strip of a window.

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,230
And because of the way the cube is sited in the city, at the edge of the city,

30
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,120
the window looks out onto the fields and into these spectacular mountains

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,130
just outside of Cuneo which in a way is the territory that the partisans were

32
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,085
fighting for.

33
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:16,220
Like Loos's mound, Rossi's monument has a lot of sensuous associations.

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,960
It's a very intense experience of ascent, enclosure, and then view.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,430
There are other encrustations or associations.

36
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:30,040
There are many, many references to modern architects like Loos himself,

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,250
like Giuseppe Terragni, like Le Corbusier that someone

38
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,400
familiar with architectural history would also notice these references.

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,190
But again, like Loos, the real object, which Rossi

40
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,530
called an architectural type--

41
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,010
the real object withdraws from our experience.
