ERIKA NAGINSKI: My name is Erika Naginski.

2
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,670
I am Professor of Architectural History at the Graduate School of Design

3
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,449
and the Director of the PhD program in Architecture, Landscape Architecture,

4
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:26,990
and Urbanism.

5
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,500
Today, we're going to be talking about the relationship of a book that

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,690
was published in 1949 by Rudolf Wittkower entitled "Architectural

7
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,340
Principles in the Age of Humanism" and its characterization of the Renaissance

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,450
architect.

9
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,980
As we'll see, this is a book that had an extraordinary impact

10
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,320
on two distinct groups.

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,640
The first was the Renaissance architectural historian.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,670
This book offered a new approach to the way

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,920
we understand the architecture of the 15th and the 16th century in Italy.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,550
The other group was the modernist architect.

15
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,400
It is strange to think that a book on the Renaissance

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,270
might have an impact on modernist thinking,

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,240
but this book revolutionized our understanding of geometry,

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,940
modular pattern, and the ways in which diagrams can be used

19
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,060
to explain the work of the architect.

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,740
Two things to say about this book.

21
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,190
The first is that it was highly invested in an abstract and intellectual

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,290
approach to the Renaissance.

23
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,270
It underscored the rise of theory in the 15th and 16th century,

24
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,600
and the ways in which the works of a given architect

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,740
might offer a coherent kind of investigation

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,070
into a set of problems surrounding perspective, proportion, geometry,

27
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,670
and the advent of ideal form and architecture.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,419
This highly abstract approach had repercussions.

29
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,760
What it means, ironically, is that Wittkower was absolutely disinvested

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,830
from the complexities of history.

31
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,410
He was not interested in the cultural context

32
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,530
out of which architecture arose.

33
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,200
He does not delve into patronage, religious history, the monastic orders,

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,560
particular events that might have marked the Renaissance.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,420
Instead, he steps back to analyze architectural form

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,240
as an autonomous project.

37
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,500
At the heart of this approach is the notion of the paradigm.

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,560
The word paradigm comes from the Greek.

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,290
It means both pattern and to show side-by-side.

40
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,840
In the latter definition, really get a sense

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,080
of a comparative approach, that to put two things

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,190
together means essentially the creation of a synthesis.

43
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,690
So the word ultimately serves to underscore the creation

44
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,350
of an outstanding example of something.

45
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:18,010
Of a model, a standard, an epitome, an ideal, a paragon.

46
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,640
The assumption on Wittkower's part is that Renaissance architects

47
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,380
were after such paradigms, that they sought and developed them,

48
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,060
and ultimately, through that process, were after the core principles

49
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,710
of architectural form.

50
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,340
By the same token, what's also true is that Wittkower's very own approach

51
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,590
became paradigmatic.

52
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,530
In other words, it offered a standard means

53
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:50,350
of approaching the historical past, of interpreting the past, and even

54
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,280
of generating form itself.

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,530
How do we understand this book?

56
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,710
Is it an interpretation of Renaissance architecture?

57
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,480
Is it a template for modernist architectural thinking?

58
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,110
What we can say is that Wittkower's is a broad attempt

59
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,260
to characterize the theory of architecture

60
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,959
as it emerged in the 15th and 16th century in a distinct set of places.

61
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,890
In Florence, in Rome, and in Venice.

62
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,340
Furthermore, the book is broken up into four chapters

63
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,020
that deal with issues that Wittkower took to be absolutely fundamental.

64
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,900
First, there is the question of symbolism.

65
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,960
In other words, how buildings mean.

66
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,740
The second chapter looks at the problem of the appropriation of form.

67
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,860
In other words, how did architects look back

68
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,070
to the deep past, and in particular, to the pagan classical past,

69
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,480
seize that tradition, reinterpret in syntax

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,450
and reinvent classicism as a system.

71
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,730
Third, the question of typology and the development of building types.

72
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,290
Are we talking about churches?

73
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,170
Are we talking about villas?

74
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,270
Are we talking about institutional buildings?

75
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,540
And lastly, the question of proportion.

76
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,520
The geometric ideal.

77
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,470
The question of measure.

78
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,430
And while any number of architects, buildings, texts

79
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,510
are invoked in his book, it's also clear that there are essentially

80
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,220
two key players in his narrative.

81
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,600
The first we'll talk about today is Alberti, a theorist and an architect.

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,960
A real Renaissance man.

83
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,270
He was also a painter.

84
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,180
And second, a Venetian architect from the 16th century named Andrea Palladio.

85
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,410
These two figures essentially represent the whole

86
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,500
of the Italian Renaissance for Wittkower,

87
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,580
and when we think about that, we understand that Wittkower's approach

88
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,220
was essentially reductive.

89
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,990
What might we expect the historian to garner

90
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,940
from a picture of the Renaissance architect or the buildings

91
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,590
that he erected?

92
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,750
We might assume that the historian would be after a history of patronage,

93
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,730
for example.

94
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,630
A history of the politics that gave rise to a particular commission.

95
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,640
Who would consider the great events that marked the 15th and 16th century.

96
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,920
Changes in military technology.

97
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,630
Also, the question of politics or religion during this period.

98
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,820
The influence of the papacy.

99
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,940
The rise of ducal states and their sense of an autonomy from the papacy.

100
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,590
All of these are left out of Wittkower's narrative.

101
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:45,470
To read Wittkower is to see a process of mental abstraction at work.

102
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,560
In other words, what Wittkower was after wasn't

103
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,370
the discrete cultural meaning of a particular building

104
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,000
in a particular context.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,760
He's not after giving us some real and robust sense of the 16th century world

106
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,900
view.

107
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,910
Instead, he wants to bring together the classical kit of parts

108
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,880
that make a building formalize itself, that

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,680
allow it to transform into the buildings we still have today.

110
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,310
In other words, Wittkower is looking for a kind of deep structure,

111
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,660
we might call it, that organizes architectural form.

112
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,230
He's going after the identification of their component parts.

113
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,310
What is a portico?

114
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,510
What is a column?

115
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:32,510
This is why ultimately, he relies on diagrams to explain architecture.

116
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,050
He looks through the complex appearance of a building like this

117
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,050
in all its three-dimensionality and distills it

118
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,300
into its most basic elements through plan, sometimes elevation.

119
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,470
In other words, he develops a syntax, a language, a form.

120
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,190
He's interested in Renaissance architecture as an explicitly--

121
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,540
and these are his words--

122
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,980
as an explicitly "mathematical science which worked with spatial units."

123
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,970
Wittkower's whole analysis along these lines

124
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:08,000
can be understood as a philosophical exercise, not an historical analysis.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,080
In which thinking and reason emerge as the defining

126
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,020
characteristics of the architect.

127
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,810
And this is what's demonstrated through the diagrams.

128
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,370
Ultimately, what emerges from this is the autonomy of architecture itself.

129
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,240
And we see this when we look at what his diagram of the Villa Cornaro does.

130
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,160
You can see that he's interested only in the plan.

131
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,429
He cuts away the rear monumental staircase.

132
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:40,250
He minimizes and essentially elides the entrance porch, takes away the column,

133
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,789
and therefore anything that might signify a supportive function.

134
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,440
He takes away the side wings.

135
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,230
He takes away the poche, the scale, everything, in other words,

136
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,030
that Palladio indicates in his plan and elevation.

137
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,090
We want to think about how these diagrams give us

138
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,880
a certain highly particular view of the Renaissance, which privileges geometry,

139
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,130
all the way from its basic spatial units to the general order given

140
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,880
to the universe by God.
