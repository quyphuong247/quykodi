K. MICHAEL HAYS: We begin with an aphorism by the Viennese 20th-century

2
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,920
architect Adolf Loos. Loos writes, "If we find a mound six feet long and three

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,200
feet wide in the forests, formed into a pyramid, shaped by a shovel,

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,840
we become serious and something says, 'someone lies buried here.'

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,370
That is architecture."

6
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,170
Now, there are several things to attend to in that little passage.

7
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,440
First of all, it seems to be a sort of unprepared encounter.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,280
We come upon a mound in the forest.

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,850
But immediately, we see that the mound has been shaped.

10
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,150
Someone has constructed it, and someone has constructed it

11
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,470
into the shape of a pyramid.

12
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,610
The mound is not actually a pyramid.

13
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,790
The pyramid is something that we have to construct

14
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,370
in the architectural imagination.

15
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,320
But someone has given us markers.

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,170
They've indexed the act of construction.

17
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,050
Loos says, "It's been shaped by a shovel."

18
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,070
So there are tools involved with the construction.

19
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,120
The tools indicate that there's a craft involved-- there's technique involved.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,890
So we have an encounter that involves the architectural imagination,

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,630
constructing a genre or a type, which is the pyramid-- this particular kind

22
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,770
of construction,

23
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,680
and we have craft or technique involved.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,410
But the shape of the mound, and what we call

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,820
its indexicality-- that is, it's marking the fact that it's constructed--

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,080
and all these other features that Loos recounts,

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,420
those are associated features.

28
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,390
Those are sort of part of the sensuous experience.

29
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,860
They're really sort of encrustations to the real object,

30
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,820
which is a tomb or a pyramid or a grave of some sort.

31
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,410
Then Loos says we become serious.

32
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,730
This is important.

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,120
The consequence of the encounter is, first of all, an architectural affect.

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,600
We become serious.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,560
The mound, the shape of the mound, the appearance of the mount,

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,550
has affected us.

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,170
All these encrusted features have an architectural affect,

38
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,840
and, only then, do we conceptualize.

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,370
Only then, do we theorize someone lies buried here,

40
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,360
and the summation of that encounter is the conclusion:

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,670
"That is architecture."

42
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,255
Now, what is the "that"?

43
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:57,100
The "that," which is architecture, is not the actual experience.

44
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,020
The sensual experience has an effect, but the "that,"

45
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,860
which is architecture-- the real object of that is withdrawn.

46
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,090
It's inaccessible.

47
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,500
We don't actually experience the "that."

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,590
The real object of architecture is autonomous from my encounter with it.

49
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,140
The sensuous object is part of the encounter.

50
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,260
The sensuous qualities inhabit the encounter.

51
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,220
We can understand this:

52
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,890
if I close my eyes, the sensual object vaporizes, evaporates,

53
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,800
but the real object, the "that," which is architecture, is still there.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,300
It has its own autonomy, its own identity separate from the encounter.
