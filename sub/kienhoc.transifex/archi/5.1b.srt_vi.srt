ANTOINE PICON: 1849 provided the incentive
https://youtu.be/uTba-dFC6Ao
1
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,000
for the organization of the Great Exhibition held

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,880
in London a couple of years later.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,960
Indeed, Great Britain was, at the time, the most advanced country

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,230
technologically, but also in economic terms.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,990
So how could it be that England had not organized an exhibition of this type?

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,170
The idea was actually taken by a small group

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,300
of people belonging to the Royal Society of Arts, a company that

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,530
had been created in the 18th century and had been revitalized

9
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,480
by the presence of Prince Albert, who had become president of the society.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,280
Here we have a painting depicting the main protagonist of the organization

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,110
of the 1851 exhibition.

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,280
In the center, we have actually Prince Albert sitting

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,300
and the people pointing a finger towards the paper in front of the prince

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,360
is actually Joseph Paxton, of whom a bit later.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,520
So...it's in the middle of the society that this idea

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,700
to organize something at a much larger scale than what

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,130
had been done before gradually emerged.

18
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,610
So first, one had to find a land where to hold the exhibition,

19
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,370
and Prince Albert actually secured the temporary loan of part of Hyde Park

20
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,340
as the place where the exhibition could take place.

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,280
Other members of the society were extremely active

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,160
securing promises of artifacts to be displayed.

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,790
The secretary of the society toured the United Kingdom,

24
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,565
visiting industrialists in order to obtain those promises.

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,610
What was gradually emerging was a very large project.

26
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:03,700
Overall, the estimation was that something like 800,000 square feet

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,480
would be necessary to host the entire exhibition.

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,060
Hence, the idea to call for a proposal for a very large building

29
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:20,080
in order to be able to shelter all the artifacts that would be displayed.

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,210
A committee was formed and asked for proposals to architects

31
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,680
all over Europe.

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,360
The call was issued in March 1850, and a couple of months

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,580
later some 230 proposals were received, most of them

34
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,240
from the United Kingdom and France.

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,500
Two proposals were especially noticed: the first one

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,670
by a French architect, Hector Horeau, a kind of gigantic

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,380
shed very much like a railway station; the second one

38
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,850
from Richard Turner, an engineer who had recently realized the Kew Garden

39
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,460
greenhouse.

40
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,790
Both proposals were admired for their qualities.

41
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,350
They were both, actually, proposing a single building, something that

42
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,450
would be retained by the committee.

43
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,120
In the case of Horeau, this inspiration

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,800
would later lead him to his utopian project for covering the Grands Boulevards

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,590
in Paris with iron sheds.

46
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,820
We can see there the genealogy between the world of the "passage,"

47
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,810
the Great Exhibition, and subsequent development in an urban iron

48
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,180
construction proposal.

49
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,790
The some 230 proposals for the Great Exhibition buildings

50
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,300
were exhibited in London in the Institute

51
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,290
of Civil Engineers in June 1850.

52
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,120
From those proposals, especially from the two most noticed ones--

53
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,180
the Hector Horeau and the Richard Turner ones--

54
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,800
the committee drew a number of conclusions.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,670
The first one was that instead of conceiving

56
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,760
a series of separate buildings, it was probably

57
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,570
much better to imagine a single building which

58
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,530
would give more flexibility, a flexibility all the more needed

59
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,130
that the definitive organization of the exhibition

60
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:21,269
was not yet known, especially since all the loans had not yet been secured.

61
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:28,070
Another idea, related to the single building choice,

62
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,320
was to conceive it in a modular way.

63
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,540
And this is where the idea of a module of 24 feet

64
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,410
began to emerge as probably the most convenient choice.

65
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,620
The committee had a number of architects and engineers,

66
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,510
and since no proposals had been deemed completely satisfactory,

67
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,430
the architects and engineers of the committee

68
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,740
decided to design their own proposal following these general choices:

69
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,240
single building, a grid on a 24-feet module.

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,770
The result was actually a pretty horrendous proposal made of brick

71
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,780
with a giant dome that would have dwarfed the St. Peter's one, but which

72
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,300
proved not only ugly in the eyes of the public but also highly problematic

73
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,480
since it entailed a massive production of bricks

74
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,750
that would have then to be demolished.

75
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,580
At this stage, the organizers began to doubt that they would ever

76
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,770
be able to organize the exhibition.

77
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,440
Not only...was the scheme completely impractical, but the money to build it

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,660
seemed difficult to secure.

79
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,030
The public, in addition, was growing more

80
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,830
and more skeptical about the idea because of the images

81
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,520
that had been shown in the press, such as this one.

82
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,970
Prince Albert itself was beginning to despair.

83
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,310
This is where Joseph Paxton comes into play as, in some ways,

84
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,010
the savior, a kind of superhero like Superman,

85
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,470
who is going to really redeem the situation

86
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,440
and transform what was a path towards failure

87
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,680
into one of the greatest achievements of the early 1850s.
