K. MICHAEL HAYS: Scholars following Hegel often

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,140
insist that Hegel closed the door on art prematurely,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,150
and it's rather that each epoch has to make its own decision as to what

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,730
the function of its art will be.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,750
So let's say it's an open question whether art can continue,

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,100
in our own time, its vocation of giving appearance

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,490
to our distinctively human values.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,800
In any case, what we want to keep from Hegel

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,560
is, first, that the importance of architecture

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,690
is not just its aesthetics but its deep historicity--

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,660
by that, I mean the felt fact of architecture existing in time as well

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,020
as in space.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,050
And second is Hegel's placement of architecture at the center of human

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,370
existence, not as the work of isolated individuals--

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,210
though he knew they were architects, and he knew there were individual

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,200
builders--

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,489
but he placed the work of architecture at the center of existence

18
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,200
as a work of what he called the "Spirit," which, for us, means

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,570
of the community, of the collective.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,870
Now, making much more modest claims, we want

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,600
to look at the work of a modern architect who

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,770
shares Hegel's understanding that architecture

23
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,330
is one of the fundamental postulates of our existence in the world,

24
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,720
of the way we are being in the world, and a central medium

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,670
of human thought and human memory.

26
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,170
For Aldo Rossi, architecture in our own time

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,120
must struggle with this lack of meaning, with this pastness

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,340
to which Hegel condemned architecture.

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,760
But in Rossi's work, there's also the suggestion

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:57,440
that the challenge of architecture's origin is not just behind us, that--

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,600
as Hegel insisted-- but that architecture

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,300
is finding its origin again and again, that it has to constantly

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,610
be re-enacted, that it has to constantly be reimagined,

34
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,730
and that architecture is constantly beginning again.
