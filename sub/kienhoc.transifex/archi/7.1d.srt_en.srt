K. MICHAEL HAYS: After Le Corbusier had been able to develop and refine some of the attributes of the Dom-ino
https://youtu.be/TvXRdISin-g
1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,890
system in the actual villas, he was ready to issue what, for him, was the first programmatic

2
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,070
manifesto of the "new architecture."

3
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,120
He called it "The Five Points of a New Architecture."

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,100
For polemical reasons, he suggested that "The Five Points of the New Architecture" would

5
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,800
be a universally applicable language of the new architecture.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,649
And that it was the logical outcome and the correct use of both available technologies

7
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,810
of construction, like the concrete frame,

8
00:00:51,810 --> 00:01:01,079
and, at the same time, a vocabulary that provided what he called the "spiritual needs," to supplement

9
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,890
those technical needs.

10
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,280
The manifesto "The Five Points of the New Architecture" was promotional.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,750
It was intended to familiarize a lay public, an international public, with the ideas underlying

12
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,390
this new architecture.

13
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,970
The five points, or principles, they are at once technical and architectural.

14
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:34,640
And they are: the pilotis, the roof garden, the free plan, the ribbon window, and the

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,740
free facade.

16
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,550
The pilotis are the columns that derive from the columns in the Dom-ino system that support

17
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,310
the horizontal slabs and that raise the building above the ground.

18
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,780
By the time he's developed the pilotis in the villas, he's more and more interested

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,250
in using the pilotis to lift the building up off the ground.

20
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:11,239
The piloti, in that way, is a reversal of either of a classical podium, which anchors

21
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,140
the building to the earth.

22
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,520
But it's also the reversal of traditional domestic basements that were regarded by

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,500
Le Corbusier as dank and unhealthy.

24
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,950
At the same time the pilotis accepts the European convention of the "piano nobile," the noble

25
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,560
floor, the main floor.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,900
The main floor which is one floor above the ground.

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:40,670
And then also the pilotis has implications for the sectional distribution of occupation,

28
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,230
even at the urban scale.

29
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:48,219
Corbusier imagined that, out of the house, is an idea of raising the spaces of occupation

30
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,900
above one floor.

31
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:57,680
And leaving the ground open for recreation, circulation, transportation, collectively

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,739
available.

33
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:05,200
That understood, urbanistically, this would actually imply a new, more democratic space.

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:15,700
An opening, an availability of the surface of the earth for spontaneous and varied uses.

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,290
In the same way, raising the building on pilotis replaces the basement.

36
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,810
The roof terrace, or the garden on the roof, replaces the pitched roof and the attic with

37
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,730
an open air room.

38
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:37,200
Reinforced concrete made each floor plate structurally homogeneous.

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,170
So that the top floor plate, the roof, was just as strong as the floors.

40
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:50,910
No single feature of Le Corbusier's work better summarizes his conviction about the healing quality of

41
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,689
the house itself than the roof garden.

42
00:03:53,689 --> 00:04:00,609
On the roof garden, there was a regenerative inspiring forces and powers of this hygienic

43
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,629
exposure of the body to the sun.

44
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:10,879
The roof terrace recalls preindustrial life, which was lived more outside, and for Le Corbusier

45
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,319
would then be more healthy.

46
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,690
But it also suggests the hygienic pleasures of relaxation and traveling on the ocean liner,

47
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,400
itself one of modernism's object-type.

48
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,800
By freeing the columnar structure from the interior partitions which enclose the program,

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,669
Le Corbusier created the free plan.

50
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:39,610
The free plan is opposed by Corbusier to what he calls the "paralyzed plan."

51
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,890
The paralyzed plan is a plan of rooms:

52
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:50,009
each one discrete from the other, created by walls that are themselves load bearing.

53
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,900
Load bearing walls means that the rooms have to be of a certain size and a certain shape.

54
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,569
They have to be entered through doors and punctured by small windows.

55
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:08,280
The free plan allows a much more open arrangement and size of space and an interpenetration of

56
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,000
spaces one into the other.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,280
The separation of space and structure, or structure and the partitions that enclose

58
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,840
space, also enabled an articulation of a vocabulary of formal plastic relationships.

59
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,460
These, what are called earlier, "pictorial elements" that animated visually as well as

60
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,770
spatially the open free plan.

61
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:40,759
This is the moment when the technical conditions of the Dom-ino diagram, which change a building's

62
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:47,199
structural solution and constructional methods, actually have an effect that is ultimately

63
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,159
not about technology at all,

64
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:54,800
but rather about new possibilities of space, new possibilities of form, that now can be

65
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,760
explored sculpturally, architecturally, as well as programmatically.

66
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,919
The fourth of the five points is the ribbon window, or elongated window.

67
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,949
The ribbon window is, in a way, a corollary of the free facade.

68
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:17,759
It's a window that can be cut into a wall, because the wall is not load bearing.

69
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:26,080
But it also, as a device, negates the aedicular window, the framing window, which is about

70
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,850
one individual positioning himself in a vertical rectangle.

71
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,270
The ribbon window is a collective window.

72
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:40,669
It's not an individual window, and it's also not a window that stabilizes at one point

73
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:41,699
perspective.

74
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,689
It's rather a window that produces a panorama.

75
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:50,930
It's almost like a cinematic version of a window, rather than a painterly version of

76
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,930
a window.

77
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,650
We can think of the ribbon window as being an analog of a tracking shot in a movie.

78
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,780
Le Corbusier insisted that, though it was developed for domestic use, it could become

79
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:09,439
a standardized, mechanized, mass-produced element for all types of buildings.

80
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,730
Finally, the fifth point, the free facade.

81
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:21,730
The free facade establishes the compositional pictorial availability of the surface wall--

82
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:27,080
even as it also allows the thinness of that wall to be more membrane-like:

83
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:34,650
a kind of thinner wrapper that encloses the building and emphasizes the volumetric qualities

84
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:41,949
that were so important for Le Corbusier over the static compression structural qualities.

85
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:48,159
The wall becomes a light membrane that allows the window to be extended without interruption.

86
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:54,280
But it also allows other kinds of openings to be much more varied and to be composed

87
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,470
geometrically and visually, rather than being determined constructionally or structurally.
