K. MICHAEL HAYS: Peter Behrens's AEG turbine factory is a remarkable transcription of Gottfried
https://youtu.be/T89-68lxdp8
1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,380
Semper's theory of the primitive hut into a monumental contemporary

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,730
building.

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:30,180
Like Semper, Behrens starts with what is really a kind of social but also technological device

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,920
that is at the heart of the architectural program.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,970
Where Semper started with fire, Behrens starts with the turbine engine

6
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,150
itself, this giant steam turbine, which would become the central source,

7
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,479
the primary source of power.

8
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,730
That turbine has to be contained, has to be housed.

9
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,530
Like Semper, he starts with the base.

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,640
It's a remarkably high base that runs around the entire building.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,250
You can see the scale of this, both the base and the overall building,

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,670
by looking at these figures in the foreground relative to that concrete pad, or that concrete

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,670
base.

14
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,640
On this giant masonry base, Behrens then constructs a tectonic system

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,860
made of steel, a system of arches, 28 all together, that span an area of 25

16
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,860
by 130 meters.

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,970
And the arches rise up, again according to Semper's dictum, constructing

18
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,370
a skeleton that holds up the walls and the roof together.

19
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:40,140
Now this is different from a stone system or a trabeated system

20
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,170
where column and beam are understood as separate elements.

21
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:51,200
Behrens has constructed a tectonic system that's a kind of singular net of small metal

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,690
systems welded or bolted together.

23
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,920
However, he deviates from Semper in an important way.

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,510
At the very top edge of the factory, of the building,

25
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:10,590
just before it springs into its roof, Behrens added a very heavy steel girder that goes

26
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,980
the entire length of the building.

27
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,890
Now, that girder is brought out from the glass wall of the building

28
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,840
and, thereby, creates a very heavy shadow.

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,530
The heavy shadow, together with the depth of the beam,

30
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:31,690
makes the beam seem much, much heavier, denser, and deeper than it actually is.

31
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,280
Now, there's a big distinction between the tectonic system,

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,780
in Semper's term, which is a system made up of separate elements joined together

33
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,270
that work together in this kind of tensile net.

34
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,940
There's a difference between that and a trabeated system,

35
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,300
which is a system of columns and beams understood as separate and load-bearing

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,150
through compression.

37
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,209
What Behrens has done is use a tectonic system according to Semper's theory,

38
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,490
and, yet, he's made it appear like a trabeated system

39
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:13,150
because it's the trabeated system that has the corporeality and the visual density that

40
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,770
he thinks is required for this monumental building.

41
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,780
Behrens thought that the trabeated system, or the appearance

42
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,000
of the trabeation, would resonate with classical architecture

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,440
more than a tensile system.

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,050
A tensile system would appear too flimsy, too lightweight.

45
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,470
So he's getting the power of a trabeated colonnade, which

46
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,430
resonates with the Greek temple itself, but he's building

47
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,390
that now out of steel and glass.

48
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,520
Behren's second focus was where this tectonic system springs from the base.

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,000
It springs from the base in this giant hinge.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,270
Behrens focused a lot of his aesthetic compositional attention on that hinge.

51
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,910
The hinge is raised on the base.

52
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,810
It's almost as if it's a piece of sculpture on a podium.

53
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,170
The base comes almost to eye level, it's almost exactly at eye level.

54
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,750
So this giant hinge confronts you.

55
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,270
And the visual power of this metal hinge is almost

56
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,400
like an analog of the turbines inside.

57
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,949
Finally on this long facade is the glass.

58
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:27,159
Remember that Semper's theory is that the membrane, the wrapper,

59
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:31,080
would come from an idea of weaving.

60
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,210
This is where Behrens has used these enormous planes of glass.

61
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,659
And they're actually tilted slightly away from the base, tilted inward toward the building.

62
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:46,599
Part of this tilt then gives this visual weight to the column in the beam, but also it puts

63
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:51,349
the glass plane on display as a plane.

64
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,439
But the panes of glass here are very, very small,

65
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,509
and the mullions are very small, but they're very closely spaced.

66
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,469
The effect is that it looks like a weaving of glass and steel

67
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,159
according to Semper's dictum.

68
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:10,199
It's brittle, it has a tactility to it.

69
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,710
It has a kind of brittleness to the plane.

70
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,240
That tactility emphasizes again, the visual power of the glass.

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,659
As we move now to the front of the building, we see a slightly different aesthetic at work.

72
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:34,529
First of all, it's at the front of the building that we see the contours of this giant barrel

73
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:37,669
roof, or, actually, a kind of segmented barrel roof.

74
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,999
Now, that roof has a lot of volume.

75
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:43,580
That volume is not needed functionally.

76
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,669
That volume is not used by any of the equipment of the factory.

77
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:51,930
It's simply that Behrens wanted that contour, that silhouette

78
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,159
seen against the sky to convey this sort of representational power

79
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,639
of the building.

80
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,849
It's like a frontispiece.

81
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:01,740
It's like a temple front.

82
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,539
Structurally it works slightly differently.

83
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:08,699
We have these giant concrete piers now that at first gloss

84
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,979
are bearing the weight of this big sort of barrel roof.

85
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:16,789
But, in contrast to that, these giant concrete piers

86
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:23,509
are set back from the edge of the roof so that even though at first gloss, they appear

87
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:30,669
to be load-bearing, at second gloss, it almost looks as if the glass front itself is bearing

88
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:31,669
the weight.

89
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:37,849
And it's that contradiction or that dialectic or that tension that gives the kind of visual

90
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,659
power of this facade.

91
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:48,550
Once again, it's this tactile haptic plane of glass, a kind of plane that you almost

92
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,710
touch with your eyes as it were.

93
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:58,020
It has a tactility, a visual tactility that really makes the glass as material

94
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,939
important, almost more important structurally or visually

95
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:10,580
load-bearing than the concrete piers themselves.

96
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,610
Translating Semper's theory into an architecture of steel, glass, and concrete, Behrens is

97
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,839
able to bring the building of the industrial factory

98
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,879
into the realm of architecture, capital "A," and even to compare the factory building with

99
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,039
the monumental tradition that begins with the Greek temple.
