K. MICHAEL HAYS: The architects Peter Behrens and Mies van der Rohe,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,980
in different ways, maintain deep connections

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,650
to the ongoing classical tradition in their new architecture of steel

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,490
and glass.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,850
They use classicism to tame technology in order

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,020
to give representation to the new corporations that arose

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,640
from technical and economic advances.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,659
But there are other ways of exercising aesthetic control over standardization

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,620
and mass production.

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,640
There are ways of producing architectural effects

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,890
with new technical means.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,350
We next look at a powerful example of how

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,190
new techniques of concrete construction supported

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,550
the pictorial and spatial elaborations of what

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:55,690
another modern architect, Le Corbusier, called his "machines for living."
