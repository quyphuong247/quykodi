K. MICHAEL HAYS: I'm going to give another example
https://youtu.be/3Ji3rVLi6MI
1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,440
of the architectural imagination at work.

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,360
There's a very famous study by an architecture historian

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,340
named Rudolf Wittkower called "Architectural

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,510
Principles in the Age of Humanism."

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,840
And it's a study of every villa that the Italian architect Andrea Palladio ever

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,620
built.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,930
So let's imagine that Wittkower went with the students.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,310
He probably visited all the villas in the northern part of Italy.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,660
He may have measured them.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,940
He and his students probably drew them.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,215
And what he began to realize is that the villas, as different as they were,

12
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:47,040
had some deep structural diagram in common, some geometrical ordering

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,530
system that was not always immediately apparent,

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:57,030
but was latent and could be discovered through this activity of measuring

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,620
and drawing.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,230
Some of the villas were simple farmhouses.

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,760
They were not decorated compared to the great urban villas in Italy.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,980
Others were lavishly decorated, both on the inside and on the exterior.

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,981
Wittkower didn't look at any of that.

20
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:15,480
Some of the villas were made of different material-- stucco.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,700
Some actually were made of more precious materials like stone.

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,680
Wittkower didn't see any of that.

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,530
All Wittkower cared about was this common diagram, this template.

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,890
And out of that template, he devised or he imagined the geometrical essence

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,180
of the Palladian villa.

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,650
And in his final diagram--

27
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,700
you can see it here--

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,950
he draws that diagram.

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,992
This is the architectural imagination at work.

30
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:45,260
There are several things we can get through this.

31
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,470
First of all, appearance is important.

32
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,860
Appearance, representation, but also something

33
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,870
deeper than surface appearance.

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,590
There's also a deeper diagrammatic structure.

35
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,360
Second of all, repetition is important.

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,600
Each of these villas have something in common,

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,710
but they're all variations on a single, common theme.

38
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:13,640
And third is the relationship between that template, that diagram,

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,300
and what we might want to call the architectural understanding,

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,920
how we understand that.

41
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,140
We can think of it this way.

42
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,540
When Wittkower draws that diagram and when we look at that diagram,

43
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,730
there's a kind of harmonious resonance.

44
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:35,180
There's a kind of vibration in our minds between that visual image and something

45
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,980
that we're starting to understand, some idea of a villa type,

46
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,320
that we're starting to understand.

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,670
And here is how the imagination, which we see in that diagram,

48
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:53,120
in that drawing, bridges the gap between the raw sense data of perception

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,050
and the architectural understanding itself.

50
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,460
Now we can be precise about the imagination.

51
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,710
It's one part of a three-part system.

52
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,610
At the lowest level, we might say, is our sensory experience--

53
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,080
our sight, our touch of the materials of a building.

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,600
Even maybe the sounds of the building, or maybe even the

55
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
smells of the stone and the stucco of the building.

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,830
But those arrive as raw sense data.

57
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,240
They're unencoded.

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,130
They're unprocessed.

59
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,000
And the understanding, which is at the highest level,

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,985
knows nothing of those raw sense data.

61
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:34,970
It has no way of scanning.

62
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,350
It has no way of matching up that sense data with anything

63
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,290
that the understanding can understand.

64
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,570
That's where the imagination comes in.

65
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,170
The imagination is the third thing that operates

66
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,360
in the space between the sense data and the perceptions of the building

67
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,910
and the architectural understanding.

68
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,070
And the work of the imagination, what it has the capacity to do, is schematize.

69
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,380
Remember that diagram of Wittkower.

70
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,400
He actually draws the deep structure of those villas

71
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,520
and that schematization, that deep structure--

72
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,950
that the understanding can scan.

73
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,519
The understanding has templates already available

74
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,510
that it can match to that geometrical schema.

75
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:27,170
Now, you might even want to say that because that schema is so rigorous

76
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,210
and because it is repeated, it has the appearance,

77
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,390
or it seems that it has universal validity.

78
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,250
And indeed, Wittkower thought that the Palladian diagram

79
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,090
did have universal validity.

80
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,710
We can think of it this way.

81
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,550
When the imagination presents its schema to the understanding,

82
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,920
it sets us on the path toward knowledge.

83
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,760
And whatever knowledge is, it will have something

84
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,400
to do with this interaction of the understanding and the imagination.

85
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,240
The important thing for us is that this is a specific kind

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,920
of architectural knowledge.

87
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,900
It comes from the experience of architectural sense data.

88
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,290
It's been schematized into an architectural diagram,

89
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,640
and the architectural understanding has scanned it.

90
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,010
In some ways, you might understand the imagination

91
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,120
and the understanding as opposed.

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,070
The imagination is temporal, the understanding is universal.

93
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,840
The imagination is multiple while the understanding is singular.

94
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,090
But the understanding is also passive.

95
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,720
It receives the imagination's input.

96
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,940
The imagination is active.

97
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:44,570
So we might say that the imagination organizes the sensuous manifold

98
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,990
according to organizing principles that can be received by the understanding.

99
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,740
And here we have the idea that architecture produces knowledge.
