K. MICHAEL HAYS: But there are times when the representational function

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,780
seems to fail, when the sheer difficulty of the context

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,980
seems to exceed the capacity of the architectural imagination

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,430
to provide a diagram for it.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,490
But perhaps to enact its own limits, to perform its own incapacity

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,170
to adequately or fully represent what is truly human

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,890
is architecture's most important function.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,980
Ultimately, maybe that's what the pyramids did.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,920
Maybe that's what the Gothic cathedral did.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,670
Maybe that's what the temple did.

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,000
