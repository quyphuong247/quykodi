00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,580
K. MICHAEL HAYS: We've begun in a fairly abstract way.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,390
But this is an important first step in our demonstration

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,910
that architecture is a mode of knowledge.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,730
When we normally consider architecture, we include its function or program.

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,740
We include its materials, and techniques of construction, and its context--

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,470
both the physical and the social context--

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,030
as well as its formal property or its aesthetics.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,410
And all these are legitimate and necessary considerations

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,150
to understand architecture.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,760
Architecture very much is in the world.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,390
Architecture resides in the common-sense world.

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,560
But to really focus on architecture as exceeding mere building,

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,040
we have to detach a portion of that common-sense world from the rest.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,090
And we need to establish some aesthetic distance from ordinary concerns.

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:04,030
And so we frame our thinking, and we exclude a lot of the common-sense world

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,460
as outside that focused frame.

17
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,190
And for just a time, we free architecture from its function,

18
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:18,100
but we also free ourselves from our own interests, and prejudices,

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,090
and expectations about architecture-- its function, its social role,

20
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,060
how it was physically built.

21
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,890
And we did this in our comparison of the Greek temple and the modern white

22
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,790
house.

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,690
We separated out even material considerations, considered

24
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,540
the patronage, in order to think of architecture as constructing

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,800
its own world within a world.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,080
And the world that it constructs cannot be reduced to mere purpose.

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,230
Now, this part of our model of the architectural imagination

28
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,130
borrows from the German philosopher Immanuel Kant.

29
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,620
In the late 18th century, Kant produced a foundational theory of aesthetics

30
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,470
that we still use today.

31
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,210
For him, our experience and our judgment of beauty--

32
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,350
our aesthetic judgment-- involves, as we've

33
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,430
seen, this resonance between the two cognitive powers of understanding,

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,470
on the one hand, and imagination on the other.

35
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:28,570
But that judgment of beauty does not depend on having a priori determinate

36
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,980
concepts.

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,970
It involves more feeling and affect.

38
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:39,130
And the affects of beauty are particular and subjective.

39
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,350
They are my feelings at this moment,

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,310
but, at the same time, they're nevertheless

41
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,630
endowed with a universality.

42
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,510
And the universality is not reducible to the laws of reason.

43
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,510
It's not reducible to the laws of morality, which

44
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,470
are the other two modes of knowledge.

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,360
Consideration of aesthetics is necessary as a third mode of knowledge

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,910
because the concept-driven fields of pure reason and practical morality

47
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,680
cannot account for all there is of human knowledge.

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,470
And of course, this is why Kant is important

49
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,500
if we want to show that architecture is a mode of knowledge,

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,130
or if we want to think of architecture as producing

51
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,980
conceptual frames for knowledge.

52
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,970
So we follow Kant in our attempt, then, to isolate examples of the particular

53
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,010
techniques of production-- like making diagrams, like making sketches--

54
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,100
and the particular modes of experience that are characteristic of architecture

55
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,090
and different from other sorts of practices, even other art practices.

56
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,710
For scholars of architecture influenced by Kant, like Panofsky and Wittkower,

57
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,220
whom we've seen, this particular productivity,

58
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,180
this particular architectural experience involves investigations

59
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,550
of geometry and proportion.

60
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,770
It's highly intellectual.

61
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,350
It's self-reflexive and recursive.

62
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,390
And it's very abstract.

63
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,780
In the next module, we want to look in more detail

64
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:20,529
at an example of Wittkower's practice of this Kant-inspired interpretation

65
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,580
of the project of architecture.
