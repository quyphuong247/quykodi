ERIKA NAGINSKI: This brings us to the last two churches in the sequence.
https://youtu.be/vzHJXk5Kqjk
1
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,090
Churches whose designs are, in fact, ones

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,950
that foreground the fact that columns are now entirely absent.

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,080
Remember Alberti's distinction with which

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,130
we began between the notion of a wall architecture--

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,230
in other words, an architecture that affirms the idea of structure

6
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,170
as opposed to the column, which for him, remains in the realm of the decorative.

7
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,990
This distinction prompts Wittkower to claim

8
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,460
that the complete absence of columns in the two churches that you see here--

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,640
San Sebastiano in Mantua, begun in 1460, and Sant'Andrea, also in Mantua,

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,950
begun in 1462--

11
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,950
that in these churches where columns are absent

12
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,129
signifies a kind of decisive turning point in Alberti's project,

13
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,150
in his interpretation of architecture writ large.

14
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,090
With this idea, with these words, Wittkower's actually

15
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,840
bringing us back to the terrain of syntax, of ratio of architecture in relation

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,730
to objectivity.

17
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,390
Now, both churches were commissioned by the same patron,

18
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,630
the ruler of Mantua, Ludovico Gonzaga.

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,370
They are slightly different.

20
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,630
In fact, San Sabastiano is a central planned church.

21
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,480
It's a votive church which was never completed, and what we see today

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,350
is heavily restored.

23
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,150
Sant'Andrea, by contrast, is far more complete.

24
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,260
And in both cases, unlike the Tempio in Rimini

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,470
and Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Alberti

26
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,960
was not faced with the problem of adapting

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,450
his designs to a preexisting structure.

28
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,360
In other words, this idea of inventing the church whole cloth

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,180
means that Wittkower can analyze the facades as theoretical solutions

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,180
to an architectural problem.

31
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,920
For Wittkower, the two facades coincide as well as stand

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,040
as kind of polar opposites of each other.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,760
On the one hand, if you look at them, the main proportions

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,440
are essentially the same.

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,130
Like Santa Maria Novella, the width corresponds

36
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,870
to the height from the level of the entrance to the apex of the pediment.

37
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,430
There's the enclosure within the square once more.

38
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,870
On the other hand, we have opposing conceptions of the facade here.

39
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:49,070
San Sebastiano underscores the presence of as much solid wall as possible.

40
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:54,080
It affirms the wall as principle, and this is the opposite of what we see

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,240
in Sant'Andrea where, besides the enormous and deeply recessed entrance,

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,380
the side bays have been broken up into three tiers of thresholds--

43
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,710
of doors, of niches, of windows.

44
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,750
Again, just as from the very beginning, the idea of the triumphal arch

45
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,240
motif as a solution to masking the two-story problem of a church

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,630
remains the reference here in these new churches,

47
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,090
remains the essential antique source for the facade,

48
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,240
as somehow the appropriate classical source for religious structure.

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,520
Now in his reconstruction of San Sebastiano,

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,060
Wittkower is going to emphasize the temple facade raised on its podium

51
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,000
again, just as we saw with the Tempio, and reached

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,800
by this broad monumental stair in the antique manner,

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,840
raising the church above the city fabric somehow, at least symbolically.

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,370
The facade is articulated by six equidistant pilasters,

55
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,080
and a broken entablature with an arched window behind it.

56
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,130
The source this time is another triumphal arch,

57
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,220
the Arch of Tiberius in Orange.

58
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,760
And what I've always found strange is that Wittkower

59
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,680
fails to mention that the arrangement of elements we see on the church

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,750
are actually coming from the east side of the arch, not the front.

61
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,760
Now with Sant'Andrea, there's another arch, the Arch of Trajan in Ancona.

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,680
This is what comes into play with one large passage and two narrower bays

63
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,130
that are also cut into three spaces.

64
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,940
The argument is that while the classical temple front,

65
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,270
with its columns and entablatures and pediment,

66
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,790
is a reference for both churches, this time he's pushed out the inner room

67
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,430
with its walls-- the so-called cella--

68
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,880
into the orders, abolishing any freestanding column and entablatures

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,690
and instead privileging the idea of the wall, of privileging,

70
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,920
ultimately, structure over ornament.

71
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,720
Here's Wittkower:

72
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,310
"The Tempio and Santa Maria Novella are connected in

73
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,010
so far as they show the compromise of wall and column, a compromise which

74
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,080
was later abandoned.

75
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,070
Here the compliance with the authority of classical motifs

76
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,500
was replaced by their interpretation in terms of a consistent wall

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,670
architecture."

78
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,800
Alberti, according to Wittkower, moved from columns and ornament

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,550
to the affirmation of the wall.

80
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,410
Where we had an exploration of the ornamental meaning of classicism,

81
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,270
now we have moved to a structural understanding of classical antiquity.

82
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:52,270
And this is what renders Alberti revolutionary in Wittkower's eyes.

83
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,400
So to conclude, let's think about Wittkower's Alberti.

84
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,780
For Wittkower, the four churches offer a coherent sequence.

85
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,330
From the very beginning, we are given a problem,

86
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:12,440
how to give a church, a religious edifice, a classical aspect.

87
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,810
How to find the sources that are going to solve

88
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,980
the problem of masking a two-story structure

89
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,440
and, ultimately, coming in the end at an aesthetic affirmation of the whole,

90
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,040
of some ideal principle of unity.

91
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,010
One of the dangers here, of course, is to confuse Wittkower with Alberti.

92
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,060
We want to make sure that we understand that Wittkower's approach, which

93
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,280
is about using diagrams to distill some kind of fundamental understanding

94
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,660
of architecture and its elements, is about schematizing buildings.

95
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,620
He is not going to want to address Alberti's exploration of vernacular

96
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,120
aesthetics that are part of a far more eclectic understanding

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,750
of religious architecture than Wittkower allows.

98
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,530
However, to think about Wittkower's reading of Alberti

99
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,130
is also to understand an approach that fundamentally

100
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,070
looks at the diagram as the revelatory tool for understanding

101
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,470
architecture and its development.

102
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,010
In this sense, by using the diagram, he's

103
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,980
actually turning to a mode of interpretation that

104
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,990
relies on the schema, and here we can recognize, actually,

105
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,870
an approach inspired by the philosopher Immanuel

106
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,010
Kant, who looks at the architectural imagination as the very thing that

107
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,980
schematizes the complexity of the world and transforms it

108
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,450
into an ideal that is presented as an objective principle

109
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,890
or axiom to the understanding.
