K. MICHAEL HAYS: The Maison Dom-ino would become an objet-type for Le Corbusier, an inaugural diagram that
https://youtu.be/MSlexCUGpxk
1
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,130
would allow him to develop a number of houses in and around Paris.

2
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,210
Looking at a few of the villas of Le Corbusier will allow us to further articulate the interaction

3
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,000
of new technology with the historical continuity of the discipline of architecture.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,000
The first of these we'll look at is the Villa La Roche - Jeanneret.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,580
There was a planned development in a area of Paris that made the site very attractive

6
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,110
because the plan was that a number of houses would be built on the same site.

7
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,680
Le Corbusier was acting on behalf of the clients to negotiate an acquisition of a property,

8
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,250
in which he could build two houses for two families-- kind of twins that would be bridged by a

9
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,110
common gallery.

10
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,700
In the end, he was not able to obtain the pair of lots he wanted that would make

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,270
a symmetrical entry.

12
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,119
So he ended up, rather than designing a U-shape scheme, he ended up with an L-shape, with

13
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,439
an extended wing on the right side of the street.

14
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,909
And what would have been the bridge, or what would have been this cross-wing, now became

15
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:29,939
a gallery, raised up off the ground on columns, or what he called pilotis, and whose elevation

16
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,450
he treated as a terminus of the cul-de-sac.

17
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,109
You approach the building toward this curved surface,

18
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:45,380
and then you turn 90 degrees to the right to enter the La Roche house into a three-story

19
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:51,840
hallway, a prism, that has an area nearly equal to all the other major living spaces

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
combined.

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,600
So visitors come in to this big entry hallway, then they mount a stairway at the far corner

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,960
of the hall.

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,829
Coming up the stairway, at the very top, is a balcony.

24
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:07,749
And you're immediately, as you reach the top of the stair, you're oriented back to the

25
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:12,600
space of the entry hall, to the open space of the entry hall, from where you have just

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,700
come, as well as to other apertures, windows, and passages that punctuate through the walls

27
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,790
of the entry hall.

28
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,060
From there, you can choose a number of different paths that take you to further moments

29
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,959
of stasis.

30
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,360
You come to the top of the stair, you pause.

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,050
You move along a different path, and you pause again, either at a balcony, or an aperture,

32
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,180
or in a window.

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,540
You can also move into the main gallery, with its curved front, which is on the primary

34
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,379
floor-- that is, the first floor above the ground, since it's been raised on pilotis.

35
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:56,400
Now, this gallery was intended for the display of paintings that had been collected by

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,549
La Roche, the owner.

37
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:01,750
It's a two-story space, as I say, raised one story off the ground.

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:08,799
On the main floor, there's a ramp rising slowly along the curve of the gallery's long wall.

39
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,870
This is the same wall that is the elevation of the entry court.

40
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,689
At the bottom of that ramp is another balcony that, this time, punches through the exterior

41
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,079
wall to take you to the outside.

42
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:27,439
From that balcony, you can survey the whole project-- the elevation that would be to your

43
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,440
left, as well as the curved wall, as well as the entry court itself.

44
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,460
Now, walking up the ramp, we get a cinematic experience of the gallery.

45
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,600
It's like one long, uninterrupted shot of the abstract geometry and structure

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,629
of that space.

47
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:53,410
And then, finally, when we reach the top of that, yet another balcony flanked by two long,

48
00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:04,810
horizontal windows that afford a view out on both sides, now, of the building.

49
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:12,230
Every view of the geometry and the compositional features of the house must be taken in as

50
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:19,790
a result of movement, of movement through the spaces and movement through walls, through

51
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,880
surfaces, and around figures and walls.

52
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,290
The motion is choreographed with extreme care in a narrative of pure form.

53
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:35,130
The house is perceived as a geometrical construction by walking through and around the main space

54
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,970
in a process of rotation through the space.

55
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,710
Then there are moments of pause in this movement that are usually designated, either by a balcony

56
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,740
at a handrail, at which you come to rest, or perhaps by an aperture or a window, where

57
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,250
you come and register your body and measure it in that aperture that creates these moments

58
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,770
of stasis.

59
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:05,340
At these moments of stasis, one looks across the space, usually at walls or other surfaces,

60
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,750
in a frontal way.

61
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,720
So the moments of stasis establish a perception of frontality.

62
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,240
This dialectic of rotation and frontality, or movement and stasis, is one of the themes

63
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,740
that is definitive for the villas.

64
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,449
Now, there are two kinds of what we might even think of as knowledge or as information

65
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,800
that's produced by this dialectic.

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,310
Frontality is normally perceived at a distance, at a prospect.

67
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,169
It might be something that you scan, but usually you're looking at it in a kind of perspective

68
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:41,190
that produces pictorial space.

69
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,020
Now, pictorial space is a space that is very like that in Le Corbusier's painting, is space

70
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,139
that cannot be entered or circulated through.

71
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:56,290
It's rather viewed from a distance, assigned a frontality, and it gives order to that frontal

72
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,290
sensation.

73
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,250
Now, against this, Corbusier stages a different kind of experience.

74
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,889
And it produces a different kind of knowledge, or a different kind of information, that one

75
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:11,220
can only have by being close up to things, close to the wall, close to the aperture,

76
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,010
at the sill of the window, at the handrail of the balcony.

77
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,360
So it's close up,

78
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,740
and it requires movement and rotation through and around space.

79
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:30,580
So again, the dialectic of frontality and rotation combine to produce a kind of spatial

80
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,500
and formal knowledge, combine to produce architectural information in the architectural imaginary,

81
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,980
combine to produce a concept of the architecture.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,720
Well, at Villa La Roche, Le Corbusier was able to explore some of the properties of

83
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,330
the Dom-ino diagram, like the use of the reinforced concrete system, the horizontal slabs, which

84
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:02,599
allow the free arrangement of program and circulation, the non-load-bearing wall, the

85
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:09,200
relationship of the earth, where he explored raising some of the rooms on pilotis.

86
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,370
He wasn't able to fully explore all of the Dom-ino system.

87
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:20,199
What he found, however, in addition to that, was a way of supplementing the system with

88
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,099
a kind of formal vocabulary for architecture.

89
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:31,349
He discovered that the objet-type in his paintings-- the bottles, the plates, the contours of the

90
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:39,379
guitar, the everyday objects that he thought provided such an effect and such deep sensation

91
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:46,169
when experienced visually-- he made analogs of those objet-type in the architecture.

92
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:52,550
The balconies, the apertures, the curvilinear surfaces-- these became an architectural vocabulary

93
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:59,510
that was analogous to the objet-type in the paintings and supplemented the objet-type of

94
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,009
the Dom-ino system itself.
