00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,980
K. MICHAEL HAYS: There was a very important historical controversy --

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,580
really, an international controversy -- that sort of set the mood

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,840
for the requirements or the desire for a Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,420
to be placed in Berlin.

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,310
It was called the Bitburg Controversy.

6
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,950
In 1985, relationships between Germany and the United States

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,940
were beginning to warm up a little bit after a very long period of sort

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,290
of antagonism.

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,600
The Chancellor Helmut Kohl invited then President Ronald Reagan

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,480
to come to Berlin in what would end up being a highly publicized televised

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,650
media event that would be part of the sort of demonstration

12
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:01,020
of the reconciliation between Germany and the United States.

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,340
The plan was to go to the Bitburg Cemetery, where

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,690
Reagan would place a wreath.

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,990
Now, the issue was that the Bitburg Cemetery

16
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,740
was the site where the soldiers in Hitler's

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,780
SS, or so-called Protective Echelon, where

18
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,330
these soldiers who were sort of the epitome of Nazi evil were buried.

19
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,170
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

20
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,380
- For many years now, local American, French, and West German

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,080
military commanders have gone to that cemetery

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,410
every November to join in a wreath laying ceremony honoring

23
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,040
all those who died in World War II.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,710
But apparently, no one, including the White House Advance Team or the US

25
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,670
Embassy, ever bothered to check out the identity of the dead at Bitburg.

26
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,030
Most of the 2,000 German soldiers who are buried there

27
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,630
were killed in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944.

28
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,140
But at least 29 headstones are clearly marked SS

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,200
and contain the remains of Nazi storm troopers.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,790
The SS, originally the security arm of the Nazi party,

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,635
pledged allegiance to Hitler first, country second.

32
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:10,410
It was the SS that killed most of the estimated 6 million

33
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,880
Jews that died in the Holocaust.

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,631
[END PLAYBACK]

35
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:16,380
K. MICHAEL HAYS: The excuse was that there

36
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,210
was a military base, an American military base, nearby

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,750
and that the sort of combination of German cemetery

38
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,010
and American military base somehow, in the minds of Kohl and Reagan,

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,040
made sense.

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,890
This, as you can imagine, sparked an enormous international controversy

41
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,060
about the inappropriateness of an American president really, in a way,

42
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,560
celebrating the German SS soldiers.

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,850
And this is how Reagan responded and defended himself.

44
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,650
He says, "These [SS troops] were the villains, as we know,

45
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,950
that conducted the persecutions and all.

46
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,770
But I think there's nothing wrong with visiting

47
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,040
that cemetery where those young men were,

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,160
because they were victims of Nazism.

49
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:12,810
They were victims, just as surely as the victims in the concentration camp."

50
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,520
This is a stunning declaration.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,570
This is a stunning equation of men, women, and children

52
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,320
who died in the gas chambers with SS soldiers who

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,320
were actually propagating the deaths.

54
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,580
The relativization of victims in that way,

55
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,250
the equation of the soldiers with the victims, is an indication of a deeper--

56
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,730
of an underlying condition, where even educated people,

57
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,470
when remembering the Holocaust, would oscillate between, on the one hand,

58
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,470
this relativization of the Holocaust as just one

59
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,275
victimization among others and this desperate need to forget.

60
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,860


61
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,960
The Bitburg Controversy helped produce a kind

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,930
of public understanding of the conditions

63
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,350
that required a memorial to the murdered Jews.

64
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,905
On the one hand, there was, as I say, this relativization

65
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:10,610
of the Holocaust, a desire for reconciliation,

66
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,880
really, a desire for kind of forgive and forget

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,250
and a return to Germany's noble past before Nazism.

68
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,290
On the other hand, there was a recognition

69
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,990
for the need for a critical memory--

70
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,610
a kind of collective responsibility of constantly working

71
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,500
through the past as part of one's everyday life.

72
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,530
A refusal to package the Holocaust so that it can be redeemed and set aside,

73
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,190
and the recognition that there is a social responsibility

74
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,260
for constantly working through this.

75
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,034
