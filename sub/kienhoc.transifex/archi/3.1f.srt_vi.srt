K. MICHAEL HAYS: The idea of Spirit appearing, of, sort of, shining forth
https://youtu.be/bAIiSEnRt4E
1
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,100
in objects of art is important,

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,910
and Hegel defends a kind of two-fold thesis about this.

3
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,360
For him, it is the sensuous material, everyday world that is the illusion

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,630
because it's not imbued enough with Spirit.

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,330
Art is showing-- is more real in a way, because it shows forth Spirit.

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,940
And Hegel uses the term "der Schein," which

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,040
literally means appearance, but also has an English cognate, which is, exactly,

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,590
"shining," a kind of shining forth.

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,470
So art shines forth in the sense that it transforms the sensuous world.

10
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:59,330
It transforms the material world into a representation of Spirit

11
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,990
through the work of the imagination.

12
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,850
Hegel believed that in the Romantic when art has moved,

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,930
is moving out of the material realm into the conceptual--

14
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,010
actually, was a prologue to the end of art.

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,390
Now, Hegel never said that art died.

16
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,150
He actually never said that art would end.

17
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,330
What he said was grand art, great art is past.

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:38,670
Even in his own time he believed that as spirit grew into self-identity,

19
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,380
that material forms, material objects were

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,610
no longer adequate to represent Spirit.

21
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,510
Interestingly, the other part of his model

22
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:58,290
is that as he moves from symbolic to classical to romantic,

23
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,680
even though each of those epochs have all

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,920
of the art medium represented in them, the paradigm of the symbolic

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,210
is architecture.

26
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,970
The real paradigm of the classical is sculpture,

27
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,292
because of this adequation of the human form to spiritual expression.

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,540
The real paradigm of the romantic is painting and music.

29
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,230
Why painting and music?

30
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,870
Painting is two-dimensional.

31
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,510
It starts to move out of the three-dimensional, physical, material

32
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,390
world into the realm of pure vision, a pure representation.

33
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,120
And music is even less material or more dematerialized.

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,960
The material of music is just time and rhythm.

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,040
And Hegel privileges music in the romantic.

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,900
Because he thought that the time and rhythm of music

37
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:05,430
was really representing or uniting with the time and rhythm of human

38
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,210
thought itself.

39
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,850
So music is the most conceptual art.

40
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,900
But then, finally, a Spirit achieves self-identity.

41
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,140
It moves away from art altogether.

42
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,020
And it moves toward philosophy and theology.

43
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,320
And these are the ultimate, in a way, representations of Spirit.

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,810
After that, Spirit no longer needs art to represent itself.

45
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,810
This is not to say that art doesn't continue.

46
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,180
This is not to say that art-- that humans still

47
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,490
produce art for other reasons.

48
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:48,310
But for Hegel it no longer produces art to represent Spirit.

49
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,330
So Hegel has it both ways.

50
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,660
He constructs an aesthetic whose very conception of possibility,

51
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,240
a very condition of possibility is that it moves through time, as it more

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,270
adequately represents Spirit.

53
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,680
And as the aesthetic moves through time it becomes less material.

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,760
It becomes more conceptual, until finally, it becomes thought itself.

55
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,180
And the adequate activity, the adequate process of Spirit

56
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,930
is no longer the materialization and the appearance through art,

57
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,490
but is actually thought itself.

58
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,840
So the aesthetic necessarily concludes at the end of history

59
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,460
by abolishing itself and becoming thought.

60
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,160
This doesn't mean that art will cease to exist.

61
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,140
Art practice will continue.

62
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:48,260
But it will find other opportunities, other cultural uses for its existence.

63
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,670
Hegel has a very beautiful quotation about philosophy--

64
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,790
"Philosophy always arrives too late.

65
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,850
As the thought of the world, it only makes its appearance

66
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,160
after actuality has finished its process of development and is over.

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,330
...Only in the maturation of actuality does the ideal appear to confront the real.

68
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,460
Then the ideal reconstructs this world for itself

69
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,010
in the form of an intellectual realm, comprehending in its substance.

70
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,560
When philosophy paints its grey on grey then the form of life has grown old,

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,360
and this grey on grey is not capable of rejuvenating it, merely of

72
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,110
understanding it.

73
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,550
The owl of Minerva only begins its flight when the twilight falls."
