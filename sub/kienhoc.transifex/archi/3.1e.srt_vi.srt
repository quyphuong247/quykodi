K. MICHAEL HAYS: In between the symbolic and the romantic
https://youtu.be/IlNrCGehOpU
1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,120
is the classical, whose architectural paradigm is,

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,860
of course, the Greek temple.

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,460
Hegel understands the Greek temple, first of all,

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,030
as a harmonious relation between form and function.

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:25,910
Think of it this way:

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,300
the symbolic for Hegel really is pre-functional.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,137
There's no real reason for the pyramids.

8
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:34,470
Of course, we know that they were tombs of the pharaohs,

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,620
but there's no function in terms of the spirit.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,705
Where in the Gothic cathedral, it is, we could say, post-functional.

11
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:43,490
It's use doesn't really matter.

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,090
It's more this dematerialized representation of a conceptual realm.

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,660
But in the classic Greek temple, function and form

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,950
are exquisitely coordinated.

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,740
Its function is to house a god.

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:03,960
But more important, its function is to show forth the Spirit in the object.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,530
In the romantic period, Spirit has almost left the object.

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,410
In the symbolic period, Spirit is outside the object,

19
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,940
and the object is pointing to it.

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,790
In the classical period, Spirit shows forth from within the object.

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,890
Now, it may be easier to understand this if we

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,940
think of classical sculpture, which is really the paradigmatic classical art

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,810
form for Hegel.

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,460
The Greeks used the human form, they idealized the human form,

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,309
so that the Spirit shows forth in the human form.

26
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:35,350
And this is the paradigm.

27
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,433
So if you think about the way a classical building

28
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:41,110
does that, it takes its parts, which are very distinct,

29
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,070
different parts-- the column, the entablature, the joint

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,290
between the column and the entablature.

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,960
It shows forth the parts as differences, but the differences

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,240
are all coordinated by a single idea of a whole that

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,470
brings all the differences together.

34
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,290
So this is how we can see the holism of the Spirit shining forth

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,400
through the different parts of the classical temple,

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,910
and that's really its function.

37
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,350
And so its form and its function are exquisitely

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,790
coordinated into this unity.
