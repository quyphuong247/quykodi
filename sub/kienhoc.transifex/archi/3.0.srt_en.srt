K. MICHAEL HAYS: Wittkower's interpretation of the work of Alberti

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,590
and Argan's account of the work of Brunelleschi give us two examples

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,830
of Kant-inspired historians attributing to architecture the status

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,410
of an ongoing formal project--

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,980
a project of speculation and conjecture that takes

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,090
place in the architectural imagination.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,650
We now look to put that idea into dialectical play with the movement

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,020
of architecture through history.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,640
To return to history is to return this internal world constructed

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,510
by architecture, this world of aesthetic perfection,

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,300
to the more robust world in which we all reside.
