K. MICHAEL HAYS: The risk of representing the Holocaust
https://youtu.be/-F9n7L4SBzI
1
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,590
through realistic representations is a risk

2
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,910
of being complicit with the very forces that

3
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,100
victimized the Jews in the first place.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,930
There's also the risk of creating a kind of excusing,

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,990
or creating a kind of redemptive or adaptive mechanism, with which we

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,290
can ultimately forget the Holocaust.

7
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,780
In contrast to that, the Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,350
uses abstraction to produce a critical memory.

9
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,880
This is not a memory that comes from someone actually seeing

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,610
or someone seeing in a photograph.

11
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,560
It's not a memory that comes from some inscription

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,030
from the archives of the Prague cemetery.

13
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,830
It's a memory that comes from the slabs themselves,

14
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,120
from the way they're organized, from the way that the organization

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,680
of the project itself reflects the enormity

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,470
of the scale, the systematicity, the randomness of the Holocaust itself.

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,565
This is the critical memory that Eisenman is attempting to produce.

18
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:23,200


19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,690
The memorial doesn't try to conciliate.

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:32,250
It doesn't try to give us a conciliatory narrative or image.

21
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,510
It rather, in its very negativity, forces

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:47,280
us to think about the unnamed strangers whose absence is utterly sealed,

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,980
whose loss is final.

24
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,880
And it tries to force us to not forget that.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,380
The German-Jewish philosopher Theodor Adorno put this point very powerfully.

26
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,830
"After Auschwitz, our feelings resist any claim

27
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:10,070
of the positivity of existence as sanctimonious, as wronging the victims;

28
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,850
our feelings balk at squeezing any kind of sense, however bleached,

29
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,550
out of the victims' fate."

30
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,920
And it seems to me that the memorial in Berlin

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,430
follows this sanction of refusing to give

32
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,030
a positive excuse for the Holocaust.

33
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,170
This memorial presents us with the fact that the events in question,

34
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,900
though they cannot be represented, must be remembered.

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,442
