K. MICHAEL HAYS: Architecture is not just about the need for shelter
https://youtu.be/pwzCXOPK5BY
1
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,870
or the need for a functional building.

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,470
In some ways, it's just what exceeds necessity that is architecture.

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,240
And it's the opening onto that excess that makes architecture fundamentally

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,120
a human endeavor.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,470
Architecture is a technical answer to a question that's not technical at all,

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,571
but rather is historical and social.

7
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:40,039
The study of architecture is the study of human thought and human history.

8
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,210
This is about the architectural imagination.

9
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,770
It's how to think about architecture, but it's also

10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,380
about architecture as a mode of thought.

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,635
Architecture is one of the most complexly negotiated cultural practices

12
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:02,135
there is.

13
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,510
And a single instant involves all of the aesthetic,

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,190
technological, economic, political issues of social production itself.

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,250
And indeed, in some ways, architecture, as we'll see,

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,970
helps articulate history itself.

17
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,470
These are all big claims.

18
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,490
And we'll need big ideas to address these claims.

19
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,680
And we'll also need very specific, concrete examples

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,260
of architectural projects and events from history.

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,640
Welcome to The Architectural Imagination, an online introduction

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,606
to the history and theory of architecture.

23
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:36,860
I'm Michael Hays, Professor of Architectural Theory at the Graduate

24
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,685
School of Design.

25
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,160
And my colleagues and I will introduce you

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,700
to some of the most fundamental themes, concepts,

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,110
and examples of architectural thought.
