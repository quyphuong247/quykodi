K. MICHAEL HAYS: At the other end of history, architecture will find its primary form
https://youtu.be/3BCFmy5jJO0
1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,140
in the interior.

2
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,600
So we move away from the object that marks and toward the interior.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,600
This is the romantic stage of architecture,

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,570
and its paradigm is the Gothic cathedral.

5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,690
Hegel conceptualized the Gothic cathedral

6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,980
as an enormous interior landscape.

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,090
Think of all the activities that take place in a cathedral in medieval times.

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,240
There was bartering, there was trading, as well as worship.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,450
There was a gathering, maybe even there were celebrations

10
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,850
of the community as a collective space.

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,900
It's a civic space.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,030
It's almost like an urban interior.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,870
And the great Gothic cathedrals, which Hegel knew, which he had visited,

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,890
were so large that they almost take on a kind of atmosphere.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,400
They have a kind of interior atmosphere.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,070
The stone of the cathedral, very unlike the stone of the pyramids,

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,575
is a stone that denies its own stone-ness.

18
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:13,170
It's been carved away.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,760
It's been ornamented.

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,840
It's been decorated and refined until the stone seems to be

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,800
just vectors of energy surging upward.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,050
And then there's the stained glass, of course,

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,740
modulates the light, modulates this atmosphere.

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,590
And the space takes on a kind of diaphanous quality,

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,170
a kind of lace-like quality.

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,210
It's important that it's collective.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,800
It's important that it's dematerialized because here, the Spirit,

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,200
in the romantic period, is leaving the sensuous realm, is leaving nature,

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,460
is leaving the object realm, and becoming more conceptual,

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,030
becoming more self-conscious--

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,870
more self-conscious, more conceptual, and less material.
