ERIKA NAGINSKI: Now it would seem a given that architects would be interested in institutions and in
https://youtu.be/88sZOf9vwO4
1
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:23,710
studying their typologies and developing their typologies but one has to remember that this

2
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:33,100
institutionalism this imagining of public buildings was completely new in the Renaissance.

3
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:39,420
What's important for us is that this relation of the ideal city and inventing institutions

4
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,079
or public institutions anew with which to reorganize the social order really emerged

5
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,370
fully articulated only for the first time in the 18th century, so centuries later with

6
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,559
architects like Ledoux, who is looking at the factory as a kind of template for an ideal

7
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:05,280
society, and also with the works of the architect to whom I want now to turn, Étienne-Louis

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,920
Boullée, another one of these visionary architects whose "City of the Dead" I'm now going to

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,289
turn to.

10
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:18,610
This is a pen-and-ink drawing from the 1780s, so we're dealing with the decade before the

11
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,330
French Revolution broke out.

12
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,250
The French Revolution begins in 1789.

13
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,270
Boullée is an extraordinary character, historically, along these lines.

14
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,119
He's an academically trained architect.

15
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:39,310
His career spans the 18th century, this period we call the Enlightenment: the period that

16
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:46,030
saw the birth of social philosophy, of notions of democracy, of new forms of government that

17
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,080
would challenge royal authority, and by the end of the century, of course, with the American

18
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,090
Revolution and the French Revolution, we see society actually rewritten.

19
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,509
So it's no surprise that utopian schemes and the imagining of public buildings would occur

20
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:03,599
in this historical context.

21
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:11,870
But to go back to Boullée, this is an architect who was born in 1728, and he died in 1799,

22
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,270
the very year the French Revolution came to an end.

23
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:22,930
So he is, actually, a kind of perfect fit as a kind of architectural figura of the Enlightenment.

24
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:30,370
He's someone who was elected to France's official architectural institution: the Royal Academy

25
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,240
of Architecture.

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,810
He took himself to be a great proponent of classical ideas and of pure geometric forms

27
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,840
in architecture.

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,530
He, essentially, imagined a whole series of public buildings.

29
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:52,790
He fetishized the colossal in architecture, and most of all, most curiously, he built

30
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,310
relatively little.

31
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:00,590
His oeuvre is, essentially, found in drawings like this one of unbuildable projects, in

32
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,590
fact.

33
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,940
Yet, he emerged as one of the most influential theorists and teachers of his time.

34
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:14,530
And we can continue to feel his legacy in modern and contemporary architecture.

35
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,730
So how does he show us a "City of the Dead," a kind of urban fabrication that extends the

36
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,130
cemetery into an entire city fabric.

37
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,030
We have at the rear of the image a domed basilica, obviously a centralized structure, which is

38
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:40,090
elevated, and, if you notice, the curves and lines of its contours actually formalize the

39
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,300
silhouette of the mountain, the huge mountain that's rising behind it.

40
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:52,000
In other words, here architecture is not simply in symbiosis with nature; it's actually a

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,350
metaphor for it.

42
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:01,340
You sense the ghost of the ideal city in this so-called "City of the Dead," rendered as

43
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,470
eternal as nature itself.

44
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,530
And you're going to see in the drawings that we're going to look through Boullée, like

45
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,530
Ledoux, began to develop a whole typology of public buildings: churches, cemeteries,

46
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:23,280
libraries, schools, military forts; and, in this, of course, is inscribed a utopian aspiration,

47
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,780
a rewriting of society through architecture.

48
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,530
There's another aspect of Boullée's architecture that we need to address, however.

49
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:41,030
They are deeply engaged with the aesthetic philosophy of the period.

50
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:47,400
In particular, Boullée is looking to create a kind of equivalent, in architecture, to

51
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,310
what the philosophers who were his contemporaries called the sublime.

52
00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:00,730
This is a concept that was developed in the 18th century; it was used to describe, imagine

53
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:08,970
the state of being awestruck, of being overwhelmed by the infinity of nature, by the infinity

54
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,660
of God-- in other words, by things that seem so incommensurable that we don't know how

55
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,570
to take account of them, that we actually don't know how to represent them.

56
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,720
In other words, the sublime corresponds to that which is immeasurable, unrepresentable,

57
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,350
inconceivable.

58
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:34,120
Boullée's writings and his images-- these pen-and-ink sketches-- sought to take those

59
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,860
kinds of qualities associated with the sublime, and they were conveniently typologized by

60
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,880
philosophers-- I'm thinking, in particular, of Edmund Burke or Immanuel Kant-- by the

61
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:53,630
end of the century, and these qualities can be identified as follows: obscurity, power,

62
00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:01,889
vastness, infinity, magnificence, silence, suddenness, the intermittent sound or the

63
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:09,350
intermittent sight, and Boullée took these ideas and turned them into architecture.

64
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,050
What he was after, ultimately, was to make architecture somehow transcendent, to make

65
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,920
architecture reach a kind of philosophical condition.

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,550
And what it so interesting here is that, somehow, we're returning to the phenomenology of architecture.

67
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,570
In other words, how our bodies, how our senses react to the spaces around us, to the architectural

68
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,590
spaces around us.

69
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,630
So how does this work?

70
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,140
How does this work in terms of a paper architecture?

71
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:46,080
What I'm showing you here is what Boullée called "a funerary monument characterizing

72
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,430
the genre of a buried architecture."

73
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,780
What does this mean?

74
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:59,949
Well, first, it means that the image is, somehow, thematically tied to the sublime because the

75
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:06,639
subject or purpose of the building we see is, in fact, an architecture of death.

76
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,660
It is a kind of monumental gateway to a cemetery, if you will.

77
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,030
So it's representing the unrepresentable in architectural form.

78
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,100
This is quite a contradiction.

79
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,919
Second-- the title is a giveaway to this-- it characterizes what Boullée called a genre

80
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,130
or type.

81
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,800
This is an important word in the 18th century: type or typology.

82
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,400
It's a genre or type of architecture, and so, presumably, it typifies a set of characteristics

83
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,020
or properties.

84
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,390
These characteristics, or properties, are meant to have a certain effect or prompt a

85
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,560
certain kind of reaction on the viewer.

86
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,030
Third, that genre or type actually has a name.

87
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,270
Boullée calls it "buried architecture."

88
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:58,229
The idea here is that you, actually, bury a colossal structure so that architecture

89
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:04,289
itself becomes an analogy to the tomb.

90
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:13,490
Out of this typologizing, out of this searching for a typological formatting of public buildings,

91
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:21,880
Boullée developed what later would be called "architecture parlante," or "speaking architecture."

92
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,260
This is very much along the lines of what Ledoux was doing at the saltworks.

93
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:33,180
And the idea is that buildings somehow explain their function or explain their identity through

94
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,279
their formal attributes.

95
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,610
They speak their names.

96
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:44,820
The idea emerged in Boullée's collected writings and his drawings, which, essentially, span

97
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,450
this late 18th-century period from about 1778 into the French Revolution, into 1793.

98
00:08:51,450 --> 00:09:00,079
And all of this manifested itself in utopian terms, in an architecture on paper that was

99
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:07,800
rendered monochromatically and that offered a kind of panoply of unbuildable edifices

100
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,339
presenting projects for public buildings moored to huge scale, to largeness of scale, and

101
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,050
highly formalized geometric vocabularies.

102
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,900
This is the rise of public building and public building typologies, and we understand that

103
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:30,740
when we go back the 18th century that this was a fundamentally utopian undertaking.

104
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,350
So what was this architectural language of utopia, if you will.

105
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:44,300
Well, it's based on regularized solids, gargantuan spheres, pyramids, huge quadrangles, with

106
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,300
each geometric form, somehow, thematizing a given purpose, a given use.

107
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,029
The result is that the symbolic aspect of architecture-- in other words, how you invoke

108
00:09:55,029 --> 00:10:01,379
the character of a structure-- superseded all practical implications.

109
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:06,300
In other words, Boullée was absolutely not interested in whether these could be built

110
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
or not.

111
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,589
He was interested in their symbolic apparatus and their social utility.

112
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:18,730
So the example here is a military fort, and, for Boullée, military architecture needed

113
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,209
to suggest "the idea of force."

114
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:27,629
Accordingly, what you see in the drawing, or what you see in Boullée's imagining of

115
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:34,199
the fort, is that the actual techniques, the technologies of construction here, are pretty

116
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:35,980
much irrelevant.

117
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,290
He's not interested in mechanical problems, technical issues.

118
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,149
He actually dismissed Vitruvius for being too interested in engineering because this

119
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,449
was not what, for Boullée, the primary purpose of architecture.

120
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:55,560
The primary purpose of architecture was to imagine possibilities, for Boullée.

121
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,910
Instead, he was far more interested in how we, literally, read the identity of his structure,

122
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:08,140
which is a round central tower flanked by four square ones set on the diagonal.

123
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,119
In other words, this is an architecture of signs.

124
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:17,629
You have an absolutely massive shield-- it's, in fact, the shield of the great Greek warrior

125
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:21,239
Achilles-- plastered on the facade.

126
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:27,149
You have walls so massive that they give the idea of indestructibility, and the fact that

127
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:31,540
they actually couldn't be built was completely beside the point for Boullée.

128
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,620
You have piles of cannon balls and cannons set to each side of the flanking towers.

129
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,519
All of this is a kind of symbolic apparatus that produces signs so that we can read the

130
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,939
building, that the architecture, again, can speak its identity, speaks its character,

131
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:51,489
speaks its name.

132
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:57,600
Another example would be something like this, in this so-called geometrical elevation of

133
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,399
a chapel of the dead.

134
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,739
Again, we have the pyramidal shape, which we associate with the memorial, with commemoration,

135
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,699
with the end of life.

136
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:13,139
We're meant to understand this commemorative purpose through this visual illusion, if you

137
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:19,779
will, to the sublime, which Boullée actually stresses in his definition of architecture.

138
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:28,980
And when we turn to his writings, we can read into them his deliberate allusion to the philosophical

139
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,589
ideas that were circulating in the period.

140
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:39,119
Here is Boullée, "Architecture is the only art by which we can put Nature to work, and

141
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:44,949
this unique advantage makes manifest its Sublime aspect.

142
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:51,049
The means by which nature can be put to work, which belong to architecture, come from the

143
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:57,999
power to effect what poetry can only describe.

144
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:06,029
The art of moving us through the effects of light belongs to architecture.

145
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:12,360
For in all the monuments that are capable of stirring the soul and making us experience

146
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:19,310
the horrors of darkness, or, conversely, that create transportive sensations through brilliant

147
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:26,429
effects, the architect, who must know these means and master them, can dare to say: I

148
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:27,839
create light.

149
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,209
This is an extraordinarily ambitious definition of architecture, and there are several points

150
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:34,230
to retain.

151
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,649
First, that architecture is linked to nature.

152
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:44,709
Second, that the sublime character of architecture is based on that link to nature.

153
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:53,059
And third, Boullée's assumption that, somehow, the formal character of a building affects

154
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,110
our senses.

155
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,500
We feel horror at darkness.

156
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,910
We feel jubilation at light.

157
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:06,389
And, finally, the equation between architect and God: "I create light."

158
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:11,589
The assumption here is that there is a direct relationship between highly abstract forms

159
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:19,459
and human sensations, and that geometrical shapes can actually render architecture transcendent.

160
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:27,299
Drawings, in this sense, become a kind of template for the sublime and for inciting

161
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,929
a sublime reaction in their viewers.

162
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:36,119
Here's another one of these drawings; this one's a perspectival entrance to a cemetery

163
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:42,999
in which darkness and the pyramidal form evoke the end of life.

164
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,579
Over and over again, we see these mechanisms at work.

165
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:54,160
For example, in this project for a metropolitan church, where we can discern the regular succession

166
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,699
and uniformity of its kit of parts that, according to philosophers of the time, artificially

167
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,199
recreated the sense of infinity.

168
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,300
Listen to this account.

169
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:11,129
"Whenever we repeat any idea frequently, the mind by a sort of mechanism repeats it long

170
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:12,329
after...

171
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:19,019
Place a number of uniform and equidistant marks in regular sequence [such as a row of

172
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:26,379
columns] they will cause it to seem to extend to a length almost incredible and seem multiplied

173
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:27,850
without end...

174
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:35,189
[Likewise in a] rotunda you can nowhere fix a boundary; turn which way you will, the same

175
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:40,699
object still seems to continue, and the imagination has no rest.

176
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:51,399
But the parts must be uniform as well as circularly disposed, to give this figure its full force."

177
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:58,329
In this scheme of things, the architectural is actually created by the repetition of columns,

178
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:02,809
by placing uniform columnar screens on all sides.

179
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:06,420
And circularity is also crucial to the effect.

180
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,989
Here is shows up in this gargantuan dome, a dome technologically which could never have

181
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:15,230
been erected at the time because of its sheer size.

182
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:21,550
And, of course, to go back to the sublime; it is a rotunda that offers no boundaries

183
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,519
and no end points.

184
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,779
It is the architectural equivalent, if you will, of infinity.

185
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:33,750
And then there's the uniformity of the plan too, with four arms and entrances all exactly

186
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:40,790
alike, all the same, and, unlike Ledoux, completely devoid of program.

187
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,100
But now I want to return to where I began, and the idea that no mater how sublime Boullée's

188
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,079
projects seem, they were, nonetheless, very much tied to contemporaneous architectural

189
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,079
projects.

190
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,930
In other words, projects that were actually built.

191
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,739
What Boullée, in some cases, was doing was looking at the built, and then using the real

192
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:07,150
to create a fiction, to create a new typology.

193
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:12,419
So for the metropolitan church, all we need to do is to consider a church that was built

194
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:19,730
by the architect Soufflot, the Church of St. Genevieve, which is now the French Panthéon.

195
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:26,440
And if we compare the plans-- Boullée on the left, Soufflot on the right-- we can see

196
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,880
that, basically, what Boullée did was to take Soufflot's church and to turn it into

197
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,340
some kind of geometric giant.

198
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:42,690
Boullée's focus on vast dimensions, on a kind of formal purity, on a repetition is

199
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:50,680
inscribed in a sacred space that had a real precursor, a built expression in Soufflot's

200
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,960
church.

201
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,910
And what Boullée, essentially, did was to fantastically blow Soufflot's church out of

202
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,060
scale through representation, through drawing.

203
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,760
The idea, however, was already there in Soufflot's church.

204
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,110
This is typical of the visionary architect's translation of the real into the ideal, of

205
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,820
producing a fiction from the concrete.

206
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:22,170
So no matter how sublime Boullée's projects seem, they were nonetheless tied to contemporaneous

207
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,150
projects that were actually built.
