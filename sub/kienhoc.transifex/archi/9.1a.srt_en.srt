K. MICHAEL HAYS: Today we'll look at the Centre Pompidou in the city of Paris.

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,760
It's a cultural and art center in the Marais district

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,030
on Place Beaubourg in Paris, designed by the team

6
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,760
of Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,150
The ultimate goal is to produce a reading of the center that

8
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,630
is ideological, to understand the architecture

9
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,710
as a mapping and a representation of a historical moment

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,230
and a political condition.

11
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,850
On the one hand, the center was inspired by post-1968 philosophies

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,280
of collectivity and community.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,010
But on the other hand, the project was an interpretation

14
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,550
of new cybernetic theories of information and organization,

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,830
avant-garde theatrical principles, cutting-edge technology,

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,860
and a completely new attitude toward urbanism

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,480
and the practice of urban space.

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,960
The ultimate goal was a building that would support and represent

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,610
freedom and change in direct response to the desires of its users.

20
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,830


21
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,740
The concept of architectural imagination gives us

22
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:34,160
a way of articulating the relationship between everyday perceptual events,

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,540
perceptual habits and conventions, just the attitudes about being in the world,

24
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,120
and the relationship of that between the context, which is usually the city,

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,770
but also the social-historical context of those experiences.

26
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,090
So we can think about it as two levels.

27
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,970
The first level is existential and subject centered.

28
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,460
It's just how we as individuals, or as a collective,

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,790
are in the world in that existential being in the world.

30
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,760
The other, which is really history itself, is deep structural.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,640
It concerns the objective conditions of possibility

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,210
for how we can be in the world.

33
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,070
In other words, different historical moments, different times,

34
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,300
different contexts allow ways of thinking in a certain way,

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,410
allow ways of behaving in a certain way.

36
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,360
But those ways are shifting through time.

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,700
If we can give an account of the context,

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,470
if we can construct the context with enough robustness,

39
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,305
with enough dynamism, then we can--

40
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:41,780
and if you think about and still continuing

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,160
to think about the idea of architectural imagination, we can see the building,

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,490
we can interpret the building as an active mediator between the context

43
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,740
and our individual experiences.

44
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,140
So a building, because it deals with space, it deals with material,

45
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,140
it even deals with uses and activities in time,

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,000
can be not just an inert object but an active mediator

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,330
between its historical context and our understanding of that context.

48
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,730
So what we want to do now is to think about the Pompidou

49
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,020
Center in the city of Paris at a particular moment in time

50
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,440
as a kind of representation, as a kind of registration,

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,920
and it's actually helping us produce an understanding

52
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,390
of a very particular moment in history.

53
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,387
