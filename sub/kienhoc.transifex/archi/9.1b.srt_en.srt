K. MICHAEL HAYS: What's referred to as the events of May '68 were responsible for the program of

1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,680
the Pompidou Center.

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,380
The events of May '68 in Paris involved a series of student demonstrations and student

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,140
occupation of certain sites.

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,400
There were times when the students would gather together with certain workers

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,489
and make a general strike.

6
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,079
It actually was happening across France, but it was most intense in Paris.

7
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,770
It sometimes involved violent confrontations, as the students demonstrated or the workers

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,510
demonstrated and came into conflict with police or the army.

9
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,300
But it also involved artistic ideas, ideas about how culture and cultural production

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:57,699
and artistic activity could actually bring about social and even political change.

11
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:01,940
One way of focusing it is to consider the activities of an avant-garde art group called

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,519
the Situationist International.

13
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:09,180
What the Situationists wanted was a way of practicing the city, a way of being in the

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,070
city which would divert and change the understanding of the city and of everyday life.

15
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:22,070
An example of some of their production includes a kind of what they call this a psychogeographic

16
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:29,080
map of Paris that would be a kind of instructional map of how to practice the city differently.

17
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,500
They took a map of Paris that everybody in Paris would have had, a way

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
to navigate the city.

19
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,600
It was called the "Paris Taride."

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,060
And they took certain places, very famous places or well-known places on the map and

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,720
would cut them out and then rearrange their relationship.

22
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,910
As you can see in the photograph here of the poster, they would then mark these connections,

23
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,010
reconnect the pieces with little red arrows that they call "plaque tournante."

24
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:03,020
A plaque tournante is like a rotating table or like a turntable that would reorient locomotives

25
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,980
and trains and things like this.

26
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,940
But the idea here is that through this new way of practicing the city, you would take

27
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,730
the different moods of different parts of the cities, the different atmospheres, the

28
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:22,100
different sort of attitudes that one experiences as you move through the city and you would

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,720
try to reconnect them and reorder them to detour them, to divert them and create new

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,240
attitudes, new experiences of the city.

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,390
The events of May '68, the student occupation, the student demonstrations were for, the Situationists

32
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:48,090
a kind of paradigm for a new kind of cultural production, for a new way of practicing urban

33
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,220
space, new alternatives of spatial practice.

34
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,569
And indeed, the stillness himself produced posters, slogans, new forms of art.

35
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:59,540
Here are some examples of the slogans.

36
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,319
This one, "Sous les pavÃ©s, la plage," that is "Underneath the pavement (underneath the paving

37
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,880
stones) is the beach."

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,850
And this was the idea that if you dug up the cobblestones, if you dug up the paving stones

39
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,770
of the street and threw them through the windows of the university, that eventually you would

40
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,940
uncover a new territory, you would uncover a beach in the very center of Paris.

41
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:28,550
So it has this idea of uncovering a new place for leisure or performance, but also a beach

42
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,130
from which could be launched a kind of new cultural attitude.

43
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,989
Or this one, "Il est interdit d'interdire de dire."

44
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:36,989
You can't do that in English.

45
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:38,730
Yeah, you could do it in English.

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,790
"It is forbidden to forbid bidding."

47
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,739
"It is forbidden to forbid speech..." would be another example.

48
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,100
And while Paris was the center of this kind of attitude, of course it

49
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,180
happened at other places.

50
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,200
In the United States, also around the summer of '68, the demonstrations against the Vietnam

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,960
War, the demonstrations for civil rights were very, very similar to the events of May '68

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,540
in Paris.

53
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,120
London sometimes felt left out as it looked to Paris.

54
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,400
The Rolling Stones were inspired to write a song about the events of May called

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,789
"Street Fighting Man," where they lament the fact that the Londoners weren't participating in

56
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:22,039
the way that people of Paris and maybe people in the States were.

57
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,130
But there was a general feeling of global change.

58
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:32,300
There was a feeling that, out of this moment was emerging what would be simply a different

59
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:40,300
way of life, and that cultural practices, art practices would have to reflect that.

60
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,150
The events of May '68 were a paradigm of what the Situationists were calling for, a new

61
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,690
way of practicing the city, a new spatial practice.

62
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,390
It was as if the posters made by the students would replace the sort of paintings that Whitney

63
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,390
would protect.

64
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:02,300
It was as if the slogans became the poetry of a whole new generation and the performances,

65
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,600
the demonstrations, even the violent ones, became a new kind of performing art, an urban

66
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,240
performance that would replace conventional theater.

67
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,130
So if the events were not a huge political success, they had, nevertheless, enormous

68
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,220
social and cultural impact.
