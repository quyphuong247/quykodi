1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,889
What puts the “science” in “social science”?

2
00:00:02,888 --> 00:00:07,398
The things you probably think of as “science”
– like biology, or physics, or chemistry

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,800
– can seem a world apart from sociology
and the concepts we’ve introduced so far.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,420
But sociology is a type of science; it’s
just not one that uses beakers or microscopes.

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:20,219
Rather than investigating the physical, natural
world, sociology explores the social world.

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,519
Now, there are different schools of thought
within sociology about the best way to understand
the social world.

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,679
But one of the primary means of conducting
sociology uses many of the same, basic principles
and methods as any of your hard, clinical sciences.

8
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,000
Can sociology use the scientific method?
Check.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,079
Does it rely on empirical data?
Check.

10
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,199
And graphs?
Heck yeah!

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,980
[Theme Music]

12
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:52,359
A science is really any practice that uses
a systematic method of observation to gain
knowledge.

13
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,280
And you probably know that systematic method
as the scientific method.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,579
Basically, you come up with some question
about the world, and then develop a testable theory
about how you could answer that question.

15
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,619
And you develop and test your theory by gathering
empirical evidence;

16
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:07,179
that is, verifiable information that’s collected
in a systematic way.

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:13,240
Now, whether you’re using it to explore the natural
world or the social world, the scientific method is
rooted in the philosophy known as positivism.

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:19,379
First laid out by Auguste Comte – yes, the same
Auguste Comte that we introduced as the founder
of sociology a couple episodes ago –

19
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,119
positivism argues that phenomena can be
studied through direct observation,

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,820
and that these observations can be pulled together
into theories or facts that can help us understand
how the world works.

21
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:32,279
Now, you might be wondering where the “positive”
in “positivist” comes into play.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,739
Was Comte just a glass half-full kinda guy?

23
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,140
Well, “positive” in this case doesn’t refer to optimism,
and it doesn’t mean “I’m POSITIVE that I’m right!”

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,420
Instead, a ‘positive’ theory is one that’s
objective and fact-based, whereas a ‘normative’
theory is subjective and value-based.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,900
Which brings us to the first of our three
types of sociological inquiry:

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,080
Positivist sociology, or the study of society based
on systematic observations of social behavior.

27
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,239
And here, “objective” is the key word.

28
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:02,159
As scientific researchers, sociologists must
set aside their own values and beliefs to approach
their work as neutral observers,

29
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,000
and use empirical evidence to answer
questions about how the social world works.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,318
So what kind of evidence are you looking for?

31
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,799
If you’re doing quantitative research, you
want data.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,939
Quantitative research is the study of observable
relationships in the world, using mathematical
or statistical methods.

33
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,060
Basically, quantitative evidence is information
that you can count or tally up.

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,300
But this doesn’t just mean number-based
data, like income or age.

35
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,800
You can also use it to categorize people or
things, like the state you live in, your gender,
or your race.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,340
And quantitative evidence can be used in lots
of different ways.

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,680
For example, there’s descriptive data, which
does just what it sounds like:

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,379
It describes facts relevant to the question
you’re researching.

39
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:39,159
Like, maybe you want to know how
income is distributed across households in the
United States.

40
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,919
Quantitative data are your friend here.

41
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,139
This graph is the distribution of household incomes
in 2014, produced by the US Census Bureau.

42
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:48,779
The height of the bars in the graph indicate the
number of households at a certain income level.

43
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,560
And the point labelled “50th” is an important
one because it’s the median income, the absolute
middle observation in the sample.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,479
That means that 50% of households have lower
incomes than that level, and 50% have higher incomes.

45
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,599
In this case, the median income is $53,700.

46
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,299
But, be careful about the conclusions you
draw from this graph!

47
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,340
The median may be the observation in the middle,
but it’s not the same as average household income.

48
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,680
That distinction goes to the mean, which is the sum
of all the values, divided by the number of observations.

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
So in 2014, the mean household income was
$75,700.

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
That’s a lot higher than the median!

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,920
What’s up with that?

52
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,979
Why is there a gap between the mean and the
median?

53
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:29,039
Well, think back to the group that the Occupy Wall
Street movement was concerned with: “the 1%”

54
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,098
That political label is actually a descriptive
statistic!

55
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,239
It describes the percent of the population
with the highest income.

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:43,879
And the fact that the income of that 1% is so much
higher than the incomes of the other 99% – that’s why
we have a gap between the mean and median.

57
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,879
And I’m not being political here; it’s
pure mathematics:

58
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:54,359
If you have 99 people making $50,000 per
year and 1 person making $50 million per year –
what’s gonna happen to the mean income?

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,660
It’s gonna be pulled way up by the one,
very rich person.

60
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:04,979
Even though the mode – or the most common
observation in your sample – is the same as the median
income, $50,000, the mean will be over $500,000.

61
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,799
Another type of evidence that sociologists
use is qualitative data – or information that’s not
in numerical form.

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,160
Where quantitative data try to measure, qualitative
data try to illustrate, or characterize.

63
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,939
Sometimes the information that you need
can’t, or shouldn’t, be distilled into a number in
a spreadsheet.

64
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:24,040
Instead, you use descriptions of the world,
gathered through interviews, questionnaires,
and first-hand observation.

65
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,420
Like, why do some people get married and
some people commit to a long term partnerships
without getting married?

66
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:35,759
Maybe some of that is quantifiable, but a lot of the
process behind making a decision like that is going to
come down to how the couple feels about marriage.

67
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,939
And that can’t be easily stated in a statistic.

68
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:41,480
There are, of course, limitations to sociology
as a positivist discipline.

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,259
Not everything you want to know about society is
going to fit into observable, measurable categories.

70
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,759
And what’s worse: I don’t know if you’ve noticed this,
but human beings are pretty unpredictable.

71
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,560
In much of the natural sciences, the
environment in which research is done in is
completely controlled by scientists.

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,879
Like, microbes in a petri dish: They’re probably
not going to develop free will and mess around with
your carefully designed experiment.

73
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,180
But if you’re studying human behavior, you
can’t control the environment or how your
subject interacts with that environment.

74
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,240
So if you’re interested in, say, the effects
of quality parenting on child development,
you can’t randomly assign babies to parents.

75
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,019
Because, ethics. Parents apparently
want to raise their own spawn.

76
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:19,560
But more than that, you might not want to
be controlling the environment so much.

77
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,600
If you’re interested in how humans behave in the real
world, you don’t want your research methods to make
them act differently than they otherwise would.

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,939
Because the fact is, subjects might change how
they behave if they know they’re being observed.

79
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,459
For a really fun and fascinating example of
this let’s go to the Thought Bubble!

80
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:39,719
In the late 1920s, Austrian sociologist Elton
Mayo went to a telephone factory known as
the Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois.

81
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,820
His goal was to help the Western Electric
company figure out how to make its workers
more productive.

82
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:50,319
So Mayo split the factory staff into groups: a control
group who kept working under the same conditions as
always, and an experimental group.

83
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,980
For the experimental group, Mayo made a series
of changes to their working environment.

84
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,540
He gave them different work hours, changed
up their rest breaks, even turned up the lights
on the factory floor.

85
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,720
And lo and behold, the changes seemed to work!

86
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,340
The workers in the experimental group became
more productive, and absenteeism dropped.

87
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:08,079
But the truth is, the changes to the physical
environment weren’t what made the difference.

88
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,740
Yes, brightening up the room made the
workers more productive – but it turned out,
so did dimming the lights!

89
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,560
And so did reversing all the other changes
that Mayo made.

90
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,639
Eventually, Mayo realized that the workers were
working harder because he was observing them.

91
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,500
The fact that the workers knew someone was
watching how hard they worked made them want
to work harder.

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,639
And this finding at the Hawthorne Works led
future researchers to be much more aware of how
their own presence influenced their findings.

93
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,860
And to this day, the influence of an observer
on the behavior of her participants is known
as the Hawthorne Effect!

94
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,020
Thanks Thought Bubble!

95
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,799
So, yes, studying humans and their behavior
scientifically can be challenging.

96
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,420
But yet another problem with positivist
sociology is that not all social facts can be
applied to all people, in all time periods.

97
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,658
In other words, truth is not always objective.

98
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,100
It’s like when you tell someone about your
favorite book.

99
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,980
If you’re trying to convince them that Harry Potter is
“objectively” the best book series ever written, then you
don’t know what the word “objectively” means at all.

100
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,060
There is no objective truth about what the
best book is.

101
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,980
That’s strictly subjective – an idea that’s
built on your own experiences and feelings.

102
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,980
But as sociologists, we still find subjective
experiences to be valid, and important,

103
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,960
and even worth studying – even if we can’t
generalize them into some capital-T truth
about the world.

104
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,500
Instead, we might be interested in how
patterns in people’s subjective experiences form
the structures that make up our social world.

105
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,339
In sociology, we talk about subjectivity as
the meaning that people give their own lived
experiences.

106
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,000
And this brings us to another way of doing
sociology:

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,360
Interpretative sociology is the study of society
that focuses on the meanings that people attach
to their social world.

108
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,199
While positivist sociology is more interested in
whether a person acts a certain way – something
you can see as an outside observer –

109
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,779
interpretative sociology asks:
Why this behavior?

110
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,439
What’s the meaning behind it?

111
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,980
And how do people view their own actions and
thoughts?

112
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:55,620
Interpretative sociologists approach their subjects
with the aim of seeing the world from their subject’s
perspective, rather than through quantitative data.

113
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,280
So, there are fewer statistics involved in
this type of research.

114
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,979
Instead, interpretative sociologists often
use interviews or face-to-face interactions with
their subjects to understand the world.

115
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,700
Now, there’s one more school of thought
about how the science of sociology can be
conducted.

116
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,879
And it actually relaxes some of the
assumptions we made early on about the
objectivity of the researcher.

117
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,060
These thinkers believe there’s plenty of room in
sociology for subjectivity – especially, for values.

118
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,620
Values are the ideas a person has about what’s good,
and the attitudes they hold about how the world works.

119
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,560
And curiosity about a research topic often
springs from these very values.

120
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,040
Many researchers are drawn to the study of
sociology out of a desire to understand moral or
political questions about how societies work.

121
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,259
Like, what’s the relationship between race
and poverty in the United States?

122
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,399
How can understanding that relationship help
break the connection between race and poverty?

123
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,480
The argument for value-driven research,
rather than value-free research, is one of the
origins of Critical Sociology,

124
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,600
or the study of society that focuses on
the need for social change.

125
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,040
These ideas go back a long time, starting
as early as the 19th century when Jane Addams
developed the Hull House,

126
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,299
an organization that not only provided
things like housing and education to low-income
people in Chicago,

127
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,159
but also researched the causes of, and
solutions to, the ills of poverty.

128
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,139
We’ll explore all of these schools of thought
throughout the rest of series.

129
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,759
But for now, we talked about sociology as
a science.

130
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:12,259
We discussed positivist sociology and how
sociologists use empirical evidence to explore
questions about the social world.

131
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:17,159
And we introduced two alternatives: interpretative
sociology and critical sociology.

132
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,279
Next time, we’re going to learn about how
sociologists actually do their research.

133
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,519
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl
C. Kinney Crash Course Studio in Missoula, MT,

134
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,240
and it's made with the help of all these
nice people.

135
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,379
