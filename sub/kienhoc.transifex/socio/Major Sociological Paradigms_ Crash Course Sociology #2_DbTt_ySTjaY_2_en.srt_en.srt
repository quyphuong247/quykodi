1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
What’s up with society, exactly?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,559
I mean, is it a smoothly functioning whole, with
different parts that fit together to keep it ticking?

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,980
Or is it a jumble of different, competing
groups, constantly at each other’s throats,
struggling for control?

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,000
Or maybe it's, you know, a bunch of people
who are just trying to get through their days.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,699
The fact is, there isn't one answer to the question
of what the nature of society really is.

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,559
But all three of the models that I just described

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,239
– society as a well-oiled machine, as a group
of competing interests, and as bunch of people
just interacting with each other –

8
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,809
they’re all worth considering.

9
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:35,239
Because they each offer their own perspectives
on the social world, and they’re each crucial to
understanding the practice of sociology,

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,280
with histories that can be traced back to
a founding figure in the discipline.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,439
So, let’s talk about paradigms.

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:51,099
[Theme Music]

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,120
A paradigm is not some kind of high-tech parachute.

14
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,890
And it doesn’t equal twenty cents.

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,039
Instead, a paradigm is basically a model for
how you think about things –

16
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,980
a set of concepts and theories that frames your
perspective on a certain topic, whether it’s Russian
literature or public art or the laws of physics.

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,840
And in sociology, theoretical paradigms are
key.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,760
These paradigms are the fundamental assumptions
that sociologists have about the social world,

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,780
the ones that guide their thinking and research.

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,960
And that might sound kind of prejudicial at first,
like you’re going into the study of society with
certain biases in mind.

21
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,859
But you need the assumptions that these paradigms
provide, because raw facts don't interpret themselves.

22
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:29,539
Raw facts are things like "the unemployment
rate last year was 5%," or "Sam is six feet tall," or

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,320
"today a group of people with signs
blocked the highway."

24
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:36,519
By raw I mean that these facts are just simple
descriptions of empirical reality.

25
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,158
And they don’t come pre-interpreted.

26
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,509
Is 5% an acceptable unemployment rate?

27
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,099
Or should we be trying to lower it?

28
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:44,629
Is six feet tall actually tall?

29
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:50,060
And are protesters who are blocking a
highway disrupting the order of society, or are
they struggling for their interests?

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,320
The answer to that last one is, of course,
both.

31
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,459
But the important thing to understand is that
either answer requires you to make some assumptions
about the social world.

32
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:03,139
The other important thing is that those two
different answers will be useful in different situations,
for answering different kinds of questions.

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,640
For instance, if you're trying to understand
how and why society can hold together at all,

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,060
then looking at protests as signs of strain
or disruption might be more useful.

35
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,640
But if you're trying to understand why people
protest, then trying to understand how they're
pursuing their interests might be better.

36
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,199
Now, all this might sound kind of unscientific:
Physics doesn't need "interpretation" exactly.

37
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,019
Math doesn't need multiple "perspectives."

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,680
But actually, they do.

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,860
All scientific disciplines make assumptions about
the world, and all scientific disciplines use different
perspectives, depending on the questions they’re asking.

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,720
In physics, you can understand a bouncing ball
as a nearly uncountable multitude of fundamental
particles, each with its own wave function,

41
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,000
and all held together by different kinds
of forces at the quantum scale.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,740
Or you can just understand it as simply X
number of grams of rubber moving through space.

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,240
The perspective you take will dramatically
change what kinds of questions you want to ask.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,219
All sciences ask different kinds of questions and
have different assumptions for answering them.

45
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:58,020
And raw facts always need some kind of
perspective in order to make them useful.

46
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,719
Now, if we want to talk about different kinds
of questions and perspectives in sociology,

47
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,379
a good place to start is with something we
brought up last episode:

48
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:10,419
the fact that sociology looks at society at
all levels, at all scales, from the huge to the tiny.

49
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:14,059
In other words, sociology is concerned with
both the macro and the micro.

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,840
An orientation towards the macro means looking
at the big.

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,240
When sociologists ask questions at this level,
they're taking a broad focus, looking at the
large-scale structures that shape society.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,439
Macro questions are things like "What caused
the transition from feudalism to capitalism?"

53
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:30,009
or "How does race impact educational achievement?"

54
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,120
An orientation toward the micro, of course,
means looking at the small.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,060
These questions are concerned more narrowly with
interactions between individuals, asking things like:

56
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,560
"Do doctors talk to patients of different
races differently?"

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,560
or "How do the members of a certain group
build a group identity?"

58
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:46,669
Now, it's worth noting that these orientations
aren't completely separate.

59
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,719
Because, again, the big and the small are
always connected.

60
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,019
Asking how doctors talk to patients of different
races is a micro question, but it also helps

61
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,030
us begin to understand the macro-level pattern
of racial disparities in healthcare.

62
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,520
Likewise, asking about how a group builds
its identity could have macro impacts,

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,460
because it could help explain how large social
structures are reproduced and maintained.

64
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,120
Now that we understand a little more about
the different scales that sociology works on,

65
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:12,559
we can turn to its main theoretical paradigms,
of which there are three:

66
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,939
There’s structural functionalism, conflict
theory, and symbolic interactionism.

67
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:20,939
Let’s start with structural functionalism,
which originated with a French sociologist
named Emile Durkheim.

68
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:26,819
Durkheim imagined society as a kind of organism,
with different parts that all worked together to
keep it alive and in good health.

69
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,699
Of course, things could go wrong.

70
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:34,259
But this was always imagined by Durkheim
as a malfunction, an illness, or a deviation from
the normal functioning of things.

71
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,860
So the structural functionalist perspective
makes this same basic assumption:

72
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,620
Society is seen as a complex system whose parts
work together to promote stability and social order.

73
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,319
And these different “parts" of society are social
structures, relatively stable patterns of social behavior.

74
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,599
For example, Durkheim was extremely interested
in religion, and also in the division of labor,

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,680
or how tasks in a society are divided up.

76
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,389
And these structures are seen as fulfilling
certain social functions.

77
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,199
For instance, the family, in most societies,
fulfills the function of socializing children –
teaching them how to live in that society.

78
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,019
And social functions come in two types: manifest
and latent functions.

79
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:12,740
Manifest functions are intended or obvious
consequences of a particular structure, while latent
functions are unintended or unrecognized.

80
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,900
For example, we often think of the purpose
of schools as providing children with knowledge
– that’s their manifest function.

81
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,239
But, schools can also help socialize children.

82
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,040
They can have – and historically have had
– the additional purpose of creating workers
who listen to authority and hit deadlines.

83
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,460
That’s a latent function.

84
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:34,519
Now, along with functions, we also have social
dysfunction, which is any social pattern that
disrupts the smooth operation of society.

85
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:39,539
Technological development is a powerful driver
of economic improvement, for example, which
is a useful function.

86
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,639
But it’s also a destabilizing force.

87
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,740
New machines can put people out of work.

88
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,480
Someday soon, we may see the social dysfunction
of thousands of long distance truckers being
displaced by self-driving vehicles.

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,560
And this brings us to one of the problems
with structural functionalism.

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,759
Since it sees society as fundamentally functional
and stable, it can be really bad at dealing with change.

91
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,839
It can be bad at providing good
explanations for why change happens,

92
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,099
and it can also interpret bad things in
society as having positive functions, which should
therefore not be changed.

93
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,100
To take an extreme example, a structural
functionalist view might imagine that poverty,

94
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,860
although harmful to people, is functional
for society, because it ensures there are always
people who want work.

95
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,900
So this view might see any attempts at alleviating
poverty as being potentially damaging to society.

96
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,819
It’s in areas like this, however, where
conflict theories shine.

97
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:33,659
In contrast to structural functionalism, conflict theories imagine society as being composed of different groups that struggle over scarce resources – like power, money, land, food, or status.

98
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,000
This view takes change as being fundamental
to society, constantly driven by these conflicts.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,639
The first conflict theory in sociology was
the theory of class conflict, advanced by Karl Marx.

100
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,599
This theory imagines society as having different
classes based on their relationships to the means of
production – things like factories and raw materials.

101
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:58,140
Under capitalism, the two classes were the capitalists, or bourgeoisie, who own the means of production, and the workers, or proletariat, who must sell their labor to survive.

102
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,939
Marx saw this conflict between classes as
the central conflict in society and the source
of social inequality in power and wealth.

103
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:06,860
But there are other conflict theories that
focus on different kinds of groups.

104
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,639
Race-Conflict theory, for example, was first
stated sociologically by W.E.B. DuBois, another
founder of sociology.

105
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,879
It understands social inequality as the result of
conflict between different racial and ethnic groups.

106
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,800
Gender-Conflict theory, meanwhile, focuses on
the social inequalities between women and men.

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
The perspective of all three kinds of conflict
theory have been crucially important in American
history and are still important today.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,459
But the paradigms we've looked at so far are
essentially macro approaches:

109
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:36,339
Structural functionalism focuses on how large
structures fit together, and conflict theory looks at how
society defines sources of inequality and conflict.

110
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,339
But then there’s symbolic interactionism,
and it’s built to deal with micro questions.

111
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:46,779
Symbolic interactionism first appeared most
clearly in the work of German sociologist Max Weber
and his focus on Verstehen, or "understanding."

112
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:52,379
Weber believed that sociology needed to
focus on people’s individual social situations and
the meaning that they attached to them.

113
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:58,459
So, because it’s more micro-focused, symbolic
interactionism understands society as the
product of everyday social interactions.

114
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:03,459
Specifically, this school of thought is interested
in understanding the shared reality that people
create through their interactions.

115
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:10,299
It might seem weird to say that reality can
be created, but think back to the idea of
raw facts versus interpretation.

116
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,699
Waving my my hand back and forth is a raw fact,
but it only means that I'm waving hello to you because
we’ve agreed to give it that meaning.

117
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,039
For symbolic interactionism, then, there is
no big-T truth.

118
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,680
Instead, it looks at the world that we create when
we assign meaning to interactions and objects.

119
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,620
A handshake is only a greeting because we
agree that it is.

120
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,879
A dog can be a friend or food, depending on
what meaning we've given it.

121
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,939
Obviously, these three different paradigms provide
radically different ways of looking at the social world.

122
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,320
But, this is because they all grasp at different
parts of it.

123
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,900
They each give us a different lens through we can see
our social lives, just like science sometimes needs a
microscope and sometimes needs a telescope.

124
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:49,139
All of these lenses are important and, yes,
necessary for the investigation of sociological
questions.

125
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,000
Today we discussed what theoretical paradigms
are, and talked more in depth about the macro/micro
distinction.

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,340
Then we took a look at the three major
paradigms in sociology, and learned a bit about
their advantages and disadvantages.

127
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,180
Next week we're going to start learning how
these paradigms can be used to do actual
sociological research.

128
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:10,079
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr.
Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT, and it's
made with the help of all these nice people.
