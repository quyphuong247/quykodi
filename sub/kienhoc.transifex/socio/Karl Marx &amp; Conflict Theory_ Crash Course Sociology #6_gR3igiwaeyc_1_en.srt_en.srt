1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
You’ve probably heard of Karl Marx.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,599
He's remembered as the father of divisive political
movements, and his name is sometimes still thrown
around in American politics as a kind of slur.

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,160
But I don't want to talk about that.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,140
I want to talk about Marx the philosopher.
Marx the scholar.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:19,140
In the 19th century, a time defined by radical
inequality and rapid technological and political change
in Europe, Marx was concerned with one question:

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,160
What does it mean to be free?

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,859
Starting from this question, Marx developed
an entire theory of history.

8
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:29,368
And in doing so, he laid the foundation for
the paradigm of conflict theory in sociology,

9
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:35,399
ultimately pushing the discipline to look
at questions of power, inequality, and how
these things can drive societal change.

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:46,560
[Theme Music]

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,469
If Durkheim was concerned with social
solidarity, with how society hangs together, Marx
was concerned with freedom.

12
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,519
The question that Marx asked was "how can
people be free?"

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
Because humans aren’t just naturally free.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,300
When you think about it, we're actually incredibly
constrained.

15
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:06,349
Our physical bodies have all kinds of needs
we have to meet in order to survive, and they’re
needs that we're not really adapted to meet.

16
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:12,239
Like, if you take a hummingbird and put it in the
middle of a forest somewhere, it'll just go on about
its day, collecting nectar and living its life.

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,219
But if you drop a person in the middle of
the woods, they’ll probably starve.

18
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:19,439
Compared to other animals, Marx thought, we're
incredibly poorly adapted to the natural world.

19
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,099
In fact, the only way for us to survive in
nature is to change it, working together to
remake it to fit our needs.

20
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:29,319
This is labor, he said, and we must labor
cooperatively in order to survive.

21
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,879
As we labor, we change the world around us,
and gradually free ourselves from our natural
constraints.

22
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,759
But what Marx saw was that just as we freed
ourselves from these natural constraints,

23
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:39,429
we entangled ourselves in new social constraints.

24
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,560
Let's go to the Thought Bubble to explore
this some more.

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,789
Think about it like this.

26
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:46,629
Ten thousand years ago, basically everybody
spent all day trying to get food.

27
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:52,959
In this "primitive communism," as Marx called it,
people were strongly bound by natural constraints,
but socially very equal.

28
00:01:52,959 --> 00:02:01,399
Now compare that to the Middle Ages when, under feudalism, you have an entire class of people, the nobility, who never spent any time worrying about where their next meal would come from.

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,040
But you also have the peasantry, who still
worked constantly, making food.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,180
In fact, they spent a lot of their time making
food for the nobility.

31
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,640
People were producing more than they
needed to survive, but instead of that surplus
being equally distributed,

32
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,899
society was set up so that some people
simply didn't need to labor at all, while others
had to work harder.

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,980
That's not a natural constraint anymore, that's
a social one.

34
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:27,139
Working together allowed us to transcend our
natural constraints, Marx argued, but the way labor
is organized leads to massive inequalities.

35
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,279
Thanks Thought Bubble.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,319
So, central to the question of freedom for
Marx is the question of labor, how it's organized

37
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,519
and who it benefits, and how this organization
changes over time.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:43,219
This focus on labor gave rise to the perspective created by Marx and his longtime collaborator Friedrich Engels – a perspective known as historical materialism.

39
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:51,219
Historical materialism is historical because it
looks at change over time, and it's materialism because
it is concerned with these questions of material reality –

40
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:55,979
that is, how production is organized, and who has
things like food, or money, and who doesn't.

41
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,000
Now, it's not that Marx didn't care about
other things, like politics or religion.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,159
But he felt that they were secondary to the
production and control of resources.

43
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,620
And I don't mean secondary as in
less important;

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,319
I mean secondary because he thought that if you wanted to understand those things, you had to understand the material reality they were based on first.

45
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,139
In this view, the economy – that is, the
organization of labor and resources in a society

46
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,260
– was the foundation, and everything else
– politics, culture, religion, even families

47
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:25,620
– was what Marx called the superstructure,
which was built on top of material reality.

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,950
So when Marx studied history, he didn't focus
on wars and power struggles between states.

49
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,639
Instead, he saw historical development in terms of
modes of production and economic classes.

50
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,129
Now, “modes of production” might sound
like they’re about how stuff is made, but Marx
understood them as stages of history.

51
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:43,859
Primitive communism, feudalism, and capitalism
are all modes of production.

52
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,380
And modes of production are all defined by
a combination of forces of production and
relations of production.

53
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,878
Forces of production are basically the technical,
scientific, and material parts of the economy

54
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:59,180
– tools, buildings, material resources,
technology, and the human labor that makes
them go.

55
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,400
In modern capitalism, the forces of
production include things like factories, oil,
and the internal combustion engine.

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,300
But they also include cultural or social technologies,
like the idea of the assembly line and mass production.

57
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,580
The relations of production, meanwhile, define
how people organize themselves around labor.

58
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,180
Do people work for wages, or does everyone
produce and sell their own goods?

59
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,280
How does ownership or property work?

60
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,299
Is trade a central part of the economy?

61
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
These are all questions about the relations
of production.

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,500
And these questions are important because, if
you think in terms of social constraints and surplus,

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,600
the relations of production specify how the
surplus is taken from the people who produce it,
and who gets to decide how the surplus is used.

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,140
And, in capitalism, these relations aren’t
all that clear-cut.

65
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,120
For one thing, we don't have legally defined
classes.

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,840
In feudalism, being a lord or a peasant was
a legal matter.

67
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,369
If a peasant didn’t work, their lord could
legally punish them.

68
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,168
But under capitalism there aren't any legal
rules about who labors and who doesn't.

69
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:54,439
If you skip work you don’t get tossed in
jail, you just get fired.

70
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,819
But Marx was a historical materialist, so in his view,
even in feudalism, classes weren’t really defined by laws,

71
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,680
they were actually defined by their place
in the relations of production.

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,259
And when Marx looked at industrial capitalism
taking shape around him, he saw two main classes:

73
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,660
the working class (or proletariat) and the
capitalists (or the bourgeoisie).

74
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,199
The proletariat are defined by the fact that
they don’t own or control the means of production

75
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,060
– that is, the materials you need to use
in order to labor and produce goods.

76
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,819
One way of thinking about the means of production
is as the inanimate part – the actual, physical stuff –
that makes up the forces of production.

77
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,779
So this includes everything from the land
to stand on while you work,

78
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:33,739
to the raw materials you need, like trees, and coal,
and iron ore, to the tools and machines you use.

79
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:42,420
To simplify things dramatically, the proletariat are defined by the fact that, while they work in the factories and use resources to make things, they don’t own the factories or the things they make.

80
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,400
The bourgeoisie are defined by the fact that
they do own the factories and the things that
are made in them.

81
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,399
They control the means of production and the
products that come from them.

82
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:55,839
It’s this difference in who controls the means
of production, Marx said, that leads to exploitation
in capitalism, in the form of wage labor.

83
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:02,000
If the proletariat lack access to the means
of production, he argued, then they only have
one thing they can sell: their labor.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,680
And they must sell their labor.
If they don't, they starve.

85
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,379
Now you might argue that, hey, they're being
paid, right?

86
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,689
Well, Marx would counter that they’re only
being paid enough to live on, if barely.

87
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:14,779
However, Marx would also argue that they're
being paid less than the worth of what they
produce.

88
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:21,099
And it is that difference – between the value of
the wage and the value of what’s produced – which
is the source of surplus in capitalism.

89
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,800
You know this surplus as profit.

90
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,590
And the bourgeoisie get to decide what to
do with the profits.

91
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:33,119
Because of this, Marx believed that the bourgeoisie will always be looking to make profits as large as possible, both by driving down wages and by driving up productivity.

92
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,399
And this leads to one of the big problems
with capitalism: crises.

93
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,819
Specifically, crises of overproduction.

94
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,199
Other modes of production had crises, too,
but they were caused by not having enough.

95
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,859
In capitalism, for the first time in history,
there were crises of having too much.

96
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,800
We reached a point where the forces of
production were so developed that we could
produce far more than we needed.

97
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,740
But the vast majority of people couldn’t
afford to buy any of it.

98
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,960
And so we had crises where the economy
collapsed, despite the fact that there was more
than enough to go around.

99
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,759
Crises of overproduction are an example of
what Marx saw in every mode of production:

100
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,420
the contradiction between the forces of
production and the relations of production.

101
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,900
Marx understood history as a series of
advances in the forces of production –

102
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:15,079
like, greater coordination among capitalists,
more technological complexity, and more
organizational innovation.

103
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:22,050
But eventually, he said, those advances always
stall, as the forces of production run up against
the limits created by the relations of production.

104
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,800
For example, in the early days of capitalism,
the relations of production included things

105
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,259
like private ownership of property, competition
among capitalists, and wage labor.

106
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,360
And these things allowed for explosive economic
growth.

107
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,240
But eventually, these very same things became
limitations on the forces of production – stuff like
factories, technology, and human labor.

108
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,639
That’s because capitalists drove wages down in pursuit
of profit, and they competed with each other, leading to
a lack of coordination in the economy.

109
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,819
So you wound up with a population that couldn’t afford
to buy anything, while at the same time being offered
way more goods than it would ever need.

110
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,240
And, with the economy in shambles, there's
no way for the forces to keep developing –

111
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,439
there’s no money to invest in new factories
or new technologies.

112
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,680
So the relations of production that created
economic growth became precisely the things
that caused crises.

113
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,560
Marx saw this as an impasse that all modes
of production eventually meet.

114
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,050
So how do you get a society to move past it?

115
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,720
Marx said, the way forward was class conflict.

116
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,600
History is a matter of struggling classes,
he said, each aligned with either the forces
or relations of production.

117
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:25,040
The bourgeoisie are aligned with the relations of production, he said, because these relations are what allow them to extract surplus from the workers.

118
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,319
So they're quite happy with the situation
as it stands.

119
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,478
But the proletariat want change.

120
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:37,120
They want the further development of the forces of production – of which their labor makes up a large part – and they want a complete change in the relations of production.

121
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,539
They want an end to exploitation and they
want the surplus to benefit them.

122
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,879
After all, it was their labor that created
the surplus.

123
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,789
In short, they want revolution.

124
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:50,579
And so this is Marx's model of history: a
series of modes of production, composed of
forces and relations of production.

125
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,480
These forces and relations develop together
until they eventually come into conflict,

126
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,379
leading to a revolution by the oppressed class
and the institution of a totally new set of

127
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,200
relations, where the workers benefit from
the efforts of their labor.

128
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,810
Plenty of theorists followed in Marx’s wake,
taking his idea of historical materialism

129
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:08,389
and expanding it to better deal with some
of the areas that Marx had left out.

130
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:13,669
Particularly interesting here is the work
of the Italian theorist Antonio Gramsci, who
wrote in the years preceding World War II.

131
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:19,339
One of the big questions implicit in Marx’s
theory is just how the bourgeoisie manages
to stay in power so effectively.

132
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,960
And Gramsci answered this with the theory
of hegemony.

133
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:29,139
He argued that the ruling class stays in power, in part, through hegemonic culture, a dominant set of ideas that are all-pervasive and taken for granted in a society.

134
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:33,340
While they’re not necessarily right or wrong,
these ideas shape everyone's understanding

135
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,440
of the social world, blinding us to the realities
of things like economic exploitation.

136
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,100
But hegemonic ideas don’t need to be economic
ones.

137
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,940
They could just as easily be beliefs about
gender, or race.

138
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,440
And this points to possibly Marx’s biggest
impact.

139
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,260
While Marx’s model of history is specific
to economic conflict, we can see in it the

140
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,240
essence of the broader sociological paradigm
of conflict theory.

141
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,680
Conflict theory is the basic idea of looking at
power dynamics and analyzing the ways in which
struggles over power drive societal change,

142
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,759
as all kinds of groups, not just workers and
owners, fight for control over resources.

143
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:10,360
Marx’s ideas gave rise to a host of conflict theories in sociology, including Race-Conflict Theory, Gender-Conflict Theory, and Intersectional Theory.

144
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,759
These theories give us ways to understand power, control, and freedom in modern society, and we’re going to be looking at them over the next couple of weeks.

145
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,059
But for today, you learned about Karl Marx,

146
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,869
historical materialism and Marx’s basic
perspective on history.

147
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,360
You also learned about modes of production,
their development, and how they fit into Marx’s

148
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,820
overall theory of historical development,
along with class struggle and revolution.

149
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,180
And finally, we saw how Marx’s ideas gave
rise to Gramsci’s idea of hegemony, and
to conflict theories more generally.

150
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:40,109
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the
Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT, and it's
made with the help of all these nice people.

151
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,340
Our animation team is Thought Cafe, and Crash
Course is made with Adobe Creative Cloud.

152
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,110
