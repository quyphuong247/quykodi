1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,639
Do you think you’re middle class?

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:04,070
If you’re American, there’s a pretty good
chance that you do.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:10,589
In a survey conducted by the Pew Research
Center in 2015, 87% of those surveyed identified
themselves as middle class.

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,519
That’s a pretty big middle.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:19,559
But your intuition about what the middle class is –
like who it includes, and what constitutes a middle
class lifestyle – probably isn’t the full picture.

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:25,820
And a lot of questions that sociologists try to
answer are questions just like this – questions that
you think you know the answer to already.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,300
Many a person has played the armchair
sociologist at some point in their lives –

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,939
spouting off about how they think “Society
Really Works” because of their own experience.

9
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,460
Or the experience of their friend’s brother’s
roommate.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,439
We all do it.

11
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,519
But having personal opinions about the world
doesn’t make you a sociologist.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,340
Sorry.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,580
This is where sociological research comes
in:

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,570
It helps us understand society’s patterns,
even when they go against our intuitions.

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:53,619
Rather than using our gut to answer questions, we
use a research method, a systematic plan for gathering
and analyzing observations about the world.

16
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,439
This is where we’re gonna learn how to do
sociology!

17
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:07,500
[Theme Music]

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,459
First things first: Research starts with a
question.

19
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:18,019
And the key to deciding on a question is defining
the concepts that you’re studying, and making sure
that both you and your audience agree on what
those concepts mean.

20
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,780
It’s like that thing with The Dress.

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,239
Some people thought it looked black and blue,
and other people thought it looked white and gold.

22
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,879
It turns out that some things that seem totally
objective just aren’t.

23
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:35,640
And this becomes infinitely more complicated when you replace the concepts of blue or gold with concepts like the economy, poverty, parenting, education, or love.

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,680
So, what if the way I am defining poverty
isn’t how you’re imagining poverty?

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,000
What if we’re all seeing different levels of well-being
as being “poor,” but we refer to them all as “poverty”?

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,959
That won’t work.

27
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,759
So you have to define your concepts, which
becomes even more important when you get to
the next part of the research process:

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,040
Stating a hypothesis – a statement of a
possible relationship between two variables.

29
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,718
A variable is just something that can take
on many different values – it varies.

30
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,798
Hence, the name!

31
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:03,640
So before you can assign a value to a variable,
you have to operationalize it.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,740
That is, you have to define the exact variable you’re
going to measure, and exactly how you will measure it.

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:15,180
For example, you can operationalize a variable
that you want to use to understand relationships,
by defining it as “reported marital status.”

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,740
Only then can you assign each person in your sample
a number corresponding to their relationship status.

35
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,900
Like 0 if they’re married, 1 if they’re
divorced, 2 if they’ve never been married,
etc., etc., until every person is labelled.

36
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,360
And what value a variable takes on is called
its measurement.

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,960
You can measure someone’s height, you can
measure someone’s income, and you can measure
someone’s relationship status.

38
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,900
It doesn’t matter how many categories your
variable has: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 whatever.

39
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:42,329
What’s important is that the way you define
your categories is both reliable and valid.

40
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,090
Suppose you decide to use Facebook relationship
status as your measure of relationship status among
your subjects.

41
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,020
For your measurement to be reliable, you have
to be consistent in how you measure the variable.

42
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,300
So, here’s what not to do:

43
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,759
Say you have two categories for relationship
status: Single or Not Single.

44
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,719
Two different sociologists are going through the
data, assigning values based on Facebook status.

45
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,680
One decides that people who say “It’s
Complicated” get the label “Not Single,”

46
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,139
while the other decides that these people
should be called “Single.”

47
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,479
That’s not consistent.

48
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:13,060
Every person with the same characteristics
– in this case, the same relationship status –
needs to be assigned the same value.

49
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,960
And for your measurement to be valid, it has to
actually measure something that directly reflects
the concept that you’re trying to study.

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,480
Facebook relationship status may be a useful
measure of whether someone’s single or not,

51
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,409
but it’s not a valid measure of, say, their
political views.

52
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:31,479
Once you know how you want to measure your variables, your hypothesis will be an educated guess about how they’re related – often using an if-then statement.

53
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,879
Here’s an example of a hypothesis, based
on what I was talking about earlier:

54
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,439
If someone lives in a city, then they are less
likely to refer themselves as middle class.

55
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,000
In this case, geographic location is what
we call the independent variable;

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,919
it’s the variable that we think is affecting
the change in how people describe themselves.

57
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:53,299
But you can also have variables that you believe
are affected by changes in your independent variable;
these are your dependent variables.

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,460
Your hypothesis is that they change when the
independent variable changes.

59
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,960
But you have to be careful because correlation
does not always equal causation.

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,379
Correlation is what happens when two variables
move together.

61
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:08,259
It can be easy to misinterpret a correlation
to conclude that one thing causes the other,
when it really doesn’t.

62
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:11,979
For example, murder rates tend to be high
when ice cream sales are high.

63
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:16,219
But it’s ridiculous to think that more ice
cream causes more violence – or vice versa.

64
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,740
What’s missing is a third variable: heat.

65
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,900
More people commit crimes during hot months,
and more people buy ice cream then too.

66
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:28,639
OK! Once you have your hypothesis, and you
know what types of variables you need to test it,
you’re at your next step:

67
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,899
Collecting your data.

68
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,399
There are four main ways that sociologists
collect data:

69
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,560
Experiments, Surveys, Participant Observation,
and Existing Resources.

70
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,540
Experiments in sociology work much as they
do in the natural sciences, just with humans as
subjects instead of mice or atoms of beryllium.

71
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,620
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to see a real life
example of how a sociology experiment works!

72
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,160
In the 1990s, the US Department of Housing
and Urban Development conducted an experiment
known as The Moving to Opportunity study.

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,840
In it, social scientists randomly assigned
low-income families into a control group or
one of two experimental groups.

74
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,399
One group was a control group, which means
nothing was changed in their environments.

75
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,310
This allowed for a comparison between them
and the experimental groups.

76
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,439
They received a housing voucher that
allowed them to move to cheaper housing –

77
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,579
often in a better neighborhood than they
were currently in – if they wanted to.

78
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:13,579
Then, a whole bunch of data was collected
– and is still being collected –

79
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,779
on many different short and long term
outcomes, including earnings, children’s educations,
and health outcomes.

80
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:21,339
These outcomes are the experiment’s
dependent variables.

81
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,599
So we have one independent variable –
receiving the voucher or not –

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,640
and a bunch of possible dependent variables,
like earnings, education, and health outcomes.

83
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,610
In an experiment, if the change you predicted occurs
for the experimental group but not for the control group,
then your experiment supports your hypothesis.

84
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:42,080
And in the HUD experiment, sociologists compared
how the measures of well-being changed for the control
group, compared to those for the experimental group.

85
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,259
One of the findings:

86
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,300
those who received a voucher had better
mental health outcomes – such as lower rates
of depression – than those who didn’t.

87
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,759
The data from Moving to Opportunity continues to
be studied to this day and is a key source of research
into how neighborhoods affect families’ well-being.

88
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,899
Thanks Thought Bubble!

89
00:05:55,899 --> 00:06:00,539
The second method that researchers use is
a survey, where people respond to a set of
prepared questions.

90
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,900
Typically, researchers are interested in the
responses of a specific group of people –
what we call the population of interest.

91
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:10,620
Women aged 18 to 35. Veterans.
Left-handed people. Youtubers.

92
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,800
Whoever your research question is about, this
is your population.

93
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,840
But it’s unlikely you’ll be able to survey
the WHOLE population.

94
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,859
Even government-run surveys, like the Census,
don’t reach everyone.

95
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,460
So instead, you survey a sample – a smaller
group that’s representative of the population.

96
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,120
And a survey can take many forms.

97
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,319
There can be open-ended questions, or Yes
or No questions.

98
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,040
The questions can appear in many different
orders, or be phrased in different ways.

99
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,879
So, sociologists have to think carefully
about these things –

100
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,259
and about whether the structure of their survey
might bias the respondents’ answers.

101
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,279
Now, some research takes place in a much less
controlled environment.

102
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,199
Tons of sociology research is done “in the field,”
through our third method, participant observation.

103
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,379
Participant observation is when researchers
observe people by joining them in their daily routines.

104
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,019
The result of this type of research is called
an ethnography.

105
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:59,169
Researchers try to integrate themselves into
a community, hanging out with their subjects,
working with them, and so on.

106
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,420
They’re both observers and participants.

107
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,620
This type of data-collection tends to be exploratory
and descriptive.

108
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,579
You’re not trying to prove a specific hypothesis.

109
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:10,620
Instead you’re trying to understand the
lifestyle of your subject.

110
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,240
Some say that this type of research is too subjective,

111
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,280
but a major benefit of doing fieldwork is that it
lets you to gain insights into people’s behavior, in the
real world, in a way that experiments won’t.

112
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,869
Take, for example, sociologist Alice Goffman’s
field work in Philadelphia.

113
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,560
She spent six years living in a low-income,
crime-ridden neighborhood in West Philadelphia

114
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,459
where she befriended and lived with two
young African American men

115
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:36,829
and documented the ways the criminal justice system intersected and disrupted the lives of them, their families, and other members of the neighborhood.

116
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:42,379
The documentation of lived experience like
that can provide insights that you just couldn’t
get simply from looking at statistics.

117
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,980
Now, there’s one thing that’s important
note about these three types of research:

118
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,410
When researchers interact with their subjects,
whether it’s through an experiment, an interview,

119
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,240
or participant observation, they have to take
seriously the ethics of their research.

120
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,120
Sociologists are answerable to an
Institutional Review Board,

121
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,240
which ensures that all researchers take the privacy
and well-being of their subjects into consideration
when they design their research methods.

122
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,120
For example, informed consent of the subject
is a must.

123
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,360
This means that your subjects must know you’re
observing them, and must be made aware of any
risks they take by being part of your study.

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,060
Not all research methods require you to interact
with subjects though, or even collect your own data.

125
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,220
Many sociologists analyze existing sources
of data, collected by others.

126
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:26,920
The most common of these sources is government
agencies, which collect statistics on income, health,
education, employment, marriage, fertility –

127
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,040
I could keep going.

128
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,620
The point is, these data sets are much larger
and cover more years than an individual researcher
could collect on their own.

129
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:36,120
Plus, it saves time and money for the researcher.

130
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,740
Once you’ve collected your data using one of these
methods, the final step is turning that data into
information that helps answer your question of interest.

131
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,120
You can do this in two ways: through inductive
or deductive logical thought.

132
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,679
Inductive logical thought takes your observations
and uses them to build a theory.

133
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,419
You start with data and then use them to form
an idea about how the world works.

134
00:08:53,419 --> 00:09:01,279
For example, seeing the results of the Moving to Opportunity study might prompt a researcher to theorize that the neighborhood a person lives in is a key factor in their mental health.

135
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,199
Deductive logical thought, meanwhile, uses an
existing theory to inform the hypothesis you test.

136
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,460
In this case, you start with a theory and you
collect data that allows you to test the theory.

137
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:19,040
Theories about the relationship between where you live and your child’s well-being is part of what prompted the government to not just collect data on the heads of household in the HUD study, but also on their children.

138
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,159
And these two types of reasoning are not mutually
exclusive;

139
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,779
within one study, a researcher will use both
to develop theories about the social world.

140
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,459
And guess what?
You’re done!

141
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,180
Today we discussed the research method:

142
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:35,319
form a question and a hypothesis, collect
data, and analyze that data to contribute
to your theories about society.

143
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,230
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl
C. Kinney Crash Course Studio in Missoula, MT,
