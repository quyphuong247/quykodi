1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
You’re about to cross a street.
What do you do?

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,060
If there are no cars coming, do you stay at
the crosswalk, waiting for the light to change?

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:07,259
Or do you just go for it?

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,859
Do you look left first before you cross, or
do you look right?

5
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:13,160
Or maybe you just dart across the street,
shouting, ‘Hey I’m walking here!’

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,780
No matter what you do in this situation, what
you do is going to depend on culture.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,220
Now you may be thinking, how can something
like crossing the street be a cultural phenomenon?

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:26,710
Isn’t culture, like, opera and galas and
fancy art openings with tiny hor d’oeuvres?

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,620
Or maybe you think culture is bigger than
all that, that culture is your heritage, traditions

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,219
that have been passed down for generations, like
Quinceañeras, Bar Mitzvahs, or Sweet Sixteen parties.

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:42,659
The fact is, all of these things – street-crossing,
fine arts, and traditional rites of passage
– they are all part of culture.

12
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:53,679
[Theme Music]

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:01:01,500
Culture is the way that non-material objects –
like thoughts, action, language, and values – come
together with material objects to form a way of life.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,719
So you can basically break culture down into
two main components: things and ideas.

15
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:09,200
When you’re crossing the road, you can see
markers of your culture in the things around you –

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,680
the street signs, the width of the
road, the speed and style of the cars.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,400
This is material culture, the culture of things.

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,730
Books, buildings, food, clothing, transportation.

19
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:26,200
It can be everything from iconic monuments like the Statue of Liberty to something as simple as a crosswalk sign that counts down how many seconds you have to cross the street.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,060
But a lot of the culture that’s packed into
crossing the street is non-material, too.

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,560
We interpret the color red to mean stop –
because our culture has assigned red as a
symbol for stop and green for go.

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,400
And if you grew up in a country where cars
drive on the right side of the road, your parents
probably taught you to look left first before crossing.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,880
This is non-material culture, the culture
of ideas.

24
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:49,579
It’s made up of the intangible creations of human
society – values, symbols, customs, ideals.

25
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,140
Instead of the Statue of Liberty, it’s the
idea of liberty and what it means to be free.

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:02,140
For our purposes as sociologists, we’ll mainly be focusing on this second type of culture and its three main elements: symbols, values and beliefs, and norms.

27
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,659
Symbols include anything that carries a
specific meaning that’s recognized by people
who share a culture.

28
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,960
Like a stop sign. Or a gesture.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,520
If I do this [holds up one hand, palm out,
then just 1 finger], you probably know that
I mean: hold on a sec.

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,780
Non-verbal gestures like this are a form of
language, which is itself a symbolic system that
people within a culture can use to communicate.

31
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,080
Language is more than just the words you
speak or write – and it’s not just a matter of
English or French or Arabic.

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,400
The type of language you use in one cultural
setting may be entirely different than what
you’d use in another.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,939
Take how you talk to people online.

34
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,699
New linguistic styles have sprung up that
convey meaning to other people online, because
internet culture.

35
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,500
See, there’s one right there!

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,120
If you’re internet fluent, me saying ‘because’
and then a noun makes perfect sense, as a way
of glossing over a complicated explanation.

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,740
But if you’re not familiar with that particular
language, it just seems like bad grammar.

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:54,939
Whether it’s written, spoken or non-verbal, language
allows us to share the things that make up our culture,
a process known as cultural transmission.

39
00:02:54,939 --> 00:03:01,780
And one view of language is that it not only lets us communicate with each other, but that it also affects how people within a culture see the world around them.

40
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:09,759
This theory, known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, argues that a person’s thoughts and actions are influenced by the cultural lens created by the language they speak.

41
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,299
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to see an
example of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in action.

42
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,700
What gender is the moon?

43
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:20,219
For English speakers, this question might
just conjure images of the man in the moon,
but in many languages, nouns have genders.

44
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,060
And in some languages, the moon is feminine,
like the Spanish ‘la luna’.

45
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,219
But in others, the moon is masculine, like
the German ‘der mond.’

46
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,659
And this affects how Spanish and German people
perceive the moon!

47
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:35,819
In one study, Spanish and German people were asked to rate objects – which were gendered in their language – with reference to certain traits.

48
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,419
Like, is the moon beautiful?
Is the moon rugged? Is the moon forceful?

49
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:47,280
The study found that for those whose language used a masculine article, objects were more strongly associated with stereotypically masculine traits, like forcefulness.

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,120
Another study found that when a name was assigned to an object, and the name matched the gender of the word for it, it was easier for people to remember the name.

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,640
Like, “Maria Moon” tended to be remembered
more readily by Spanish-speakers than by German
speakers.

52
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,779
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

53
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,759
Now, I should mention that the Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis is one that researchers are divided on.

54
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:09,859
Benjamin Lee Whorf – the American linguist who
helped shape this theory – did his original research
on indigenous languages like Hopi and Inuit.

55
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,190
And since then, anthropologists have argued
that some of his findings don’t hold up.

56
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:19,180
For example, Whorf famously claimed that because
the Hopi language describes time differently,
the Hopi people think of time differently.

57
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:22,459
But anthropological evidence about the Hopi
people suggests otherwise.

58
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:27,779
And Whorf’s study led to a strange, and
false, stereotype that Hopi people, quote,
“have no sense of time.”

59
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:33,899
Sociology is an evolving field, and academic
disagreements like this are just one reason that
we study language and how it shapes our society.

60
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:40,849
But if language helps us communicate, shape, and
pass on culture, the next element of culture is what
helps us organize culture into moral categories.

61
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,120
Values are the cultural standards that people use
to decide what’s good or bad, what’s right or wrong.

62
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,459
They serve as the ideals and guidelines that
we live by.

63
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:54,779
Beliefs, by contrast, are more explicit than
values – beliefs are specific ideas about
what people think is true about the world.

64
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:01,779
So for example, an American value is democracy,
while a common belief is that a good political system
is one where everyone has the opportunity to vote.

65
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:07,339
Different cultures have different values,
and these values can help explain why we see
different social structures around the world.

66
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:12,959
Western countries like the United States
tend to value individualism and stress the
importance of each person’s own needs,

67
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,819
whereas Eastern countries like China tend
to value collectivism and stress the importance
of groups over individuals.

68
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,899
These different values are part of why
you’re more likely to see young adults in the US
living separately from their parents

69
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,799
and more likely to see to multi-generational
households in China.

70
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,020
Cultural values and beliefs can also help form
the guidelines for behavior within that culture.

71
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,079
These guidelines are what we call norms, or
the rules and expectations that guide behavior
within a society.

72
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,099
So giving up your seat for an elderly person?
Great.

73
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,280
Picking your nose in public?
Gross.

74
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,379
These are two ways of talking about norms.

75
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,040
A norm simply relates to what we think is
“normal”, whether something is either
culturally accepted, or not.

76
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,479
And we have three main types of norms!

77
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,360
The first are what we call folkways.

78
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,420
Folkways are the informal little rules that
kind of go without saying.

79
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:01,610
It’s not illegal to violate a folkway, but
if you do, there might be ramifications – or
what we call negative sanctions.

80
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,060
Like, if you walk onto an elevator and stand
facing the back wall instead of the door.

81
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,379
You won’t get in trouble, but other people
are gonna give you some weird looks.

82
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:14,579
And sometimes, breaking a folkway can be
a good thing, and score you some positive
sanctions from certain parts of society.

83
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,959
Like, your mom might ground you for getting a
lip ring, but your friends might think it’s really cool.

84
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:26,269
Another type of norm are mores, which are more official than folkways and tend to be codified, or formalized, as the stated rules and laws of a society.

85
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:31,939
When mores are broken, you almost always
get a negative sanction – and they’re usually
more severe than just strange looks.

86
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:37,459
Standing backward in the elevator might
make you the office weirdo, but you’ll probably
get fired if you come into work topless,

87
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:42,419
because there are strict rules about what
kinds of clothing – or lack thereof – are
appropriate for the workplace.

88
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,400
Hawaiian shirts – probably not.

89
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,359
No shirt?
You’re fired.

90
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,199
But mores aren’t universal.

91
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,939
You may get fired for showing up without a
shirt at work, but men can lay on the beach shirtless,
or walk down the street with no problem.

92
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,839
For women, these norms are different.

93
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,419
In the United States, cultural norms about
women’s bodies and sexuality mean that it’s
illegal for women to go topless in public.

94
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,100
But then in parts of Europe, social norms
are more lax about nudity, and it’s not uncommon
for women to also be shirtless at the beach.

95
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,460
The last of type of norm is the most serious
of the three: taboo.

96
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:16,639
Taboos are the norms that are crucial to a
society’s moral center, involving behaviors
that are always negatively sanctioned.

97
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,060
Taboo behaviors are never okay, no matter
the circumstance, and they violate your very
sense of decency.

98
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,740
So, killing a person: taboo or not?

99
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,740
Your first instinct might be to say, yes,
killing is awful.

100
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,160
But, while most cultures agree that life is
sacred, and murder should be illegal, it’s
not always considered wrong.

101
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,740
Most societies say it’s okay to kill in
times of war or in self defense.

102
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,300
So what is a taboo?

103
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,780
Cannibalism, incest, and child molestation are
common examples of behavior we see as taboo.

104
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:50,959
Yes, you can kill someone in self-defense, but if you
pull a Hannibal Lector and eat that person, you’re going
to jail, whether it started as self-defense or not.

105
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,399
So don’t do that.
Ever.

106
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:59,919
Norms like these and many others help societies
function well, but norms can also be a kind of constraint,
a social control that holds people back.

107
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,439
Some norms can be bad, like ones that encourage
unhealthy behavior like smoking or binge drinking.

108
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,939
But not all norms have clearly defined
moral distinctions –

109
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:13,180
like the way a culture’s emphasis on
competition pushes people toward success,
but also discourages cooperation.

110
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,220
And that’s the tricky thing about culture.

111
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,740
Most of the time you don’t notice the cultural
forces that are shaping your thoughts and actions,
because they just seem normal.

112
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,220
That’s why sociologists study culture!

113
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:30,200
We can’t notice whether our values and our norms
are good or bad unless we step back and look at them
with the analytical eye of a sociologist.

114
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,340
Today we learned what culture is and the difference
between material and non-material culture.

115
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,620
We learned about three things that make up
culture: symbols, values and beliefs, and norms.

116
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,139
We looked at how language influences culture
through the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis

117
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:47,399
and discussed the three types of norms – folkways,
mores, and taboos – which govern our daily life.

118
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,220
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT, and it's made with the help of all these nice people.
