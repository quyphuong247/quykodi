1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
How many cultures are there in the world?

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,980
We’ve talked a lot about the things that
make a culture a culture – things like norms
and symbols and languages.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:13,600
But we haven’t really discussed how you
lump all those little things together and say,  yes,
these are the things that belong together –

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,800
these things are culture A, and
these other things are culture B.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,580
So, what are the rules of culture?

6
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,959
Well, culture isn’t just about nationality,
or the language you speak.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,080
You and another person can live in the same
country and speak the same language, and still
have totally different cultural backgrounds.

8
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,169
Within a single country, even within a single
city, you see lots of different cultures,

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,640
and each person’s cultural background will
be a mishmash of many different influences.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,380
So, there really isn’t – and never will be – a single,
agreed-upon number of cultures that exist in the world.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,120
But that doesn’t mean we can’t recognize
a culture, and understand cultural patterns
and cultural change,

12
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,979
and think about how different cultures
contribute to the functioning of society.

13
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:59,899
[Theme Music]

14
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,079
Are you more likely to spend your free time
at a football game, or at a modern art gallery?

15
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,349
Do you watch NCIS or True Detective?

16
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:08,209
Do you wear JC Penney or J Crew?

17
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:13,819
These distinctions – and many more like them –
are just one way of distinguishing between cultural
patterns, in terms of social class.

18
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:17,179
Because, yes, Class affects culture,
and vice versa.

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,380
So one way of looking at culture is by examining
distinctions between low culture and high culture.

20
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:24,379
And OK, yeah, those are kinda gross sounding
terms.

21
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:28,679
But I want to be clear: High culture does
not mean better culture.

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,180
In fact, so-called low culture is also known as popular
culture, which is exactly what it sounds like:

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,080
Low or popular culture includes the cultural behaviors and ideas that are popular with most people in a society.

24
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,299
High culture, meanwhile, refers to cultural
patterns that distinguish a society’s elite.

25
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:48,920
You can sort of think of low culture versus
high culture as the People’s Choice Awards
versus the Oscars.

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,299
The Hunger Games probably weren’t gonna
be winning Best Picture at the Oscars.

27
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,920
But they were massive blockbusters, and the
original movie was voted the best movie of
2012 by the People’s Choice Awards.

28
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:01,998
By contrast, the winner of Best Picture at
the Oscars that same year was The Artist,

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,920
a black and white silent film produced by
a French production company.

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,479
Very different movies, very different types
of culture.

31
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,259
Now, you can also look at how different types
of cultural patterns work together.

32
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,810
The Hunger Games and The Artist may appeal
to different segments of society, but ultimately,

33
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,860
they both fit into mainstream American media
culture.

34
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,720
Mainstream culture includes the cultural
patterns that are broadly in line with a society’s
cultural ideals and values.

35
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:29,379
And within any society, there are also
subcultures – cultural patterns that set apart a
segment of a society’s population.

36
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:30,960
Take, for example, hipsters!

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,460
They make up a cultural group that formed around the idea of rejecting what was once considered “cool,” in favor of a different type of cultural expression.

38
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,879
Yeah, your beard and your fixed-gear bike, or your
bleach blonde hair and your thick-framed glasses –

39
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,319
they’re all part of the material culture that signifies
membership in your own specific sub-culture.

40
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,120
But, who decides what’s mainstream and what’s
a sub-culture?

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,140
I mean, the whole hipster thing has gone pretty
mainstream at this point.

42
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,339
Typically, cultural groups with the most power
and societal influence get labelled the norm,

43
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,900
and people with less power get relegated to
sub-groups.

44
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:00,519
The US is a great example of this.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:09,080
In large part because of our history as a country of immigrants, the US is often thought of as a “melting pot,” a place where many cultures come together to form a single combined culture.

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,140
But how accurate is that?

47
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:17,559
After all, each subculture is unique – and they
don’t necessarily blend together into one big cohesive
culture just because we share a country.

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,599
And more importantly, some cultures are valued
more than others in the US.

49
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,079
For example, everyone gets Christmas off
from school, because Christian culture holds
a privileged role in American society.

50
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,520
That might not seem fair, if you’re a member of a
sub-culture that isn’t folded into mainstream culture.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,469
So, it's not really a melting pot if one flavor
is overpowering all the other flavors.

52
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:38,359
And this brings me to another subject: How
we judge other cultures, and subcultures.

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,240
Humans are judgmental.
We just are.

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,560
And we’re extra judgmental when we see
someone who acts differently than how we
think people should act.

55
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,199
Ethnocentrism is the practice of judging one
culture by the standards of another.

56
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,079
In recent decades, there’s been growing
recognition that Eurocentrism – or the preference
for European cultural patterns –

57
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,450
has influenced how history has been
recorded, and how we interpret the lives
and ways of people from other cultures.

58
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:04,079
So what if, rather than trying to melt all the cultures
into one, we recognize each individual flavor?

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,160
One way to do this is by focusing research on
cultures that have historically gotten less attention.

60
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,099
For example, afrocentrism is a school of thought
that re-centers historical and sociological study on the
contributions of Africans and African-Americans.

61
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,120
Another option is expanding and equalizing
your focus.

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,000
Instead of looking at behavior through the
lens of your own culture, you can look at it through
the lens of multiculturalism –

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,120
a perspective that, rather than seeing society as a homogenous culture, recognizes cultural diversity while advocating for equal standing for all cultural traditions.

64
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,759
In this view, America is less a “melting
pot” and more like a multicultural society.

65
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,399
Still, the ways in which cultures and subcultures
fit together – if at all – can vary, depending on your
school of thought as a sociologist.

66
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:47,120
For example, from a structural functionalist
perspective, cultures form to provide order
and cohesiveness in a society.

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,800
So in that view, a melting pot of cultures
is a good thing.

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,720
But a conflict theorist might see the interactions
of sub-cultures differently.

69
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,600
Prioritizing one sub-culture over another can create
social inequalities and disenfranchise those who belong
to cultures that are at odds with the mainstream.

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,660
It’s hard to encourage individual cultural
identities without promoting divisiveness.

71
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,660
In the US at least, it’s a constant struggle.

72
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,320
But sometimes, sub-groups can be more
than simply different from mainstream culture
– they can be in active opposition to it.

73
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,399
This is what we call a counter-culture.

74
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,879
Counter-cultures push back on mainstream culture
in an attempt to change how a society functions.

75
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,540
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to take a
trip back to one of the biggest counter-cultural
periods of the 20th century: the 1960s.

76
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,560
In the United States, the 1960s were rife
with countercultures.

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,579
It was a time of beatniks, and hippies, of
protests against the Vietnam war, and of protests
for civil rights and women’s liberation.

78
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:39,250
These movements were often led by young people
and were seen as a rebellion against the culture
and values of older generations.

79
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,779
This was the era of free love, where people
embraced relationships outside of the traditionally
heterosexual and monogamous cultural norms.

80
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:50,439
Drug use – especially the use of psychedelic
drugs – was heavily associated with this sub-culture
and was celebrated in its popular culture –

81
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,149
think Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
or the Beat authors’ books about acid trips.

82
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:58,219
But this counter-culture was also a push back
politically against mainstream culture.

83
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,660
Many cornerstones of the politics of the American left
have their origins in the counter-culture of the 1960s:

84
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,280
anti-war, pro-environmentalism,
pro-civil rights, feminism, LGBTQ equality.

85
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,339
From the Stonewall riots to the Vietnam war protests,
‘60s counter-culture was where many of these issues
first reached the public consciousness.

86
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,479
Thanks Thought Bubble!

87
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,729
So, counter-cultures can often act as
catalysts for cultural change, especially if they
get big enough to gain mainstream support.

88
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:23,959
But cultures change all the time, with or
without the pushback from sub-cultures and
counter-cultures.

89
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,620
And different parts of cultures change at
different speeds.

90
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,079
Sometimes we have what’s called a cultural
lag, where some cultural elements change more
slowly than others.

91
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,979
Take how education works, for example.

92
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,730
In the US, we get the summer off from school.

93
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,680
This is a holdover from when this was a
more agricultural country, and children needed
to take time off during harvest.

94
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,800
Today, there’s no real reason for summer
vacation, other than that’s what we’ve always done.

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,220
So how does cultural change happen?

96
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:47,848
Sometimes, people invent new things that change
culture.

97
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:53,099
Cell phones, for example, have
revolutionized not just how we make phone calls,
but how we socialize and communicate.

98
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,139
And inventions don’t just have to be material.

99
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,719
Ideas, like about money or voting systems,
can also be invented and change a culture.

100
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
People also discover new things.

101
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,940
When European explorers first discovered tomatoes in Central America in the 1500s and brought them back to Europe, they completely changed the culture of food.

102
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,860
What would pizza be without tomatoes?!

103
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,160
A third cause of cultural change comes
from cultural diffusion, which is how cultural
traits spread from one culture to another.

104
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,920
Just about everything we think of as classic
“American” culture is actually borrowed and
transformed from another culture.

105
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,480
Burgers and fries?
German and Belgian, respectively.

106
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,379
The American cowboy?
An update on the Mexican vaquero.

107
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,219
The ideals of liberty and justice for all
enshrined in our founding documents?

108
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,060
Heavily influenced by French philosophers
like Rousseau and Voltaire, and British philosophers

109
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,819
like Hobbes and Locke, as well as by the Iroquois
Confederacy and its ideas of representative
democracy.

110
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,038
Whether we’re talking about material culture
or symbolic culture, we’re seeing more and

111
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,260
more aspects of culture shared across nations
and across oceans.

112
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:53,180
As symbolic interactionists see it, all of
society is about the shared reality – the
shared culture – that we create.

113
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,360
As borders get thinner, the group of people
who share a culture gets larger.

114
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,300
Whether it’s the hot dogs we get from Germany or the jazz and hip hop coming from African traditions,

115
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,100
more and more cultures overlap as technology and globalization make our world just a little bit smaller.

116
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,640
And as our society becomes more global, the
questions raised by two of our camps of sociology,

117
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,719
structural functionalism and conflict theory,
become even more pressing.

118
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,539
Are the structural functionalists right?

119
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,460
Does having a shared culture provide points
of similarity that encourage cooperation and
help societies function?

120
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,319
Or does conflict theory have it right?

121
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,719
Does culture divide us, and benefit some
members of society more than others?

122
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,819
In the end, they’re both kind of right.

123
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,879
There will always be different ways of
thinking and doing and living within a society –
but culture is the tie that binds us together.

124
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,830
Today, we learned about different types of
culture, like low culture and high culture.

125
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,920
We looked at different ways of categorizing
cultures into sub-cultures.

126
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,259
We contrasted two different ways of
looking at cultural diversity: ethno-centrism and
multi-culturalism.

127
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:49,340
We discussed the role of counter cultures
and explored how cultural change happens.

128
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:55,280
And lastly, we looked at a structural
functionalist and a conflict theory perspective
on what cultures mean for society.

129
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,289
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT, and it's made with the help of all these nice people.
