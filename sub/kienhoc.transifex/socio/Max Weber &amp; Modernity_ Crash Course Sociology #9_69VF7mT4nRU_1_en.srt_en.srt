1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,779
Take a second and imagine life just over five
hundred years ago.

2
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:04,990
Say you’re in Europe, at the tail end of
the Middle Ages.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,740
If you had to name the biggest change between
then and now, what would you choose?

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,089
Maybe the internet, or industrialization,
or the incredible advances in health and medicine.

5
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:17,500
Maybe you'd think back to Marx or Durkheim
and say that it was the shift from feudalism
to capitalism.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,879
These are all good answers.

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,609
But Max Weber had a different one.

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,588
The most important change wasn’t technical,
or economic, or political.

9
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:29,659
The biggest change, he said – the one that best
distinguishes the modern world from the traditional one
– was a difference in the way we think.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:40,480
[Theme Music]

11
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,099
Like most of the theorists we've studied so far,
Max Weber lived at the end of the 19th century,

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,840
and the turbulent changes of that
time influenced him as it did all the others.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,370
He lived during the formation of the first German
national state, and watching this process first-hand
made him concerned with understanding modern society.

14
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,439
So in his work, Weber examined some of the
defining characteristics of the modern world,

15
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,128
which sociologists have now spent over a hundred
years studying and arguing about:

16
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,219
He focused on ideas like rationalization,
bureaucracy and social stratification.

17
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,849
And when he saw where modernity was heading,
he was really worried.

18
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:15,659
But to understand what he was so worried about,
you need to understand how we got to modernity
in the first place.

19
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,979
And for Weber, the real defining features
of the transition from traditionalism and
modernity were ways of thinking.

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,040
Not modes of production or social integration,
but ideas.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,060
To think traditionally is to take the basic
set-up of the world as given.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,590
In other words, traditionalism sees the
world as having a basic order, and that order is
the way things ought to be.

23
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,600
We can see this very clearly in feudalism
and divine-right monarchies:

24
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,379
The monarch is understood as having been anointed
by God, and you owe them your allegiance regardless
of whether they're good or bad at their job.

25
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:45,899
The question of whether or not they deserve
the position never even comes up.

26
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,210
But if traditionalism takes things for granted,
modernity doesn't.

27
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,119
In modernity, everything is up for grabs.

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,260
What Weber saw when he looked at history was that societies, and people, were becoming more rational.

29
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:58,359
They were undergoing a process of rationalization.

30
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,659
And Weber's definition of rationality included
three specific things: calculability, methodical
behavior, and reflexivity.

31
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,359
Calculability means that, if we know the inputs,
we can know the outputs.

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,440
Just think of a bowl made in a factory
versus one you make yourself:

33
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:17,240
Every single bowl comes out of the factory
exactly the same, whereas no two bowls you make
by hand are gonna quite match.

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,360
Now, the reason that we know the outputs,
if we know the inputs, is because there’s methodical
behavior involved – a procedure to follow.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
In the factory, the method is in the machines.

36
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,259
So the results are going to be the same, no
matter who’s pulling the levers.

37
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:34,759
Finally, thinking rationally for Weber meant
thinking about what you're doing, in other
words, thinking reflexively.

38
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:40,139
You're constantly looking for new ways to
improve the process, for new and better and
more efficient ways to make bowls.

39
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,699
So, traditional society is the society of
individual artisans, each with their own process,
which is how it’s always been done.

40
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:53,000
But modern society is the society of explicit instructions and standardized, methodical, procedures which are always being reflected on and improved.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,620
So what caused this massive shift in how people
think?

42
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,620
What kicked off this process of rationalization?

43
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,060
Weber gave here what might seem like an unlikely
answer: religion.

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:08,280
In his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber argued that the transition from traditionalism to modernity began with the Protestant Reformation.

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,539
For hundreds of years, the Catholic Church dominated Medieval Europe until, in 1517, a German priest named Martin Luther denounced corruption in the church.

46
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,239
This set off a series of new religious movements
that radically opposed Catholic dogma.

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,200
This was the Protestant Reformation.

48
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,050
And it’s in these new movements that Weber
saw the origin of modern rationality.

49
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,260
Catholicism, after all, was the basis for
the traditional worldview.

50
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:34,459
Everything in medieval life – from the
structure of the social order to the way you farmed
– was the way it was, because God willed it.

51
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,200
By contrast, in Lutheranism, you still have
a divinely sanctioned place in the world,

52
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:42,839
but for the first time, the question of how
well you are performing your role became important.

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,259
This idea – of personal responsibility – opened
the way for another important figure in Weber’s
view of history: John Calvin.

54
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:53,299
Calvin didn’t believe that God could possibly
be concerned with anything that one measly
little human might do.

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,740
Instead, Calvin believed in predestination, the idea that your fate, whether you’re saved or damned, has already been set by God, from the beginning of the universe.

56
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,420
And there's nothing you can do to change it:
you're either one of the “elect” or you’re not.

57
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,000
So, how do you know?

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,300
Through what Calvinists called a "proof of
election.”

59
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:14,320
And here’s where personal responsibility
really comes in: The proof that you were saved
was to be found in how you lived your life.

60
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,300
So the point of your life was no longer that it
was divinely appointed – it became a matter
of how well, or how much, you work.

61
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,680
And, by extension of this logic, success
itself became proof of election:

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,430
If you’re financially successful, then that
was a sign that you were blessed by God!

63
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,180
Suddenly you didn’t just work until your needs
were met, as you did in traditional society.

64
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,840
Now the work was an end in itself, and you
worked to accumulate as much wealth as possible,
because wealth proved you were saved.

65
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,779
This is the sociological consequence of the
Protestant Reformation that Weber studied
and understood:

66
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:50,399
It transformed a communal, traditional
society into an individualistic, capitalist society –
one that was focused on economic success.

67
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,239
And I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but
modern capitalism is nothing if not rational.

68
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,980
Think about it: You must work methodically
in your calling.

69
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,460
You must constantly be reflecting on your
work, in order to work more efficiently and
productively.

70
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:04,560
And you use profit as a calculable measure
of your success.

71
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:08,370
So rationalization gets its start in religion,
around questions of how we work.

72
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,530
But Weber spent his career showing how all
of society came to be organized rationally.

73
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:20,519
In fact, if you've ever been to the DMV, you've seen what Weber argued was one of the biggest impacts of rationalization in society: the rise of bureaucracy.

74
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,019
Bureaucracy is a key part of the transition
from the traditional to the modern state,

75
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,079
and Weber identified six traits that make
it both extremely rational and very efficient:

76
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,909
It’s composed of a hierarchy of positions
with an extremely clear chain of command.

77
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,560
This hierarchy is made up of a variety of
very specialized roles and is held together
by formal, written communications.

78
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,100
The people in the bureaucracy
accomplish their work with technical competence,
according to detailed rules and regulations,

79
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,079
and they do it without regard to the particular people
they're serving – in other words, they do it impersonally.

80
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,120
And I can’t think of a better example of
all these traits than the bureaucracy you
see at the DMV.

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:59,340
The workers do their jobs competently and according to the rules, and they treat you just like they would treat anyone else, without regard for your personal characteristics, that is, impersonally.

82
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,519
But there isn't only this change in the way
the state works, there's also a change in
the way the state is obeyed.

83
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,839
In a traditional society, Weber believed that
the state ruled through traditional legitimacy:

84
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,460
people followed the king because that's how
it had always been done.

85
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:16,620
But the modern state works differently: It
rules through a combination of what we call
legal-rational and charismatic legitimacy.

86
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,639
Legal-rational legitimacy is essentially a
belief in the system itself.

87
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,839
You follow the rules because they are the
rules.

88
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,679
So, the DMV employee doesn't ask for a
certain piece of paperwork because that's how
it's always been done.

89
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
He does it because that's how the procedure
instructs him to do it.

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,699
If the manual were rewritten tomorrow, he’d
do it that way instead.

91
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,979
But there's a problem with legal-rational
legitimacy, and with bureaucracy in general:

92
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,020
If it's all about following the rules, well,
somebody needs to make the rules.

93
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:44,259
That's where charismatic legitimacy comes
in.

94
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,740
You follow the commands of a charismatic leader
because of the extraordinary characteristics
of that person.

95
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,759
So the modern state is an apparatus of
rules which are ultimately directed by a group of
charismatic leaders.

96
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,180
In the US, for instance, when we go to the polls
every four years, we're making a choice about
who’s going to direct the bureaucracy,

97
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,459
and we make that choice based on the
characteristics of the people running.

98
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,239
And here’s another one of Weber’s major
contributions to sociology:

99
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,160
The idea that the people who run to be
leaders of our bureaucracies, do so with
the support of political parties.

100
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,240
For Weber, political parties were a key example of
social stratification, or the way that people in society
are divided according to the power they hold.

101
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,280
Weber didn’t think that society was divided purely
based on economic classes, or your relationship to
the means of production, like Marx did.

102
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,979
He argued that the system was more complicated,
and consisted of three elements.

103
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,939
Like Marx, he included class, but he didn’t
think that classes had unifying interests.

104
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:35,269
Weber also included political parties, defined
broadly as groups that seek social power.

105
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:40,519
And finally, he included status groups, defined
by social honor, which includes things like
respect and prestige.

106
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,979
All three of these things, Class, Power, and
Status, affected a person’s place in society.

107
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,020
More importantly, each of these elements of
Social Stratification could vary independently.

108
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:53,579
So there could be a poor priest, say, who
is high in social prestige, but of a low class.

109
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,120
Or a lottery winner, who is of a high class
but low in status.

110
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,680
Or a bureaucrat in a political party, who
has some measure of political power, but not
necessarily money or status.

111
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:06,019
And then there are those who can turn their
fame, or status, into political power.

112
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:10,569
Unlike Marx, Weber didn’t take a particularly
critical stand on stratification in society.

113
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,750
But that doesn’t mean he didn’t see its
problems.

114
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,519
For Weber, rationalization was the defining
feature of the modern age, and he was deeply
worried about it.

115
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,019
Remember, rationalization is about three things:
calculability, methodical behavior, and reflexivity.

116
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:27,008
But it's really easy to lose reflexivity – to
stop reflecting on your work or your role

117
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:31,540
– and instead become locked in a calculated
routine that becomes meaningless and unthinking.

118
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,899
Weber worried that the systems that rationalization
built will leave behind the ideas that built them,

119
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,449
and that they’ll simply roll on forever,
meaninglessly, under their own momentum.

120
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,759
He worried that we'll become locked in what
he called an "iron cage" of bureaucratic capitalism,

121
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:51,259
from which we can’t escape; our lives will become nothing but a series of interactions based on rationalized rules with no personal meaning behind them.

122
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:55,139
This worry about meaning, and the concern
for ideas and how they shape our reality,

123
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,699
is one of the big influences that Weber handed
down to future sociologists.

124
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,920
On the micro level, these ideas were picked
up by what’s known as the symbolic interactionist
paradigm and theorists like Erving Goffman.

125
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:12,809
Meanwhile, theorists like Talcott Parsons and Jürgen Habermas took on the more macro version of these questions, looking at processes like rationalization and bureaucratization and culture more generally.

126
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:15,659
We’ll talk more about culture, and what
it is, next time.

127
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:19,449
But for now, you learned about Max Weber and
his understanding of the modern world.

128
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,650
We talked about rationalization and the transition
from traditional to modern society.

129
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:28,000
We discussed bureaucracy, legitimacy, and
social stratification in the modern state.

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,399
And we saw why Weber was so worried about
the modern world.

131
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:37,419
