And a poet to boot.
Pretty good resume, yeah?

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,480
What if I make it a bit more impressive?

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,399
That PhD from Harvard?

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,679
First Harvard PhD granted to an African American.

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,618
The civil rights organization?

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,810
The NAACP.

13
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:26,799
That magazine?

14
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:31,839
The Crisis, the longest running black publication
in the United States, in print since 1910.

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,159
This resume belongs to William Edward Burghardt
DuBois, whom you might know better as W.E.B. Dubois.

16
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,779
He was one of the earliest American sociologists,
as well as one of the first proponents of race-conflict theory.

17
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,920
And his studies of the lives of African Americans
during the Jim Crow era of American history

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,880
– and the oppression they faced – are the
cornerstones of how sociologists study race.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:01:01,600
[Theme Music]

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,180
W.E.B. Dubois was born in a small town
in Massachusetts in 1868.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,780
1868 – that’s five years after the Emancipation
Proclamation.

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,140
Three years after the end of the American
Civil War.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,750
And the same year that the 14th amendment
was passed.

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,549
At this time, race was considered a biological
construct.

25
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:21,060
Slavery, and later the Jim Crow laws – laws
in the South that enforced racial segregation

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,579
– were framed as natural consequences of the
supposed, natural inferiority of Blacks to Whites.

27
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,239
We, of course, now know that this was not
just wrong, but deeply harmful.

28
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:37,119
And more than that – the idea that race itself
is a purely biological, immutable quality is also
understood today as being simply untrue.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,640
Instead, race is thought of as a socially
constructed category of people, who share biological
traits that society has deemed important.

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,939
Yes, human beings vary a lot in how we look –
our skin color, our facial features, our body shapes,
our hair texture.

31
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:55,799
But those visual markers only become a “race”
when members of society decide that specific
markers constitute a specific racial group.

32
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,119
This is why the concept of race often changes,
across cultures and times.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,120
For example, when Dubois was alive, Irish and
Italian Americans weren’t considered ‘white,’ either.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,439
But today, try telling some Boston Southie
guy or an Italian grandma from Pittsburgh
that they’re not white.

35
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,439
See what they say.

36
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,479
Did something change about Irish and Italian
Americans biologically?

37
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,219
Of course not.
It’s how society saw them that changed.

38
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,819
And it’s that last bit – what race a person is
seen as, and how they’re treated as a result –

39
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,919
that ends up being a huge determinant
of a person’s social outcomes.

40
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,280
Dubois began to consider his race as a part of his identity, when he moved to the South to go to college, and then spent several years in Europe.

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,939
He saw how differently black people were treated
in different places, and was disillusioned about how
Americans treated him based on his skin color.

42
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:35,359
He can describe this disillusionment much
better than I can:

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,480
“One ever feels his twoness,” he wrote,
“an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts,
two unreconciled strivings; two warring id.”

44
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:49,408
This quote reveals a really critical underlying
thread in much of Dubois’ work – the idea
of double-consciousness.

45
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:57,159
Dubois argued that there are two competing identities as a Black American – seeing one’s self as an American and seeing one’s self as a Black person while living in white-centric America.

46
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,819
Living as a member of a non-dominant race,
he said, creates a fracture in your sense of
identity within that society.

47
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,629
These feelings are what fueled Dubois’ work, which focused on the disparities and conflicts between people of different races – what we now call race-conflict theory.

48
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:16,919
Today, questions of race and identity are studied by sociologists who work on racial identity theory, which looks at how individuals come to identify as a certain race.

49
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,319
Dubois didn’t only research racial identity,
though –

50
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:26,900
he also looked at the everyday lives of black and white Americans and wrote extensively about how and why their lives differed so drastically in post-slavery America.

51
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,420
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to look at
one of Dubois’ early studies of these disparities.

52
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,679
In 1896, the University of Pennsylvania hired
Dubois to do a survey on Black communities
in Philadelphia.

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,830
His work eventually became ‘The Philadelphia
Negro,’ the first published study of the living
conditions of African Americans.

54
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,340
Dubois went knocking on doors, asking people
questions about themselves and their families.

55
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,539
And there were an awful lot of doors.

56
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:51,340
All told, Dubois collected data on 9,675 African
Americans.

57
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:59,020
He focused on one specific ward of Philly – the 7th ward, a historically Black neighborhood that attracted families of all classes, from doctors and teachers, to the poor and destitute.

58
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,330
He sat in thousands of parlors, asking questions
about age, gender, education, literacy, occupations,

59
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,500
earnings, crime, and documented the ways in
which African-Americans differed from Philly’s
white residents.

60
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,550
For example, the Black population turned out
to be much younger than the White population
and had a higher proportion of women.

61
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:22,139
It also had lower literacy rates, higher rates of poverty
and crime, and a higher concentration of workers in the
service industry than in manufacturing or trade.

62
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,639
Mortality rates were higher, as was the frequency
of illness.

63
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,919
But here’s what made Dubois’ report especially
unique:

64
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:33,870
He concluded that much of the dysfunction within
Black communities came from their inferior access
to things like education and more lucrative jobs.

65
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:40,899
The reason that the black population had higher rates of death and illness, he said, was because of occupational hazards, and poverty, and less access to health care.

66
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,349
It’s hard to express just how radical Dubois’
conclusions were at the time.

67
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,420
The problems in black communities were not due to
racial inferiority, Dubois argued, but to racial prejudice.

68
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,540
And that was completely different from how
many Americans thought at the time.

69
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,700
Thanks Thought Bubble.

70
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,469
So, race doesn’t exist in a vacuum.

71
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,540
It doesn’t just imbue you with certain essential
qualities.

72
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,850
Instead, race matters because of the power
that society gives it.

73
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,660
For another example, let’s stick with Philly
and use the labor unions there in the 1890s.

74
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,850
Because of prejudice against Black workers,
and beliefs about their abilities and morals,

75
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,660
trade labor unions didn’t allow Black
workers to join.

76
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,400
And because they couldn’t join unions, many Black workers couldn’t get manufacturing or trade work – which paid much better than service work.

77
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,919
And because they couldn’t get these jobs,
Black communities had more men out of work,

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
higher rates of poverty, and more criminal
behavior.

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,980
Which then allowed the white workers and
unions to justify their decision to not allow black
 workers into their union.

80
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,600
The prevailing beliefs about race and racism
ultimately reinforced themselves.

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,260
This is what’s now known as racial formation
theory, a theory formalized by modern sociologists
Michael Omi and Howard Winant.

82
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:44,120
Racial formation refers to the process through
which social, political, and economic forces influence
how a society defines racial categories –

83
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,340
and how those racial categories in turn
end up shaping those forces.

84
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:54,339
Omi and Winant argue that the concept of race came about as a tool to justify and maintain the economic and political power held by those of European descent.

85
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:58,579
Another modern look at these issues can be
seen in the work of sociologist William Julius
Wilson.

86
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:03,529
He explores why Black and White Americans
tend to have such different outcomes in terms
of income, education, and more.

87
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,179
And he argues that class, not race, is the
determining factor for many Black Americans.

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,910
But the reasons that these class gaps exist
to begin with, come from the structural disadvantages
that date back to Dubois’ time.

89
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:20,120
Dubois continued to research the ways in which
prejudice, segregation, and lack of access to education
and jobs were holding back African Americans.

90
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:30,220
A strong advocate of education and of challenging Jim Crow laws, he clashed with another leading black intellectual of the time, Booker T. Washington, who advocated compromise with the predominantly white political system.

91
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,180
Over time, DuBois grew frustrated with the
limits of scholarship in affecting change,

92
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:36,410
so he turned to direct activism and political
writing.

93
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:45,689
In 1909, he co-founded the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People or the NAACP,
and was the editor and intellectual driving force behind
its magazine, The Crisis.

94
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:50,680
The NAACP fought against lynching, segregation
of schools, voting disenfranchisement, and much more.

95
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,180
It used journalism as one of its most powerful
tools, publishing the records of thousands of
lynchings over a thirty year period.

96
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,600
And it used lawsuits, targeting voter disenfranchisement
and school segregation in decade-long court battles.

97
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,900
And, after DuBois’ time, it went on to become
part of many of the landmark moments in the
fight for civil rights,

98
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:10,079
including the Brown vs. Board of
Education case, the Montgomery Bus Boycott
and the March on Washington.

99
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,959
Modern sociologists continue Dubois’ work
on racial politics, asking the question:

100
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,279
How is race intertwined with political power,
and the institutional structures within a society?

101
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:23,899
Sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, for example,
argues that we now have what he calls “racism
without racists.”

102
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:31,639
What he means is: Explicitly racist views have become less socially acceptable, so fewer people are willing to say that they don’t think Black and White Americans should have equal rights.

103
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,599
But, as Bonilla-Silva points out, that doesn’t
mean racism is a thing of the past.

104
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,150
Instead, he says, structural racism – the kind that’s entrenched in political and legal structures – still holds back the progress of racial minorities.

105
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:47,839
Take, for example, the fact that the median
wealth of white Americans is 13 times higher than
the median wealth of black Americans.

106
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,060
Now, you could look at that and say, well, black people
just aren’t as good at saving as white people.

107
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,339
After all, it’s not like there’s anything legally
preventing them from making or saving more money.

108
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,219
But that completely ignores the ways in which
wealth builds up over generations.

109
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,720
Past generations of Black Americans were unable
to build wealth, because they had far less access
to higher incomes, banking services, and housing.

110
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,480
These ideas about how the structures of power
interact with race may have their origins in Dubois’ work,
but they continue today.

111
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,620
And so do his studies of racial resistance.

112
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,740
Researchers of racial resistance ask: How
do different racial groups challenge and change
the structures of power?

113
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,620
Sometimes racial resistance is easy to see
in society.

114
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,480
Think the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s
and 60s, or Black Lives Matter today.

115
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,180
But sociologists can also look at more subtle
forms of resistance, too, like resistance
against racial ideas and stereotypes.

116
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:39,379
For example, sociologist Patricia Hill Collins has written about the different relationships that black and white women have had with marriage and staying home to raise a family.

117
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:44,879
In the feminist movement of the 1960s and
70s, one of its key issues was the exclusion
of women from the workforce.

118
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,439
Entering the workforce was seen as a form
of resistance.

119
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,020
But Black women have, for most of
American history, been forced to work, or needed
to work to help support their families.

120
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,139
For them, Collins argues, joining the workforce
is not resistance.

121
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:01,460
Instead, staying at home to care for their
families can be an act of resistance against
society’s expectations for Black women.

122
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,259
All of these modern fields of study within
race-conflict theory – racial identity,

123
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:11,899
racial formation, racial politics, and racial
resistance – they all have their origins in the work of
one sociologist: W.E.B. Dubois.

124
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:17,120
Today we talked about W.E.B. Dubois, one of
the founders of sociological thought and the founder
of race-conflict theory.

125
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,500
We talked about race and how our understanding
of how we define race has changed over time.

126
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,759
We talked about Dubois’ idea of ‘double-consciousness’ and how it relates to the modern day field of racial identity.

127
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:38,639
We introduced the idea of racial formation and used Dubois’ survey of African Americans in Philadelphia to look at how economic, political, and social structures affect how we perceive different races – and vice versa.

128
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:48,620
And finally, we looked at the activist side of Dubois’ life as co-founder of the NAACP and editor of the Crisis, and discussed how modern day sociologists study racial politics and racial resistance.

129
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,460
Next time, we’ll take a look at some of
the sociologists who were at the forefront of a different type of conflict theory: gender-conflict theory.

130
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,500
