Here,
two actions are distinguished.

56
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:45,279
‘tackling causes’,
or doing things the right way called Mitigation

57
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:49,239
and ‘handlding impacts’ or responding
to negative effects.

58
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,590
calles Adaption Presenter The Intercontinental
Panel for Climate Change,

59
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,559
calculated the potential for different sectors,
to mitigate,

60
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:03,709
and by doing so where most potential to achieve
carbon reductions are.

61
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,799
As you can see in the graph,
in particular buildings,

62
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,120
transport and energy supply are key sectors
to achieve positive change,

63
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,499
towards a sustainable society.

64
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:18,600
Often such change,
be it mitigation or adaptation is related

65
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,480
to trying to achieve to change the way we
organize our society,

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,319
from one based in linear flows of input and
output.

67
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:33,610
into one which is based on curcular flows,
where output can become input again.

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,500
Often referred to as renewables.

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,020
And this is strongly related to this video’s
theme of ‘Urban Services and Infrastructures’.

70
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,729
‘Infra’ is Latin,
and refers to ‘below’.

71
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:52,060
Infrastructures are defined as the essential,
or fundamental facilities and systems serving

72
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,530
a country,
city of area,

73
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:01,259
including the services and facilities necessary
for its economy to function.

74
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,080
Of course it doesn’t refer only to ‘structures’
below the ground,

75
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,620
infrastuctures are all over to provide our
society with essential services,

76
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,120
such as transportation of people,
goods,

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,310
energy and water.

78
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,620
The importance of infrastructure for our society
has increased significantly.

79
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,900
As UN Habitat already implied by including
infrastructure as a main indicator of prosperity

80
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,199
At the moment infrastructure often drives
urban development.

81
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,580
Which is referred to as the existing ‘paradigm’,
as originally this was the other way around

82
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,020
namely that urban development defined infrastructures.

83
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,919
For this reason I will take you one step back.

84
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,189
To the need for infrastructure.

85
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:51,860
What defines the need for infrastructure?

86
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,860
This is called the ‘Suprastructure’,
and defined as the different standards of

87
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,699
societal needs and goals.

88
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,840
To define the need for infrastructure we should
look at the relation between infrastructures,

89
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,879
buildings and systems with the societal goals
that are aimed at.

90
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:15,289
There are so-called fundamental needs to support
societal goals.

91
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,750
these fundamental needs are the same for every
human on earth.

92
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,020
the are:
support (like provision of food etc.),

93
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,180
protection (like a roof above the head,
etc.),

94
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,340
affection,
understanding,

95
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,500
participation,
relaxation,

96
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,219
expression and freedom.

97
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:41,550
Cities are physical expressions of social
structures and the fulfilment of these fundamental

98
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,860
needs.

99
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,430
Activities to sustain fundamental needs can
be called urban services.

100
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,639
Examples are transportation of material flows,
supply of water,

101
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,009
energy etcetera,
but also housing or cultivation and provision

102
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,949
of food.

103
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,999
Such urban services can be materialized.

104
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:08,389
This is what we know as transportation infrastructure,
public utilities like sewerage,

105
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,599
ICT et cetera.

106
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,560
But this also concerns urban ordening and
planning and land development.
