Hello. So, today we are going to visit professor
Rik Leemans. Rik is professor in environmental

2
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:42,390
system analysis. And he also contributed to
this big report of the intergovernmental panel

3
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,210
on climate change. So let’s see what he
is going to tell us.

4
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,360
Hello Rik.
Hi Huub.

5
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,380
Nice meet you again.
Good to see you.

6
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,899
I would like to ask a few questions about
Climate change.

7
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,019
That’s possible, that’s possible, let’s
sit down.

8
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,899
Oke!
SO Rik, climate change, what is that actually?

9
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:16,979
What kind of climate change are you hinting
at. Is this the long term metro climate change.

10
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,869
Climate has been changing throughout the history
of the earth. We have had the ice ages, we

11
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:28,979
had major volcano outbreaks. Climate change
is in principle metro, but over the last 150

12
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:35,329
years we really see a climate change which
is caused by humans. Its caused by our use

13
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:42,200
of energy, our use of different resources.
And if you look at energy, the fossil fuels

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,359
especially, coal, oil, natural gas. We use
an enormous amount of those fuels and if you

15
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:56,149
burn them they release CO2 into the atmosphere.
If you change forest into agricultural land

16
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,829
the forests are burnt and that produces CO2
in the atmosphere. If you use cement, or you

17
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,579
produce cement, every ton of cement is a ton
of CO2 and that ends up in the atmosphere.

18
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:14,099
And besides CO2, which is the major greenhouse
gas, we also have some others like methane

19
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:21,410
which comes from cattle, from wetlands, from
mining. N2O, or laughing gas, which very much

20
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:27,810
comes from fertilizer and manure use.
Especially this CO2 I understood that this

21
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,820
stays very long in the atmosphere.
Yes, at the moment we emit about 11 gigaton

22
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:45,910
of CO2. That is 10 to the 18th ton of CO2.
That is an enormous amount. About 25% of that

23
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:52,200
amount is taken up by the oceans and about
25% is taken up by all plants in the world.

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,050
The rest remains in the atmosphere and contributes
to the increase of concentrations of CO2.

25
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,770
If we look at the greenhouse gasses CO2 is
the most important. Its most important because

26
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,370
it has a high concentration in the atmosphere
compared to the other greenhouse gasses. And

27
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,480
it sits in the atmosphere for more than 1000
years. So every molecule of CO2 that you don’t

28
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,090
emit has an impact over a period of 1000 years.
Methane is a much, much stronger greenhouse

29
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:30,060
gas but only sits in the atmosphere for about
20 years and then is broken down to CO2. N2O

30
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:37,080
or laughing gas also has a relatively long
period in the atmosphere, 70 to 80 years,

31
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,710
and this is a strong greenhouse gas but the
concentration is about a 1000 times lower

32
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,830
than that of CO2.
The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is

33
00:03:47,830 --> 00:04:01,710
now 400ppm. That means 1 molecule in the air,
compared to 2500 other molecules is CO2. Yes.

34
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,480
How come that such a little amount is causing
such a global effect?

35
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,740
These concentrations are very, very small.
But the power of CO2 and the other greenhouse

36
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,680
gas is that they absorb heat in the atmosphere
and radiate them in all directions. So the

37
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,270
heat doesn’t escape to space anymore. And
that’s the radiative force of CO2. The concentration

38
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,199
is small and maybe you say, we can ignore
it. But if you look at small concentrations,

39
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:39,229
they can definitively have an impact. Think
about 3 glasses of beer. If you are sober,

40
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:45,039
you drink 3 glasses of beer, the content of
alcohol in your blood is about 400ppm and

41
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:52,039
then you are not allowed to drive anymore.
Your behaviour has changed. So small concentrations

42
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,360
do matter.
So our atmosphere is at the moment a little

43
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,770
bit drunk?
It is at least disturbed. Influenced by humans.

44
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:10,370
Ok, and then, if you look at cities, the urban
environment. How is then this climate change

45
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,080
having an impact on the urban environment
and how important is that for us?

46
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,349
Now if we look at climate change, it is getting
warmer. A warmer atmosphere holds more water,

47
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:26,389
so you also get more precipitation. And most
of this precipitation, if it is getting warmer,

48
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:32,229
we get more thunder storms. So heavy rain
showers. and if we look especially at city

49
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:38,270
environments, city environments warm up very,
very easily, with all the concrete etc. So

50
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:46,779
a heat wave in a city would be much more severe
than for example in a forest or in a large

51
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:51,590
park. You can easily see that with central
park in New York. That is about 5 degrees

52
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,999
cooler than the surrounding cities. And the
other impact is very much the big storms,

53
00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:04,680
or the big thunder storms which give a lot
of rain and lead to local flooding, problems
