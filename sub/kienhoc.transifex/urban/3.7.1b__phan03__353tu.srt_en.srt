Multi-level and networked governance also
present us with new challenges:

84
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,830
if decision-making is shared across multiple
level and networks,

85
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,930
who is ultimately responsible for the outcomes
of policies and decisions?

86
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,690
There is a huge problem of accountability.

87
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,430
Also,
decisions making never takes place in leveled

88
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,170
arenas:
different actors have very different capacities,

89
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,510
voices and access to information and knowledge.

90
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,400
There are huge asymmetries of power.

91
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,169
There are also vulnerable groups who have
a hard time making their voices heard:

92
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:06,650
ethnic minorities,
the elderly,

93
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,859
children and women,
for example,

94
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:16,300
have had traditionally little saying on how
cities are managed and designed.

95
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,419
For this reason,
some planners and designers have taken up

96
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:25,359
the task to become advocates for these groups,
in order to make their voices heard in metropolitan

97
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,980
innovation.

98
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:34,800
PARTICIPATION and ADVOCACY IN PLANNING AND
DESIGN PROCESSES ARE ON THE RISE.

99
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,650
Advocacy is just one of the multiple roles
metropolitan innovators can have in governance-based

100
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,870
design.

101
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,720
They could be managers,
articulators,

102
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,760
negotiators,
facilitators,

103
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,370
directors,
process designers there is a VARIETY of new

104
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,919
roles emerging in a context of deep societal
change.

105
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,229
This is very different from the traditional
roles metropolitan innovators have had in

106
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,449
the past.

107
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,20
What do you want YOUR role to be?

108
00:08:07,20 --> 00:08:10,479
Metropolitan innovators themselves have changed.

109
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,780
While this role has been traditionally occupied
by MEN,

110
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,590
we can now observe that many more women,
members of ethnic and religious minorities

111
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,789
are planning and designing cities in countries
around the world.

112
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,100
So to summarize,
understanding the roles and interests of a

113
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:33,430
large number of actors will help you:
define the challenge at hand and address it

114
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,120
in a more realistic way.

115
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,000
Collect relevant knowledge from a variety
of actors that would otherwise not be accessible

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,20
to you design implementation processes that
will ensure the success of your project finally,

117
00:08:50,20 --> 00:08:55,980
it will enable you to design new relationships
that will empower people and make them participants

118
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,990
of metropolitan innovation.

119
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,790
This will strengthen democracy and ensure
social sustainability.

120
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:10,579
I hope you start imagining what kinds of partnerships
and synergies between actors you can promote

121
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,590
in your projects to achieve a sustainable,
fair and prosperous city.
