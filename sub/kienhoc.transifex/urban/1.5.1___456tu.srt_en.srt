Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:15,360
In this video I will briefly explain to you
what natural resources are.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,200
A natural resource is anything that people
can use which comes from nature.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,580
People do not make natural resources,
but gather them from the earth.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,600
Examples of natural resources are air,
wood,

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,759
coal,
oil,

7
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,919
Water,
iron,

8
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:32,989
and forest.

9
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:35,210
To mention just a few...

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,660
Some of these resources are renewable.

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,989
These are resources that can be naturally
replenished.

12
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,710
Such as air,
water and timber.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,219
While non-renewable resources are resources
where the consumption in a certain time interval

14
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,390
is exceeding the re-generation in the same
time interval.

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,179
Coal and oil and gas,
are the most widely known examples of non-renewable

16
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,030
resources.

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,659
These are so called fossil fuels.

18
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,870
And the name says it all,
their origin is prehistoric .

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,880
The origins of these reserves lie millions
of years in the past.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,680
Dead algae and trees were covered with sediments
and given enough time and pressure.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,110
They changed their molecular structure and
turned into oil,

22
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,090
gas or coal as we know it today.

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:29,800
So these large reserves are essentially non-renewable,
because we consume them faster than they are regenerated.

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,720
This is why people now look for energy sources
that are so called renewables Including solar

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,050
power,
wind power or biomass rape seed seen here

26
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,970
in the yellow flowers or palm oil to produce
for instance biodiesel.

27
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,950
These are renewable energy sources because
the energy can be produced over and over again.

28
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,270
But the example of palm oil and rapeseed highlights
a problem with renewables.

29
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,090
If a renewable resources is consumed faster
than it can be renewed or if its production

30
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,580
is causing other damage then this resource
in not long renewable or sustainable So,

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,810
for instance for palm oil there is a controversy
about the fact that promotion of palm oil,

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,189
as a renewable energy source,
is causing deforestation and conversion of

33
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:29,499
agricultural land away from local food production
to palm oil production for export.

34
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,439
Another example is fish.

35
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,909
Fish is a renewable resources because,
if managed well,

36
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:39,829
it can re-produced at the same rate or faster
than they are used up.

37
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:44,109
As you can see,
>25% of the global fish reserves are over

38
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:47,519
exploited,
depleted or recovering from depletion,

39
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
about 50% being fully exploited.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,260
While only the remainder is moderately exploited
or underexploited.

41
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,930
Similarly water.

42
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:06,090
In many places of this world water resources
are severely over exploited for agriculture and cities.

43
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:12,709
Such as here in California or here the irrigation
areas in the middle of the desert in Saudi

44
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:13,969
Arabia.

45
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:18,159
So,
I invite you to discover the intricacies related

46
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,689
to making our urban areas and cities reliable
only on sustainable renewable resources.

47
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:27,139
I am sure you gone join me and my colleagues!

48
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,379
Right?
