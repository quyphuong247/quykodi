between water and land transportation,
port cities have thus grown as places of transshipment

50
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,349
to take advantage of water access.

51
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,959
Each adapted its form and function to unique
local geographies,

52
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,969
topographies,
political,

53
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:59,870
economic or historical situations,
as exemplified here through the city of Aden

54
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,489
in Yemen â€¦ or Havana in the Caribbean.

55
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,090
The function of port cities goes beyond that
of transshipment,

56
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,260
storage and land-sea connection.

57
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,829
These cities are also the sites of headquarters,
small and big,

58
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,150
including the imposing structures of the East
India Company in London or the Dutch East

59
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,879
India Company in Amsterdam.

60
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,120
Such headquarter buildings highlighted the
companies importance at home,

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,180
but also throughout their respective empires.

62
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,389
In Canton,
todays Guanzhou China,

63
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,960
for example,
the waterfront served as the business card

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,419
of the foreign traders or factors.

65
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:50,569
They designed the company headquarters in
classical European styles,

66
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:58,129
and marked them with flags for all arriving
ships to be seen.

67
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:04,520
Port activities often transcends the areas
dedicated to the transhipment of goods.

68
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,090
Traders,
and other people associated shipping developed

69
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:15,860
living and leisure spaces throughout the urban
area connecting the port often to the entire

70
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,280
city,.

71
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,090
Each waterfront is different and its select
appearance contributes to the construction

72
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,810
of local identities and imagery,
as seen here in the port of Piraeus.

73
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,539
Ships travel the sea on diverse and often
changing routes,

74
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:39,849
allowing for easy adaptation to changing political
and economic situations in the foreland,

75
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,830
as this map of the British Empire suggests.

76
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,930
To be part of shipping networks,
ports have to provide appropriate facilities

77
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,960
for similar (and evolving) ships sizes and
types,

78
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,259
depth and containers.

79
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,389
In the case of Bristol,
shown here,

80
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:03,770
that meant overcoming challenges such as tidal
fluctuations of 9 meters.

81
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:09,740
To keep their place in port rankings,
port cities had to adapt their facilities

82
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,379
rapidly to changing shipping technologies
and new forms of administration.

83
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,919
Controlling water,
transforming coastlines and hinterland infrastructures

84
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,389
was a key to port survival and an issue of
national importance.

85
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:30,020
Once rivers and shores became too crowded,
rendering transhipment impractical,

86
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,720
governments and shipping companies built new
docks to control water height despite tidal

87
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,110
changes,
as was the case in London,

88
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,169
where a group of powerful businessmen lobbied
Parliament to allow the creation of a West

89
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,139
India Dock Company.

90
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,319
Authorised in 1799,
by the West India Dock Act 1799 the docks

91
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,139
opened in 1802.

92
00:06:54,139 --> 00:07:00,069
Liverpool similarly developed large docklands
with warehouses.

93
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,069
Many cities followed the London example,
others,

94
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,900
like Hamburg opted for tidal harbors,
here the Sandtorkai (1866),

95
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:15,659
to allow for unloading despite changing river
levels as docks would have strangled harbor

96
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:23,780
traffic The growing number of steamships required
yet another round of transformations:
