00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,870

in other words:
changes in the shares of cars,

37
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,239
public transport,
walking and cycling.

38
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:23,489
Such a change occurred in the centers of many
western cities between 1967 and 1973:

39
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,480
Cities started to realize that building more
roads and parking places was not the way to

40
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,299
proceed.

41
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,669
Instead city centers needed to be attractive
and livable places,

42
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:42,449
not dominated by cars,
even though this came at the cost of the ease

43
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:47,499
of travelling by car to and in the city center.

44
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:54,499
City centers became more attractive for walking
and in some cases also for the bike.

45
00:03:54,499 --> 00:04:00,769
And travelling by public transport to and
within the city became important as well.

46
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:06,779
In addition,
such centers became safer and the mode shift

47
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:12,139
resulted in less CO2 emissions,
air pollution and noise.

48
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:19,729
I think the main challenge is to reduce the
use of aircraft and cars,

49
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:27,220
and increase the use of public transport,
and the share of walking and cycling.

50
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,930
But cars will remain important for decades,
so another challenge is to shift to more fuel

51
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,009
efficient cars,
and less CO2 emitting cars,

52
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,659
and maybe shared cars.

53
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:47,909
Land use and transport planning can stimulate
a shift away from individual car use,

54
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:53,759
both for reasons of livability,
as well as because of accessibility and climate

55
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,620
change.

56
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,460
Such policies are not necessarily expensive
policies.

57
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,930
For example,
policies aiming to stimulate cycling are relatively

58
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,740
cheap.

59
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,979
Since some years many cities worldwide encourage
cycling,

60
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,539
examples being London,
New York,

61
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:19,340
Paris,
Bogota and Santiago (Chile).

62
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,449
The shift away from conventional cars to cleaner
cars,

63
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:29,379
public transport and walking and cycling will
make cities much more attractive,

64
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:35,280
and will reduce CO2 emissions,
air pollution and noise.

65
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,129
A final remark:
There is often more resistance from people

66
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,530
before than after implementation.

67
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:50,169
This means that it takes brave policy makers
to implement controversial policies,

68
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,889
but after implementation people will often
increasingly appreciate these policies.
