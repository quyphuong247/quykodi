scale design interventions.

43
00:04:52,559 --> 00:05:00,639
But also the ambiance of the space you are
in has an influence on how you experience the temperature.

44
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,689
And this ambiance can also be manipulated
through the design of the space.

45
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:14,330
I will show you in the following, which types
of design interventions are apt to change

46
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:21,169
temperature related factors, wind and ambiance.

47
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:28,650
If you want to provide shade close to buildings,
you can shape the buildings themselves accordingly,

48
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:38,279
for instance by building arcades under the
buildings- such as in the plaza Mayor in Madrid.

49
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:45,169
by additions to buildings such as the louver
balcony in Salzburg.

50
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:52,639
If you want to provide shade in public spaces,
you can use fixed elements or flexible elements

51
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,479
such as the movable curtains above a street
in St.

52
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,080
Barbara.

53
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,789
or flexible elements such as the movable awnings
in Mumbai.

54
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:08,559
If you want to create shade, you can- of course
– also use vegetation.

55
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:16,479
The vegetation can consist of free standing
trees or hedgerows, but it can also grow on

56
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,199
trellises or pergolas.

57
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,369
The great advantage of vegetation is that
it also tempers the air temperature through

58
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:27,249
evapotranspiration.

59
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:33,419
If you might know, evapotranspiration is the
water that is emitted by plants via their

60
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,099
stomata.

61
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:42,180
So vegetation does a ‘double duty’ for
prevention of urban heat.

62
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,839
This cooling effect of greenery - through
evapotranspiration- can also be enhanced in

63
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,589
places where shade for people outdoors is
not so important.

64
00:06:52,589 --> 00:07:00,849
For instance, green walls and green roofs-
in case they are really thick green roofs-

65
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:06,189
can lower air temperatures and also the temperature
in the buildings themselves.

66
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:12,279
And of course- also water can help cool the
air temperature, but only when it is very

67
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,960
finely dispersed!

68
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,319
It is really important that the water is moving
because still waterbodies actually store heart

69
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,069
and will emit extra heat in warm nights.

70
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:31,830
As we know, wind can be a nuisance and should
then be blocked- for instance with wind shields

71
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,559
or with hedgerows.

72
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:40,529
When the wind shelters are a bit permeable
for air flows, the wind protected area behind

73
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,229
them actually is bigger.

74
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:51,129
Obviously, it is sometimes desired to actually
have some ventilation.

75
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:57,199
Then it is important to actually keep areas
in the city and in the city fringes open,

76
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:04,759
such as open squares, water surfaces or open
parks so that the wind can roam freely.

77
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,699
Last but not least- in urban design it is
also possible to influence the ambiance of

78
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:17,990
a space- for instance, in Western Europe people
like to stay in urban environments that have

79
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:27,969
warm colours and materials and they feel thermally
comfortable there.

80
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:34,669
But in other countries people have other preferences.

81
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:41,059
In which materials and colours of an urban
environment would you feel thermally comfortable?
