those that are particularly prone to climate
risk, such as flooding.

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,370
But those with more resources and better networks
have better chances to leave the city when

41
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,570
a disaster hits.

42
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:08,540
But without proper policies and evacuation
plans, also such outward migration can become

43
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,710
chaotic and add to the distress.

44
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:16,010
These two response scenarios were for instance
clearly visible when hurricane Katrina hit

45
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,560
New Orleans in 2005.

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,550
The Middle class was largely able to flee
New Orleans in advance - due to higher levels

47
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,700
of network capital – they owned a car, they
had contacts outside the city.

48
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,000
But the poor were left behind – as they
for instance did not own a car and there was

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,490
no well-functioning public transport.

50
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,560
The US government was also not well prepared
to assist those who were left behind.

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,710
Systems of provisioning collapsed of for instance
food, energy, water, medical supplies, which

52
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,810
added to the vulnerability of the urban poor.

53
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,430
Whilst the risks for local communities are
growing, there is still a lack of effective

54
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,780
governance strategies that protect climate
migrants, including those who are forced to

55
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,280
stay behind.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,010
Most attention goes to the development of
global or national protection frameworks for

57
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,530
climate migrants.

58
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,840
But coherent policies and governance strategies
on the urban level are still in a very early

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,720
stage.

60
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,170
To further promote urban governance responses
to the problem of climate migration, a good

61
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,410
starting point is for cities to discuss this
topic in transnational city networks.

62
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,500
These networks facilitate learning as best-practice
exchange.

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,439
Such discussions should not just focus only
on better infrastructural strategies to protect

64
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,740
densely populated areas, but also aim to ensure
a more coordinated disaster response and inclusive

65
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,530
policies that protect the urban poor and marginalized
groups.

66
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:45,120
A city network that may offer such a response
is the Asian cities climate change resilience network.

67
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:50,509
One of its objectives it to promote a more
holistic approach to adaptation.

68
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:56,330
It does so by moving away from endorsing only
technical and infrastructural adaptation planning

69
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,000
to also promoting better policies that address
the social consequences of climate change

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,650
for urban deltas, such as policies to manage
increased migration flows or to protect marginalized

71
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,460
groups that are not able to flee a climate
disaster in time.

72
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,849
In sum, climate migration is an emerging issue
for urban governance.

73
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:20,020
But still much needs to be done to better
protect climate migrants, including those

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,080
who are left behind.

75
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Do you think climate migrants should be better
protected?
