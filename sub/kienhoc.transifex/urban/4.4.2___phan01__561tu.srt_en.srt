Hi there.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,869
In this video I will tell you about: What
you can do in your household and buildings

3
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:21,860
to improve your current energy demand and
what you need to do to take care that your

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,090
greenhouse gas emissions are effectively reduced
and eventually become zero?

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,360
As a first step, to structure your efforts,
what you can do is to reduce your demand.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,360
So in this case reducing the amount of kWh
you use.

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,640
The second step is the cascading of resources.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,680
So that you reuse of waste streams So for
one process you forward it into another, and

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,300
use it there as an input but than with a lower
quality demand.

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,050
The third thing you can do is multisourcing.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,320
This means that you use renewable and sustainable
energy sources to cover your energy demand.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,470
So to fill these somewhat abstract terms,
I will show you some examples for each of

13
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,530
these steps.

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,110
Starting with demand minimization.

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,189
This means that you do something what we normally
call passive solutions.

16
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:15,149
So you install or design something that reduces
your energy demand all the time.

17
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:19,810
One common example for this reduction is insulation.

18
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,110
If you improve the insulation, you directly
decrease the heat losses that you have to

19
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,750
the outside and by that your heating demand.

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:35,549
So what I could do as a person, I could wear
another layer and by that efficiently reduce

21
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,780
my heat demand.

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,080
If you now want to improve your cooling and
reduce your body temperature, I could think

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,290
of better ventilation.

24
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,049
So I take care that my body temperature is
regulated.

25
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:52,330
Or if I am cold and I want to make best use
of the sunlight, what I can do is, I can turn

26
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:57,350
towards the sun, where it is warmer.

27
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,340
Now, how does this now translate to a building?

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,570
What you can for instance for a building,
you could install another additional insulation

29
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,130
layer.

30
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,390
That is normally something done for existing
buildings.

31
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,720
Or you can use really well insulating building
materials if you build a new one.

32
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,269
For cooling and ventilation, you can use mechanical
or natural ventilation.

33
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,469
By that you keep the inside temperature low
with minimal efforts.

34
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:27,359
To make good use of the sun and its heat and
light, you can orientate the larger surfaces

35
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:31,629
of your building towards to the sun, so on
the Northern Hemisphere to the South.

36
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:36,870
Furthermore, you would increase the glass
surfaces to that side to let heat and light

37
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:44,090
in, while you reduce them on the North side,
so you reduce the heat loses.

38
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,809
If you want to efficiently reduce your electricity
demand, the simplest way is to get rid of

39
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:53,389
your old-fashioned appliances and go for new
less-energy consuming ones.

40
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:58,879
So for instance you can use more effective
light bulbs than in the past.

41
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:06,379
So with this LED light, and other light sources,
you could use affection of your previous energy

42
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:12,939
demand while providing the same amount of
light in the room The second step what you

43
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,599
can do is to Cascade, or reuse energy.

44
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,819
This is most often limited to the reuse of
heat and cold.

45
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:22,239
But then at different temperatures than the
original process.

46
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,949
One example that does show this idea somewhat
is the following: If you want to boil your

47
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:31,379
eggs for breakfast in the morning, you usually
have hot water left at the end.
