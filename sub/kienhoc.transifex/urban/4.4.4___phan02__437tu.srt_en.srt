If not,
hydrogen cars might become more important

53
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,530
in the future.

54
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,699
How about non-technical solutions?

55
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,539
Are they not relevant?

56
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:33,580
I guess they can be relevant.

57
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,059
Building in high densities,
mixing use categories like houses,

58
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:42,139
shops,
schools and medical services,

59
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,189
building new offices and houses near stations,
and planning for walking,

60
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:51,990
cycling,
and public transport not only improve livability

61
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,439
of cities,
and accessibility by slow modes and public

62
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,090
transport,
but also reduce CO2 emissions.

63
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,550
A lot of people are optimistic about other
non-technological measures,

64
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,520
like car sharing,
car-pooling,

65
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,779
and free public transport.

66
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,639
And yes,
especially car sharing and car-pooling can

67
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,669
reduce CO2 emissions,
but research shows that the contribution of

68
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:24,300
those measures is quite small.

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,539
So do not expect too much.

70
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,749
And free public transport?

71
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:34,379
Such a policy can even increase CO2 emissions.

72
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:39,599
This because not only will some people change
from the car to public transport,

73
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:45,939
but people will travel by public transport
more frequently and further.

74
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:54,770
The extra CO2 emissions of additional trains,
trams and busses needed can easily exceed

75
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,949
the reduction of CO2 emissions of cars.

76
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:09,279
In 1997 the Belgium city of Hasselt was one
of the pioneering cities to provide free busses.

77
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,270
Between 1996 and 2004 bus use exploded by
a factor 13,

78
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:22,389
but only 16% of new passengers were former
car users.

79
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:29,759
This does not mean mode choice is not relevant:
Cars emit more CO2 per passenger kilometer

80
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,099
than public transport,
and certainly than walking and cycling.

81
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,969
So the choices you and I make in terms of
modes we use,

82
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,740
have impacts.

83
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,699
Therefore,
land use and transport planning that supports

84
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:52,559
travelling over shorter distances,
and using public transport or walk or cycle,

85
00:06:52,559 --> 00:07:00,360
may contribute to CO2 emission reduction Although
I focus on urban travel,

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,240
it is important to realize that flying is
extremely CO2 intensive.

87
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,610
One intercontinental return trip by plane
is as ‘bad’ for the climate as a the use

88
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,419
of a small car in a whole year.

89
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:25,059
If people would fly less for holidays or if
business would substitute travel by information

90
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:31,589
and communication based technologies,
such as e-meetings or e-conferences,

91
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:34,800
that would help a lot.

92
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,199
If we would continuously implement the best
technologies available we can reduce CO2 emissions

93
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:48,169
of urban transport by more than 50% in 2050.

94
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,659
If we would also implement planning solutions,
over 60% is possible.

95
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,819
But the problem is the change,
not the outcome:

96
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:01,789
The pain is in the change.

97
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:07,479
Stringent climate policies generally face
a lot of opposition if technologies are more

98
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:12,879
expensive than current alternatives,
and if people and companies need to change

99
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,319
behavior.

100
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,569
But I think after implementation most people
support such policies.
