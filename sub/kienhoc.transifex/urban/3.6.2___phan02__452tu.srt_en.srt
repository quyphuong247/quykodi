A clear example are the omnipresent vending
machines in Japan where you can find all sorts

56
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,270
of drinks.

57
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,620
The coffee shops and stalls,
present at nearly every important crossing

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,180
in the city are another example.

59
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,440
The growth in ready-to-eat food means also
the increase of individual single-service

60
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,500
packaging.

61
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,380
More energy is needed and more waste generated
because of this trend.

62
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,990
Energy is needed to produce the food and the
packaging but also for transport to supply

63
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,389
the different points of sale.

64
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,490
The cooling needed to maintain the quality
of the food and the cooking to prepare it,

65
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,680
also require energy.

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,990
Packaging is disposed of and uneaten food
thrown away.

67
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,749
Cities produce enormous quantities of waste.

68
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:49,270
The changing urban lifestyles have also direct
impacts on human health.

69
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,979
Eating fast food and the overall higher consumption
of food means that people's health is negatively

70
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,770
affected.

71
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,180
Obesity and diabetes have become endemic in
many modern cities.

72
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,840
Municipal governments are looking for ways
to deal with these problems.

73
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,759
Some innovative responses are taking place.

74
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,729
More healthy snacks are made available.

75
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,389
Locally-sourced fruits,
vegetables and processed food are delivered

76
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:16,560
at home.

77
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,919
Particularly interesting is the sale of healthy
fast food from food trucks,

78
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:27,289
so-called 'food on wheels',
and 'Mobile Garden' initiatives Promoting

79
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:31,719
sustainable and healthy lifestyles is high
on many cities' agendas.

80
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:34,590
However,
changing a lifestyle is not just a matter

81
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,370
of raising awareness.

82
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,069
To make sustainability part of a lifestyle,
awareness raising and informing the public

83
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:47,379
needs to be combined with increasing the availability
and accessibility of more sustainable and

84
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,550
healthy alternatives.

85
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,900
It is not only a matter of making more healthy
food available,

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,909
it is also important how this is made available.

87
00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:01,689
Can poor citizens also find affordable sustainable
food in ways that fit their lifestyles?

88
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:05,469
In each lifestyle this combination may get
a particular shape.

89
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:09,939
So,
not a one-size-fit-all solution!

90
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,849
More healthy food-on-the-go,
urban farming,

91
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:17,259
sustainable healthy school meals and fresh
food in supermarkets may all be elements in

92
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:21,309
different strategies that fit different lifestyles.

93
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:25,240
In-depth understanding of different lifestyles
and their dynamics is therefore a condition

94
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,590
for any strategy of promoting sustainability.

95
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,139
In this video,
I have shown how urban lifestyles are changing.

96
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,400
As the case of food illustrates,
these changes may have profound impacts on

97
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,699
life in cities.

98
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,249
Understanding these changes is important when
local authorities want to promote sustainable

99
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:46,259
lifestyles.

100
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,110
If we fail to recognise and understand these
transformations we may create barriers to

101
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,650
successful sustainable urban development and
adaptation.

102
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,710
But if we acknowledge lifestyle changes at
an early stage,

103
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,740
we can timely develop governance strategies
and be more effective.

104
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,490
So....

105
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,509
What do you think?

106
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,979
Can these lessons from changing food lifestyles
also be used to promote sustainability in

107
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:10,959
other practices?
