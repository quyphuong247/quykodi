In this video I will give you an introduction
to this weeks challenge,

2
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,900
‘Urban growth’,
and will shortly address how this challenge

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,490
is related to the different themes and videos
of this week.

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,800
Urban growth is a challenging topic,
as it has negative,

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,980
but also positive aspects with challenging
and appealing urbanized environments,

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,419
as a result.

7
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:34,570
When we take an astronauts view to the world
by night,

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,070
like for instance here looking to the north-western
part of Europe,

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,520
you can see clearly the illuminated polycentric
and interconnected patterns of urbanisation

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,320
in this part of our world.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,660
According to the United Nations,
the world population is expected to increase

12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:01:00,260
from 7 billion to over 9.3 billion by 2050,
a 40 per cent increase in less than 40 years.

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,399
At the same time,
the number of urban dwellers is expected to

14
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,180
rise from 3.6 to 6.3 billion.

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,170
To look at this trend in another way the global
urban population is increasing by 60 to 70

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,100
million people,
or the entire population of countries like

17
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,920
France or the United Kingdom,
every month.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,579
Or to put it differently every day,
at least 200,000 people move to cities or

19
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,780
are born in them,
equivalent to populating a city the size of

20
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,850
Amsterdam every 4 days If you look at the
ranking with the largest urban areas in the

21
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,569
world,
you can see in the Top 20 that almost all

22
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:48,020
of them are situated in developing countries.

23
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,090
Actually,
95% of urban growth will be in developing

24
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,609
countries,
While this also includes that an expected

25
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:04,529
3 billion people will live by 2050 in ‘informal’,
or so-called non-planned urban settlements.

26
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:08,780
So it is a misunderstanding that urbanization
mainly results in high-rise,

27
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,709
dense and new urban environments.

28
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:15,230
In fact mega cities,
of over 10 million inhabitants only count

29
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,180
for approximately 8% of urbanization.

30
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,959
At the same time the largest share still concerns
mid-sized to large cities,

31
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,870
urban sprawl,
and rural areas.

32
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,920
as you can see in the pie chart,
here shown to the right.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,019
In the pie on the left you can see that Asia
still includes the largest share of urbanized

34
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,019
areas of half a million inhabitants or more.

35
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:46,840
It is however important to be aware that the
continent of Africa is the fastest urbanizing

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,579
at this moment.

37
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:53,689
One of the negative impacts of this worldwide
urbanization process is that it leads to an

38
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:57,129
increased pressure on natural areas.

39
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:02,310
Cities have a strong dependency on their hinterlands,
and therefore put significant claims of land

40
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,680
use necessary to supply essential needs of
urban dwellers,

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,310
such as food,
water,

42
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,040
energy and the management of its waste.

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,379
Humans have come to so thoroughly dominate
Earth’s biological and natural systems,

44
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:23,569
that some scientists have gone so far as to
claim that after the Pleistocene and Holocene,

45
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:27,510
we have now entered an entirely new geological
epoch,

46
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,239
called ‘the Anthropocene’,
‘the age of man’.

47
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,109
In fact cities of the 21st century wield so
much power,

48
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:42,879
that it can be concluded that there often
isn’t any more a leading national economy,

49
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,370
but that there’s a network of metropolitan
economies where countries talent,

50
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,549
creativity and industry are concentrated.

51
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:58,469
This has led some experts to envisage a future
of powerful city-states rather than nation-states,
