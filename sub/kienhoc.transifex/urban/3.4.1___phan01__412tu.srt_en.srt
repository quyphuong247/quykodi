Hi,
In this video I will tell you about changes

2
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,930
in urban services and infrastructures over
time.

3
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,340
The focus is on water and energy.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,710
They are so-called essential services because
every citizen needs water and energy to survive.

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,300
Moreover:
urban water and energy production,

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,739
distribution and consumption take up a huge
part of city's environmental footprints.

7
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,559
Sustainable development in cities calls for
major changes in the infrastructure services

8
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,440
for water and energy,
but how do we do that?

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,719
Before we try changing them,
we first need to understand the typical social

10
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,489
and technical features of these infrastructures.

11
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,589
I will give you a brief history of both to
show these features and I will show you that

12
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,469
they have quite some patterns in common.

13
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:05,210
In the West the first piped drinking water
and electricity grids were provided as local

14
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,920
autonomous networks and grids.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,899
We are talking end of the 19th century,
the phase of localization.

16
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:17,439
Private entrepreneurs built small networks
and grids to serve their local customers.

17
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,950
The first drinking water networks in Amsterdam
were built to serve only those citizens in

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,469
Amsterdam who could afford to have the first
water flush toilets in town.

19
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,560
The first electricity networks were built
by and for local entrepreneurs on a neighbourhood

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,350
scale.

21
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,140
But by the end of the 19th century many local
authorities had taken over the building and

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,159
management of water networks and electricity
grids for reasons of public health,

23
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,909
safety and economic development.

24
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,280
This is the start of local and regional network
building,

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,090
increasingly a government affair.

26
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,079
Water and energy companies become so-called
public utilities,

27
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,960
owned by local or regional governments.

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,090
The decades thereafter,
especially after WWII,

29
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,660
we can see an upscaling and speeding up of
network building.

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,250
Regional electricity grids become connected
through High-Voltage powerlines operated by

31
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,880
National Transmission System Operators.

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,250
Municipal water companies merge and become
provincial entities.

33
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,480
The percentages of connections for both water
and electricity reach levels of 90 to 100%.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,670
This is the phase of Nationalisation.

35
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,640
At the end of which we see large government
owned networks,

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,300
providing water and energy services to their
citizens,

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,280
under regional or national monopoly conditions.

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,190
Utilities have become the single providers
of water and energy services.

39
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,290
Consumers have no choice but to connect to
the grids.

40
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,950
They are so-called Captive Consumers.

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,270
Then,
roughly around the 1980s public utilities

42
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,010
become contested.

43
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,310
A wave of privatization and utility market
liberalization causes national and regional

44
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,230
utilities to split up,
become private service suppliers over the
