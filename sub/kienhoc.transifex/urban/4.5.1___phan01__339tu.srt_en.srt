Hello and welcome!

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:17,610
I would like to explain to you the effect
climate change has on water resources through

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,259
the process of salt water intrusion.

4
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:23,990
As you know water is essential for life.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:30,360
For instance your body consists for 70 percent
out of water and is essential for food production,

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,610
drinking and industry.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,820
This water is under threat from salt water
intrusion.

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,000
What is salt water intrusion?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,610
Salt water intrusion is the movement of salt
into freshwater aquifers and associated surface

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:53,160
water bodies, which can lead to contamination
of drinking water and soils with salt.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,59
Making water and soil unusable.

12
00:00:57,60 --> 00:01:00,210
Where and how is it happening?

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,140
As you know more than half of the population
of the world is urban, but also mainly coastal.

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,719
Half of the world's population lives within
60 km from the sea, and three large cities

15
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,669
are located on the coast.

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,749
In the figures shown here you can see the
major cities are positioned in areas under

17
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,469
threat by flooding from the sea.

18
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,939
Under maximum estimated sea level rise.

19
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,579
Here you can see North America And here you
can see Asia.

20
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:40,619
And Europe is presented here.

21
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,889
In addition to this we have a map of the current
coastal groundwater impacted by salt water

22
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:48,949
intrusion for Europe.

23
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,359
As you can see the areas prone to coastal
flooding are overlapping with the regions

24
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,20
prone to salt intrusion into the groundwater.

25
00:01:59,20 --> 00:02:04,380
As the urban population grows, and rural inhabitants
move and settle in the coastal areas, this

26
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,209
has an impact on the coastal groundwater resources.

27
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,819
They abstract increasing amounts of groundwater
for agriculture, drinking water and industry.

28
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:18,589
The water that is taken from underground must
be replaced.

29
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,239
And in coastal areas this is salt water from
the sea.

30
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,129
What also happens is that as the fresh water
is extracted, the land subsides, it goes down,

31
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:35,700
making it more vulnerable for flooding and
salt water inflow through the surface water.

32
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,920
When it goes together with geologically based
subsidence, severe salt water intrusion into

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,390
ground and surface water can occur.
