Its presence today generates multiple additional
streams of finances,

140
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:37,010
people,
ideas and imaginaries all of which merit further

141
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,820
exploration.

142
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,290
The impact of oil on the Randstad is not limited
to these physical petroleumscapes.

143
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,630
These intersect with MENTAL ones.

144
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,700
The oil companies generate these imagined
landscapes for the general public.

145
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,730
They are very different from the ones that
they physically build and from people’s

146
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,130
experiences or conceptions of those industrial
spaces.

147
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,800
And,
they changes how we conceive of and use our

148
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,720
environment.

149
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,920
Whereas my research seeks to connect domains,
corporations have carefully separated the

150
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,620
petroleumscapes that they physically build
from people’s experiences or conceptions

151
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,140
of those industrial spaces.

152
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,500
These representations are not neutral:
they actually change the ways how we conceive

153
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,170
of and use our environment.

154
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,710
They use a variety of tools to construct these;
the first is corporate media.

155
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,030
Since the 1930s,
oil companies have used maps to fuel the general

156
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,610
public’s desire to explore the Dutch landscape.

157
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,470
They promote the car as a vehicle of freedom
and discovery.

158
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,220
[pun intended] The covers of maps,
brochures,

159
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,670
and booklets produced by oil companies rarely
depict refineries or headquarters;

160
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,800
instead they tie company colors and logos
to traditional landscapes,

161
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,880
to tourist destinations,
or to historical,

162
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,360
scientific,
or cultural explorations.

163
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,390
Often themes of the advertisements echo societal
changes and preferences,

164
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:24,860
ranging from the quality of fuel in the 1950s,
to issues of gender in the 1980s and environmental

165
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,610
themes today.

166
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:33,310
Looking beyond companies and consumers,
we can see that independent players also create

167
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,190
imaginaries of oil culture:
by including references to oil aesthetics

168
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:44,360
in public or private buildings,
and in urban designs Architectural adaptations

169
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,290
of refinery aesthetics,
are evident in the well-known centre Centre

170
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,650
Pompidou in Paris,
or the public library in Rotterdam by Jaap

171
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,910
Bakema,
pictured here.

172
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,690
Artists have similarly reacted to the changing
landscape with representations of gas stations,

173
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:10,240
isuch as,
by Fukazawa Sakuichi or by Araun Gordijn Petroleum

174
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,370
is also part of our popular culture,
just think of children’s toys that promote

175
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,450
a recognition of oil buildings,
logos and colors from an early age on..

176
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:26,050
and many other apects of oil culture,
such as media and citizen responses remain

177
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,910
to be explored.

178
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:34,480
As we imagine cities beyond oil,
numerous questions arise about future technologies,

179
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,010
policies,
and lifestyles.

180
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,890
But many of these developments will take place
in existing cities.

181
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,830
As we invent the future,
we thus have to think about the ways in which

182
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:52,570
our physical structures and mindsets have
been co-shaped by petroleum and how this influences

183
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,220
contemporary design.

184
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,490
We must acknowledge the persistence of these
mindscapes,
