You can see that the white circles,
the big car-based shopping malls,

50
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,730
follow global integration,
while the other white areas,

51
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,730
the pedestrian based shopping areas,
follow local integration.

52
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,500
The method has been improved throughout the
years,

53
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,530
including angular weighting,
metric distances,

54
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,890
and a lot of other measurements.

55
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:35,130
In this map of Amsterdam the red lines show
all the local shopping streets.

56
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,820
Interesting enough,
the tramlines go right through these local

57
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,440
streets.

58
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,540
You can also see that the post war urban areas,
like Bijlmermeer,

59
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,600
bottom-right corner,
is highly segregated compared to the city

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,70
center.

61
00:04:52,70 --> 00:04:58,409
The street network plays a large role in how
cities transform.

62
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,370
As research has shown,
the street network configuration tends to

63
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,980
steer the building density,
but also the land-use mix,

64
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,150
that influences how people use streets.

65
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,500
So the more people in the streets,
the higher degree of urbanity.

66
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,810
Density,
diversity and degree of street life are very

67
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,60
strongly influenced by the street network
configuration.

68
00:05:26,60 --> 00:05:31,640
At the moment,
we are working on a theory on how do cities

69
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,150
transform naturally.

70
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:41,310
The role of FUNCTIONS have played a very important
role on how we plan our cities.

71
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:48,890
But in order to plan more successful cities,
THE STREET NETWORK should play an important

72
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,140
role.

73
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,240
In the end,
the functions and building density are accumulated

74
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,470
by the street-network.

75
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,740
We have built a sufficient number of badly
functioning urban areas during the last 50

76
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,640
years.

77
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:13,190
So it is time to learn from these areas through
identification and analyses of the spatial

78
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:20,900
as well as social parameters and to apply
this knowledge in urban planning practice,

79
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,310
design guidelines,
urban regeneration,

80
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,650
and architecture.

81
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,929
Space syntax seems to contribute to a lesser
matter of guesswork.

82
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,520
Because,
through this method we can give an indication

83
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,930
of how it would affect the social-economic
life of cities,

84
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,780
just through the change of integration.

85
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,140
Here you see the case of Coventry,
before and after the ring road.

86
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,140
The ring road has contributed to the segregation
of the city center,

87
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,740
contributing to social problems.

88
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,350
So,
Space Syntax is very useful to create SMART

89
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,590
cities.

90
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,169
We have to Sense the city,
we have to Map the urban area,

91
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:20,910
and the map needs to be Analysed,
and also you have to Reach to the map,

92
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:28,560
and you can use space syntax to Test out the
socio-economic implications of various design

93
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,780
proposals The main message is:
think SPACE before FORM.

94
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,900
How are things accessible to one another?

95
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,370
Thank you for your attention.
