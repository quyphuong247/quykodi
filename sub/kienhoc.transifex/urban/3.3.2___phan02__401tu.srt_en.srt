47
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:45,689
https://youtu.be/IQgfTPQPZag
and their specific scopes and forms,
both PHYSICAL and MENTAL.

48
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:51,930
This flowchart shows a first tentative (and
certainly not final) illustration of the complex

49
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,489
ways in which global corporations,
in collaboration with numerous actors,

50
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,260
such governments,
architects,

51
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,939
engineers,
designers,

52
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:05,629
planners artists,
oil sub-contracters and oil related industries

53
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,839
but also citizens,
have shaped urban form.

54
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:15,339
I argue that we need a thorough understanding
of these intersections as we aim to build

55
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,829
future sustainable cities.

56
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,049
And that,
changing the imaginaries is an important step

57
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,020
in creating fossil-free energy landscapes.

58
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,440
First,
I will discuss the development of the PHYSICAL

59
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,360
petroleumscapes.

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,610
These physical landscapes have developed,
intersected and reinforced each other.

61
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,750
Then,
I will explore the ways in which oil companies

62
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,710
have imaged the physical landscape for their
customers,

63
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,690
developing MENTAL petroleumscapes.

64
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:57,050
Let us now see what this approach to petroleumscapes
means concretely flavour area that we are

65
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,580
in.

66
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,590
This (ARA) Amsterdam-Rotterdam-and Antwerp
spot market area is particularly worthwhile

67
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,960
studying as it includes the second-largest
petrochemical complex after Houston.

68
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,289
We will specifically explore how oil has contributed
lavou construction and design of the Randstad,

69
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:21,300
this densely built metropolitan area in the
West of the Netherlands.

70
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,520
Here we focus specifically on the Rotterdam/The
Hague region,

71
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,479
providing one example of the interlinking
petroleumscapes that are similar to those

72
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,259
in other petroleum-based urban regions all
around the world.

73
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:38,909
The first petroleumscape is the industrial
footprint of oil,

74
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,759
its storage,
transformation,

75
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,520
and transportation.

76
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,220
It is highly functional,
almost identical around the globe,

77
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,849
huge in both size and investment,
and at the core of the oil business.

78
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:59,250
The growth of the Rotterdam port from 1862
to today is captured here in preliminary analytical

79
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,099
drawings.

80
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:06,870
These images illustrate the impact that the
physical flows of oil have had on urban form.

81
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,659
The first of these industrial facilities were
built for lighting oil.

82
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:16,259
They have grown enormously over the last 100
years and now take up a lot of space in the

83
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,439
Rotterdam port with storage tanks,
refineries,

84
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:29,520
pipelines and other infrastructure spanning
from the inner city to the tip of the port

85
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,530
the Maasvlakte II in 1972.

86
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:39,889
Oil related structures are a major part of
the 5300 ha of industrial space in the Rotterdam

87
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,669
port with storage tanks,
refineries,

88
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,150
and pipelines.

89
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,669
This petroleumscape is largely inaccessible,
and rarely considered conceptually by built

90
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:53,900
environment scholars or citizens.

91
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,870
Parallel to the industrial petroleumscape
is a distribution one:

92
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,289
a retail network of gas stations.
