Hi everybody I will explain that sustainable
urban development cannot be solved by a single

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,639
actor.

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,390
Today I will explain that sustainable urban
development cannot be organized by a single

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,090
actor.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,679
An ‘actor’ is the word used for a person
or group of persons,

6
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,910
such as an organisation.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:30,249
An actor is a person or organisation who acts,
who does something,

8
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:32,009
who participates.

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,040
Decision-making power and responsibility are
fragmented.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,110
Therefor multiple actors,
public,

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,690
private and societal actors need to collaborate
and/or coordinate their actions to contribute

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,560
to sustainability.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,210
Many people think that sustainability is the
responsibility of government;

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,560
government should take care of it.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,400
They are right,
in the sense that government is a caretaker

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,990
of public values,
values that are of importance to every person

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,960
in society and that contribute to the common
good.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,330
But government and governmental organisations
have only limited control of the actions of

19
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,780
others that influence sustainability.

20
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,570
Let me give you an example.

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,000
In international,
multilateral agreements,

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,730
governments promised to save energy,
reduce carbon emissions and switch to renewable

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,430
energy sources.

24
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,050
National governments transposed these agreements
into national law.

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,310
However,
most of the buildings are not owned by governments,

26
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,409
but by private enterprises,
social housing companies,

27
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,820
landlords and individual persons.

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,760
Energy is provided by private suppliers.

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,360
Home owners are free to contract any supplier.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,119
Governments thus have few means to make these
different actors to comply with their energy

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,540
policies.

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,890
Without the ability to enforce policy ambitions,
it will not NOT work to legally prescribe

33
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,880
policy goals.

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:15,579
Aa command and control approach – however
tempting- will not be effective.

35
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:19,159
The governance challenge of sustainability
also results [FULL SCREEN] from the complexity

36
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,529
of the urban environment,
..

37
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:27,060
consisting of types of actors owning and using
the different parts of the urban environment,

38
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,120
spaces and spatial scales and many different
infrastructures,

39
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,219
such as roads,
energy infrastructures And less visible infrastructures

40
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:44,389
such as sewage systems and telecommunication
cabels.

41
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:47,730
Cities are also referred to a socio-technical
systems,

42
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,779
consisting of different subsystems with intertwined
technological and institutional elements.

43
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:57,400
We can distinguish subsystems in different
ways:
