00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:05,879

These structures have evolved along with cars,
road infrastructure,

94
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,210
and user needs since the beginning of the
20th century.

95
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,400
The Dutch retail landscape has unique features:
Faced with opposition from a citizen organization

96
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,639
in 1939 the companies established a distinctively
Dutch appearance through the works of leading

97
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,840
architects,
including Sybold van Ravesteyn.

98
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,159
or Willem M.

99
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:27,610
Dudok.

100
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:35,849
Gas stations are now ubiquitous in our cities
and rural areas.

101
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:41,139
They can take on a regional flavour,
adapting to local urban forms or changing

102
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:43,499
consumer preferences.

103
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:47,279
Today they boast the unified names and colors
of oil companies.

104
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,900
Compared to the stable and fixed industrial
oil landscape,

105
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,810
the gas stations form a more flexible and
fleeting landscape.

106
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,990
But as places of regular contact with citizen
consumers,

107
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:07,680
and everywhere across the countryside,
they make a strong impact on people’s minds.

108
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,520
The Randstad is also home to headquarters
and research centers,

109
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,900
establishing yet another face of the oil industry:
a petroleumscape of administration.

110
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,840
Companies translate the physical presence
of oil administration and research facilities

111
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,939
into more distinctive urban and architectural
spaces.

112
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:33,310
The large administrative and research facilities
of Royal Dutch Shell,

113
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,240
in the Haque,
the former Esso’s headquarters,

114
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,940
and the B.I.M.

115
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,520
(Bataafsche Import Maatschappij) are in prestigious
locations in The Hague,

116
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,430
Or the Shell headquarters in Rotterdam.

117
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,470
A forth,
ancillary petroleumscape,

118
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,240
is more typical in other parts of the world,
(for example,

119
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,800
Abadan in Iran,
built by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company—now

120
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,890
BP from the 1920s to the 1950s.

121
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,260
It consists of company-built facilities:
housing,

122
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,460
leisure,
educational or religious institutions as well

123
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,150
as company investments into public infrastructures
of diverse types.

124
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,540
These industrial,
retail,

125
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,820
and administrative networks have grown in
the Randstad also co-shaping numerous ancillary

126
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,040
structures,
housing,

127
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,570
schools or other cultural institutions that
we have only started to identify.

128
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,930
Furthermore,
the spread of petroleum structures went hand

129
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,090
in hand with the growth of public rail,
road and pipeline infrastructure,

130
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,320
So,
to summarize,

131
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,060
the industrial,
retail,

132
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,770
and administrative and ancillary networks
have grown in the Randstad in close conjunction

133
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,900
with rail,
road and pipeline infrastructure as shown

134
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:02,880
in these maps combining all three petroleumscapes.

135
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,530
From 1910,
when oil was used mostly for lighting more

136
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:13,780
people started to use cars to 1970 when extensive
port areas were dedicated to oil,

137
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,940
and highways with associated gas stations
had captured the rural areas to 2000,

138
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,890
when oil had become a prominent part of everyday
urban and rural areas.
