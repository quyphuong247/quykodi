Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:19,900
In this video I will explain what the urban
heat island effect is and how it happens.

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,230
With climate change extreme temperatures are
more likely.

4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,539
This includes longer periods of high temperatures.

5
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:29,849
Cities are especially vulnerable to these
higher temperatures due to the Urban Heat

6
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,079
Island effect.

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,480
Which is a phenomenon that a city is generally
warmer than its rural landscape.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,199
The urban heat island is most pronounced during
the evening and night.

9
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:47,530
During this time the air temperature over
the metropolitan landscape can show large

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,559
differences.

11
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,199
During calm and clear nights these air temperature
differences between the urban and rural area

12
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,499
can easily reach up to 8 degrees Celsius.

13
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:05,089
The urban heat island phenomenon is present
in most urban areas, even in small villages.

14
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,210
This is an example of the urban heat island
in Amsterdam.

15
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,920
In green you can see the air temperature of
a rural weather station increasing during

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,280
the morning and decreasing in the afternoon
and evening and in red you can see the air

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,610
temperature in the center of Amsterdam.

18
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,260
During the morning and the start of the afternoon
there is very little difference between the

19
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,930
two temperatures.

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,760
However in the evening and night the air temperature
in Amsterdam stays much warmer than the temperature

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,950
in the rural surroundings.

22
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,860
The formation of the urban heat island is
caused by various processes.

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,700
So first of all, the city consists of streets
with buildings.

24
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,200
These buildings trap the solar radiation that
enters the street.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,050
This energy heats up the buildings and streets
and can hardly escape during the night.

26
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,159
Of course, the city has other sources of heat
as well.

27
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:08,170
Such as waste energy from electricity production,
transportation or heating and cooling of buildings.

28
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:15,220
In addition, human metabolism, so people are
a source of heat in the city as well.

29
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,319
Finally, urban areas are generally have a
lower fraction of vegetation cover.

30
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,349
In rural areas part of the incoming energy
is used for the evaporation of water from

31
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,239
plants and soil.

32
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,280
However, since urban areas have more impervious
surfaces the energy that would be used for

33
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:42,879
evapotranspiration is now used for the heating
of the air and the surfaces.

34
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,170
All these things combined can lead to higher
air temperatures in the urban environment

35
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,769
compared to the rural surroundings.

36
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:56,269
Naturally, the strength of the urban heat
island is determined by different variables,

37
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,810
both from a meteorological and an urban form
perspective.

38
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,409
Variables such as clouds and wind have a negative
effect on the urban heat island.

39
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,639
Clouds decrease the amount of solar radiation
reaching the urban surface and therefore the

40
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,639
amount of energy that will be stored in buildings.

41
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:22,209
More wind induces horizontal mixing between
the urban and rural environment.
