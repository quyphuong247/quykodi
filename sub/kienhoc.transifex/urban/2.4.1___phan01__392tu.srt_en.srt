‘Urban services and Infrastructures’ can
be considered the conjunction of intestines

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,999
and essential organs of a city.

3
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:23,449
One of the main challenges of today is to
change the existing systems,

4
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:27,269
infrastructures and services from a sustainable
perspective,

5
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,279
both as a remedial device for the contemporary
city,

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,930
and an organizing principle for new cities.

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:41,570
Towards circular systems which aim to minimize
new inputs and maximize recycling,

8
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,510
and thus to reduce pollution and wastes.

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,789
To achieve a shift towards more sustainable
systems,

10
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:54,129
urban professionals,
designers and decision makers often aim immediately

11
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:58,390
to implement new systems,
based on renewables.

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,649
Like for instance the introduction of new
technologies,

13
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,430
or the placing of photo voltaic panels on
top of the roofs of buildings,

14
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,860
For instance here projected on a typical part
of Amsterdam canal houses and urban blocks.

15
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,600
Besides of the negative aspects of a too much-
‘techno-fix’-way of approach,

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,090
with all kinds of drawbacks,
starting with new technologies overlooks essential

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,649
primary steps to take before that,
to achieve sustainable development of essential

18
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:34,380
streams and related infrastructures.

19
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,229
As there is a preferred order in approach.

20
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,610
The right order,
known as the ‘Trias Ecologica’,

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,520
or ‘Trias Energetica’,
is to first of all start with the reduction

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,149
of demand.

23
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,399
For instance the demand for mobility,
energy,

24
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,630
or water.

25
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,640
In case of energy for instance,
reductions from 30 up to 50% of the amount

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
originally used can be achieved already.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,310
But also in case of mobility significant reduction
of demand,

28
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:13,110
and thus reduction of necessary investments
in new capacity or systems can be achieved.

29
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,879
The second step is to try to recycle available
surplus.

30
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,510
This can be for instance the availability
of waste-heat in an area,

31
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,580
by matching cooling demand of a supermarket,
with reusing the produced heat there for the

32
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,530
heating demand of apartments built on top
of it.

33
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,840
But this can also be related to the reuse
of nutrients in wastewater,

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,150
or of clean water for agriculture.

35
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,069
Next,
the third step in the Trias Ecologica concerns

36
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,349
the introduction of generation of the essentials
by renewables,

37
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,760
for instance in case of energy the use of
solar panels,

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,780
heat pumps or wind mills.

39
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,239
However,
...in our existing organisation of cities,

40
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,879
still a fourth,
final step needs to be taken:

41
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,830
The use of existing resources,
if this is the case,

42
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,900
aim should be to use these resources as efficient
as possible.
