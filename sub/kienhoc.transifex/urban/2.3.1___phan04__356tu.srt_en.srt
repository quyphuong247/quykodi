These new cruise ships require extensive facilities
on land,

140
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:27,120
and the number of terminals has grown rapidly
in recent years.

141
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,860
Waterfront regeneration,
first promoted as a recuperation of the waterfront

142
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,180
for locals,
is now becoming an attraction for cruise-ship

143
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,499
tourists.

144
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:42,680
Hamburg is particularly attractive to cruise
ship companies:

145
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,089
it hosts several terminals and tourists can
step off the ship and enjoy the new HafenCity

146
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,949
neighborhood.

147
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:54,610
When the big ships dock in the heart of the
city,

148
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,139
they attract landside tourists.

149
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:03,509
Cities cooperate with cruise companies and
sponsor festivals focused on the ships,

150
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:11,110
including “cruise days.” But the impact
of cruise ships on cities is highly contested.

151
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,430
While some celebrate the economic benefits
of tourism,

152
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:21,809
others criticize this industry’s use of
environmentally disastrous fuels (heavy oil

153
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,399
and unfiltered sulphurous gasoline).

154
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:31,389
They also oppose what they term the invasive
presence of these huge ships in historic cities

155
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,569
such as Venice.

156
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:38,199
So far,
despite the interconnectedness of ports and

157
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:42,079
waterfronts,
and the more recent connection of cruise ships

158
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,319
and inner city ports,
only a few organizations promote comprehensive

159
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:50,759
planning of port and city.

160
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,160
Local urban planners pay little attention
to the different urban bodies of water,

161
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,689
rivers,
lakes,

162
00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:00,119
or the sea.

163
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:00,120
.

164
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,180
Climate change may be the wake-up call that
gets politicians,

165
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,800
planners,
and citizens alike to stop thinking about

166
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,899
ports,
waterfronts,

167
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:17,089
and other water related areas as disparate
entities and to engage in collective responses.

168
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:22,350
The challenges of global water rise,
including increased migration,

169
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,290
require ingenuity around the world.

170
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,800
Port cities and urban waterfronts are at the
forefront of these changes.

171
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,860
Some ports try to position themselves as green,
balancing economic and environmental challenges.

172
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,809
Responsible innovation has become a theme
at the Rotterdam port;

173
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:46,379
among other things,
it gives price reductions to ships that have

174
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,970
received the Green Award.

175
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,110
To conclude:
Ports and port cities have adapted repeatedly

176
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:00,300
over time to numerous challenges,
often balancing economic needs and social

177
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,809
interests,
while also creating a local port culture that

178
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:10,629
supports the needs and requests of the port.

179
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:16,670
Port Cities have demonstrated a resilience
that may inspire other cities that need to

180
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,290
adapt to the challenges of global climate
change!
