139
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,580

and their related land claims,
which are not all satisfied within the city’s

140
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,350
hinterland.

141
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,710
Actually,
this involves dependencies or claims,

142
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,660
and often even literal ‘land grabbing’
all around the world.

143
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,810
Like shown here in this graph of the countries
that literally bought most land outside their

144
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:03,490
own borders (the open circles),
and countries that are ‘invaded’ the most

145
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,270
by such land grabbers (the filled circles).

146
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,590
And the size of these circles indicates the
amount of surface.

147
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,720
And this also holds for cities,
on a local,

148
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,060
regional,
national and even global scale.

149
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,570
So cities do not stand alone:
they are connected with their hinterlands,

150
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,170
and with the rest of the world.

151
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,480
This holds also for citizens,
and for both social as well as economic relations.

152
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,600
But it also relates to the different spatial
or infrastructural domains in cities,

153
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,510
like for instance wastewater treatment and
energy,

154
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,710
or food and waste.

155
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,280
These interdependencies,
or as I prefer to call them,

156
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,410
reciprocities,
are key to solutions that address the challenge

157
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,070
of socio-economical change.

158
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,570
Therefore,
to wrap up this introductory video to this

159
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,950
weeks challenge of socio-economic change in
relation to metropolitan areas,

160
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,350
within this context of multiple dependencies,
or reciprocities,

161
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:59,950
it is important to be aware of “conditionality”:
any form of sustainable urbanism is dependent

162
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:05,270
on the presence of sustainable technical,
and ecological systems,

163
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:10,300
and such systems are dependent on socio-economical
balances,

164
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,300
which on its turn is dependent on sustainable
users,

165
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,160
or citizens.

166
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,440
Therefore,
metropolitan areas,

167
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,290
or our society as a whole,
based upon the principles of sustainability

168
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,300
is predicated on the symbiosis of tradition
and renewal and the need to foster a new ethos

169
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:30,330
that values community building and the empowerment
of the individual at both local and global

170
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,070
scales.

171
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:39,780
We must look beyond connectivity based solely
on technology,

172
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,370
transportation and trade,
toward finding integrated solutions,

173
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,130
at smaller scales,
including their surrounding hinterlands,

174
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,850
their communities and the bounds of the natural
environment,

175
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,750
promoting a dynamic equilibrium that will
continuously adapt and transform our metropolitan

176
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,070
areas.

177
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,560
This week this socio-economical challenge
will be addressed on the same sequence and

178
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:04,990
thematic setup,
of:

179
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,990
‘Shape and Structure’,
‘Urban Services and Infrastructure’,

180
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,850
‘Natural resources’,
‘Livability and Urban living’,

181
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,420
and ‘Policy and Governance’.
