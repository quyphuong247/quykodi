Somehow big is associated with "grey" and
industrial, while small is considered "green" organic, or natural.

45
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,100
Big systems are considered big in terms of
technical infrastructures, but also at the

46
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:49,819
same time - in management combining the flows
that are treated and with low levels of involvement

47
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,610
of users.

48
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,770
Small systems are associated with high involvement
of users, separated flows and decentralised management.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,170
So large scale often means: big works, centralised
management while small scale refers to small

50
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,739
technologies and small organisation as well.

51
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,450
This division in small and large is a simplification.

52
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,230
Not only do you miss valuable levels between
the large and the small, you also miss the

53
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,820
social, and managerial dimensions of scale
.

54
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,540
The emerging urban systems that are put in
place to mitigate or adapt to climate change

55
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,700
do certainly not fit in simple large versus
small dichotomies.

56
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,270
Some big systems can be entirely supported
by the active involvement of many users.

57
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,410
An example is a windpark set up by motivated
consumer-shareholders.

58
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,630
And many small systems can be managed by big
actors.

59
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:55,130
For instance in case of centrally controlled
heat-power units distributed over many households.

60
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,260
Community energy organisations for solar energy
show an intermediate level of organization,

61
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,700
while their systems can still be connected
to the central electricity grids.

62
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,480
And Big water companies support intermediate
level water treatment sites, because they

63
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,840
are a valuable addition to the performance
of the water system at large.

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,010
At the same time: These systems require the
involvement and management of householders

65
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,730
who are discharging their waste water to the
system.

66
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,210
Such Community co-provision of urban services
maybe a renewed phenomenon in Western context,

67
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,800
it is not in the Global South.

68
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,120
Communities are responsible for drinking water
services, sanitation, or waste management.

69
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,290
Sometimes on their own, in the absence of
formal public services.

70
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,780
Sometimes in collaboration with formal private
and public service providers.

71
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,530
An abstract representation of my message would
look like this.

72
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,870
Diverse blue or yellow small systems work
together with the larger red and green systems

73
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,430
and they are interconnected via grids like
power lines.

74
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,700
Many climate change adaptation and mitigation
measures come in intermediate scales of urban

75
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,230
service provision.

76
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,470
Scales that have until recently been overlooked
if one has an eye for the big versus the small

77
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,400
systems only.

78
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,130
New combinations between utility providers,
businesses, communities and individual co-producers

79
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,850
are on the increase.

80
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:32,250
The social and technical diversity it delivers,
presents opportunities for urban climate adaptation

81
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,750
beyond the small versus large debate in service
provision .

82
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,250
How would you evaluate the service provision
in your cities related to climate change?

83
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,310
Do you observe the social and technical diversity
in the measures taken?

84
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,690
And what about the of scales of infrastructure,
of management or citizen involvement in your city?
