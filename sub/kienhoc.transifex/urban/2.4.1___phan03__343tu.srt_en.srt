Shown here is again the concept of a 'Living
Machine',

86
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:49,210
in this case in Findhorn,
Scotland.

87
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,470
The Danish village of Marstal,
where over 70% of its heat-demand for the

88
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,030
entire village is covered with solar energy
generated with the solar collector plant shown

89
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,620
at the bottom of the image.

90
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,810
And a bio-gas plant in Latvia,
which produces energy,

91
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,130
clean water and soil out of waste water.

92
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,370
The existing,
so-called,

93
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,160
paradigm...

94
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
or 'ruling way of doing',
in general however still concerns a centralized

95
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,020
organisation.

96
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:28,910
Although this is from a sustainability perspective,
more and more frequently questioned as optimum.

97
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,040
From security,
management and related cost perspectives this

98
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,060
still is considered as one of the best scale-levels
of implementation.

99
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,860
From a social perspective however this is
not necessarily the case,

100
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,410
as the distance between user and solution
is large,

101
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,880
and thus it anonymizes use,
and therefor also doesn't avoid wrong use

102
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,680
or any learning regarding.

103
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,840
Therefor,
as stated,

104
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,910
todays search for alternatives,
more frequently,

105
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,030
tries to find solutions at the previously
shown intermediate scale level,

106
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,930
of a neighborhood,
or city-district,

107
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,180
to be able to include the positive aspects
from a technical and cost perspective related

108
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,750
to the scale economy,
and so-called heteronomy,

109
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,260
or interconnection at larger scales.

110
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:27,400
But also to the social aspects,
which request finding 'community based' solutions,

111
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,430
either autonomous,
clustered or within a decentralized system

112
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:38,370
consisting of several smaller systems.

113
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,720
In the end,
the optimal organization of infrastructures

114
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,960
and services always will be place-specific.

115
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:50,700
Nevertheless,
lately a shift towards hybrid solutions and

116
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,690
solutions at smaller scale-levels can be noticed.

117
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,300
This is also the result of new ICT systems,
which make it easier to respond real-time

118
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,720
to variations in demand and supply.

119
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,300
The optimal scheme for such an organization
looks like the one shown here,

120
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,370
in which an intermediate scale level is introduced
between that of the individual buildings and

121
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,220
centralized systems.

122
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,460
In this intermediate,
'decentralized hub' supply and demand of the

123
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,780
different essential streams and related infrastructures
can be matched,

124
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,800
while it also includes storage to overcome
misfits between peeks in demand and supply.
