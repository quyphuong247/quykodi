to different kinds of knowledge and with different
perspectives on the problems at hand.

43
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,219
Different kinds of knowledge and different
perspectives will make our solutions more

44
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,709
tailored to their real needs and wishes.

45
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,510
But we need to be able to DESIGN the ways
in which those stakeholders will influence

46
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,560
and participate in a project.

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,69
For instance,
how can children influence projects in which

48
00:03:54,69 --> 00:03:56,129
they have a stake?

49
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:01,540
Can you design specific forms of participation
for them?

50
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,840
In liberal democracies,
the interactions among actors happen in a

51
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,69
legal framework where the roles and capacities
of actors are defined by rules,

52
00:04:11,69 --> 00:04:13,349
contracts and regulations.

53
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,738
This is called the rule of law….

54
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,820
Planning rules are an example of such frameworks.

55
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,500
Governance that happens within the rule of
law in formal institutions and result in formal

56
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,770
governance arrangements.

57
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,90
But governance is also influenced by other
factors like power,

58
00:04:35,90 --> 00:04:39,609
culture,
informal rules and traditional values.

59
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:48,69
These are called informal institutions and
result in informal governance arrangements.

60
00:04:48,69 --> 00:04:52,750
As societies become increasingly more complex
and democratic,

61
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,350
governance becomes a central tool for designers
to achieve socially,

62
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,449
economically and environmentally sustainable
solutions that are supported by a large number

63
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,229
of actors.

64
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,460
In other words,
governance is a very important tool to achieve

65
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,830
sustainability!

66
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,469
We often forget the social dimension of sustainability.

67
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,99
That’s why I use Larsen to emphasize that
“for sustainability to occur,

68
00:05:21,99 --> 00:05:27,120
it must occur simultaneously in each of its
three crucial dimensions:,

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,970
social,
economic and environmental”.

70
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,199
The main goals of sustainable development
are to create conditions for the full realization

71
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,660
of human potentials,
through healthy,

72
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,919
fair and prosperous environments.

73
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,580
In summary,
metropolitan innovators must understand complex

74
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,389
systems of governance.

75
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:57,770
That will allow them to make better and more
effective decisions and deliver better solutions.

76
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,599
We need to know how to operate with the relationships
in place in order to better achieve sustainable

77
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:05,930
and feasible solutions.

78
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,490
We must also be able to design new relationships
and tools to articulate different actors.

79
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:19,440
This is important in order to formulate,
develop and implement desirable spatial visions

80
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,349
and guarantee political,
economic and institutional support and successful

81
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:26,539
implementation.
