One important way there, is not to rely on
one energy source only.

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,940
But to combine them in a smart way to provide
energy all the time.

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,69
So you would combine PV, wind, geothermal,
biomass or whatever else is possible in such

34
00:02:26,69 --> 00:02:30,579
a way that you provide energy all the time,
while the other sources might not be that

35
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,400
available.

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,250
To implement this nevertheless we have to
improve our current energy infrastructures.

37
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,209
What we now a days have, we have got a centralized
infrastructure where large-scale power plants

38
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:43,849
provide our electricity for instance.

39
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:49,40
The electricity only flow in one direction,
from the supplier to the consumer, from the

40
00:02:49,40 --> 00:02:51,250
power plant to the socket at home.

41
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,40
In the future, we all will become small-scale
energy producers, if we would install renewables

42
00:02:56,40 --> 00:02:56,500
at home.

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,569
So instead of just being consumers we also
produce.

44
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,19
That also means that electricity are only
flowing in one direction, but it actually

45
00:03:03,20 --> 00:03:07,870
is flowing from where it is produced, and
in surplus, to where it is needed.

46
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,459
So in order to distribute all these energy
flows we need to find new ways to organize

47
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,950
this, to provide sustainable energy as a service
to everyone.

48
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,119
Here, the use of Smart Grids and ICT can become
powerful tools.

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:29,140
Furthermore, the storage of energy will be
another crucial aspect for our future energy systems.

50
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:37,700
So you must think of using electricity storage
devices like batteries to store electricity

51
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,129
when it is in surplus, Or you must find new
ways to store heat and cold.

52
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:46,518
One thing you could apply there is so called
Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage.

53
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,220
So you would use ground water as a storage
element.

54
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,60
What you will do with that: you store heat
that is in surplus in summertime and you reuse

55
00:03:58,60 --> 00:04:00,110
that in wintertime.

56
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,840
While you store cold in the ground water in
wintertimes and reuse your cold in summertime

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,140
for cooling your building.

58
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,170
So my question to you: When will you start
feeding energy into the decentralised network?
