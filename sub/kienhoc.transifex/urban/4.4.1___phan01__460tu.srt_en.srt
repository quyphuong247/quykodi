Hi there, welcome back.

2
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:19,880
In this video I will tell you about your energy
demand and the related greenhouse gas emissions.

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,779
In the last 200 years the world has seen a
tremendous increase in energy demand.

4
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,320
And we all know that this energy demand is
likely to increase further.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,080
What are the reasons for this increase?

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,370
Well, we are more and more people living on
this planet, our living standards increase

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,860
and as a result, for instance the amount of
appliances that we use at home, that we have

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,930
at home are increasing.

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,360
So just think about, more mobiles, more routers,
more tablets or whatever else you have at

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,540
home.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,710
In principle, there is nothing wrong with
an increasing energy demand.

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,589
As long as you would supply this energy in
a sustainable way.

13
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:03,019
Unfortunately, our energy supply is currently
not sustainable.

14
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:07,140
From the beginning of the industrialization
caused by the invention of the steam engine,

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,460
the development of the last 200 years is closely
linked to the use of fossil fuels.

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:18,040
And this is causing massive environmental
problems.

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,980
So, where does your energy come from?

18
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,439
Take a look at this picture from the global
energy mix.

19
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,789
Like I said before our energy is mainly coming
from fossil fuels.

20
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:29,579
That is coal, oil and gas.

21
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,439
A smaller fraction is coming from nuclear
energy.

22
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:39,329
The remaining part of 15-20% is coming from
what we consider as “renewable energy sources”.

23
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,569
Be aware that renewable does not automatically
mean it is also sustainable.

24
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,539
Among these energy sources prominent are two
things.

25
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:53,899
The use of traditional biomass mainly in developing
countries, that means burning of wood for

26
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:59,429
cooking and heating, and other hand the use
of hydroelectricity via large-scale dams like

27
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:04,539
you can find for example the one at the Three-Gorges
Dam in China.

28
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:09,479
All the other energy sources you hear so much
about in the media on the internet in the

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,500
news like Photo Voltaic, like wind power or
all the other things that are popping up are

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,970
actually producing a rather small fraction
of our current energy demand.

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,209
Both, the increasing energy demand and the
focus for energy supply on fossil fuels have

32
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,780
caused a tremendous increase in greenhouse
gas emissions over the last one hundred years.

33
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,200
So when you look at the emissions of many
countries all over the globe you can see that

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,810
they have increased their greenhouse gas emissions
by several hundred percent over the last one

35
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,420
hundred years.

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,959
Currently countries like let’s say India,
China and Indonesia have a comparably low

37
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,569
output of greenhouse gas emissions per person.

38
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,439
Now if you would imagine that they would increase
their greenhouse gas emissions per person

39
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,459
to the same layer like let’s say the United
States or the United Arabic Emirates, and
