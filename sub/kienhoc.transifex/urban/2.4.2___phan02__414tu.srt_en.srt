This because more and fast roads will stimulate
people to buy more cars and drive more by

45
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:30,939
car,
which results in nuisance from driving and

46
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:35,069
parked vehicles,
land take of infrastructure,

47
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,849
accidents,
noise nuisance and air pollution.

48
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:46,829
A major challenge therefore is to balance
the need for more roads for better access,

49
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:52,489
but on the other hand to minimize land take
of transport for better livability.

50
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,669
So how can this challenge between accessibility
and livability be met?

51
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:03,329
By urban planning and design,
and by transport planning.

52
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:08,480
In line with what I just said,
urban planning should mean:

53
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,870
- Building in high densities,
- Mixing use categories,

54
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,519
such as houses,
shops,

55
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,509
and medical services,
and - Building near stations and other public

56
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,009
transport nodes.

57
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:26,930
Then people will walk and cycle more,
and make more use of public transport.

58
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,710
And then accessibility by slow modes and public
transport is improved.

59
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,810
Such planning might result in 10 to 20% less
car use.

60
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,560
The next contribution comes from transport
planning:

61
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,030
Cities can plan for walking and cycling,
and for public transport.

62
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,669
And the role of the car should be reduced.

63
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,199
Such planning will have a positive influence
on sustainability,

64
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,340
because of the shift from car to walking,
cycling and public transport.

65
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,210
And this shift reduces energy use,
emissions and noise production.

66
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,669
In addition such joint land use and transport
planning influence other livability aspects:

67
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:19,740
nuisance of parked and driving vehicles,
and the visual quality of city.

68
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,750
Can sound policies for land use and transport
planning easily be implemented?

69
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,710
Unfortunately not:
there are often important barriers,

70
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,000
and cities do only limitedly learn from each
other.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,099
In 1972 the Dutch city Groningen reduced the
role of motorized transport in the inner city

72
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:45,530
dramatically,
after much opposition.

73
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,310
But results were generally evaluated positively.

74
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:56,370
Nevertheless cities that proposed comparable
policies later again faced comparable problems,

75
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,439
and only limitedly learned from Groningen.

76
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:08,050
In some cases the implementation of controversial
policies benefits from a so called champion,

77
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,460
Jamie Lerner,
the former mayor of the Brazilian city Curitiba,

78
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,659
who implemented a bus based transport system,
being a nice example.

79
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:23,430
Also the former mayor of London,
Ken Livingstone,

80
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,159
who introduced the congestion charge,
can be seen as a champion.

81
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:33,780
The congestion charge is a charge drivers
of motor vehicles need to pay if they want

82
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,919
to enter Central London.

83
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,900
To conclude:
Joint planning of land use and transport can

84
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,409
stimulate walking,
cycling and the use of public transport,

85
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:51,350
and consequently make cities accessible,
livable and attractive.
