Welcome to the urban growth week of this MOOC.

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,380
In this week you will explore the challenges
of urban growth and the solutions to address

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,189
the problems arising from this.

4
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:24,320
You will do this from the five perspectives
or themes shape and structure,

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,429
infrastructure and transport,
Natural resources,

6
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:30,519
liveability and urban living and policy and
governance.

7
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,940
You will begin by learning about how density
and urban form of cities can be assessed in

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,780
the shape and structure theme.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,149
In the infrastructure and transport theme
you will acquire knowledge on urban growth

10
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,469
and the provisioning of urban services such
as energy,

11
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,320
water,
waste and food and you will further learn

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,960
about the mutual interdependence between the
type of urban transport and urban growth.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,090
Next,
you will hear about efforts to decoupling

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,929
growth from resource use in the natural resources
theme.

15
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:08,240
Then you will contrast the social environment
against the physical environment of cities

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,560
from the perspective of liveability.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,500
Finally,
you will learn about policy and governance

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,979
in relation to urban growth.

19
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,750
As in all weeks there will be a practical
assignment and a quiz this week.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,820
In the practical assignment you are asked
to identify the biggest changes that your

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,850
city has undergone as a result of growth or
decline in the last decades.

22
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,360
Then,
in the quiz you can check how much you have

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,680
learned this week.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,049
Please remember,
for a successful completion of this MOOC you

25
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:42,990
need to do at least 4 out of 6 assignments
and 4 out of 6 quizzes in total.

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,390
Now I wish you loads of fun during the urban
growth week.
