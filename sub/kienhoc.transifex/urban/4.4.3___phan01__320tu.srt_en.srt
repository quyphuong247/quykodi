Hi there.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,590
In this video I will outline the key challenges,
as well as solution for becoming reliant on

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,970
renewable energy systems.

4
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,180
As you already know there are plenty of solutions
for the production of renewable energies.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,90
This might be PV, wind, geothermal, or biomass
for instance.

6
00:00:30,90 --> 00:00:33,640
But off course there is a drawback to these
beautiful technologies and we are not there

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,820
yet that we could say we can fully rely on
these sources.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,430
Nevertheless, the share of renewables is growing
steadily and many cities have made such a

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:48,190
progress that you could actually say that
some districts are fully supplied by renewables.

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,669
Yet, like I said, we are not there yet.

11
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,10
We have to tackle several challenges before
we can fully replace fossil fuels, this includes

12
00:00:56,10 --> 00:01:00,970
an improvement of necessary physical as well
as organizational infrastructures.

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:06,79
These are things we still have to develop
to bring sustainable energy to everyone.

14
00:01:06,79 --> 00:01:12,539
One main problem we have to tackle by this
is the so-called intermittency of many renewable

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,40
energy sources, for instance like PV.

16
00:01:15,40 --> 00:01:17,420
Now, what is intermittency?

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,520
This term means nothing else, that many of
the energy sources, we have mentioned already,

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,70
are not available all the time in the same
quantity.

19
00:01:26,70 --> 00:01:28,130
Take solar energy for example.

20
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,100
During day time, solar energy is plentiful
available.

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,539
But during night time, you have got a problem.

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,450
Furthermore, you have seasonal and global
differences when solar energy is available

23
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,710
and how much.

24
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:48,740
So think of the differences in sunlight hours
or intensity in winter versus summer.

25
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,860
Winter normaly has less sunlight hours and
a lower solar intensity, while in Summer time

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,420
more sunlight is available and the intensity
is way higher.

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,490
These differences might be small if you are
close to the equator, while further away from

28
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,979
the equator these differences are huge.

29
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,389
And even can make the use of solar energy
not really favourable.

30
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,298
How to overcome the challenge of intermittency?
