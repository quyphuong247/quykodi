There are two indicators that can be used
to assess the urban form. Floor Space Index

58
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:31,680
(FSI) or Floor Area Ration (FAR) that gives an indication
of the built intensity of an area. And the

59
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,810
Ground Space Index (GSI) that expresses the
compactness of the build environment of an

60
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,750
area (i.e. building pressure). Let’s look
at how these indicators are calculated.

61
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,260
First we need to understand three key variables.

62
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,620
Firstly, the floor area or
the space sum of the space available at all stories

63
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,479
of a building. Secondly, the plan area or the reference area. This

64
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:04,020
can be privately built or non-built areas associated to a building. Such as the property on which a building is built.

65
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,479
The so called lot. But it can also
be the area that includes

66
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,810
playground, car parks or other infrastructure
often called the island or block. Or it can be a district

67
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,980
comprising of many islands, roads, water areas and large public space etc.

68
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,400
The third and last variable is the building footprint

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,300
or the area on which the building is build.
From these variables two indicators can be derived.

70
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,540
The Floor Space Index can take a value between

71
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,789
0 and any number. It is calculated by dividing
the floor area by the reference area. It answers

72
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:46,219
the question of how may times the floor area
can cover the plan area.

73
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:51,969
The GROUND SPACE INDEX can take a max value
of 1. It answers the question of how much

74
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:57,889
build up space there is in a plan area.
So let me explain this, by using some Lego

75
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:05,139
cubes.
Imagine that this yellow cube here is a storey

76
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:14,289
of a house; so it’s our floor area. If we
add one more cube, we have twice the initial

77
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:21,310
floor area. If we add another cube, we have
three times the original floor area and if

78
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,960
we add a fourth cube, we have four times the
original floor area.

79
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,449
Imagine that this is the footprint of our
building; in other words, the area that is

80
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:39,270
covered by our building. We have now both
components that we need to understand the

81
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:47,129
Floor Space Index. We have the floor area
and we have the plan area.

82
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:59,110
If I now take the floor space and distribute
the floor space across the plan area, in that

83
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:09,849
manner, I have a Floor Space Index of 1. If
I remove one cube and place it on top, here,

84
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:17,930
how has my floor area changed? And how has
my Floor Space Index changed? Well it has,

85
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:26,249
in fact, not changed at all; it is still 1.
If I add a cube here, it remains 1. And if

86
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:34,810
I add another cube here, it remains still
1. The message is that the Floor Space Index

87
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,909
tells us something about the relationship
between the area of floor, in comparison to

88
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:56,690
the area of our plan area. If I redo this
and add two more cubes here, we have a Floor

89
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:04,779
Space Index of 1.5. If I add more, we have
a Floor Space Index of 2.

90
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:13,459
Let’s look at the Ground Space Index and
what that means. Again we have the plan area

91
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:26,920
and we have in this way a Floor Space Index
of 1. We can now also say that we have a Ground

92
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:35,320
Space Index of 1. All of our ground is covered:
a Ground Space Index of 1. If I move my cubes

93
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:43,110
this way, my Ground Space Index reduces to
only 0.5. The maximum of the Ground Space

94
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:56,000
Index is 1, by the way. The Ground Space Index
reduces further to 0.25. 25% of the plan area

95
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,350
is built on. This is very different from the
Floor Space Index, which remains 1 in this

96
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,600
sort of setup, no matter now I distribute
the space. But the Ground Space Index changes

97
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,639
every time I alter the arrangement of the
cubes.

98
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,380
How can we actually use this? You can for
instance plot the Floor Space Index, against

99
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,649
the Ground Space Index and based on this,
you can say how urbanized an area is. As you

100
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:32,560
can see in this picture, at low ground space
and Floor Space Index we have rural areas;

101
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,600
there’s not much built. There’s lots of
open space and the buildings are not very

102
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,440
high. As you move up on the y-axis and sideways
on the x-axis, the areas become much more

103
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,160
compact and more urban. If we now put Bijlmer
and Betondorp into this picture, we can see

104
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,540
that Bijlmer is much more rural. Why is that?
It has a slightly higher FSI, but it has not

105
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,320
a very compact build. It has lots of open
space, which in this classification is defined

106
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,529
as more rural. Betondorp on the other hand
is more urban and is more compact and distances

107
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:17,800
between buildings are short.
So what can be concluded from this is that

108
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,100
the Floor Space Index and the Ground Space
Index are useful indicators to define the

109
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,320
physical layout of a city; and that you should
always ask what the reference area for determining

110
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,240
densities FSI and GSI was.
So, I challenge you to be critical about density

111
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,929
measures and to spot the differences in urban
form in your city.
