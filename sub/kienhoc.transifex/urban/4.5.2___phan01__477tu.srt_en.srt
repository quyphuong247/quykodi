Hello and welcome!

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,170
Today I would like to talk to you about how
cities can make better use of water that is

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,730
available to them.

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,119
So we will mainly focus on basic principles
of water reuse.

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,959
As you know there is an increase pressure
on water resources and cities are a significant water users.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,919
But are also vulnerable to the consequences
of water shortage such as rationing of water,

7
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:35,420
land subsidence and contamination of ground
water and river water with salt.

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,130
So there must be smart ways to use water and
to combat these effects.

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,329
Humans need only about 2 litres of water to
drink and a little more for food preparation.

10
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:51,059
The UN suggests an absolute minimum of 20
litres per person per day for drinking water,

11
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,550
personal hygiene and cooking.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,390
But if we look at water consumptions per capita
around the globe, developed countries hugely

13
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,789
exceed this water consumption.

14
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:02,989
Why is this?

15
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:08,450
To understand this we need to look at the
water consumption in more detail.

16
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,990
This graph shows a water consumption of European
household.

17
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,600
As you can see more than two thirds of the
water is not actually used for drinking or

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,760
food preparation.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,110
About a third of the water is instead used
as a transport medium in toilet flushing.

20
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,680
Another third is used for showering and bathing
and another large share is used for cloth

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,380
washing.

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,600
But, this graph does not include households
that use water for watering their grass and

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,320
plant in the garden.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,060
Which can be much larger share than indoor
water use.

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,140
Such as here in California, where household
consumption can make up to 900 litres per

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,320
day.

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,500
With 50% related to irrigation and watering
the garden So what can be done to try to reduce

28
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,430
water consumption?

29
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,560
One easy way to do this are hose pipe bans.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,590
Or simply not to be allowed to watering the
garden.

31
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,200
Another way is to use dual flush toilets.

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,670
So instead of one large toilet bowl, with
one type of flush, you use different types

33
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,330
of flushes.

34
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:17,670
A small one of about 3 litres for urine and
a larger one of about 6 litres for the poo.

35
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,930
Click Or even you could look at vacuum toilets.

36
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,049
An innovative way of flushing your toilet
that you may know from the plane.

37
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:31,060
They use less than 2 litres per flush.

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,040
Another alternative is to use water saving
shower heads.

39
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,370
These either pulse the water in short intensive
pulses or inject air into the water to give

40
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,120
the same sensation as for larger amounts of
water.

41
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,189
Of course a very good way to use less water
is to change your behaviour.

42
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:56,969
You can take shorter showers, turn the tap
of when brushing your teeth or do not do the

43
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,469
dishes with a running tap.

44
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:03,239
But reducing water consumption is not all.

45
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,540
Water is an amazing thing.
