185
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,560

and take them into account when we clean up
and redevelop polluted areas,

186
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,080
when we develop new buildings,
neighborhoods,

187
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,010
or forms of mobility,
or when we preserve and represent the remnants

188
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,610
of oil modernity.

189
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,420
Petroleum has polluted the ground for decades
and sometimes even longer,

190
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,970
often poisoning neighboring housing districts.

191
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,800
As refineries and storage areas around the
world disappear,

192
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,860
they will require extensive and specialized
cleanup.

193
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,740
For how much longer will oil occupy large
parts of the Rotterdam port?

194
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,950
And what will we do when it leaves?

195
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,570
We also need to consider themes of preservation
and heritage:

196
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:48,740
As petroleum becomes a part of our past,
how will we remember and “preserve” the

197
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,720
networked heavily polluted industrial heritage
of oil – the storage tanks,

198
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,070
pipelines,
and drilling platforms?,

199
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,800
Some spaces,
such are gas stations are small and relatively

200
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,860
easy to scrap and – after appropriate clean-up
of the soil— also easy to replace,

201
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,080
but what will we do with the highways that
are the paradigms of the car age?

202
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,660
Indeed,
once petroleum is in our past,

203
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:22,630
how will we explain oil-related structures
such as headquarters or gas stations that

204
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,730
are part of our architectural and cultural
heritage,

205
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,720
even already added to the national heritage
list?

206
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,610
How shall we analytically frame transformations
such as the renovation of the “A’Dam Tower,”

207
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:41,970
the former “Toren Overhoeks” designed
by Arthur Staal for Shell in 1967,

208
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,980
and that has now become an urban icon at the
heart of Amsterdam?

209
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,630
Addressing the tangible and intangible heritage
of oil in the city,

210
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,500
and in the landscape,
is a key challenge--including,

211
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,040
for example,
on how to think beyond petro-mobility.

212
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:05,300
If mindscapes influence how people generate
new physical petroleumscapes,

213
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:12,000
then recognizing them and furthermore transforming
them is perhaps the first step in creating

214
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,060
fossil-free energy landscapes.

215
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,140
Building on the research laid out above,
many questions still remain to be explored:

216
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,030
into media responses,
citizen experiences,

217
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,030
or popular languages.

218
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,750
Happily,
we can turn to new technologies to help with

219
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:37,050
this An augmented reality tool and an open
source website are already under development

220
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,840
at TU Delft.

221
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,820
These tools are for you,
to track the history,

222
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,740
location,
and spread of petroleumscapes;

223
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,850
to collect narratives of oil,
to understand their role in the popular imaginary…

224
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,310
to challenge them And to contribute to the
imagining and promotion of alternative energy

225
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:57,940
futures.
