In this video we will move forward from the
challenges of urbanization and elaborate on

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,320
the challenge of Socio-Economic change and
the principle of equity and the human perspective

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,310
in Sustainable Development of metropolitan
area’s.

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,400
Today,
all metropolitan areas worldwide face the

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,279
same question:
How to ensure a high quality of urban life,

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,540
and the sustainability and resilience of our
vital systems that provide energy,

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:34,890
water,
food,

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,580
materials,
mobility and communication.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,580
Although ‘many roads lead to Rome’.

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:44,100
most urban centric positions to achieve real
advances in quality of life are based on responses

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,180
to socio-economic change,
and the human perspective.

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,579
This can be either from the perspective of
sustainability,

13
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,920
here framed as ‘the Sustainable City’
to make sure our children inherit a world

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,020
at least as healthy,
beautiful and with similar or better opportunities

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,760
than we have ourselves.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,280
or improved equity and government transparency,
also framed as ‘the Just city’,

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,200
or with respect to Quality of life,
often framed as ‘the Healthy city’ But

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,920
in all these positions,
increasingly the perspective of technology

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,190
comes in as well,
and how this relates to us humans and our

20
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,780
social economical dependencies and organization.

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,970
This rises of course all kinds of questions
including funny ones like,

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,410
How much do you tip a robot bartender?

23
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,619
But seriously,
regarding metropolitan challenges,

24
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:46,179
in general technology is used to help achieve
efficiency improvements,

25
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:50,649
for instance,
to achieve efficient infrastructure and resource

26
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,649
use,
an aim often connected to the concept of ‘smart

27
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:57,349
cities’,
which will be elaborated further in the context

28
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:59,580
of digitization,
the challenge we will elaborate on,

29
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,810
in Week 6.

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,569
Meanwhile,
cities are constantly being ranked for livability,

31
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:09,039
happiness,
cultural capital and creativity.

32
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,080
However,
it is constant innovation that stands out

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,110
as the key stimulus for longevity in economic
competitiveness.

34
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,790
So,
where some cities have gained recognition

35
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,769
in innovation through short-term booms,
Such as Helsinki and Dubai City,

36
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:32,689
the more dominant global cities,
like Singapore and London,

37
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:39,629
Paris and New York have maintained high levels
of innovation and retained their prominence

38
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,680
over time.

39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,709
This is why several studies have suggested
that the key characteristic of leading world

40
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:53,239
cities is that they attract the best and brightest
minds,

41
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,620
Or,
as I name them CROBOS new generations of creative

42
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,439
and hobo,
or mobile creative talent who hop around the

43
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,439
world in search of new exciting places to
live and work.

44
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,989
So to come back on the different Urban positions,
in hopes of initiating a leapfrogging effect,

45
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,469
this aim to achieve increased levels of technological
innovation and urban dynamics in the end is

46
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:21,870
central in finding solutions to socio economical
change,
