43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,379
https://youtu.be/RoVe-V5g9dQ
Here shown as the fourth step.

44
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:21,400
Of course the approach is called Trias Ecologica,
or Trias Energetica,

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,010
as the aim should be to avoid such a fourth
step at all.

46
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,810
This three –or four- step approach also
needs to be seen in relation to scale.

47
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,430
As 'Reduction of Demand',
the first step,

48
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,439
always considers the lowest scale of implementation:
The user,

49
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,470
or the individual building.

50
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,680
The second step in this approach,
the 'Reuse of existing surplus',

51
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,420
or so-called residual effluents,
should be started at this lowest scale level

52
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,159
too.

53
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:02,450
After which this should be considered for
the subsequent larger scales,

54
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:09,120
like for instance that of the neighbourhood,
the city district and the city-region or metropolitan

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,610
area.

56
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,180
The third step,
'Renewable generation'… than can be considered

57
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,080
at either of the scales where spatial,
technical,

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,750
social and economical aspects will define
the optimal scale of implementation.

59
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,080
Again like stated before,
realising more efficient use of the existing,

60
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,530
be it either on a centralised scale level
at the metropolitan scale,

61
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,330
or at the scale of individual building.

62
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,760
Such a fourth step should preferably be avoided.

63
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,540
With respect to the implementation and the
architectural or urban integration of the

64
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:56,050
different systems it is important to be aware
that nowadays almost at all scale levels we

65
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,570
can find feasible solutions.

66
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,420
For instance,
on an individual scale level,

67
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,690
or that of one household,
we can purify waste-water to clean water,

68
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,650
based on natural systems,
like shown here to the left in a so-called

69
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,530
'Living Machine' in a conservatory.

70
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,450
Or generate energy via an individual pole
with integrated solar panels,

71
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:29,800
or a decentralized vertical axis wind-mill,
like shown second and third from the left.

72
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,030
But also more compact autonomous systems,
either natural-,

73
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:41,680
or entirely technical systems to compost excreta,
purify grey waste-water or rainwater into

74
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
secondary use water or even drinking water
can be achieved.

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,050
At this scale level.

76
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:55,020
Important to notice here however is that to
achieve certain optimization in efficiencies,

77
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,910
related to the environmental or technical
processes,

78
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,930
and thus also regarding costs of implementation
and space used,

79
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,610
the individual scale level in general is not
considered to be the optimal scale level.

80
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:22,000
In particularly not in case of urban environments
and higher densities or clear urban living.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,150
In particular social aspects will support
real sustainable (or durable) functioning

82
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,850
of such systems.

83
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,810
Therefor a 'community-based',
clustered or so-called decentralized scale

84
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,720
of implementation is lately more often considered.
