00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,259

look like?

80
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,599
It can take many shapes and forms!

81
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:24,669
Inhabitants perceive a safe and healthy environment,
are in control and facilitate the desired

82
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,809
level of social interaction.

83
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:31,800
The forms that facilitate these primary needs
are timeless.

84
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:40,439
See the example of social interaction facilitated
on a square in the old city of Gent in Belgium.

85
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,629
However… one thing seems to be missing here.

86
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,199
Do you have any idea?

87
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,379
‘Green’ an essential part of the livable
city.

88
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,349
There is a positive correlation with the wellbeing
of citizens.

89
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:00,169
‘Green’ is said to reduce stress in a
neighborhood.

90
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:05,029
City dwellings in a green environment are
perceived as more attractive.

91
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:08,039
Green makes a city friendly.

92
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,240
This pocket park in the middle of Beijing
in China is also a nice example.

93
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,749
‘Green’ also has a positive relation with
other sustainability aspects.

94
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:22,889
It facilitates a better microclimate and reduces
heat stress in a city.

95
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,599
And it contributes to better air quality.

96
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,159
‘Green’ plays a role in water storage.

97
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:36,550
It contributed to a child friendly city and
can facilitate physical exercise,

98
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,680
as you can see here.

99
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,719
It might even be combined with food production.

100
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:47,550
Furthermore green supports environmental awareness.

101
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,610
To wrap up,
designing a socially sustainable living environment

102
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:58,419
starts from the primary needs for all,
and carefully build up the urban landscapes.

103
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:04,529
In every step we need to safeguard an integral
approach to,

104
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,149
in the end,
facilitate all needs:

105
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:10,629
Health,
safety,

106
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:15,919
control over one’s own life,
a social and a natural,

107
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,029
or green,
environment!

108
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:24,529
Of course the relations between these primary
needs can be complicated.

109
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:30,740
For example higher densities,
which often lead to opportunities for inhabitants,

110
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,899
might come with air pollution,
noise,

111
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,449
less green ,and maybe unsafely.

112
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:41,329
Now please question yourself,
how can these primary needs,

113
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:48,220
illustrated on neighborhood level,
also contribute to socially sustainable mega-cities?

114
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:55,769
It is all about balancing and finding advanced
metropolitan solutions!
