81
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,620
https://youtu.be/B9m1j78JL8E
And there is just soil and water on top.

82
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,890
And all the water that will not infiltrate
can flow off and be caught in that beaker.

83
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:22,020
The second one is a rooftop material, so this
illustrates the paved surfaces in the city.

84
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,640
And the last one is a semi-paved area where
there are rocks but there is also soil beneath.

85
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,070
So I just turned on the rainfall simulator
and this is a light rainfall event.

86
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,700
You can see that on the grass the droplets
are just laying there, whereas on the paved

87
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,860
surfaces they really start to run-off.

88
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,910
That is because the leaves of the grass intercepts
the rainfall.

89
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,490
As long as the column is not completely saturated,
if there is still space in the soil, the water

90
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,930
will be taken up by the soil and you wonâ€™t
get as much run-off as a paved surface or

91
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,080
a semi-paved surface.

92
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,690
So we just had a very light rainfall event
and you can see that place where the grass

93
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,280
is situated there is hardly any rainfall measured
because the rainfall intensity is lower than

94
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,990
the infiltration capacity.

95
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,310
As long as the column is not saturated the
water will keep infiltrating.

96
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,780
That is not the case at the paved surface
where you can see a lot of water have ran

97
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,710
off the surface.

98
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,580
And not that much water will infiltrate in
the soil because it is sealed.

99
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,340
And the last one is an intermediate case where
you have some water captured but not as much

100
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,340
as in the paved one.

101
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,840
So now we are going to see what will happen
when there is a more intense rainfall event.

102
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,770
You can see that the rainfall intensity is
much higher like a convective rainstorm.

103
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,410
And also in the grass case you can see clearly
run-off now because the rainfall intensity

104
00:06:48,410 --> 00:07:01,060
is much higher than the infiltration capacity.

105
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,900
So the rain has stopped and now we can look
at the results.

106
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,180
As you can see the least water has been caught
by the grassy bucket.

107
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,140
That is because not all water is flowing off
the surface but most of it is infiltrating

108
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,020
into the soil.

109
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,740
You can illustrate this with a sponge, the
soil really acts like a buffer.

110
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,800
So the rainfall that is falling on an unpaved
surface will be delayed.

111
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,590
So that is much easier in your sewage systems
than for example this paved surface where

112
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,880
most of the water is running off and you have
very high discharge peaks.

113
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,540
Very high peaks of flow into your sewage systems.

114
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,580
And of course the semi paved one is again
an intermediate case.

115
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:47,290
So here you can see that rainfall intensity
and also land cover are really linked in whether

116
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,420
pluvial floods occur or not.

117
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,770
So heavy rainfall events, which are probably
going to occur more often in the future, due

118
00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:00,310
to climate change, in many places in the world,
can cause pluvial floods.

119
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,790
Which is especially a problem in areas with
a lot of paved surfaces like in the cities.
