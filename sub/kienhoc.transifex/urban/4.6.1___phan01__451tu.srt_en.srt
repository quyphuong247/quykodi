Hi, in this video you will learn about ways
in which urban society interacts with urban

2
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,620
services to address climate change.

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,280
Measures that are being taken for climate
adaptation or mitigation put the existing

4
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,659
centralised urban infrastructures for water,
energy or food supply under pressure.

5
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:33,829
They are changing the urban fabric.

6
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:39,090
The larger systems do not disappear as many
of the larger systems become connected to

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,340
smaller systems.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,480
Others do split up and decentralise.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,480
We can talk about urban splintering in this
respect.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,540
Examples are: urban agriculture to supply
fresh foods or to process organic waste, constructed

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,910
wetlands as an alternative form of urban waste
water treatment or the development of micro

12
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,379
grids next to central electricity supply.

13
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,990
Apart from these physical changes in systems,
we also see various alternative forms of governance

14
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,390
emerging.

15
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,570
As public utilities used to manage the central
systems, backed up by central governments,

16
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,950
it does not mean that the decentralised systems
are also managed like that.

17
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,740
We see Public Private Partnerships in which
local authorities work together with private

18
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,280
firms to provide decentralised services.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,520
Communities or neighbourhoods who are managing
local energy generation, urban agriculture

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,979
or community toilets.

21
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,670
These developments show the need to move away
from the classical dichotomy in service provision.

22
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,039
Briefly: that of small versus large scale
provision.

23
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:54,070
Since the first wave of environmental consciousness
in the 1960s one discourse has emphasised

24
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:59,810
that small scale devices, such as composting
toilets or solar cookers would be viable alternatives

25
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,039
to the polluting modern energy and water or
food systems.

26
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,700
Small is beautiful as Schumacher told us in
1973.

27
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,760
On the other hand there is the point of view
claiming that both climate and efficiency

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,879
gains can be reached by using economies of
scale.

29
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,819
Large systems can rationally be controlled
and managed.

30
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,459
Rational from both a climate change and an
economic point of view.

31
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:32,129
This, for instance, is a typical example of
thinking big in sustainable energy infrastructures:

32
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:39,480
a super-grid connecting renewable energy generators
stretching over more than on continent.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,390
When evaluating newly emerging initiatives
in the urban context, the dichotomy between

34
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,040
small and large just doesn't work for the
assessment of current urban splintering.

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,920
The examples of current measures for climate
mitigation and adaptation seem to sit between

36
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,340
the small and the large.

37
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,930
Let me take the example of sanitation to explain
the thinking in social and technical scales.

38
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,660
For long, the discussion has been whether
we should have big sewer systems, water flush

39
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,610
toilets and huge wastewater plants for urban
sanitation worldwide, or that we should down-scale

40
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,459
these systems.

41
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,750
That is: making smaller, easier to manage
systems.

42
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,489
Important to note here is that the small versus
large discussion is not only about technical

43
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:27,840
scales.
