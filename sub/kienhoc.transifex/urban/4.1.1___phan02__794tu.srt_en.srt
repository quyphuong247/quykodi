54
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,629

with water etc. So the sewer canals have to
be changed and if you want to adapt to those

55
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:15,820
impacts.
But I understood there is also another effect

56
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,740
that many cities are located in delta areas
and there we have the risk of flooding and

57
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,980
also the salt water…
Yes, one of the effects of warming the atmosphere

58
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:33,150
is actually that the oceans also warm. Some
of the ice on land start to melt, so sea level

59
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,270
rise starts to come up. And if you have a
lot of delta cities, the sea-level rise actually

60
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:45,669
threatens the livelihood of these cities.
With flooding, but also through more salty

61
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:51,430
water in the rivers. And that salty waters
could actually threatened the fresh water,

62
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:58,309
and fresh drinking water, and crops in the
cities. And in some areas, or delta areas

63
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:02,909
always have enough moisture, and you see that
in Egypt where there is a very big contrast

64
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:11,309
between the desserts and the delta. But, especially
in dry areas it will be dryer, and in wet

65
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:17,159
areas it will be wetter. And therefore with
climate change you get problems with flooding’s

66
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:22,839
but also with droughts. And those droughts
immediately affects the amount of water, the

67
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:28,490
available water, drinking water but also for
crops. So indirectly the amount of crops that

68
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:37,770
a city consumes could actually become a problem.
So in the urban environment we are confronted

69
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,550
with at least 4 different factors?
Climate change is not simple, it is quite

70
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,639
complex, the impacts are complex, and you
really if you want to adapt you have to look

71
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,409
at the temperatures, how do we actually forgo
extreme temperatures, you have to look at

72
00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:01,749
too much water and you have to look at too
little water. And really build your infrastructure,

73
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:06,089
or change your infrastructure in such a way
that you can cope with these kinds of issues.

74
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:14,740
Rik, people are talking about climate mitigation
and climate adaptation. Can you explain these

75
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,930
terms and relate them to the urban environment,
to cities?

76
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,629
As I said earlier, the problems have started
150 years ago with the beginning of the industrial

77
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:32,419
revolution. So we are already seeing climate
changes. We are already observing the impacts.

78
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,800
And we have to cope with these impacts. And
coping with impacts is very much adaptation.

79
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:47,880
So if a city changes sewage system to actually
deal with much higher water availability after

80
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:58,070
a big shower, that is adaptation. If a city
in a delta changes the dikes, that is adaptation.

81
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:05,960
You really look at predicted impacts and deal
with this. Mitigation is taking away the cause

82
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:13,150
of the problem. So mitigation is very much
reducing the emissions, so that is the concentrations

83
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,270
in the atmosphere of greenhouse gas are stabilized.
And the climate, or the anthropogenic climate

84
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:25,240
change, does not continue anymore. And if
you want to do successful mitigation, so that

85
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,810
is stabilizing the concentrations, we have
to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by

86
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:37,760
about 80-90% in the coming 50 years.
Rik, we have to reduces those greenhouse gas

87
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,270
emissions. And especially in the urban environment,
the cities, we have to accomplish this. Can

88
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:50,590
you explain how we can do that?
Well, I think cities are extremely important

89
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,850
to cope with this problem, because of two
reasons. If you look at the international

90
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,800
negotiations on the convention of climate
change, it go’s very, very slow. It is very

91
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,650
difficult for all heads of states to actually
reach an agreement. And I think the cities,

92
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,320
which are local units, with visionary mayors,
can actually make a difference, and become

93
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:21,720
an example of become CO2 neutral. Second,
cities are very concentrated areas, which

94
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,430
use a lot of energy, where there is a lot
of activity, but those can also be made relatively

95
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,490
much more efficient. Think about transport.
If you do that in a rural area distances are

96
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:40,380
big. In a city they are relatively small so
you can use electric cars, electric small

97
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:47,710
trucks, etc. and really imbed that with smart
grids into the whole infrastructure. Same,

98
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:54,060
if you want to cope with some of the impacts
it is that density in the city that can actually

99
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:01,710
improve the efficiency of a lot of activities.
And the cities are impacted. The people see

100
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:07,180
it, but people also take the actions. And
therefore I think the people in cities are

101
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:15,480
much more willing to deal with this problem
than people in rural areas. And the cities

102
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,790
as we have seen in the US and Europe are really
taking a lead in dealing with this problem

103
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,860
So you learn to think global, and now we have
to act local?

104
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,010
Exactly!
Especially in the urban environment.

105
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:36,699
Especially because about 60 to 70% of the
people live in urban environments.
