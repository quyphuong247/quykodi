Water can be used over and over again.

47
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,090
One option is to cascade the water according
to its quality.

48
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,499
So the idea here is to use only the water
quality that is necessary.

49
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,400
Therefore one can distinguish between potable
water and non-potable water or second quality water.

50
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:27,989
For this it is helpful to understand different
water sources and water uses in the household.

51
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,829
Toilet flushing and cloth washing can for
instance be done with water of non-potable

52
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,400
quality.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,529
While the other types of water needs should
be covered with drinking water quality.

54
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:44,010
Sources of such non-potable water are for
instance water from the sink or the washing

55
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,689
machine.

56
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:46,310
So called grey water.

57
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,669
But also Rainwater is a good alternative.

58
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:55,849
Here is a simple example of how water from
a sink can be reused for toilet flushing.

59
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:58,349
Here is an example of grey water irrigation.

60
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,489
And here a one where rainwater is harvest
in Ho Chi Minh City.

61
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,549
But often the simple cascading is not enough.

62
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,529
Then water needs to be treated.

63
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:13,279
Sometimes grey water needs to be treated to
be used, this can be done through simple sand

64
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:16,260
filtration, as shown here.

65
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,340
The black water, so the water that contains
faeces can of course also be treated and reused

66
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,750
for not potable purposes.

67
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,310
Like here in Santa Monica.

68
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,800
And here in Hoe Chi Min City.

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,750
But it is even possible to reuse your wastewater
for drinking.

70
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:41,190
In fact most of you will have done so, via
what is called unplanned indirect potable reuse.

71
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,020
Often wastewater is discharged into a river
and then used as drinking water further downstream.

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,620
The unplanned potable reuse.

73
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,470
Then there is something called planned indirect
potable reuse.

74
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,780
Here wastewater is treated, often using energy
intensive filtration technologies.

75
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,300
Water is then discharged deliberately back
to the natural environment.

76
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,500
From which it is taken to supply people with
water.

77
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,490
Finally, direct potable reuse is a process
where wastewater is treated and directly supplied

78
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,520
as drinking water to the customer.

79
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,760
Planned indirect potable water reuse is practised
widely such as in Singapore and Orange county - USA

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,000
In Orange county the water is injected to
the groundwater and then abstracted from it

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,690
for drinking water.

82
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,440
The added advantage of this process is that
it also replenishes the groundwater thereby

83
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,310
counter acting the saline intrusion.

84
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,349
Finally direct potable reuse is rarely practised.

85
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:45,460
Here an example from Windhoek Namibia.

86
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,880
The reason that direct potable reuse is rarely
practised is not so much technical or health related.

87
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,909
But is to a large extent due to public perception
about waste water.

88
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,029
Or would you drink your own pee or poo?
