00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,860

One step further is the integration of these
services into new concepts of infrastructures,

104
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,030
and buildings,
like shown here,

105
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,560
the Dutch example of a Solar bike road which
generates electricity.

106
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,430
When we zoom out,
it shows us that at the scale of the city

107
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:12,620
such connection of supply and demand provides
all kinds of insights and potential solutions

108
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,120
to improve cities’ sustainability.

109
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,940
By considering and matching essential flows
like energy,

110
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,120
water,
nutrients and waste,

111
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,670
the so-called ‘urban metabolism’ can be
determined and improved.

112
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,750
This is an important notion,
that also will be explained more in detail

113
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,490
within this week’s theme of ‘urban services
and infrastructures’.

114
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,919
And this,
on its turn,

115
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:46,310
connects directly to the third theme we will
address in relation to the challenge of urbanization:

116
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,260
the ‘natural resources’.

117
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,060
Due to urban growth,
globally rising middle class,

118
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,590
and new developments like ICT,
with respect to natural resources,

119
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:02,310
the role of cities is often challenging,
due to their larger environmental impact and

120
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,990
socio economic change but it also includes
significant potentials for solutions,

121
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,460
as cities for instance generate the largest
share of global GDP,

122
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,130
while being more effective in energy use.

123
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,830
In this weeks video on the theme of ‘natural
resources’ the relation between resource

124
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,730
use efficiency,
self-sufficiency and urban density will be

125
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,990
explained.

126
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,760
The fourth theme addressed concerns that of
'livability and urban living'.

127
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,980
Regarding,
the social versus the physical environment

128
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,060
will be explained.

129
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,760
But also places and communities will be addressed
to understand that a neighborhood is not a

130
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,940
community,
while aspects of street level design and community

131
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:58,170
building are key to livable urban environments,
or even conditional to their sustainability.

132
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,530
Livability is also strongly related to the
notion of equity As you can see in this world

133
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,670
map,
in particular developing urban regions in

134
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:13,110
the world also concern the places where average
income still is to be considered low or medium

135
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,930
level.

136
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:21,680
This combination of urban growth and poverty
puts huge pressure on existing urban environments,

137
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,320
and eventually could even lead to urban decline
or unlivable environments.

138
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,520
But even in existing and positively developing
urban environments such urban growth puts

139
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:42,290
serious pressure on their built-up areas,
like shown here for London.

140
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,490
there are limits to available space,
and systems of transport,

141
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,150
like shown here for example in Amsterdam,
which make new,

142
00:10:53,150 --> 00:11:02,340
smart concepts or innovations,
or innovative policies and governance necessary.

143
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,130
And this is the last theme addressed this
week,

144
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,220
in relation to urban growth,
‘policy and governance’.

145
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,120
In fact,
from a policy or governance perspective,

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,660
it is better to speak of urban transformation
in stead of growth,

147
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,080
as there will be limits to growth.

148
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:29,360
Regarding this theme and how to adjust policies,
strategies based on dynamic control and development,

149
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,070
qualitative planning of conditions,
transformation and strategic interventions

150
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,279
will be key in the transformation towards
urban environments and structures that include

151
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,540
change,
and are livable,

152
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,339
sustainable and just,
and simply exciting environments to live in.
