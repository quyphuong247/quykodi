Hello and welcome. In this video I will show
you how socio-economic factors affects natural

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,880
resource use.
In this picture you see the water consumption

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,910
pattern of 42 Dutch household. Within this
household each person uses about 120l of drinking

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,409
water per day. You can clearly see various
peaks in the morning and in the evening.

5
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:37,930
In a more abstract form this is the water
consumption pattern in some other parts of

6
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:44,600
the world. Only a bare minimum of water, a
bucket full, is available for cooking, drinking

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,300
and some personal hygiene.
If urban service infrastructure makes access

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,019
to water or any other resource easier, then
generally consumption of that resource goes up.

9
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:01,660
Paired with a change in our perception
about hygiene. This leads to a higher overall

10
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,979
consumption. As for instance shown in this
graph of water consumption since the 1970

11
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,220
in the Netherlands.
What can also be observed is that with higher

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,140
income you are more likely to have access
to services and to use more resources. In

13
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,909
this picture of the UN you can see the relationship
between income and access to water. You can

14
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,360
see that only 5% of the poorest in sub- Sahara
Africa, have access to piped water at home,

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,570
while 62% of the richest have.
You can further see that improved access and

16
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:44,390
unimproved access dominates the more poor
or second and middle income classes.

17
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,710
Improved access, includes stands posts such
as this one. This implies that getting water

18
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:57,250
is laborious and time consuming job. Therefore,
most probably reducing water consumption.

19
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,360
Getting water is by the way mostly done by
women!!!

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,899
Looking in more general terms at resource
use and socio-economic indicators such as

21
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:12,380
GDP or income. A positive relationship between
the two can be observed. In this graph it

22
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,910
can be seen how the global Gross Domestic
Product has grown and material input has increased

23
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,420
alongside it while at a slower pace.
The strongest increase can be observed for

24
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,519
construction minerals, which grew by a factor
34. Which is actually due to development of

25
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:39,110
cities and population growth. Ores and industrial
minerals use grew by a factor of 27, and fossil

26
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:46,810
energy carriers by a factor of 12. Biomass
extraction increased only 3.6-fold. Because

27
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,489
earlier much more biomass for power production was used which is now replaced by fossil energy.

28
00:02:53,489 --> 00:03:00,250
That this trend holds is also confirmed by
another study that compared the metabolic

29
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:08,780
rate of countries with its GDP. Shown here
in diagonal line. But some other things can

30
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,680
be observed too. There are a number of outliers.
This suggests that it is possible for some

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,260
countries to achieve relatively high incomes
per capita while consuming fewer resources

32
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:28,430
per capita. On the other hand it also shows
that other countries display very high resource

33
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:35,190
consumption levels per capita without a corresponding
rise in incomes per capita.

34
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,590
This is related to many factors. Like population
density, but it is also strongly related to

35
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,209
the type of economy and trade.
For examples countries that rely on lignite

36
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:53,870
(a brown coal) instead of gas as an energy
source will show higher metabolic rates. This

37
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,900
is because the metabolic rate is measured
in weight and as lignite contains less energy

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,569
per metric ton than gas the metabolic rate
is higher.
