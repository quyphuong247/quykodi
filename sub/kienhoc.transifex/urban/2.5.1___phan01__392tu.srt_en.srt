Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,820
Today I will take a look with you,
at how the growth of cities affects the use

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,210
of natural resources.

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:25,939
As our world becomes more urban there is evidence
that the resource use efficiency goes up.

5
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,930
Density is a good explanatory variable for
this.

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,619
Take the example of heating of buildings.

7
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,850
As density goes up the heating demand goes
down.

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,480
This can be explained by the fact that walls
are shared and the relationship between the

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,559
volume of the building and the outer surface
areas decreases.

10
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,680
Such as here for the case for flats in multi-storey
buildings.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,949
This is shows a simplification of this high
rise.

12
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:54,409
You can see that many cubes,
or flats,

13
00:00:54,409 --> 00:01:00,479
of the same kind together result in a reduction
of the surface to volume ration.

14
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:07,190
So while for the first cube the surface area
was 6 times larger than the volume it is now,

15
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:15,360
when using three cubes up,
down and sideways only 2 times larger Applying

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,660
this to urban areas mean that houses should
for instance have at least have 3 levels or

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,650
more to make use of this effect.

18
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,890
As can be seen in the green rapidly declining
green line.

19
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,670
Everything below is really heating and cooling
inefficient – as temperature changes are

20
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,210
rapid and therefore use more energy – generated
from natural resources.

21
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,920
A similar relationships has been suggested
for transport which is more efficient in dense

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,360
cities,
because distances are short and alternative

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,130
modes of transport can be used.

24
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,479
This can be seen here in the example of New
York city and fact that the redline – density

25
00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:01,620
- is declining to the outer suburbs and the
energy use per capita goes up.

26
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,310
Other infrastructures can also be build much
more efficient in cities,

27
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,190
rather than in the rural surrounding.

28
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,549
For instance the costs and the material used
for sewers and water pipes reduces as density

29
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,060
here measured as Floor Space Index increases.

30
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,200
As well as the construction material per floor
area.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Similarly,
district heating networks,

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,170
so networks were for instance waste heat from
centralised incineration is supply to households,

33
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,980
is much more effective in urban areas,
as there is a heat loss from long transport

34
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,170
distance.

35
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,350
Furthermore,
some people propose that reuse and cascading

36
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:46,950
of resources is easily implemented in urban
areas; as the supply and demand of large quantities
