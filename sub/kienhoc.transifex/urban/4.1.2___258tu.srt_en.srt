Welcome to the climate change week of this
MOOC. The focus of this week is on understanding

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,270
the drivers for climate change and the role
of cities within it. Furthermore, you will

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,990
discover why cities are important places for
climate change mitigation and climate change

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,169
adaptation. These aspects are again explored
from the perspective of the four themes. There

5
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:36,440
are many highlights this week including the
visit to a rain simulator at Wageningen University

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,640
under the shape and structure theme. In this
theme you will also investigate how the climate

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,620
in a city is related to the build environment
and how you perceive urban climate. You will

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,809
hear about renewable energy generation and
the role of urban transport in mitigating

9
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,809
climate change under the infrastructure and
transport theme. You will discover the effect

10
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:02,199
of climate change on water resources and solutions
for better water management when exploring

11
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:08,500
climate change for the natural resource perspective.
Under the topic liveability and urban living

12
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,630
you will discover the role of urban services
and how people interact with infrastructure

13
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,420
in their effort to tackle climate change.
In the governance and policy theme you will

14
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,960
hear about climate change migration and the
important role of cities and city networks

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,310
in addressing climate change.
As every week there is also a weekly test

16
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,560
and a practical assignment. In the assignment
you are asked to calculate your CO2 footprint

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,360
and compare it to your fellow MOOC participants.
Check out the assignment description for more

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,450
detail. Now, I wish you loads of fun in this
week.
