By 1830 the construction of Brunswick Wharf
in London provided a place for the growing

98
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,229
number of steam ships,
where they no longer had to wait for the tide

99
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:39,520
to enter the dock,
but could cast off at will.

100
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,270
Companies built even more new docks:
In London,

101
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,659
the Victoria Dock (1855) was directly connected
to train lines,

102
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:51,639
and the Royal Albert Dock (1880) had almost
5 kilometers of quays.

103
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,800
Finger piers,
that is raised structures built into the water,

104
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,099
characterized American ports such as those
in New York or San Francisco.

105
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:09,449
The long individual piers gave large ships
greater available quay length.

106
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:14,909
Industrialization in the 19th and 20th centuries
introduced further changes and initiated the

107
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:18,199
separation of port and city.

108
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:24,860
The former multi-functional trade buildings,
gave way to mono-functional areas for shipping,

109
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,080
administration,
and housing.

110
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,610
The city moved some 24000 inhabitants,
rich and poor,

111
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,909
to allow for the construction of the warehouse
district of the Speicherstadt in Hamburg,

112
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:44,720
an innovative storage area with integrated
sea and land access (including direct connections

113
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,350
to railways alongside the piers),
as illustrated in this section of 1888.

114
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,389
The presence of the warehouse district led
to the next door construction of an office

115
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:00,959
district,
which came to include the world-famous Chilehaus.

116
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,350
Both areas have recently been recognized as
UNESCO World Heritage sites.

117
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:13,100
By the mid-19th century the telegraph made
possible the rapid exchange of information.

118
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,560
It gave shipping companies advance knowledge
on the whereabout of their ships and facilitated

119
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,089
preparation.

120
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:26,490
As new technologies became available,
politicians and engineers also changed the

121
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,920
waterways.

122
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,720
The opening of new thoroughfares,
shortened trips extensively.

123
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,190
New cities became dominant;
others lost their prominence.

124
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,750
The creation of the Suez Canal in 1869,
for example,

125
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,459
went hand in hand with the development of
three new planned port cities on the Suez

126
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,320
canal:
Port Said,

127
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,589
Ismailia,
and Suez.

128
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:56,850
The cities became cosmopolitan centres attracting
migrants from various backgrounds and serving

129
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,490
as places for the exchange of goods,
people,

130
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,540
and ideas.

131
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,850
Other examples are the Kiel Canal in North
Germany (1895),

132
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,190
that links the North Sea to the Baltic Sea
over a distance of 98 kilometers.

133
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:17,730
and the Panama Canal (1914) that shortened
the way from the Pacific to the Atlantic,

134
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,360
from the American West coast to the East coast.

135
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,350
New technologies and means of transhipmentâ€”such
as bigger cranes,

136
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,560
led to recurrent reconstruction of port facilities
Starting in the 1960s,

137
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,860
containerization,
first imagined by Malcolm McLean,

138
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,230
an American transport entrepreneur,
led to wholesale restructuring of shipping

139
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,399
networks,
trade patterns,

140
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,350
port facilities,
port city hierarchies,

141
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,089
and urban form.

142
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:50,740
Whereas,
historically,

143
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,250
port and city where intimately connected,
with industrialization the two grew apart.
