As you can see from the diagram shown here.

40
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,209
Our city is very resource hungry you may say.

41
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,590
Especially water dominates the overall resource
inputs.

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,340
But the other important resources I mentioned
are also shown here.

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,930
You can also see that the outputs side of
the diagram is dominated by wastewater,

44
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,349
but also that as solid wastes,
off gases and consumer produces are represented

45
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,889
there.

46
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,879
Now this is a very linear approach and conceptualization
of a city.

47
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,230
But a new way of thinking and an ambition
for the future is the circular urban metabolism.

48
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,489
Where things are as much as possible reused
and recycled,

49
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,430
as shown here in the recycle arrows.

50
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,709
And as you can also see,
as a result of this the inputs and outputs

51
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,099
are reduced.

52
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,059
How can such a circular metabolism be achieved?

53
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:47,370
Well you could say there are four strategies
to do so.

54
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,859
Firstly,
of course to reduce consumption of water,

55
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:52,719
energy and other resources.

56
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,790
Secondly,
multi sourcing,

57
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,909
or finding alternative sources for the products
we consume every day.

58
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,930
Water is a very easy example here.

59
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:09,159
You can use rainwater harvesting from your
roof and use the water in the house.

60
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,559
This is practised widely around the world.

61
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:16,280
The Third method is cascading,
or reusing the products at the quality they

62
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,160
exit our household.

63
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,730
So you could for instance think about reusing
water for irrigation.

64
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,620
The fourth and final strategy requires much
more inputs and technology.

65
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,280
That is recovery!

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,420
Here you need energy,
possibly chemicals or other things to upgrade

67
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,910
the quality of a product and reuse it again.

68
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,620
For instance plastics can be reused over and
over again as well as metals.

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,150
Using this approach,
you on the one hand reduce our natural resource

70
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,350
consumption.

71
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,820
As you can see here,
the arrow is smaller.

72
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,500
But on the other hand you are also likely
to reduce the environmental impact your resource

73
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,630
consumption has.

74
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,570
So,
I challenge you to start changing the metabolism

75
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,940
of your home by using these strategies!
