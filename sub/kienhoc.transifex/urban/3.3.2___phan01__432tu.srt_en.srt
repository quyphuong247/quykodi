Welcome!

2
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we will explore the ways in which global
corporations and public actors have co-created

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,740
our built environment and our lifestyles around
petroleum—in its multiple forms—over the

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,660
last 150 years.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,949
We will look at oil as an actor of urban,
socio-economic and cultural change,

6
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,200
through the lens of the Randstad,
the Netherlands.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,640
To project sustainable cities of the future,
we have to take into account both the cities

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,350
that we have some of which have evolved over
thousands of years

9
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,190
and the cultures of the people who live in
these cities.

10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,860
To facilitate the implementation of new technologies
and energy-policies,

11
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,850
we also need to inspire new mindsets.

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,280
That includes helping people understand how
things are now:

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:12,560
This map of 2014 shows how the flows of oil—and
money—connect producers and consumers around

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,960
the world effectively linking highways
in the US or Europe to new iconic buildings

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,920
in the Middle East.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:30,090
These images help citizens read oil’s commodity
and financial flows through built form.

17
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,720
As we trace the history of oil’s impact
on cities,

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,990
we find planned interventions,
perhaps best illustrated by the City of the

19
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,870
Future project for the 1939 World’s Fair
in New York.

20
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:48,970
Sponsored by General Motors and imagined by
Normal Bel Geddes,

21
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,630
this vision was used for advertisement purposes
by Shell.

22
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:00,460
It went on to inspire urban form in the second
part of the 20th century,

23
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,750
Public planning has created many urban areas
and set the conditions for economic development.

24
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,719
But private actors and the commodity flows
associated with them have also driven unplanned

25
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,790
urban change,
such as suburban sprawl that developed with

26
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,590
the growing use of the car.

27
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,590
The extraordinary reach of corporations into
political and economic institutions is well

28
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,760
captured in this 1904 cartoon illustrating
Standard Oil’s reach for the steel,

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,859
copper and shipping industries,
as well as a state house,

30
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:37,779
the U.S.

31
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:40,859
Capitol,
and the White House.

32
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:44,819
The global corporations of the oil industry
(here in blue),

33
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:51,650
with the support of public actors (red),
have utterly transformed the built environment.

34
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,769
They have constructed landscapes,
urban forms and functions,

35
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:58,069
as well as buildings of various scales,
types,

36
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:58,579
and aesthetics.

37
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:04,620
In short,
architectural and urban expressions of the

38
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,879
network of oil.

39
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,719
The same corporations that have changed the
built environment have also influenced how

40
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,540
we conceive of,
use,

41
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,709
and design it.

42
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,889
In turn,
these imaginary scapes influence architects,

43
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:23,669
artists,
writers and the general public (yellow) as

44
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,939
they produce buildings and artistic works,
but also films,

45
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:33,689
literature or every-day language that represent
the built environment.

46
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:39,159
I employ the notion of petroleumscape to capture
to capture these flows and spaces,
