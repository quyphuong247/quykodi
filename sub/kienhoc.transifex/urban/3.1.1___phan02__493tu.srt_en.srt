47
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,709

and are often framed as the Innovative City,
the Smart City or the Creative City.

48
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,859
There are however important,
if not MORE important,

49
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,749
social aspects as well.

50
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:42,670
The most pressing urban problems are not technological,
but social in nature,

51
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,060
and have tended to be exacerbated,
not solved by corporate-led privatization

52
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,159
and city branding strategies.

53
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,349
This relates to the ‘equity’ component
in the concept of Sustainable Development.

54
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:57,650
As by mid-century 2 BILLION people in developing
countries will be living in informal settlements.

55
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,209
This is also connected to what is called ‘capital
biased technical change’,

56
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:10,510
where urban poor have less access to and opportunities
for technology and progress caused by technical

57
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,760
innovations.

58
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,959
And thus,
less access to a better future.

59
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,090
This is why the challenges related to socio
economic change should include the perspective

60
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,440
from both formal as well as informal urban
areas,

61
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,569
and how informal developments and people can
be supported to empower,

62
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,849
transform,
and improve their living environments.

63
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:41,500
Within such an informal growth context it
is important to be aware that humans have

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,690
a fundamental right to certain facilities,
the ‘right to the city’,

65
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,330
as Henri Lefebvre framed it;
and which could be specified into the ‘right

66
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,849
to access and infrastructure’.

67
00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:00,819
This relates to the lack of some basis services,
like for instance sewerage and clean water,

68
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:07,389
which still in many parts of developing metropolitan
regions in the world are the case.

69
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,620
Because it is here that the brunt of urban
growth is taking place,

70
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,180
as we saw in last week’s challenge of Urbanization.

71
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,050
To make it even more crucial:
often these extensions are located at the

72
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,900
most vulnerable places in cities,
like on slopes subject to landslides,

73
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,310
or in deltas,
subject to flooding.

74
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,639
Events that are expected to happen more frequently
the coming years,

75
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,220
due to climate change,
which is the challenge that will be addressed

76
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,490
next week.

77
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,389
Another important notion is the following:
although we are using technology to find solutions

78
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,620
for many things,
if not everything,

79
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,990
we often don’t seem to think about whether
and how people will embrace these solutions.

80
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,759
And how dependent and resilient it makes them.

81
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,550
People adapt their behavior,
and that can have either negative or positive

82
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,610
consequences to the way we organize and run
our daily lives and urban environments.

83
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,190
This is also specified by the sociological
fact that humans are malleable and conditioned

84
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,729
by their social environment,
not the natural environment.

85
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:25,970
This has a negative side:
people do not act as we expect them to do.

86
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,039
Like for instance in the Dutch city of Amersfoort,
where a new,

87
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,729
solar based ‘zero-energy’ urban neighborhood
of several hundreds of houses in the district

88
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:39,599
of Nieuwland was realized,
but once people started living there,

89
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:46,280
it resulted not to be at all energy neutral
any more After investigating the case,

90
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,379
it resulted that,
besides of several technological problems,

91
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:53,729
people also used too much energy,
as they thought that,

92
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:59,030
as energy was generated by renewables,
they could use more.
