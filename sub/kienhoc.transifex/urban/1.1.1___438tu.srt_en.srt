Welcome to the MOOC Sustainable Urban Development,
Discover Advanced Metropolitan solutions.

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,790
My name is Arjan van Timmeren.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:22,820
This MOOC is in initiated by AMS,
the Amsterdam based Institute for Advanced

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,380
Metropolitan Solutions,
a joint initiative by Massachusetts Institute

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,890
of Technology,
Delft University of Technology and Wageningen

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,140
University and Research,
together with a growing group of international

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,760
business partners,
citizen platforms and public authorities.

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,519
In this institute science,
education,

9
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:48,510
government,
business partners and societal organizations

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,570
are working tightly together to create solutions
for the complex challenges metropolitan regions

11
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,970
all around the world,
like for instance Amsterdam,

12
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,440
are facing.

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,449
So what are the challenges?

14
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:05,610
And how should we approach these challenges?

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,110
AMS tries to find solutions by research with
an interdisciplinary perspective,

16
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,090
and a use or user perspective,
first of all,

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:25,570
by ‘sensing the city’ ’designing metropolitan
Solutions’ and ‘integrate and test solutions’

18
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,780
in real life urban settings,
or so-called ‘test beds’ and ‘living

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,180
labs’.

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,840
Main questions for such metropolitan areas
are Where should we be going when we want

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,990
to address to growth or shrinkage and develop
our future city ?

22
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,670
And Which technological,
ecological and social opportunities can be

23
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,229
used to engineer and design such desirable
future?

24
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:56,190
But also,
Which metropolitan solutions still need to

25
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,090
be researched,
developed and tested?

26
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,190
and How to turn this into economic growth
as well?

27
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:11,060
And last but not least How to create a more
prosperous city for ALL citizens?

28
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,530
To find solutions for such challenging questions,
the AMS Research program is organized around

29
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,400
three themes: The Connected City,
The Vital City,

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
and The Circular City.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,730
Concrete research and education is organized
around these three main themes.

32
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:39,590
This first AMS MOOC will give the overall
introduction to such solutions and these themes.

33
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,900
In this MOOC we focus on metropolitan regions,
the engines of modern civilization,

34
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:52,910
as 70% of Global GDP is being created in metropolitan
regions around the globe.

35
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,069
Metropolitan regions are characterized by
their reciprocities,

36
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:02,170
or mutual dependencies,
with the surrounding environment,

37
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,099
their peri-urban areas and hinterlands.

38
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:11,030
But also by the reciprocities between technology
and people,

39
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,160
nature and culture,
with incoming flows of energy,

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,099
water and materials and outgoing wastes.

41
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,170
And above all characterized by the resulting
dynamics,

42
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,920
with different scales of interaction and a
mix of complex technical systems on the one

43
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,260
hand,
and human behaviour on the other.

44
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:40,430
There’s a saying “People make a city”
but in fact “people ARE the city”.

45
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,500
The bottom line is what makes citizens happy?

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,830
Therefore this MOOC will always look at societal
and metropolitan challenges,

47
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:58,000
from the perspective of engineering and foremost
the perspective of citizens and stakeholders,

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560
people in general YOU in particular!
