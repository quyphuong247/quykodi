the car (as a driver or a passengers) or the
bike… Or in case of goods transport,

37
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:03,870
for example,
the lorry or a ship Transport also requires

38
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,389
infrastructure,
the hardware allowing vehicles and people

39
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:14,819
to move,
such as roads as you can see on this picture.

40
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,279
or rail and airports.

41
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:25,859
A next part of the transport system is the
so called ‘services’ that companies offer

42
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:29,569
to potential clients.

43
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,370
Services are,
for example,

44
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,579
the options offered to travel by public transport,
including train,

45
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:39,870
tram,
metro and bus,

46
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,199
often expressed in the form of time tables.

47
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,870
Or those offered by airline companies.

48
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:53,629
Or taxi services,
either conventional or modern types like ‘Uber’.

49
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:57,689
Or services to deliver goods.

50
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:04,569
Another part of the transport system includes
the costs to make use of that system.

51
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:09,549
Costs firstly relate to the monetary costs
one has to pay,

52
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,150
for – for example – a bike,
a car,

53
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,690
fuel,
parking,

54
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,299
or for travelling by public transport.

55
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,900
Costs also include the time needed to travel
and the effort it takes.

56
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:31,919
Effort is a broad term covering anything but
time and monetary costs,

57
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:39,759
such as energy in case of walking and cycling,
mental effort in case of driving,

58
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,770
and the discomfort of travelling,
such as in case of heavily crowded trains

59
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,169
or when it rains and one walks or cycles.

60
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:57,280
Or the risks one runs – not any mode is
100% safe.

61
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,949
Regulations are the legal rules,
such as maximum speeds on different types

62
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:09,259
of roads,
and emission or safety standards for vehicles.

63
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:13,930
To wrap up:
Transport is a very complex and heterogeneous

64
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,659
sector and cities cannot function without
transport.

65
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,530
But,
it also causes problems,

66
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:28,009
because urban transport can make cities unattractive,
and emits much CO2.

67
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:35,939
A huge challenge for cities therefore is how
to provide enough options to travel for people,

68
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:41,169
and to transport goods,
without too much negative impact on the environment.
