Welcome!

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,340
Today we 
will give you a short introduction to Space
Syntax.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:24,39
This method is unique in linking spatial properties
of the urban environment to socio-economic

4
00:00:24,39 --> 00:00:25,619
characteristics.

5
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,250
From an urban point of view Space Syntax consists
of four things.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,749
First of all,
it gives a concise definition of urban space.

7
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:40,929
Secondly,
it is a family of techniques for analyzing

8
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:44,839
cities as the networks of space.

9
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:49,219
These spaces are formed by buildings,
the placing of buildings,

10
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,579
the grouping of buildings,
and the orientation of buildings.

11
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,899
Thirdly,
space syntax is also a set of techniques for

12
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,989
how you can correlate the spatial analysis
with socio- economic data,

13
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,940
such as movement patterns,
land use,

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,220
areal differentiation,
and migration patterns and even the social

15
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,820
wellbeing and malaise.

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,669
Fourthly,
space syntax consists also of a set of theories

17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,480
about how urban space networks relate in general
to social factors,

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:33,170
economic factors and cognitive factors,
which shape them and are affected by them.

19
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,980
For example,
the theory of the natural movement economic

20
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:44,500
process shows how the spatial configuration
influences the flow of movement from everywhere

21
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,750
to everywhere else,
and the relation with the location of economic

22
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,630
activities,
likes shops,

23
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,250
restaurants,
etc.

24
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,180
In order to analyze the city we start with
the axial map.

25
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,820
You can process this map through a software.

26
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,550
This software provides a set of color codes.

27
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:14,239
Behind these color codes are hidden numbers,
which represent different levels of integration.

28
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,439
The red are the most integrated areas,
and the blue the most segregated areas.

29
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:25,269
So,
the red ones are the most accessible streets,

30
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:29,900
and the blue ones the least accessible streets.

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,529
What happens when the structure of the street
network changes?

32
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:42,120
One example to show how the axial-integration
affects the city is the Berlin case before

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,950
and after the Berlin wall.

34
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,10
From the 60’s to the 80’s the city was
divided by a wall.

35
00:02:50,10 --> 00:02:54,649
This blocked the movement routes between east
to west.

36
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,870
If you look at the map and see what happens
when you remove the wall,

37
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,680
then you will see the new center of Berlin,
which is the red line,

38
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,639
the Friedrichsstrasse.

39
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,299
Now it is becoming the new high-street of
Berlin.

40
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:19,480
You can also use this method to indicate where
are the potential centers of the city.

41
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,129
This is the case of Oslo from 1999.

42
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:30,730
When you run a global integration,
which means taking the whole city into account,

43
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,499
then you see the outer ring road becomes the
most integrated space.

44
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:41,59
There you have all the car-based shopping
malls.

45
00:03:41,59 --> 00:03:48,169
You can also run a local integration,
and that highlights the various local centers

46
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,169
in the city.

47
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:57,29
Here you can see Oslo’s three local centers
popping up.

48
00:03:57,29 --> 00:04:03,609
You can correlate the axial map with the dispersion
of functions.
