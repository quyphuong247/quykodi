Hi there, thanks for watching today!

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,790
In this video you will learn about the role
of cities in addressing climate change.

3
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,270
Let me first tell you about the international
context of climate change before going into

4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,080
the specific role of cities.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,779
First of all, climate change is a global problem
and therefore is tackled through collaborative

6
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,790
state action in the United Nations, specifically
under the United Nations Framework Convention

7
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,440
on Climate Change.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,690
This negotiation process started already in
1992 but has been developing rather slowly

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,010
as states have been hesitant to commit to
ambitious targets to reduce green house gas

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,670
emissions.

11
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,920
In December 2015, nation states adopted the
Paris Agreement at the 21st Conference of

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,600
the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,200
This agreement represents a new chapter in
state efforts to tackle global warming.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,640
For the first time in history, states have
agreed to not just limit global warming to

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,700
a maximum of 2 degrees above pre-industrial
levels.

16
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,190
They have become more ambitious by agreeing
to limit temperature rise to well below 2

17
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:33,280
degrees and to pursue efforts to limit global
warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

18
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,289
But despite this agreement, nation states
are thus for not doing enough and not promising

19
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:43,369
enough to effectively mitigate climate change.

20
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,679
According to an assessment done by Climate
Action Tracker, national mitigation pledges

21
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:55,489
associated with the Paris Agreement will result
in 2.7 degrees global warming.

22
00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:01,849
Through the effects of severe drought, sea-level
rise and extreme weather events, such temperature

23
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:06,500
rise will have a massive impact on local communities.

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,030
So given this action gap, other actors than
our national governments have stepped up to

25
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,150
take action themselves to reduce green house
gas emissions - called mitigation action - and

26
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,870
to prepare for the effects of climate change
- called adaptation action.

27
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,790
Cities are amongst these actors that have
stepped up in the fight against climate change.

28
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:36,280
Action by cities also makes sense as cities
account for a major share of the world's emissions.

29
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,019
The urban built environment and car traffic
between urban centres and the suburbs are

30
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:45,159
both important contributors of high emission
shares by cities.

31
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,810
This share is further enhanced by emissions
from the many industries or even airports

32
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,319
located in the metropolitan region.

33
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,840
But luckily many cities have started to develop
mitigation and adaptation strategies to climate

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,950
change.

35
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,189
And adaptation measures can even go in tandem
with mitigation strategies.

36
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:12,739
For instance, more green parks and green roofs
are beneficial for storm-water management

37
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:19,159
to reduce risk of flooding – which is adaptation
– but more green parks and green roofs can

38
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,650
also contribute to the reduction of green
house gas emmissions which is again about

39
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,810
the mitigation of climate change.

40
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,939
Another example of how cities promote mitigation
measures is by bike sharing schemes to reduce

41
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,819
car usage.

42
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:38,769
Big cities such as Paris are actively endorsing
such schemes.

43
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,299
In taking climate action, cities are moving
away from top-down policy-making where cities

44
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:48,989
execute policies set by the nation state and
impose rules on their citizens.

45
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,019
Instead, there is a move towards a governance
approach to climate change in which power

46
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,879
is no longer centralised around the national
government.

47
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,989
This shift to governance allows for more policy-action
taken on a city-level and for active collaboration
