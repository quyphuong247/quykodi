Welcome back!

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,910
This video continues our exploration of port
cities.

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,880
This time you will learn how ports,
waterfronts,

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,060
and port cities changed after the 1960s,
as containerization triggered a wholesale

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,890
restructuring of shipping networks,
trade patterns,

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,390
port facilities,
port city hierarchies,

7
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,940
and urban form.

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:42,230
From the late 1960s to the late 1970s,
ship sizes increased,

9
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,489
with container,
oil,

10
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:51,519
and bulk carriers passing the previous upper
limit of 50.000 tons gross and requiring deeper

11
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,879
waterways and harbors.

12
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,949
As few ports were able to handle these new
huge ships,

13
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:00,070
city governments,
port authorities,

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:06,520
and shipping companies around the world developed
new terminals on the outskirts of cities where

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,450
deeper water was available.

16
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,750
Among the European ports,
Rotterdam was one of the first to receive

17
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,590
a container ship,
in 1966.

18
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:24,240
The city has regularly adapted its port,
extending its range from the inner city towards

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,729
the sea in the West.

20
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,399
Excellent connections by rail and barge to
the large inland river container terminal

21
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:33,909
in Duisburg,
Germany,

22
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,390
further spurred the growth of the Rotterdam
port.

23
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,499
Today,
the leading container ports are located in

24
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:44,030
the Middle East and Asia.

25
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:50,759
The huge ships that dock there travel to and
from Europe and America.

26
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,450
New ports have emerged in China,
where many goods originate and where leaders

27
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,899
have fostered the growth of ports since the
1970s.

28
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,960
Larger ships require deeper waterways and
ports that are built into the sea.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,720
Deep-water ports are defined as ports that
can accommodate the largest ships that can

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,540
cross the Panama Canalâ€™s locks,
so-called Panamax ships.

31
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,819
With a recent expansion,
the Panama Canal can accommodate even bigger

32
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:24,370
ships.

33
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,170
Many ports around the world will also have
to adapt (or relocate) in order to host the

34
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,010
new so-called Super-Panamax ships.

35
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,879
Discussions of port expansion are already
underway in port cities on the American East

36
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,860
Coast,
including Savannah,

37
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,599
Georgia.

38
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,970
Global trade is visible in the huge number
of containers circling the earth on these

39
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,939
ships.

40
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:58,709
The World Bank counted a little over 651.000.000
transshipments of 20-foot container units

41
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,569
in 2013.

42
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:09,060
It is also visible in the enormous amounts
of oil that ships carry from producer to consumer.

43
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,269
Turnaround time,
the time a ship needs to unload and reload,

44
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,930
is a major factor in the success of a port.

45
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:23,159
Another major factor is adaptability:
how quickly and how well ports and their neighboring

46
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,829
cities can adapt to technological,
political,
