Hello!

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,160
There is a question I would like to discuss
today.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,460
That is:
How to design a socially sustainable living

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,810
environment?

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:28,179
A sustainable urban environment facilitates
the primary needs for ALL individuals.

6
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:32,489
Bases on these needs,
how do we create a socially sustainable living

7
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,170
environment?

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,230
And will this lead us to a sustainable metropolitan
area?

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,190
The first need is a healthy living environment.

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:48,870
There is a significant relation between the
design (or non-design) of the urban fabric

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,370
and life expectancy of its inhabitants.

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,800
City growth puts pressure on the living environment.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,329
A city growing beyond control has to deal
with the unhealthy living conditions.

14
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,140
The cleaning up of slums began in the western
world in the 19th century.

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:15,220
Substantial improvements were made due to
the development of sewer infrastructure,

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,820
clean drinking water and the improvement of
the air quality.

17
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,630
In the current age of climate change we are
facing new health problems,

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,110
caused by heat stress,
air pollution or flooding,

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:35,310
as you can see here in Calgary,
Canada in 2013.

20
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,390
These apartment blocks in St Louis Missouri
USA were built in the beginning of the 1950th..

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,340
You can see high-rise buildings,
floating public space and better infrastructure,

22
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,270
which are the ingredients of the modernistic
movement.

23
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,760
Can we call this a healthy living environment?

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,910
The neighborhood proved not to be livable!

25
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,880
The crime rates were extremely high In the
beginning of the 1970th the local government

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,840
decided to demolish these buildings.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,340
This brings us to the next primary need,
which is safety.

28
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,590
In cities safety comes in various forms,
such as traffic safety,

29
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,490
fire safety,
crime prevention or security.

30
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,380
Safety is secured by regulation and formal
control.

31
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:34,030
For example facilitated by police and fire
departments or by water safety measures.

32
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,060
Safety can also be facilitated by design interventions.

33
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,960
Related to that the meaning of perceived safety
is important to understand.

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,060
This meaning is nicely expressed in the old
saying "A man who fears suffering is already

35
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:57,530
suffering from what he fears." Would you walk
through this park in the evening?

36
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,340
A safe living environment also facilitate
perceived safety!

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,140
Perceived safety is about seeing and being
seen.

38
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,690
attractive design,
accessibility,

39
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,540
and legibility.
