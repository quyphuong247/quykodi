traditional labor-intensive and low-value-added
industries have been gradually replaced by

90
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:12,110
more knowledge-intensive high value-added
one,

91
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,560
such as high-tech,
finance,

92
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,440
foreign trade,
shipping and creative industries.

93
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,280
Shenzhen wants to departure from its image
as manufactural base to focus more on its

94
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:34,389
future images -“eco(logical) system/environment”
and “innovation”.

95
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,449
In the Guangzhou case,
both central government’s open-door policy

96
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:44,980
and local government’s mega event strategies
shaped the city’s urban growth.

97
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:51,880
Guangzhou was considered China’s “South
Gate” and certainly one of its oldest cities.

98
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,400
It is the political,
economic,

99
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,020
educational and cultural capital of Guangdong
Province,

100
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,130
as well as a strong international trade center.

101
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:11,080
As one of the fourteen coastal open cities,
Guangzhou could grasp the opportunity to revitalize

102
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,890
its commercial function by creating Guangzhou
Economic and Technological Development Zone

103
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,310
to attract foreign investment.

104
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:29,480
Hosting the 6th and 9th National Games and
2010 Asian Games has provided the city with

105
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,920
an opportunity to establish the city’s new
urban districts with Central Business District

106
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,150
facilities and advanced transport infrastructures.

107
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:47,910
These developments pushed the expansion of
Guangzhou towards eastern and southern sides.

108
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:54,550
Strategic projects currently under implementation
in Guangzhou linked to urban innovation and

109
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,779
sustainable development,
such as Sino Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge

110
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,800
City and Nansha New Area.

111
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,270
Despite their enormous urban growth,
all three cities encounter the challenge of

112
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,040
economic restructuring to maintain their competitiveness
within the region.

113
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,790
All three cities compete for port activities
and for financial and high-tech sector.

114
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:27,680
All cities now emphasize liveability issues,
like affordable housing,

115
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,740
clean environment,
and social equality,

116
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,990
in its urban strategy.

117
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:40,330
Fragmented regional coordination,
resulted in the delay or suspension of a number

118
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:49,000
of regional integration measures such as the
inter-region high-speed train system or bridges.

119
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,850
For example,
the Hong-Kong-Macau-Zhuhai Bridge project

120
00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:00,770
left Shenzhen out after 20 years of negotiation
due to the objection of Hong Kong.

121
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,130
Shenzhen,
fearing it will be left out of the connection,

122
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:12,140
decided to build its own bridge connecting
to the west Pearl River Delta Region.

123
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:20,040
The same fragmentation in regional coordination
can also be found in environmental or resource

124
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,160
redistribution issues.

125
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,529
If the three cities want to further develop
in a sustainable way,

126
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,210
regional coordination between local state
and in coordination with national and regional

127
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:40,680
government like the Guangdong provincial government
becomes more essential.

128
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,860
Observing the development path of the three
cities in the past decades,

129
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,649
we see not only different layers of government
which have played a role,

130
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:56,750
but also that other stakeholders within the
city have got a stronger voice.

131
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,430
In Hong Kong,
contrary to the will of the Hong Kong Government

132
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,600
and the business sector,
strong public sentiments oppose or hesitate
