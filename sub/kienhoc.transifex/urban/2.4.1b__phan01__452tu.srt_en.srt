In this video two recent key developments
will be discussed which are leading in todays

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,970
discourse on finding metropolitan solutions
regarding Urban Services and Transport.

3
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,310
First of all it concerns the concept of Urban
Metabolism,

4
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,210
as shown here to the left,
in a schematic partial section over a piece

5
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,800
of urban tissue.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,180
Second the concept of Eco System Services,
as indicated in the figure to the right showing

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:47,339
its four main categories The concept of Urban
Metabolism looks at a human settlement according

8
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,570
to the analogy of animal and plant cells.

9
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,780
The animal cell has a so-called ‘consume
value’,

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,530
based on the process of homeostasis and growth
with use of stored energy,

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:06,320
oxygen and water and production of carbon
dioxide and refuse..

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,150
while the plant cells to some extent turn
this around.

13
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,719
In this way they have a ‘create value’,
where they create oxygen and store energy

14
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,430
based on the same kind of processes,
taking carbon dioxide,

15
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,509
sunlight and water as input.

16
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:30,880
Metabolism is a precondition for life,
along with six other essential aspects of

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,929
living,
or so-called regenerative systems;

18
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,899
these are:
Homeostasis,

19
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,469
Structural organization,
Growth,

20
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,420
Adaptation,
Response to stimuli,

21
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,530
and Reproduction.

22
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,990
The complex notion of ‘Panarchy’,
which will not be explained in detail in this

23
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,609
video,
is also based on these aspects and the continuous

24
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,189
cycle with the four stages ‘Exploitation’,
‘Conservation’,

25
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:04,990
‘Release’ and ‘Reorganization’.

26
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:11,460
The joint notion of these preconditions for
life and the concept of panarchy are an increasingly

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:18,090
important starting point for many elaborations
of urban resilience.

28
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,120
Though metabolism was at first used to describe
living organisms.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,840
Pioneering ecologist Arthur Tansley expanded
the term in 1935.

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,650
To encompass the material and energetic streams
from the inorganic construction of settlements,

31
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:44,890
and introduced the ‘Urban Metabolism’
Urban Metabolism focuses on the dynamics of

32
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,980
cities,
beyond ‘traditional’ mobility and the

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,459
relationships between built and uncultivated
environments.

34
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,730
In relation to Scarcity,
Carrying capacity,

35
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:04,310
and Conservation of Mass and Energy It is
used as a framework for modeling complex urban

36
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,260
systems’ material and energy streams,
as if the city were an ecosystem.

37
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,060
It has strong relations to other concepts
that build upon mimicking nature,

38
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,290
like Biomimicry by Janine Benyus,
and Cradle to Cradle by William McDonough

39
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:29,049
and Michael Braungart Several complex elaborations
have even tried to realize full closure of

40
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:35,540
essential systems building upon the concepts
of Urban Metabolism and Industrial Ecology,

41
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,610
like here shown for instance the concept of
the ‘Zonneterp’ project in the Netherlands.

42
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,360
Urban metabolism,
however,

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,829
is not without its critics.

44
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:52,799
It has been challenged by certain social scientists
because it neglects the sociological fact

45
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,530
that humans are malleable and conditioned
by their social environment,

46
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:04,769
not the natural environment From this perspective,
planning cities as a metaphor for a large
