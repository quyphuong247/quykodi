biological entity is naïve because human
relationships with the environment and other

48
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,840
humans are more complicated.

49
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,859
Though sociological studies of urban metabolism
have shown some irrationality of societies

50
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,040
in regards to essential streams,
there is one,

51
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,890
thankfully positive observation:
Human settlements are able to adapt to environmental

52
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,940
conditions,
and humans are self aware of their actions

53
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,780
and capable [presenter] to adjust behaviors.

54
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,990
So it is important to include further benefits,
and feedback loops to us humans,

55
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:51,670
to positively influence our behavior This
is why recent extended Urban Metabolism approaches

56
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:58,540
include the notion of synergism,
to use the benefits of the intrinsic relationships

57
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:05,320
existing within the urban metabolic system
And this directly connects to the second key

58
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,860
development which is leading in todays discourse
on finding metropolitan solutions regarding

59
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,660
Urban Services and Transport.

60
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:21,560
The so-called concept of Eco Systems Services
Humankind benefits in a multitude of ways

61
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,070
from ecosystems.

62
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:32,580
Eco System Services are defined as the direct
and indirect contributions of ecosystem structures

63
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,700
and functions,
...

64
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,100
in combination with other inputs,
...

65
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,820
to human well-being.

66
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,160
The ecosystem services concept itself was
popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,

67
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,490
where it was grouped into four categories:
‘Provisioning’,

68
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,780
‘Regulating’,
‘Supporting’,

69
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,270
and Cultural.

70
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,810
Provisioning’ includes for instance the
production of food and water;

71
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,710
‘Regulating’,
includes for instance the control of climate

72
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,520
and disease;
‘Supporting’,

73
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,070
refers to support of nutrient cycles and crop
pollination;

74
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,020
while ‘Cultural values’,
for instance include spiritual and recreational

75
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,650
benefits.

76
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,550
To help inform decision makers,
many ecosystem services are being assigned

77
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,370
economic values as well.

78
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,940
In the end Ecosystems services is all about
trying to include synergism between different

79
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,080
functions,
and above all to do so in an inclusive way

80
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,740
with people / users and to do so in a balanced
way between soft and hard infrastructure,

81
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,500
nature and technology.

82
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:59,490
In doing so,
it becomes a motive to new coalitions of infrastructures

83
00:06:59,490 --> 00:06:59,990
and stakeholders.

84
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,180
A motive to a new forms of infrastructure
lay-out and multiple use of space with multiple

85
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,240
benefits.

86
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:17,930
And a motive to new forms of urban transformation,
building site preparation and maintenance.

87
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,860
Finally,
both the concept of Urban Metabolism and Eco

88
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:30,300
System Services can be applied in different
urban morphologies and with different densities,

89
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,830
as shown in the three examples from left to
right,

90
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:42,110
Chengdou China,
Masdar City United Arab Emirates and Culemborg

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,680
Lanxmeer in The Netherlands.
