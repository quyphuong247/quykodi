Which of course was not always and entirely
the case But there’s also a positive side

94
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:07,930
to this concept of malleability and the fact
that humans are conditioned by their social

95
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,060
environment.

96
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,180
It also means that people can be educated,
that they can change in a positive way,

97
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,930
Preferably together,
and preferably by involving them as much as

98
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:24,430
possible and by including so-called ‘feedback
loops’ in the solutions you design for them.

99
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,580
For this,
two levels of scale are essential.

100
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,770
The first is the scale of the neighbourhood,
or the local (living) area,

101
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:38,310
where solutions meet users,
and actual spatial integration aspects.

102
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,939
The second is that of the urban area of the
larger city,

103
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:49,000
or so-called metropolitan region,
including its hinterland and connecting infrastructures.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,470
As it is often in these hinterlands that cities
need to find their resources,

105
00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:00,289
and space to cope with their wastes or generate
Presenter] their energy.

106
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:04,939
Related to this aspect of scale and scope
of social economic change is that cities,

107
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:10,030
or their developments are too often viewed
uniquely from an urban centered perspective.

108
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:17,710
Implying that anything outside it is seen
as rural and excluded or considered less relevant.

109
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,520
But the city cannot exist without the countryside,
its hinterland,

110
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:27,280
and –as stated before- very often cities
are crucially dependent on the in-between,

111
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,320
so-called “peri-urban” areas as well,
to solve their resources,

112
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,130
help improve their climate and provide space
for mobility recreation and much more.

113
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:47,140
This dependency of cities to their hinterlands
is often stronger than experienced or expected.

114
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,720
In the early nineties,
of the previous century,

115
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,750
a method was introduced by Wackernagel and
Rees,

116
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,420
to translate and calculate this into the space
necessary for all activities of life,

117
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:06,230
which is called the “Ecological Footprint”,
and visualizes well the misfit between available

118
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,980
space and dependency of space and related
activities,

119
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,130
products or services of a certain entity.

120
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:23,520
At the moment our global Ecological Footprint,
as you can see is much larger,

121
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,390
approximately 1.8 times the amount of surface
available on our planet.

122
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,510
In Week 5 of this MOOC you will do such a
calculation of the ecological footprint for

123
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,060
your own geographical context.

124
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,480
So,
we use more than there is available.

125
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,830
This over-consumption is possible because
of inherited resources:

126
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,820
like fossil fuel,
fertile land,

127
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,260
clean water and even oxygen in the atmosphere.

128
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,350
The act of converting renewable resources
into waste faster than waste can be turned

129
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:05,760
back into resources is termed “global ecological
overshoot”.

130
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,420
Unfortunately this is only expected to grow
further due to Urbanization and more resource

131
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,020
intensive lifestyles.

132
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,490
In the world map based upon all the countries’
Ecological Footprint,

133
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:26,840
you can see how unequal our world still is
the same holds for cities.

134
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,650
Take for instance the city Hong Kong.

135
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,760
A city like Hong Kong requires no less than
2,200 times its own surface area in order

136
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,700
to sustain itself.

137
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,590
Of course this doesn’t just concern satisfaction
of its needs in the direct hinterland.

138
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,010
Due to globalization it concerns processes,
services and resources,
