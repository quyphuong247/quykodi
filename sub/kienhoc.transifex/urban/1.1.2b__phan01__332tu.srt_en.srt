Hello and Welcome Now,
let’s have a closer look at the MOOC matrix,

2
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,270
and define these challenges and the themes.

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,770

4
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,250
As you already know,
at the moment more than 50% of the world-population

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,700

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,590
With an estimated 70% living in cities in
2050.

7
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,930
The questions regarding to this challenge
are.

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,500
What are the consequences of urbanization?

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,030
How must our cities cope with this extensive
growth?

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,530
.

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,440
and at the same time become sustainable and
prosperous?

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,890
Week 3 focuses on Socio‐economic Change.

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,290
or the process of how economic activity affects
and is shaped by society.

14
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,590
This is presented as a key driving force for
change in our cities.

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,229
As the global community becomes more wealthy,
new types of challenges emerge,

16
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:20,259
for instance related to how we manage resources,
or how to protect street life and community

17
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,770
building.

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,700
Week 4 addresses the challenge of Climate
Change.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,799
This is currently perceived as one of the
major challenges to human kind.

20
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,829
It involves many different effects,
like for instance temperature rise,

21
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:35,329
flood risks,
and other weather extremes.

22
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:41,060
We will first look at the basic process that
drive global climate change and then explore

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,159
how cities can mitigate and adapt to climate
change.

24
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,670
In week 5 we will addresses Resource Shortages.

25
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,729
Cities are responsible for about 70% of the
resource consumption,

26
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,689
but only occupy 2% of the land surface.

27
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,520
So,
in this week we will look at opportunities

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,049
and solutions to implement ideas for reducing
resource consumption and reusing and recycling

29
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,079
resources.

30
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,079
The focus will be on the interplay and the
relationship between carbon,

31
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:14,170
water and nutrients for food production.

32
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,239
In week 6,
the focus is on Digitization & (Geo)data.

33
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,140
Digitization concerns the challenges and opportunities
regarding ‘big data’ and the ‘Internet

34
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,110
of things’ for both cities and citizens.

35
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,670
This includes concepts of so-called ‘smart
sensing’ and user feed-back systems.

36
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,400
By connecting it to Geo Information Systems
you will discover opportunities on how to

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,030
use new ICT technologies to provide cities
with real-time feedback,

38
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,719
and help empower citizens.
