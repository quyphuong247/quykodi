00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,569

But,
climate change is not independent of socio-economic

40
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:55,489
change.

41
00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:02,230
While resource consumption can be managed
better by using digitisation tools.

42
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,629
So,
in the 7th and last week we will specifically

43
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:12,079
look at the relationships and synergies of
these challenges.

44
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:17,030
The aim is to discover cross-overs between
solutions.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,760
and how smart integration and involvement
of ALL perspectives will help support innovative

46
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:32,379
and lasting solution towards liveable and
prosperous metropolitan communities!

47
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,780
Now let us look at the themes.

48
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,010
As a reminder.

49
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,459
They represent different areas of expertise
or you may say different lenses through which

50
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,670
to see the world The first theme is Shape
& Structure.

51
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,819
This describes the physical layout of the
city.

52
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,879
So in more scientific terms the urban morphologies
and typologies.

53
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,329
The next theme is Urban Services,
Infrastructure & Transport.

54
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:01,090
By urban services we mean the everyday and
often taken for granted services that provide

55
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,510
you with water,
food,

56
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,540
energy,
waste management as well as transportation.

57
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:15,319
These services require a large amount of resources
and often rely on extremely costly infrastructure.

58
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,940
The fourth theme concerns Natural Resources.

59
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,810
You already know that cities are hubs of resource
consumption.

60
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,360
In this theme we place special emphasis on
natural resources in relation to the global

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,450
challenge to show you.

62
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,840
The fifth theme focusses on Liveability & Urban
Living.

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,100
Liveability is considered an important condition
for sustainability.

64
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,750
We show that urban living is a cause of many
sustainability problems,

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,570
as well as a key aspect for a prosperous and
sustainable society.

66
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,140
The last thematic challenge concerns Policy
& Governance.

67
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,880
This theme describes how governments can act
upon the challenges but it also highlights

68
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,330
how other actors,
such as municipalities and cities can implement

69
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,070
solutions to address each global challenge.

70
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,260
So,
you are invited to explore a specific theme

71
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,470
in which you are interested in more depth.

72
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,770
Thus following a ‘horizontal route’ in
our matrix.

73
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,940
Or you simply follow the MOOC week by week,
along the line of challenges.

74
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,830
In both cases we are sure you will discover
innovative and advanced metropolitan solutions.

75
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,960
We wish you lots of fun following this MOOC
