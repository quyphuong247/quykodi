And when a rainfall drops in between in, than
it will interrupt the signal and you can measure

42
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,120
the droplet.

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,340
The nice advantage is that you can not only
measure how much rainfall it is, but also

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,549
what type of rainfall.

45
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:53,430
Because it measures also the drop size and
the shape of them and also the fall speed.

46
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,280
So you ca actually distinguish between rain
and hail and ice particles or snow.

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,250
Of course there is a disadvantages of rain
gauges as well as disdrometer and that is

48
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,269
that they are point measurements.

49
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,860
You may be aware of an instrument that we
donâ€™t have on this roof which is a weather

50
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,450
radar.

51
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,219
The weather radar sends sound signals into
the sky which is reflected by the sky, so

52
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:22,579
also rain particles, and from that reflection
you can derive a full image of rainfall in

53
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,579
space, which is very valuable of course.

54
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:29,109
The last thing I want to show you here on
the roof is this experimental set-up.

55
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:34,569
You may recognise this thing as a thing that
you usually see on the towers that are normally

56
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:37,319
used for mobile telecommunication.

57
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,049
There is another one of that on the building
2 kilometres that way and it sends a signal

58
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:46,939
to this one, just like it would have if it
was still on a tower for telecommunication.

59
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:52,659
The rainfall hamper that signal and that is
very annoying for the mobile phoning companies.

60
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:55,689
But for us it is actually very useful because
we can derive rainfall from it.

61
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:02,150
This is of course a very useful treat for
urban purposes because where many people are,

62
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,400
in high population density, of course the
density of these type of links are also very

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,249
high, so you can get a very detailed map of
rainfall intensities.

64
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:16,440
And this is an experimental set-up where we
have different kind of links to test which

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,160
ones are best.

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,700
This is all I wanted to show you her on the
roof.

67
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,940
For the next part I want to show you what
happens when the rain hits the ground.

68
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,450
And for that I am going to take you to a rainfall
simulator.

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,200
So, as I promised I would show you what would
happen if the water hits the ground, but as

70
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,680
you see it was not raining outside so I have
to go inside to make it rain.

71
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,780
And that is why we are here.

72
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,530
This is the laboratory for water and sediment
dynamics and here we can simulate all sorts

73
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,530
of water flows.

74
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,620
So mostly in river reaches where we can see
how the water and the sediments on the bottom

75
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,330
of the river move.

76
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,440
But we also have this rainfall simulator and
that is where we are now.

77
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,350
I made a little experiment here in the rainfall
simulator.

78
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,200
I have 3 buckets of soil.

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,830
The first one is with a little bit of grass
inside.

80
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,230
It is an unpaved surface which we can see
in parks and in rural areas.
