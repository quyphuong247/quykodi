133
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,459

to integrate with the mainland cities in the
Greater Pearl River Delta Region.

134
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:21,580
Some even hope Hong Kong can maintain its
competitiveness without any regional collaboration.

135
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,190
In Shenzhen,
the local authorities fear little progress

136
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,050
will be made in regional collaboration with
Hong Kong.

137
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,190
They have decided to develop a new Central
Business District in Qianhai Area without

138
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,839
coordinating any possible competition with
Hong Kong,

139
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,839
albeit hesitation from the business sector.

140
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,380
In Guangzhou,
both government capacity and business interest

141
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,520
in new development were lacking,
leaving the new development of Sino Singapore

142
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:58,839
Guangzhou Knowledge City slow in progress.

143
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,040
Looking back at the development path of the
three cities,

144
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:10,089
it is clear that Hong Kong has tended to establish
its image as a financial hub by claiming its

145
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,529
Asian’s global city status.

146
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:19,080
Shenzhen has developed the profile of a strong
technologically driven and innovation oriented

147
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:25,140
city but ambitious to be more than just China’s
special economic zone.

148
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,779
Meanwhile,
Guangzhou’s identity is somewhat more generic

149
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:35,290
and traditionally leaning on the idea that
it is China’s South Gate,

150
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,230
but face trouble on establishing future image.

151
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:46,860
To conclude:
The growth cities achieve is strongly linked

152
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,769
to their power and capacity to address economic,
spatial,

153
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,080
social and environmental issues in an integrated
manner,

154
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,670
while making the most of future opportunities.

155
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:06,100
The development path of the three cities show
how policies and governance structure influence

156
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,050
urban development process and urban growth.

157
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:16,160
We see that the context and dynamics of individual
cities heavily influence the type of vision,

158
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,880
strategies and implementation put in place
to achieve sustainable urban growth.

159
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:28,830
At policy level,
we can see cities choose different state intervention.

160
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:33,339
In the Hong Kong case,
the role of the local government is indirect,

161
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:39,310
aiming at creating an enabling environment
for a free market environment.

162
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,769
Shenzhen and Guangzhou,
on the other hand,

163
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,160
demonstrate how government,
at different levels,

164
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,100
can influence urban growth through policies.

165
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,680
Shenzhen’s Special Economic Zone is a national
project designed by the central government.

166
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,339
Guangzhou’s development,
especially the exploration of mega event strategy,

167
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,990
is more directed by the local government.

168
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,870
However,
from a governance point of view,

169
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,560
in all three cases,
we see that projects are facing difficulties

170
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,959
or are being suspended as a result of societal
objection or a lack of interest from the business

171
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,080
sector.

172
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,950
How to convince the market players and the
societal forces to develop in a joint force

173
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:31,640
and how to coordinate different layers of
government? This will be the biggest challenge

174
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,309
for these cities.
