Thank you for joining this MOOC on sustainable
urban development.

2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,059
We will support you with

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,660
weekly discussion sessions,
and will actively invite you to get involved

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,910
in discovering advanced metropolitan solutions.

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,489
In this MOOC we will focus each week on one
major challenge for metropolitan areas,

6
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:35,270
the so‐called global drivers for change,
here placed in the horizontal axis.

7
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,350
Urban Growth,
Social-Economic Change, Climate change,

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,570
Resource Shortage, Digitization & (Geo)Data.

9
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:49,839
The last
week focusses on synergies between these challenges.

10
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:52,100
There are five main themes in this MOOC.

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,089
These are perspectives,
or areas of expertise,

12
00:00:55,089 --> 00:01:00,769
from which each of the challenges will be
investigated These are Shape & Structure.

13
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:05,500
Urban services,
Infrastructure and Transport Natural resources

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,080
Liveability and Urban Living And Policy and
Governance.

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,820
When taking part in this MOOC you will thereby
realise that the global challenges cities

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,399
face result in a number of different problems,
when viewed from the different themes.

17
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:24,270
At the same time you will find that each theme
-or perspective- is also offering its own

18
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,280
type of solutions.

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,350
Finally,
we hope you will realise,

20
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:35,759
that the problems and solutions actually span
across all these boxes of the MOOC matrix.

21
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,200
A special thing in this MOOC is the 100 x
100 challenge.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,990
Here you can work in teams on 100 challenges
and to find solutions for 100 cities.

23
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,619
Once you are done,
you will have the chance to compare all these

24
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:51,490
local problems and solutions.

25
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:57,750
We are very much looking forward to see these
challenges and solutions in your cities!

26
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,930
But for now let’s get started with this
MOOC.
