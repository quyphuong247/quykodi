Welcome to the socio-economic change week
of this MOOC!

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,599
This week is all about finding integrated
solutions.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,760
In the Shape & Structure theme you will begin
by learning about the Space Syntax.

4
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:30,300
This method is unique in linking spatial properties
of the urban environment to socio-economic

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,730
characteristics.

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,200
Next,
you will look at how the global corporations

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,020
of the oil industry,
with the support of public actors,

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,250
have transformed the built environment,
but ALSO have influenced how we conceive of,

9
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,480
use,
and design it.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,899
Recognizing and understanding these linkages
is perhaps the first step in creating fossil-free

11
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,670
energy landscapes.

12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,780
You will learn about changes in urban surfaces
and infrastructures over time.

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,590
The focus is on water and energy,
the so-called essential services.

14
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,020
And you will also acquire knowledge on changes
between dominant transport modes,

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,679
and within the current transport system.

16
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:23,679
Then you will learn how socio-economic conditions
are linked to natural resource use.

17
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:29,469
The concept of decoupling natural resource
use from economic growth will be introduced.

18
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:36,130
Under the topic livability and urban living
you will discover how consumer practices have

19
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,759
developed,
in co-evolution with the provision of urban

20
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,179
infrastructures in Europe.

21
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:43,539
Next,
related to this theme,

22
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:49,840
you hear about how changes in urban lifestyles
affect resource use and health.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,539
Finally,
you will learn why metropolitan innovators

24
00:01:54,539 --> 00:02:00,200
need to understand complex systems of governance.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,929
Please fill in the WORD CLOUD the five socio-economic
challenges that affect you most in your daily

26
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,069
life.

27
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,209
Combined,
all your words together,

28
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:16,440
will give us an impression of socio-economic
challenges globally!

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,420
In the PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENT we ask you to
explain WHY you have chosen those challenges.

30
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,320
As you already know,
for the 100x100 CHALLENGE,

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,050
we aspire to contribute towards solving 100
challenges for at least 100 urban areas.

32
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,460
If you are not joining yet,
but are willing to join a team,

33
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,600
please go to the teams tool!

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,820
Then,
in the weekly quiz you can check how much

35
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,000
you have learned.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,640
This week we will have short Mid-Course Survey.

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,160
Please spare us a minute and let us know how
much you're enjoying the course.

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,070
Now,
I wish you loads of fun in this week!
