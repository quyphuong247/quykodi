The redevelopment includes several so-called
lighthouse projects,

94
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,560
architectural objects by famous designers
including the Elbphilharmone by Herzog and

95
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,960
de Meuron,
here seen in the background The HafenCity

96
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,100
area offers views of the working port and
attracts locals and foreigners who occupy

97
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,420
the coffee shops,
restaurants and public spaces.

98
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:34,850
The broad Elbe River provides a safe distance
from noise and other nuisances of the port.

99
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:40,340
The HafenCity is in walking distance from
the inner-city cruise terminal,

100
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,170
boosting shops and restaurants in the area.

101
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:53,600
Vancouver and Boston are other examples of
cities reclaiming old ports for new purposes,

102
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,130
as are Portland and Miami,
and Seattle,

103
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,500
Sydney,
and Melbourne,

104
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,830
Australia each with their local particularities.

105
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,460
Countries in the Middle East are imagining
and building entirely new waterfronts,

106
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,310
with upscale housing,
tourist attractions,

107
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,340
and culture and leisure activities.

108
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,840
They reclaim land from the water specifically
for this purpose,

109
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,140
as here,
the Pearl in Quatar and here,

110
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:36,589
new waterfronts in Saudi Arabia and Manama,
and the palm islands in Dubai,

111
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:44,159
and the waterfront in Abu Dhabi,
both in the United Arab Emirates.

112
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,000
The Marina Bay was developed in Singapore
on reclaimed land.

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,310
Similar land reclamation projects in Kobe,
Japan,

114
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:01,529
and other cities provided space for new developments,
including housing and a multitude of business,

115
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:06,459
commercial,
and cultural functions.

116
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,639
Occasionally cities have built parks on new
waterfront areas.

117
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,990
Kasai Rinkai Koen is the largest park in central
Tokyo,

118
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:22,060
located close to Tokyo Disneyland;
it is all reclaimed waterfront land.

119
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,639
The area aims to recall the natural habitat
of Tokyo Bay;

120
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,379
the Tokyo Sea Life aquarium here features
aquatic habitats from Tokyo,

121
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:37,769
and also from around the world.

122
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:43,620
Professional and local presses have often
touted the revitalization of local waterfronts,

123
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,779
the commodification of historical heritage,
and the creation of new businesses.

124
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:57,269
Occasionally they raise questions about socio-economic
changes and social justice,

125
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:01,470
or address environmental concerns.

126
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,529
Only few developments,
such as the wind energy project in Hamburg

127
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:11,240
highlight the need for sustainable development.

128
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,699
Cities today improve their waterfronts not
only to foster efficient and economic transport

129
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:22,629
of goods (in containers and in bulk on large
ships),

130
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:28,779
but also to bring people to new places,
including newly revitalized waterfronts.

131
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:33,959
Over the last decade,
growing numbers of people have vacationed

132
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:39,490
on cruise ships,
taking advantage of water transportation and

133
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,529
enjoying water as a background to their tourist
experience.

134
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:52,319
What started as a pastime for the wealthy
in the early years of the 20th century developed

135
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:58,699
in the 1980s into adventure for the middle
and working classes.

136
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,120
Cruise travel has developed into a form of
mass tourism.

137
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,410
In 2012,
US American cruise ships carried some 17 million

138
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:16,120
passengers on fully catered vacations and
tours to exotic locations.
