Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,350
In this video,
I would like to introduce you to urban resource

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,930
flows and urban metabolism.

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,939
This is the pulse of your city.

5
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,920
I would like you to close your eyes and imagine
the natural resources that power this heartbeat

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,400
of the city.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,630
You got it?

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,280
Did you imagine water,
energy,

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,930
food or the products you consume every day?

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:45,940
And every time you hear the heart of the city
beat you convert water into wastewater that

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,580
is enriched with nutrients but also bacteria.

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,280
Every time you hear the heart of the city
beat,

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,330
the energy is produced and CO2 and other off
gases are produced.

14
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,900
Every time you hear the heart of the city
beat food is consumed,

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,010
partly ends up in sewage but also becomes
food waste.

16
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,150
And every time you hear this heart of the
city beat,

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,320
the products you use are thrown away,
landfilled or incinerated.

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,470
How can this diverse and complex urban metabolism,
as it sometimes called,

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,610
be conceptualized and presented easily.

20
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,260
One way to do this is a Sankey diagram.

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,580
A Sankey diagram is nothing else then a mass
flow balance.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,540
This type of diagram has a number of key features.

23
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,090
It has a defined system boundary,
in this case your city.

24
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,260
It has input and output flows.

25
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,870
And it has stocks that accumulate in the city.

26
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,120
Stock accumulate when inputs exceed output
flows.

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,620
The other important aspect of this diagram
is that the width of the arrows represents

28
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,270
the relative weight of the flows going into
a city.

29
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,070
Therefore,
the width of an enables us to compare different

30
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,170
flows.

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:12,120
More detailed versions of Sankey Diagram enable
you to identify critical system properties,

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,659
or in other words critical metabolism properties
of your city.

33
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,670
For instance,
you can identify the processes that are of

34
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,370
key importance to target for innovation and
change.

35
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:29,959
These are the processes that link and concentrate
many different flows.

36
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,829
Or you can look at the processes that have
high output flows or system losses.

37
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:41,189
These could be the processes that are crucial
to address first.

38
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,849
But let us go back to the Sankey diagram of
the city.
