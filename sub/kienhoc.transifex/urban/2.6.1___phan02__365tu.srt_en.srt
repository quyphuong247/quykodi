We can conclude that safety in the living
environment is related to the social environment!

41
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:29,630
This brings us to the next topic,
the primary need of social interaction.

42
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,810
Cities are complex social structures.

43
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,250
In a sustainable city inhabitants have the
possibility to interact with each other in

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,720
a variation of social networks.

45
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,660
But the living environment should also offer
the opportunity to escape the ‘social cage’.

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:52,330
This so called ’control over social interaction’
is a reason for people to move to a city.

47
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,560
I will explain this with the privacy model
of Altman.

48
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,930
Your desired level of social interaction may
vary through the day and through your life,

49
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,209
as you can see here on the vertical axis.

50
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,680
The living environment should always facilitate
this!

51
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,750
If the achieved level of interaction,
here on the horizontal axis,

52
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,639
is lower than the desired level a person can
feel lonely.

53
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:29,039
When it is higher than the desired level one
experiences a feeling of crowding.

54
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,860
What we are looking for is a satisfactory
match!

55
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,340
The living environment should facilitate control
over social interaction for every individual.

56
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,469
So,
there should be quiet places,

57
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:47,719
vibrant places and variety,
though offering places that may vary throughout

58
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,930
the day.

59
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,729
As long as the city consist of a variety of
types of spaces,

60
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,809
it supports control over social interaction.

61
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:01,309
A crowded street,
such as here in Hong Kong,

62
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:04,800
may be for some a solution against loneliness.

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,120
However for others it might provide too much
interaction.

64
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,490
We called this ‘crowding’.

65
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,819
Control is a primary need.

66
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:21,599
If control is legible in the built environment,
it facilitate perceived safety and social

67
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:22,419
interaction.

68
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:26,680
It can be as simple as in this example.

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,650
What makes it however complex,
is that various actors have different opinions

70
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,800
on how to be in control.

71
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,870
Building walls and fences is not always the
best solution!

72
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,870
Formal control is needed,
for instance in more anonymous places.

73
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,680
However,
informal control,

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,139
were the inhabitants are able to decide over
their own environment,

75
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:56,169
will result in citizens taking responsibility.

76
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:02,119
In a socially sustainable living environment,
control is organised transparently,

77
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:09,659
understandable or ‘readable’ for everyone,
both the inhabitants and the visitors.

78
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:12,869
So,
what does a socially sustainable living environment
