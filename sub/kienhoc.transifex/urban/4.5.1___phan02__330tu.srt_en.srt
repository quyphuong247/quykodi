One of the places in the world were these
processes are creating a very strong subsidence

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,689
is Jakarta, in Indonesia.

36
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:02,49
The current average land subsidence rate there
is 7.5-10cm/year along the coastline.

37
00:03:02,49 --> 00:03:06,549
Future population growth in the delta and
the increasing need for drinking water are

38
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:10,739
likely to aggravate the problems in Jakarta
further.

39
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,430
But the same holds for other delta areas such
as in the polders in The Netherlands.

40
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:22,49
Where the soil surface level dropped 4 metres
in 4 centuries.

41
00:03:22,49 --> 00:03:28,579
Another example are the industrial areas around
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam located in the

42
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,219
Mekong and Dong Nai Delta.

43
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:35,299
In many of these locations groundwater extraction
needs to be stopped.

44
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:41,499
But ground water abstraction in the coastal
areas is not the only cause for shortage of

45
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:45,239
fresh water resources in coastal regions.

46
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:52,400
Also the change in recharge of groundwater
system adds to the freshwater shortage problem.

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,709
There are two major aspects to this.

48
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,150
Firstly, climate change alters rain patterns.

49
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,359
Like longer and more frequent dry periods
and more intense short rain events.

50
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:12,439
The second factor is the construction of large
dams, often managed for hydro power or local

51
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,310
water needs.

52
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,120
As a results delta areas are confronted with
lower river discharge.

53
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,560
This leads to reduced ground water recharge
and increased salt water intrusion in the estuaries.

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,700
At the same time the sea level is expected
to rise, as I have shown you before.

55
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,770
Thereby threatening the subsiding cities to
be flooded, but also pushing more salt water

56
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,729
into the rivers and groundwater.

57
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:48,440
So, in summary urbanized coastal areas and
the surrounding agricultural lands are under

58
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,560
threat from three factors that influence the
state of fresh groundwater stocks, and this

59
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,240
is world-wide.

60
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,180
Increasing groundwater extraction, reduced
rain water infiltration and sea level rise

61
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,390
driving salt water intrusion.

62
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,969
All of which put groundwater resources at
risk.

63
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:17,870
So in conclusion, delta cities have to cope
with reduced freshwater availability.

64
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,100
And do you have any ideas how to solve this
problem?
