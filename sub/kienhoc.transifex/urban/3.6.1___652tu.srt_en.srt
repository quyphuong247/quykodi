Hi there, in this video you will learn how consumer practices have developed in coevolution

1
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,640
with the provision of urban infrastructure in Europe. And how they still do. I will also

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,279
address the changes in water and energy infrastructure from the perspective of end-user practices.

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,690
If we see urban infrastructures only from an engineering&#39;s point of view, we get something

4
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,370
like this. In these pictures consumers, the users of

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,290
water are invisible. Water consumption is pictured as a house.

6
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,269
The good thing about this picture is that at least different purposes of water consumption

7
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:53,680
are shown: bathing, doing the laundry and toilet use.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,799
The same goes for energy. The secondary customer, that&#39;s the

9
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,960
householder, using electricity for diverse practices like watching TV, heating the home

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,670
by running a heat pump, lighting, doing the dishes, keeping the Christmas Turkey frozen.

11
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,210
All these practices are heavily depending on the availability of materials such as a

12
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,500
reliable and continuous supply of electricity and water. And on the devices that run on

13
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,530
them: toilets, TV sets, freezers, and showers. But these practices are also pillared by meanings

14
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,950
such as cultural beliefs and taboos, personal preferences, privacy considerations.

15
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,909
...and lastly by competences: how to use things, how to cook, how to clean yourself or your

16
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,430
house. So, let&#39;s have a look at one example, the

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,159
practice of bathing. It has changed considerably over time, and

18
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,600
so did urban infrastructures for water and energy supply.

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,030
One could say that infrastructure provision was the driver for changing bathing practices

20
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,920
from the public domain To the private bathroom

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,549
But there was also another driver of change: Our attitude towards sweat: from appreciation

22
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:13,569
(as in honest labour) Towards disgust

23
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:19,180
Norms of Cleanliness have changed considerably: in the past we did all the cleaning with one

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,590
bar of soap now we use a range of shampoos and shower

25
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,400
gels. From a bath once in the two weeks, we now

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,950
sometimes take a shower twice a day. And the bath at home has moved from the kitchen

27
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,120
to its own room. All those changes in water and energy supply

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,050
and consumption are social and technical at the same time. Technology is a driver, but

29
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,860
also cultural norms and competences of householders. They coevolve at the same time.

30
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,610
This is why we should also investigate the social cultural dynamics of water and energy

31
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:02,580
related practices alongside the sustainable development of water and energy infrastructures.

32
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,230
For instance: the smart grid This is seen as an efficient electricity distribution

33
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:16,400
system that facilitates renewable energy generation and storage. So far the smart grid descriptions

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,640
and visualisations are mostly technical of nature. But with smart grids come smart meters,

35
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,629
with close to real-time data generation about household electricity consumption and production.

36
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:33,780
And with smart grids come intermittent supply of electricity depending on the contract consumers

37
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,090
have with their suppliers. Issues of privacy protection come to the fore and the timing

38
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,030
of use of electricity is becoming negotiable. Consumers will be asked to allow their electric

39
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,390
cars to store electricity at certain prescribed moments for the sake of net-balance of the

40
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:58,050
entire system. These are big changes from a hundred years old routine of electricity

41
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:05,269
consumption. New energy practices are emerging alongside the development of smart grids.

42
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,800
Studying sustainable urban energy supply would better take these socio-technical dynamics

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,550
into account. Because if you don&#39;t: you may overlook possible

44
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:21,129
reasons for resistance towards new technologies. If you would define household energy consumption

45
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:26,000
in terms of kiloWatt Hours only, you will miss differences in practices that explain

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,479
the adoption or resistance to innovations like this smart meter. For some practices,

47
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,040
shifting timing of use would be just fine. Think of a dishwasher switching on in the

48
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,530
night instead of in the evening. But it surely matters in other practices like

49
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:50,820
cooking which is highly time-bound. I would like to challenge you to think of

50
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,360
other socio-technical changes that coevolve with social-practices!
