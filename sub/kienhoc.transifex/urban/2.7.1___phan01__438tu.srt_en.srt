Hello and welcome!

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:19,000
In this video I will use the development of
the Greater Pearl River Delta region in China,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,490
as an example to demonstrate the interaction
between policy and governance as well as urban

4
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,289
growth.

5
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:29,730
In 2015,
this region,

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:37,080
with a total population of round 60 million,
has overtaken Tokyo to become the world’s

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:45,510
largest urban area in both size and population,
according to a report from the World Bank.

8
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,649
This area is almost 40,000km2.

9
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,000
It produces 9,3% of China’s GDP.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,469
The annually GDP growth is 9,4 %.

11
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,789
The Greater Pearl River Delta Region,
including 9 large cities in mainland China

12
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:10,310
and 2 Special Administrative Regions:
Hong Kong and Macao.

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,330
Next to the Yangtze River Delta Region and
the Beijing-Tianjin-Bohai Bay Region it has

14
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:17,880
become one of China’s three main economic
hubs and reputedly a “world factory”.

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,990
The region’s industrialization has been
an impetus for its massive urbanization,

16
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:33,390
attracting millions of migrant workers to
the region for manufacturing jobs.

17
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,549
In comparison with the gradual evolving process
of polycentric urban regions in Europe the

18
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:47,100
Pearl River Delta Region grows faster in speed
and is much bigger.

19
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,369
Consequently,
the policy orientations and action perspectives

20
00:01:52,369 --> 00:02:00,000
of the Greater Pearl River Delta Region and
European regions can be expected to diverge

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,210
as well.

22
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,060
See here the Randstad Region in the Netherlands,
with an population of 7 Million and an area

23
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,560
of 6000 km2 And here in Germany the Rhine-Ruhr
Area,

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,159
with an population of 10 Million and an area
of 7000 km2.

25
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,780
Hong Kong,
Shenzhen and Guangzhou are the three dominant

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:14,040
economic players in the Greater Pearl River
Delta Region and tend to compete for a leading

27
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,140
role within the region.

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:24,139
Each city has a distinctive development path
following its own specific context and governance

29
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,769
approach.

30
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:32,350
It is interesting to ask the question how
policy and government influence the growth

31
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,660
of these cities.

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,609
Hong Kong’s history as a British colony
from the 19th century allowed it to develop

33
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:49,130
a distinct institutional and legal system
and a free market.

34
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:56,010
Hong Kong’s laissez-faire capitalism,
is often described as stateless capitalism.

35
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,760
The Hong Kong government has an explicit policy
of “positive non-intervention”:

36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,480
Don’t interfere with the market.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,660
Albeit subtle and indirect,
Hong Kong’s economic development reveals

38
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:16,650
the decisive role of the state in creating
conditions for growth and competitiveness

39
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,400
since the 1950s.

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,370
For example,
the government owns all urban land.

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,840
The land is leased in a land market entirely
controlled by government.

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,810
This land regime not only helps the government
to obtain substantial public revenue,

43
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:42,729
but also allows Hong Kong to pursue its public-transport
oriented development approach by integrating

44
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:46,380
transportation and land use planning.
