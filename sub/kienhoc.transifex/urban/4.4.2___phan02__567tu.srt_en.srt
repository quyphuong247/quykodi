00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,900

And usually you do nothing with it, you just
throw it away.

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,359
What you nevertheless could do is, use that
hot water for something else.

50
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,870
For example for pouring a nice cup of tea.

51
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,299
But, this is a bit far-fetched and not essentially
that tasty.

52
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,079
Nevertheless it shows that we have got waste
streams in household that we can use for something

53
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,239
else.

54
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,859
Were we can apply the principle of reusing
waste streams.

55
00:03:54,859 --> 00:04:00,260
So you got hot water coming from your shower
or from your sink you can use them to preheat

56
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,219
the incoming cold water from your water supply
line before it actually enters the heating kettle.

57
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:10,639
By that, the temperature is already increased
before entering it and you need less heating energy.

58
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:15,529
Furthermore what you can think of is reusing
rejected heat from cooling, such as an ice

59
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:17,919
ring to warm a swimming pool.

60
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,090
Sounds a bit strange reject heat from cooling,
doesnâ€™t it?

61
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,919
But have you ever touched the rear of your
fridge at home?

62
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,030
It is quite hot there, and you can use that
heat for something else.

63
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,770
So for example heating your bathroom.

64
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,200
Now, demand minimization and cascading will
get you only that far.

65
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,750
You will eventually end up with a minimized
energy demand, but you still have to cover

66
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,090
that part.

67
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,060
And this is where multisourcing enters the
game and multisourcing here means, like I

68
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,490
already said before the use of renewable and
sustainable energy sources.

69
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,810
Most of you will have heard about the emerging
and sometimes already applied technologies

70
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,560
in this field.

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,630
So for instance the use of photovoltaic panels,
which convert sunlight into electricity.

72
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,890
You can find them on small scale application
like this calculators or street lights.

73
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,490
You could also think of installing them on
your roof, so you could provide electricity

74
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,250
for your buildings or even think on larger
scale, you can have whole fields of them.

75
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,980
If you want to increase the scale even further,
you cannot use PV anymore.

76
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,930
But you normally would switch to something
what is called a solar tower or a solar troughs,

77
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,290
where you focus the sunlight in one spot,
by that you create high temperatures.

78
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:39,000
These high temperatures are then used to provide
steam and the steam is used in a steamturbine

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,480
to produce electricity What you also can do
is, you can use wind turbines.

80
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,220
This might be a small one, and it also does
not produce electricity.

81
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,830
But nevertheless wind can play a tremendous
role in future in our energy supply.

82
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,800
Where you would install them is normally in
locations where you got a high wind speeds

83
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,870
and relatively high wind speeds are normally
constant.

84
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,680
So you got a high, constant energy output.

85
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,900
These locations can be either onshore or offshore
and you can use just one of them or you can

86
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,220
use whole parks of them.

87
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:21,370
There are many researchers, technologies and
inventors busy with new technologies and ways

88
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,830
to provide sustainable energy for everyone.

89
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,680
So for instance in Wageningen researchers
work on ways to use plants to produce electricity

90
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,830
in a concept that is called Plant-E While
this might be currently only be one small

91
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,840
plant, there are plans to use whole fields
of this, to produce electricity in future.

92
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,930
And there are many other ideas out there,
that might make a break through So, are you

93
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,110
the one who that will bring us the light?
