Welcome!

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,550
In this video you will learn how port cities
have adapted over centuries to changing political

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,590
and economic situations,
combining technical innovation with specific

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,040
governance systems and urban cultures,
creating shapes and structures that can facilitate

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,090
future urban adaptations.

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,460
We will focus first on the time period until
the 1960s,

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:44,510
thus before containerization and automation,
and before port and city moved apart.

8
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,829
The adaptation of ports,
waterfronts and coastlines,

9
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:54,140
but also of port cities and their hinterlands
to future challenges will require ingenuity

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,019
and an integrated perspective on water as
a shared resource.

11
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:06,590
As contemporary challenges of climate change,
migration and particularly global water rise

12
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,890
challenge our coastlines,
the long history of port cities,

13
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,530
their working ports and waterfronts,
which are at the forefront of these challenges,

14
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:26,200
may provide us with insights into urban resilience
Port cities have a long history of rapid transformation

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,000
and recovery and this video explores select
examples.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,840
Cities have come into existence for a multitude
of reasons over thousands of years,

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,950
as capitals,
as economic or religious centers,

18
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,360
as university hubs,
as infrastructure nodes,

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,520
or … as port cities.

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,000
Many of these reasons were part of the growth
of Istanbul for example.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,640
The city,
formerly called Constantinople,

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,470
is shown here in Byzantine times.

23
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,370
Easy access to navigable water and the existence
of natural harbors,

24
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,159
has given rise to numerous cities on rivers
and seas around the world.

25
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,819
London,
for example,

26
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:13,870
has been a port city since the 1st century.

27
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,959
The city became the heart of an empire that
“ruled the waves” for some five hundred

28
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,709
years,
with ships crowding the river Thames.

29
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,099
Here is how the city looked at the beginning
of this development,

30
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,590
around 1560.

31
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,680
Water transportation has long facilitated
the transport of goods and people around the

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,069
world.

33
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,989
This map,
painted on a wall of a trading house in Tallinn

34
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,120
(Estonia),
shows the trading networks around the Baltic

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,430
Sea that have also left their imprint on the
architecture of buildings.

36
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,969
Here an example also from Tallinn,
that combined trading,

37
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:56,629
storing and living.

38
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:01,579
These buildings resembled each other in cities
around the Baltic and North Sea,

39
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:05,430
as you can see here in the examples of Hamburg
and Lübeck in,

40
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,249
Germany,
or in Amsterdam,

41
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:10,260
The Netherlands.

42
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,069
Amsterdam has a long history as a trading
city,

43
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,639
going back to the 13th century.

44
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,349
This was particularly notable in the 17th
century,

45
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:23,290
when the city was a global trade centre.

46
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,439
Other trade networks had their centres too.

47
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,730
Venice,
for examples controlled trade with Asia and

48
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:36,279
connected to Tang Chang’an,
via the Silk Road Located at the intersection
