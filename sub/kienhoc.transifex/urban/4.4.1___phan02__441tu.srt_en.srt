this is something that actually could happen
if they continue their your current economic

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,970
growth.

42
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,030
You can directly see what additional negative
impact that possible development might have

43
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,500
on our climate and environment.

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,390
So why are then we still so much rely on fossil
fuels?

45
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,329
There is one main argument that makes fossil
fuels really attractive in comparison to other

46
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,349
energy sources.

47
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,799
And that is its energy density.

48
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:32,569
So for instance one kilogram of gasoline has
an energy density of about 12-15 kWh/kg, while

49
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,049
biomass only has an energy density of 1.5-3
kWh/kg.

50
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,239
So 5 times more in here than in here.

51
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,400
How much energy actually is now one Kilo Watt
hour?

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,329
Well a Kilo Watt Hour is about the amount
of energy you need to heat up 1000 kg of water

53
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,849
by a bit less than 1 degree centigrade.

54
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,790
So with this jerry you can actually heat up
about 4000L of water for one degree while

55
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,319
this piece of wood only would be enough for
1000L.

56
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,900
There are two more reasons why fossil fuels
can be attractive: well the combustion technologies

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,680
like we use in power plants are really far
developed and readily available and on the

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,410
other hand side fossil fuels are still rather
comparably cheap in comparison to the alternatives

59
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,720
and they are still available in abundance.

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,070
So different countries have a different energy
demand depending on life style, on living

61
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,720
standards and degree of industrialization.

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,550
So you have countries like the US or the United
Arab Emirates with an energy demand of more

63
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:41,850
than 18000 kWh per person per year while other
less developed countries like Ghana and Yemen

64
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,840
use less than one tenth of that amount.

65
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,530
So, for what do you actually use energy at
home?

66
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,130
Let’s take a look at an average household
in the US.

67
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,419
Here more than 50 % of the total energy demand
is related to thermal comfort.

68
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,919
That means heating of buildings, cooling of
buildings and the provision of warm water.

69
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,930
The remaining fraction is used for electronic
devices, lighting and appliances like vacuum

70
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,520
cleaners.

71
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,770
One important thing to realize is that the
fraction of the energy demand related to thermal

72
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,819
comfort is highly depending on the climate
and where you are on the globe.

73
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:22,069
So let’s say in colder climates like in
Norway you could expect an increase in heating

74
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:27,289
demand while you need less energy for cooling,
while for subtropical countries and tropical

75
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:32,569
countries like India or Singapore cooling
becomes the dominant fraction of your energy

76
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,780
demand.

77
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,720
Do you know how much energy you use in your
household and do you know how much CO2 you emit by that?
