Hello and welcome!
Today you will learn why we need to include

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,670
a social sustainable development if we want
to make liveable cities.

3
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:28,700
The first steps towards a sustainable development
was the awareness of our relation with nature.

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,090
Henry Thoreau was one of the first to sketch
a romantic view on this relation between man

5
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:44,520
and nature in his book “Walden – or life
in the woods” This was 1854.

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,520
A century followed were nature preservation
became more and more important.

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,860
Followed from the 60th of the last century
by the environmental movement against pollution,

8
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:03,660
the decreasing of biodiversity and the use
of ending recourses.

9
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,340
The club of Rome put out the following warning
in 1972:

10
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,000
“We broke into Nature's safe deposit box
of fossil carbon,

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,869
turning it into a wider range of fuels,
and potentially destabilizing the global climate

12
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:26,270
in the process.” The awareness of some was
vital,

13
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,539
jet it didn’t change the world for the better.

14
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,310
To do this,
a new perspective was needed:

15
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,420
‘Social sustainability or ‘People’.

16
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:41,020
We had to wait until 1992 at the Rio Earth
Summit.

17
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,170
The central conclusion of this summit was
that:

18
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,240
Human beings are at the centre of concerns
for sustainable development.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,329
They are entitled to a healthy and productive
life in harmony with nature.

20
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:04,529
So the ecological awareness first shifted
towards an environmental awareness and now

21
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:06,590
people were included.

22
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,160
The involvement of the laymen,
the wellbeing of the end-users became central

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,720
themes.

24
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,190
People were part of the problem,
but they are also the reason to find solutions

25
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,140
and they ARE the solutions.

26
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:29,300
Let’s watch twelve years old Severn Cullis
Suzuki at the conference  in 1992.

27
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,250
If we start with the wellbeing of people,
we take the perspective of the World Health

28
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,890
Organisation.

29
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:27,030
In a liveable city we fulfilling basic needs
of all and emphasizing the needs of the vulnerable

30
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,940
groups.

31
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,380
Basic needs are health and safety,
being free from war and hunger.

32
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,030
Linked topic is happiness.

33
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,310
Emphasizing the needs of vulnerable groups
is paying attention to children,

34
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,940
elderly,
the urban poor,

35
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,780
disabled,
etc.

36
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,670
A child friendly city is friendly for all.

37
00:03:51,670 --> 00:04:00,860
A city were wayfinding is based on the capacity
of old people is more accessible for all.

38
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,930
Environmental awareness of citizen is one
step,

39
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,960
participation and co-shaping the sustainable
city is another step.

40
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,280
Of course also the sustainability awareness
and participation of other actors are vital

41
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,180
here,
like governance,

42
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:25,509
designers and all actors involved in shaping
and maintaining the city.

43
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:32,180
The definition of Brundtland speaks of the
needs of future generations.

44
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,030
This includes two questions:
First:

45
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,820
To what extent are people willing to adjust
their behaviour to what is best for people

46
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,720
over 20 to 50 years?

47
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,350
Most people cannot oversee the impact of their
behaviour of today on their wellbeing tomorrow.

48
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,170
During the first traffic-jam in the Netherlands
in 1955,

49
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,860
people were filled with joy;
overseeing so much luxury.

50
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,139
More cars are only better!

51
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:07,000
Secondly;
What are the needs of a next generation?

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,430
This is why we emphasis basic needs;
the common ground between this and next generations,
