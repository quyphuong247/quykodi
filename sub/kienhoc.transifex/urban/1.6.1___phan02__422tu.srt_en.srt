53

and between people here and people elsewhere.

54
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,990
… So liveability is not about owning a car,
but then what?

55
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,810
To answer this question we combine two perspectives
on people-environment interaction.

56
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:37,850
The first starts from the individual:
What is his or her perception on the environment?

57
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,590
Be aware:
In this case the environment consists of the

58
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:49,330
city and his artefacts,
the natural environment (including our climate)

59
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,169
and the social environment.

60
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,040
The last one is the most important for a city
dweller.

61
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,230
This so called perceived liveability is very
determined by personal factors;

62
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,200
age,
capacities,

63
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,090
salary,
self esteem,

64
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,800
etc.

65
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,610
It is vital to research the perceived liveability,
but it gives very limited handles to create

66
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,040
a smart city.

67
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,590
In the second perspective we start with the
environment,

68
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,070
in our case:
the city.

69
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,169
So what may facilitate the well being of the
individual?

70
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,940
We call this the presumed liveability.

71
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,419
We presume people like to go were other people
are.

72
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,020
We know people appreciate green and water
in the living environment.

73
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,500
And we know there are a many environmental
factors that can lead to stress.

74
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,270
Stress may come from other people and from
the physical environment,

75
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,010
like from pollution,
noise,

76
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,460
but also from a poorly designed urban fabric.

77
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:01,550
If we look at liveability from a sustainable
development perspective we focus on the match

78
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,580
between a person and his or her environment….

79
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,510
an ecological approach.

80
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:12,740
We look what the optimal conditions are for
the species - called human - to survive.

81
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,590
Let us now look at the urban environment.

82
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,760
A sustainable urban environment facilitates
the following primary needs for ALL individuals,

83
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,620
for this and for coming generations:
Health,

84
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,639
safety,
Control over one’s own life,

85
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,100
a social environment ,
so called quality of interaction and contract

86
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,060
with the natural environment.

87
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,570
These needs in the urban environment are different
from individual needs,

88
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:56,860
like for example material prosperity,
which vary per personal,

89
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,100
and country.

90
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,490
and depend on the world economy.

91
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,090
To wrap up:
A city that is loved by its inhabitants is

92
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,210
a city that facilitates the needs of her inhabitants.

93
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,620
Two sides of the same coin!

94
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,060
The urban environment contributes to the wellbeing
of people and the very same people will maintain

95
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,910
the city.

96
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,440
So if you out there:
Be aware to what extent your urban environment

97
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,250
facilitate the needs for ALL.

98
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,740
Is it safe?

99
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,449
Is it healthy?

100
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,959
Do you have any control over it?

101
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,659
Can you interact with others?

102
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,599
And is the natural environment present?

103
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,380
Your awareness of these needs contributes
to a sustainable and liveable city !
