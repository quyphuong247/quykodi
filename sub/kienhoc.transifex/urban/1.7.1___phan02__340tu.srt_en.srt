Thematically,
such as the water system,

45
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,849
energy system,
transport system,

46
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:10,389
food system,
Geographically,

47
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,909
such as the building,
neighbourhood,

48
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:17,409
city and region,
Economically,

49
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:22,739
such as different value chains or regional
economic clusters,

50
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,629
And institutionally,
identifying different administrative levels

51
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:33,969
such as local,
regional and national government.

52
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:38,169
Many more distinctions or subsystems can be
made.

53
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,849
Whatever distinction you use,
it is important is to realise that the distinctions,

54
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,489
or subsystems identified,
always are related to other subsystems.

55
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,219
Be aware of these relationships when developing
and implementing sustainable urban solutions:

56
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:59,489
Avoid shifting problems to other subsystems.

57
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,589
Identify and make use of opportunities for
synergetic solutions:

58
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:09,109
these are solutions that solve two or more
problems at the same time.

59
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,169
Within this complex settings,
there are three important groups of actors

60
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:19,069
that I would like to introduce to you:
government,

61
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:22,109
market and society.

62
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:29,550
Or:
Public actors Privat actors and societal actors

63
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,310
With their policies and actions,
the actors within these groups all contribute

64
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,870
to the governance of sustainability.

65
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,310
They have to coordinate their actions to avoid
shifting problems to other people,

66
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,740
to other places,
and to next generations,

67
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:51,389
and to identify and make use of synergies,
solutions that solve more than one problem.

68
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:58,490
Actors from these three groups have different
policy instruments to contribute to sustainability.

69
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:07,740
Traditional government instruments are laws
and regulation,

70
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,479
taxes and information and communication.

71
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,449
Some of these instruments are more binding
than others.

72
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,490
Examples are systems of labelling and certification,
benchmarking,

73
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,250
and sustainability reporting.

74
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,210
Typical market instruments are instruments
that acknowledge the competitive character

75
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,000
of the market.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,169
Typical instruments of societal action are
organised advocative action,

77
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:42,639
such as non-governmental organisations,
interest groups,

78
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,810
campaigns and protests.

79
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,310
But also neighbourhood networks,
joint procurement initiatives,

80
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,539
and cooperatives are examples of societal
action.

81
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,139
In recent years,
an increased activity of social movements

82
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:04,539
and bottom-up citizen initiatives,
societal action has become an important driver

83
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:07,180
for sustainability.

84
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,310
‘Governance’ thus refers to the policies
and actions of government,

85
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:20,060
market and society that together aim to influence
societal developments.

86
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,349
Governance involves a process of interaction,
coordination and collaboration between diverse
