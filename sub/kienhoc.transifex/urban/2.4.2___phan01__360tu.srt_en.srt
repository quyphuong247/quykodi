Hello,
In this video on urban growth and transport

2
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:21,210
I want to make clear firstly that land use
and transport mutually influence each other.

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,449
Thus:
Land use influence travel behavior,

4
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:29,839
and the transport system influences the way
cities grow.

5
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:36,390
And I want to make clear an important tension:
accessibility versus livability.

6
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,070
To improve accessibility cities often want
more space for transport,

7
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,300
but to improve livability and thus to make
cities attractive the space for transport

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,780
needs to be reduced.

9
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,050
I will firstly explain why transport and land
use influence each other.

10
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,690
Land-use influences travel behavior.

11
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,600
For example:
In low-density residential areas,

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,190
such as in Los Angeles,
it is impossible to provide an adequate public

13
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,420
transport system.

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,190
This applies certainly to a metro system,
which needs high densities around stations,

15
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,280
but also to a bus based public transport system.

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,390
So,
building in low densities will stimulate people

17
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,070
to drive by car.

18
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,460
Mixing houses,
a shops,

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:34,750
schools and services result in short travel
distances and therefore encourages walking

20
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,740
and cycling.

21
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,610
And building offices and dwellings in high
densities around railway stations stimulates

22
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,479
people to travel by metro or train.

23
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,659
And changes in travel behavior make cities
change their transport system.

24
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,450
Next:
The transport system impacts land use.

25
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,979
For example,
building a new metro line and stations makes

26
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:06,869
the areas around these stations attractive
for high-density residential areas,

27
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,909
offices,
shops etc.

28
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,650
A good example is Paris.

29
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,969
Another reason why the transport system influences
land use,

30
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:22,420
and thus urban growth,
is that people on average have quite stable

31
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,569
travel time budgets:
worldwide over a large area,

32
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:27,340
e.g.

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,459
a country,
people travel about 60-75 minutes per person

34
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,069
per day worldwide.

35
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,709
This is called the theory of constant travel
time budgets.

36
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:44,889
If we build faster transport systems,
people will travel further,

37
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:47,349
encouraging urban sprawl.

38
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:54,749
On the other hand more infrastructure for
walking and cycling fits compact cities.

39
00:02:54,749 --> 00:03:00,540
Next I explain the tension between accessibility
and livability.

40
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,290
Accessibility explains which destinations
(like work places,

41
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:11,209
shops and other people) people can reach how
easily and with which modes.

42
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:16,109
A better transport and land use system improves
accessibility.

43
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:20,540
But more space for motorized infrastructure
is not good for livability.
