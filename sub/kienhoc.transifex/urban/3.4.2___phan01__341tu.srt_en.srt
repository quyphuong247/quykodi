Hello, in this video on socio-economic change and
urban transport I will discuss only one topic:

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,250
CHANGES!

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,800
Changes between dominant transport modes,
and changes within the current transport system.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,929
This still sounds a bit vague,
but I will explain.

5
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:37,700
The world’s population is increasing,
and a larger share lives in cities.

6
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,820
An important more general socio-economic change
is that in many cities people are getting

7
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,320
richer.

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,670
Rich people travel more kilometers and more
often they use fast modes:

9
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,300
they fly more,
and have more cars and less fuel efficient

10
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,050
cars.

11
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:06,220
If the world’s population is getting richer,
we can expect an increase in motorized travel,

12
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,110
unless we implement policies.

13
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,100
I next distinguish changes between dominant
travel modes,

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,780
and within modes.

15
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,920
I start with changes between dominant modes.

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,920
With ‘changes between dominant modes’
I refer to new travel modes becoming dominant..

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,250
History has shown that it on average takes
about 55 years for a new mode to become the

18
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,470
dominant mode.

19
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,390
Note that the car,
the dominant mode nowadays,

20
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,299
was already introduced on the market over
100 years ago.

21
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,960
The last ‘new’ mode is the aircraft,
which has been gaining popularity for over

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,409
60 years now.

23
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:03,479
So if people suggest that in a few decades
the transport system will differ dramatically

24
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,640
from the current system,
because new modes become dominant,

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,109
we have to be careful – I am not sure this
is realistic.

26
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:17,870
Maybe information and communication technologies,
ICT,

27
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,700
might become a new ‘mode’ – But this
is quite speculative because so far the net

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,549
effect of ICT on travel has been around zero,
if not:

29
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,040
a small increase in travel.

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,989
To check the realism of visions for the future,
a general rule of thumb is that if you want

31
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:45,620
to explore the future for a certain period,
it is good to look back the same number of

32
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,919
years,
to see how much change one can expect in a

33
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,919
certain period.

34
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:59,279
I now discuss changes within the current car
dominated transport system.

35
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,129
I refer to changes between modes we already
have available,
