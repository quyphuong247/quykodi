The compact and highly efficient urban development
approach allows 90% of all passengers to travel

46
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,160
by public transportation.

47
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:05,570
About 42 % of the territory’s households,
43% of the employment population and 75% of

48
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:14,530
the commercial and office floor areas are
located within a radius of 500 metres of railway

49
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,410
stations.

50
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:22,009
Another result of this approach is a high
quality living environment:

51
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:29,230
that three-quarters of Hong Kong’s total
1108 square kilometers of land is countryside

52
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:38,300
and 40 % of total land area is protected for
conservation and recreation.

53
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,690
Until the late 1970s,
manufacturing flourished in Hong Kong and

54
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,210
it became a major entrepôt in Pacific Asia.

55
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:57,080
China’s post-1978 reform policies allowed
Hong Kong firms to relocate across the border

56
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,860
to benefit from lower labor costs,
resulting in the so-called hollowing out of

57
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,220
Hong Kong as a manufacturing center.

58
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,210
Hong Kong took advantages from its flexible
financial regulations,

59
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,540
its extraordinary communication and business
infrastructure and its networks of connections

60
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,820
to develop itself as international financial
center.

61
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:29,510
Hong Kong has played an important role in
the history of China and the Chinese miracle

62
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,980
as most investment in China circulates through
Hong Kong.

63
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:41,550
Hong Kong has become indispensable to China’s
incorporation into the global economy.

64
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,930
In contrast,
both Shenzhen and Guangzhou have experienced

65
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,990
rapid economic growth,
industrialization and urban expansion as a

66
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,270
result of strong state intervention.

67
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:02,860
Both cities tried to take advantages from
their adjacent location to Hong Kong and attract

68
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:11,680
investment and industries with a Special Economic
Zone Policy designed by the central government.

69
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:19,420
Shenzhen is a representative example in this
Chinese polycentric urban region that grows

70
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,590
rapidly.

71
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,990
Shenzhen has arisen from a fishing village
with rice fields,

72
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,610
to become the testing ground for importing
foreign capital,

73
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,240
technology,
management,

74
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,960
knowledge and talents.

75
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,560
The national government has actively supported
Shenzhen in fulfilling this privileged role.

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,050
In 1980,
Deng Xiaoping proclaimed Shenzhen as a national

77
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,520
Special Economic Zone.

78
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,810
In the earlier years Shenzhen focused on building
export oriented economy and became the manufacturing

79
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,540
centre in China.

80
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:07,360
With around 3000 inhabitants in 1950,
its official population was 12 million in

81
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,520
2005,
and is expect to reach 15 million by 2030.

82
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:23,240
Since 1980 Shenzhen’s urbanization rate
increased from 28% to 85%,

83
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,490
making it one of the most densely urbanized
cities in China .

84
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:35,600
Shenzhen’s GDP grew at annually 27% between
1980 and 2006.

85
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,700
It was also the place where the first overseas
bank established its presence,

86
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:51,610
the first post-1949 stock market,
and hosted the headquarters of numerous high-tech

87
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,550
companies.

88
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,840
Due to rising land and production costs and
regional competition,
