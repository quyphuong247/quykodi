Hi there, thanks for watching today.

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,270
In this video you will learn about the governance
challenge of climate migration in urban deltas.

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,540
Climate migration refers to the migration
of people affected by climate change impacts,

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,489
such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events,
drought or water scarcity.

5
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:33,920
These impacts can severely damage villages
or cities, and may force people to migrate.

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,079
This is a governance challenge that is still
lacking effective responses however.

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,780
There have been many warnings about climate
migration.

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,399
It is feared that climate change will cause
mass migration flows across continents.

9
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,410
But thus far there is no solid evidence for
such extreme warnings to be correct.

10
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,410
For examples, estimates about the number of
climate migrants have been criticized for

11
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,379
being mere “guess work”.

12
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,789
They tend to simplify reality.

13
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,920
They for instance ignore adaptation strategies
taken to prevent migration.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,280
They ignore that people may not move but actually
choose to stay behind or have no resources

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,050
to move.

16
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,810
There is also no evidence for mass climate
migration flows across continents.

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,000
Instead, most climate migrants remain within
their home country.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,500
And also it’s rare that climate change acts
as the sole and primary driver of migration.

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,299
Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that climate
change functions as an additional push factor

20
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,829
of migration.

21
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:37,509
And the climate change impacts on communities
will increase as climate warming becomes more severe.

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,060
So it is an issue that we need to take seriously.

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,740
Cities are a primary destination for climate
migrants.

24
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,649
Migrants from vulnerable rural areas move
to urban centres as cities offer opportunities

25
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:52,520
for an alternative livelihood.

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,700
Climate migration therefore adds to the complexity
of current processes of urbanisation.

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,850
But climate change will also affect cities,
so people are not necessarily safe there either,

28
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,560
ones they migrate to cities.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,360
Cities are often strategically located close
to the sea or river deltas.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,580
So this makes cities vulnerable to sea-level
rise and extreme weather events.

31
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,690
Cities from both the Global North and the
Global South are at risk, including cities

32
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,810
like Dhaka, Mumbai, New York, New Orleans,
Amsterdam and many more.

33
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,640
Urban dwellers may respond in various ways
to climate impacts.

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,900
One is rapid outward migration and the other
scenarios, that people become trapped in the

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,030
city and have no means to move away in time.

36
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,830
The poor and marginalized groups are at higher
risk to stay behind – as they have less

37
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,590
resources and powerful social networks to
rely on.

38
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,720
These marginalized groups will largely be
from informal settlements like slums and also
