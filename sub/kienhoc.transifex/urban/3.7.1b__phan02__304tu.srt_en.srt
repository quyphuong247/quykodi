The European Union is not even the largest
of all stakeholders involved.

43
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,540
The EU has to abide to international treaties
and supranational institutions like the United

44
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,90
Nations,
the International Monetary Fund and the World

45
00:03:42,90 --> 00:03:44,220
Bank.

46
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,940
This has consequences on energy management
and caps on carbon emissions,

47
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,448
for example.

48
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:58,70
This was an example of governance of a TERRITORY,
but let’s look at the governance of a SECTOR:

49
00:03:58,70 --> 00:04:02,388
in this case HOUSING.

50
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:05,750
In Western Europe,
national governments have traditionally had

51
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,540
a big say in how housing is delivered to citizens.

52
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,880
But this is changing quickly.

53
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,279
The Netherlands for example,
has sophisticated arrangements in which the

54
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:22,698
national government collaborates across sectors,
levels and many actors in order to deliver

55
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,310
high quality housing.

56
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,950
This involves collaborating with many levels
and sectors of government,

57
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,500
but also with developers,
builders service providers,

58
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,600
citizens (the users),
NGOs,

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,590
designers and others involved in the complex
process of delivering housing.

60
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,349
Social housing for example,
is coordinated by large and powerful NGOs

61
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:55,850
called “housing corporations” that have
the delivery of affordable high quality housing

62
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,680
as their core mission.

63
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,720
In short:
as Eberlein and Kerwer point out,

64
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,790
multilevel governance involves a large number
of decision-making arenas,

65
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:16,550
differentiated along both functional and territorial
lines and interlinked in a non-hierarchical

66
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,760
way.

67
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,110
But there is another dimension to governance.

68
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,920
Governance is not only multi-leveled.

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,750
It is also networked.

70
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,640
Policy-making and implementation is ‘shared’
by:

71
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,560
politicians,
technocrats,

72
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,510
experts,
dedicated agencies,

73
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,240
independent authorities,
semiprivate organisations private companies,

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,490
the public,
a large number of NGOs,

75
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,220
pressure groups,
interest groups,

76
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,60
etc.

77
00:05:47,60 --> 00:05:51,600
They constitute NETWORKS of decision-making
across levels,

78
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,860
territories and mandates.

79
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,780
This means that metropolitan innovators must
adopt a new attitude towards problem identifying

80
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,159
and problem solving;
They must find new forms of steering complex

81
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,580
governance networks that are more democratic,
inclusive and flexible.

82
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,669
The key words are Deliberation,
Bargaining and Compromise-seeking.
