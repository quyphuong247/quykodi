of waste resources is in close proximity.

38
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,870
But,
it is not all that positive.

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,940
Cities cause also more natural resource use
for instance by trapping heat and being hotter

40
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,620
than the surrounding landscape,
which causes more energy use for instance

41
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,870
for cooling.

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,680
Or large cities requires large transport distances
for food or other products.

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,620
Yet,
some studies also show that a more rural or

44
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,190
sub-urban live style can improve the self-sufficiency
and self-reliance.

45
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,819
Free standing single family homes have for
instance a much higher area of roof space

46
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:27,230
for PV generation per inhabitant than large
high rises.

47
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:33,060
This property can help make them nearly energy
neutral as here in Freiburg,

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,860
Germany.

49
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:39,760
The relationship between roof and density
is shown in this figure.

50
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,379
It shows that higher density living uses less
energy for transport and energy,

51
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:51,580
but that the production of solar energy is
lower.

52
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,670
Furthermore,
historically human waste has been transported

53
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,819
away from the cities to the agricultural areas.

54
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:05,709
As a result the treatment and direct reuse
of nutrients and water contained in faeces

55
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,959
is currently,
if at all,

56
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,180
much more frequently practiced in more rural
settings were points of supply and demand

57
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,629
are close together.

58
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,789
In this context,
it is of course also clear that single homes

59
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:22,460
with gardens have much more opportunities
to supply a larger share of their food from

60
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,129
their own ground.

61
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:28,900
Making urban dwellers more reliant and therefore
vulnerable to food supply shortage.

62
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,719
So,
while our world is getting more and more urban,

63
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,949
our resource consumption efficiency seems
to improve.

64
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,490
The self-sufficiency of individual or families
however seems to be compromised.

65
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,289
One could even say that cities can be more
vulnerable to break downs in their services

66
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,960
and supply chains.

67
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,580
So the question of current concern is how
should cities grow to make them more self-sufficient?

68
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,599
Or will we need to think about self-sufficient
networks of clusters within cities,

69
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,009
cities and hinterlands or network of cities?

70
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,360
The answer is still out there,
but you can be part of the urban self-sufficient

71
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,780
network!
