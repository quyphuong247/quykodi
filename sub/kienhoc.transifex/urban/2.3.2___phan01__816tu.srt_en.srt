Hello and Welcome!

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,300
In this video you will learn about density
and urban form.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,460
Lets start with a concept of population density

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,280
What is it? You could
say it is simply a measure of how many people

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,840
share a unit of space. Or in other words,
it is the ration of people to land area. Land

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,250
area can be measured as ha, acres, square
kilometres or square miles. Let us look at

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,610
the density of some cities...maybe one of
these cities is yours.

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,380
This is Houston – Texas! This is generally
considered a city with a low population density

9
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,960
of about 250 people/ km2. What can be observed
here is a high rise central business district

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,809
and around it quite a spread out city with
low rise buildings, loads of roads and open space.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,079
Let us look at another example, Perth - Australia.

12
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,560
It does share some of key features with Houston.
It has only a slightly higher density and

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,360
there is again a high rise central business
district, there is open green space and vacant lots.

14
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,180
Then quite a different type of city, Stockholm - Sweden - one of the old

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,760
European cities. Here we do not
see many roads, the roads seem to be integrated

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,950
into the urban tissue. There are some smaller
parks around it and open water. Generally

17
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,330
the buildings are not very high 4 to 6 stories
high. But then throughout the city. Here we

18
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,909
have a higher population density of about
3500 people per square kilometre.

19
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:46,049
Here, yet again a very different type of city.
Hong Kong! With a population density of 6500

20
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,250
people per square kilometre. Imagine you stand
in between these high rise buildings and looking

21
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,850
through these street canyons. This is how
you achieve really high densities.

22
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,100
Yet, again another example with even higher
densities. The old historical centre of Tokyo

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,909
with more than 14000 people per square kilometre.
You see a similar pattern here, quite a compact

24
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:13,150
urban fabric, high rises and little green
or open space. One of the conclusion from

25
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,480
these examples is that to achieve high densities
you need high rise buildings and a compact

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,109
urban fabric. Or in other words a urban fabric
with little open un-build space.

27
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:30,370
But there is a problem with these absolute
statements about densities. You can call this a boundary

28
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,489
problem. It is a question about where does a city start and where
does it end? This answer to this question

29
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,239
will affect the value of density you arrive
at. Because it determines the value of the

30
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,900
denominators calculating the ratio of population
to land area. Let us look at this problem

31
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,709
using the example of Tokyo.
Tokyo is the largest Metropolitan area in

32
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:58,709
the world with more than 40 million people.
And, depending on which document you consult

33
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:05,859
the area of Tokyo can be up to 36000km2. Or
larger than Belgium. The population density

34
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:12,239
meanwhile does vary between about 1200 to
more than 14000 people/km2. But that really

35
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,060
depends on what you define as a city.

36
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:22,889
For example the historical center of Tokyo, until 1943 this
was defined as the city of Tokyo. In this

37
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:28,920
highly populated centre we have this high
population density of more than 14000 people per square kilometer

38
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,359
that I mentioned.
But after 1943 the historic centre became

39
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:41,560
part of the wider Tokyo metropolis. In this
most commonly used reference area for Tokyo,

40
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,799
density already drops to about 2600 people
per square kilometre. Why is that? One reason

41
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,229
for this is that, this area incorporates more
sparsely settled rural districts. But also

42
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:58,959
more parks, infrastructure such as roads and
other open spaces are added as you move away

43
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,500
from the city centre.
And then if you go even bigger to the National

44
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,209
Capital Region that is home to 40 million
people. Then the density drops further to

45
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:16,650
about 1200 people per square kilometre. The
reasons for this are the same as before. As

46
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,040
the definition of the city expands, more and
more small villages with low population densities

47
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,300
or even mountain areas are included, further
reducing the population density.

48
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,560
The message is - every time you hear a population
density ask yourself where has it been measured

49
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,599
and what is the reference area used.
But there is another problem...the different

50
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:44,889
population densities are difficult to spot.
Look at the next slide...

51
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:50,820
What do you think which of these two urban areas in the Netherlands has the higher population density?

52
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:57,340
Bijlmer on the left or Betondorp on the
right? Easy right? ......

53
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:03,150
Well they both have the same population density! But they look very different, don't they?

54
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,590
So, population density does not reveal anything
about the spatial patterns of a city. In other

55
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,370
words it does not inform about the urban form,
which is defined as: “the spatial patterns

56
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,659
of the permanent physical objects in a city”
...so the buildings and the infrastructure.
