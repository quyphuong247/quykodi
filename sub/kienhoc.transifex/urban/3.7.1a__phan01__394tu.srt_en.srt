Hello everybody!

2
00:00:12,59 --> 00:00:15,928
In this video you will learn about governance
and social-economic change.

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:23,169
We will explore why metropolitan innovators
need to understand complex systems of governance.

4
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:27,859
I will remind you what Governance is … and
I will highlight the importance of governance

5
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:32,629
for the adequacy of solutions,
and the sustainability and the feasibility

6
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:36,730
of projects in metropolitan solutions.

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,169
I will also highlight that governance is intimately
related to concepts of collaboration,

8
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,100
participation and democracy building.

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,250
In doing so,
I expect to highlight the connection between

10
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,589
governance and social,
economic and environmental sustainability

11
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:56,390
and spatial justice.

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,500
But what is governance exactly?

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,110
I define Governance as the architecture of
interactions between three large sectors of

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,780
society:
The private sector and the public sector the

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,450
public sector and civil society and the civil
society and the private sector.

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,170
In liberal democracies,
these large sectors are in positive tension.

17
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,909
By positive tensions I mean that every large
sector of society (governments,

18
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,840
businesses and citizens organized) keep the
others sectors in check.

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,729
Through various mechanisms of control,
by formulating demands and by supporting or

20
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,79
opposing ideas and initiatives.

21
00:01:40,79 --> 00:01:43,240
In this way,
they establish systems of checks and balances

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,89
and condition the actions of each other.

23
00:01:46,90 --> 00:01:53,520
A free press is important to ensure that actors
have access to information and can therefore

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,200
establish positions.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,159
Ideas like “open government” in which
the actions and the budgets of governments

26
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,880
are easily found online may help citizens,
businesses and governments themselves get

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,500
better informed about public initiatives.

28
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,530
Many governments promote citizen participation
in city development.

29
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,590
But the advent of social media has truly revolutionized
how people get informed and participate in

30
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,989
building the city.

31
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:32,340
Understanding these interactions is important
for us if we want to design processes in which

32
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,290
different actors from the public and private
sector and from civil society,

33
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:45,828
participate in different capacities and have
different roles in metropolitan innovation.

34
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:52,90
Metropolitan solutions are complex and involve
a multitude of stakeholders.

35
00:02:52,90 --> 00:02:54,819
Solutions should not stem from governments
alone,

36
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,349
or from citizens or businesses in isolation.

37
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:06,379
Solutions should be promoted and supported
by a variety of actors across different sectors.

38
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,420
This will not only increase their chance of
success,

39
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,768
but involvement of large coalitions of actors
across different sectors is likely to deliver

40
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,250
better and more realistic solutions to our
challenges.

41
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,530
While designing for change,
we wish to involve different actors with access
