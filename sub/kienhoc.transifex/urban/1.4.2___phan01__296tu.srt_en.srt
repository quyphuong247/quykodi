Hello,
In this introduction video on urban transport

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,380
I will explain how I define the transport
system,

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,650
and why this system is important,
and I will make clear what the key parts of

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,669
the transport system are.

5
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:35,110
I define transport as:
everything involved in moving people and freight.

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,570
The sector is not at all one homogeneous sector.

7
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,010
It includes both people travelling and freight.

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,950
And it covers private transport such as the
car or bike,

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,370
and public transport.

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,990
And it includes many transport modes and types
of infrastructure,

11
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,370
as I will explain later.

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,280
Why is transport so important?

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,820
It is the key to ensuring people can do activities
at different places,

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,960
examples being working,
shopping,

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,070
or visiting family or friends,
or a doctor.

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:23,140
And it ensures the supply of goods and services
(such as waste collection) to the city.

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,230
One could argue it keeps the city alive.

18
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,640
Coming back to ‘people’:
it facilitates (physical) interaction between

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,630
people.

20
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,729
Modern telecommunication does substitute some
interaction,

21
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:45,500
as in case of e-learning or skyping,
but these technologies do not replace many

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,479
other forms of interaction – we often want
to see people in person.

23
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,880
It is a key advantage of cities that they
provide attractive places for people and businesses

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,580
to meet.

25
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,260
Therefore,
a good transport systems is absolutely vital

26
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,840
for cities.

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,689
As shown on this graph the transport system
includes different modes of transport,

28
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,889
infrastructure (such as roads,
rails,

29
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:23,499
and airports) services (such as public transport
or airline services),

30
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:28,730
costs of travel,
and regulations (such as speeds on roads,

31
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,349
and safety standards for vehicles).

32
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,150
I will now briefly introduce these parts of
the transport system.

33
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,599
So,
let’s first explain modes.

34
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,480
A mode of transport is the way in which people
and freight are transported,

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,459
such as the train,
….
