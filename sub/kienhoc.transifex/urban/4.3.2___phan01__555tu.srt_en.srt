hello.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,140
In this video I will talk about how we as
humans actually create the urban climate.

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,179
Shaping the urban climate depends on the structure
and the materials the city is made of.

4
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,810
That urban climate differs from climates in
landscapes.

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,390
The urban climate is often drier and warmer
than natural landscapes and of course, the

6
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,809
heat loads that we experience from global
warming add up to these urban heat effects.

7
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:47,350
The urban climate also shows great differences
in the wind field- some places are more wind-

8
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,489
protected and some are more gusty.

9
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:58,230
Many changes in the urban structure also change
the urban climate- that’s why it is so important

10
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,510
to know the effects of design interventions-
or basically how we can shape the urban climate

11
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,330
through urban design.

12
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,640
But, how do you actually experience urban
climate in everyday life?

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,340
Urban heat can form a problem- over day it
is so hot that we have to carefully look for

14
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,120
shade outdoors.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:33,720
At night the heat in our houses keeps us from
sleeping and makes us dull and inefficient.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,850
Of course, the urban heat can also be beneficial,
e.g.

17
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:45,980
if we want to stay outdoors at night, but
mostly, the problems prevail.

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:53,000
Wind in the city is quite turbulent and we
can be unpleasantly surprised by its gusts.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,670
For instance, I was once blown off my bike
at the foot of a tall building!

20
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:06,030
We can also face discomfort when crossing
large squares because the wind speeds can

21
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,600
be quite high there, too.

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,130
On the other hand, wind can also be convenient,
for instance as a cool breeze during hot days.

23
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:25,420
But there are also many places in cities where
there is little wind because they are protected

24
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,430
by buildings and other volumes.

25
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,560
But of course, we do not feel sun, shade and
wind separately from each other.

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,370
Our temperature sensation depends on different
factors: shortwave radiation from the sun

27
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:57,030
and its reflection from urban surfaces, and of course, if you enter a shaded place or not. So, that is how you normally feel the influence of short wave radiation from the Sun.

28
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,720
And then there's also long wave radiation or in other words, its the warmth that is emitted

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:19,260
from objects in the city. For instance when you are sitting in front of the wall that has been warmed over day and it is still emitting heat at night, that when you feel long wave radiation.

30
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:33,280
Apart from that  wind, air temperature and a bit-
the relative humidity play a role on how you experience temperature as a totality.

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,760
The thermal perception is not only influenced
by these physical factors that we just saw.

32
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:48,870
It also plays a role what age and gender you
are, what you wear, how your metabolism works,

33
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:57,150
to which climate you are used and in which
temperature environment you’ve been before.

34
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:08,239
Also psychological factors such as your mood
and company have an influence on how you experience

35
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,550
the microclimate.

36
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,979
But all this cannot be changed by urban design.

37
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:23,240
As you can imagine, the wind can be changed
very well through urban design on a local

38
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,059
scale.

39
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:35,439
Also the shortwave radiation (sun and shade)
and longwave radiation can be changed very

40
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,020
effectively with local design interventions.

41
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,990
The air temperature and the relative humidity
can also be influenced, but then by larger
