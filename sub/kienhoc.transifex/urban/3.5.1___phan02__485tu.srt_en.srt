Countries may shift their domestic economy
towards services, reducing their primary and

40
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,400
secondary sectors, and increasing their dependence
on imported manufactured goods. This leads

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,150
to a lowering of domestic resource use (measured
in tons) while income per capita rises, and

42
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,479
to a shifting of the material and environmental
burden into developing countries.

43
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,010
Finally, there is evidence that the population
density has a positive influence on the resource

44
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,409
consumption. Therefore, also giving cities
or may urbanised countries a lower resource

45
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:46,339
consumption.
Yet, there is even a fourth factor of which

46
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:51,610
is proposed to affect resource use. That is
the fact that with increasing wealth of a

47
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:58,820
society the resource use and the environmental
impact actually reduce. This is the so called

48
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,399
decoupling of economic growth from natural
resource use and environmental impact.

49
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,409
This simply means that more economic output
can be produced with less resources – so

50
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:18,479
called resource decoupling. And that the environmental
impact reduces while the economic output increases

51
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,710
– so called impact decoupling.
Taking the initial example of water use in

52
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,050
the Netherlands this trend can actually be
observed. As you can see there is a recent

53
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:36,169
slight decline in the water use per capita.
The reasons for this decline maybe related

54
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:42,690
to a new environmental consciousness, more
innovation in terms of household appliances

55
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:49,729
and infrastructure.
In general this relationship has been proposed

56
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:55,640
as the Environmental Kuznet curve named after
the economist Simon Kuznet.

57
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,640
As can be seen here it shows that with increasing
wealth there will be a turning point in natural

58
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,159
resource use and environmental impact. While
this curves seems to hold true for some resources

59
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:12,580
such as water, this relationship is not evident
for other resources such as the decline of

60
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,099
fisheries for instance. So, this is still
subject to some debate in the scientific community.

61
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:25,620
But the question remains how can decoupling
then be achieved. The UN Environmental Programme

62
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,080
report on decoupling natural resource use
and environmental impact from economic growth,

63
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,219
puts cities forward as places for reaching
this decoupling. They have two key arguments

64
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:40,500
for this.
Firstly, the positive relationship between

65
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,330
density and resources use...
And secondly that fact that cities are hubs

66
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,909
of innovation...
In the report they argue that system innovation

67
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:58,529
is necessary rather than optimisation. By
this they mean that what is required are innovation

68
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:04,849
across many different aspects – technical,
in the rules and regulations, in the values

69
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:10,779
and norms you have (so for instance if you
value the environment) and the daily practices

70
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:17,089
of each of us – such as how we shower.
They also highlight that developing countries

71
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:21,459
should not follow the route of economic growth
and resource consumption developed countries

72
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:27,149
have. But rather that developing countries
and especially the fast growing cities within

73
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:32,760
them should directly pursue the decoupling
pathway of growth.

74
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:40,260
Do the better off in your city use more resources
or do they invest the money into sustainable practices?
