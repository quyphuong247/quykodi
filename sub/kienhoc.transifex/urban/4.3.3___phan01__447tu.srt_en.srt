Welcome every one to the roof of the forum
building of Wageningen University campus.

2
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,809
It is a beautiful day, the sun is shining
but I am going to talk today about floods.

3
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:28,550
You have probably seen a lot of photos of
flooded cities.

4
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,460
And if you look closely, they may look the
same, but they are not actually caused by

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,320
the same things.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,199
So they could be caused by too high river
waters, fluvial floods.

7
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:45,399
Or they could be caused by high sea waters,
if there are oceans nearby, those are coastal floods.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,739
But today we are going to talk about pluvial
floods.

9
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:52,390
Pluvial floods are caused by too much rainfall
locally.

10
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,140
So caused by heavy rainfall events that are
probably going to occur more frequently in

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,140
the future in many cities in the world.

12
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,460
Rainfall events can be divided into 2 types.

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,900
One is stratiform rainfall.

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,189
Those are the very long lasting, low intensity
rainfall events.

15
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,560
And they come from these blankets of clouds.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,500
Low hanging grey masses.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,630
The other type is convective rainfall and
those are very short live but very high intensity

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,270
rainfalls events that come from cumulus clouds,
that are very tall and veryâ€¦ you often see

19
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,619
them at the end of a warm summer day.

20
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,950
And those usually causes more problems in
cities than the other type.

21
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,609
Measuring rainfall is in fact really simple.

22
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:35,609
Here you have a rain gauge that you probably
saw before.

23
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:41,789
It is actually just a beaker in which you
collect a certain amount of rainfall.

24
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,679
Rainfall is measured in millimetres or inches.

25
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:47,490
Actually you could see that as a layer of
water that is laying on the surface.

26
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,789
One millimetre will correspond to 1 litre
per square meter.

27
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:55,319
So you could see that if you collect one millimetre
of rainfall on a square meter you will have

28
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,060
1 litre of water in your bucket.

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,299
You can make these yourself as well.

30
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,520
Just measure the surface and measure the volume
of water that you catch in a certain time

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,179
period and then you can divide them by each
other.

32
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:15,230
But of course when it rains a lot it may overflow
and you have to empty it yourself.

33
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,800
So there are also other types of rain gauges.

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,130
This is a tipping bucket rain gauge.

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,190
It has a funnel so all the water is transported
to the middle.

36
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,019
And inside this thing you have a small bucket
that is tipping when it is full.

37
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:30,799
So if you record when it tips you can record
how much water is falling during a certain

38
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,670
rainfall event.

39
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,470
This is a disdrometer.

40
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,599
A disdrometer sends a laser beam from one
side to the other.
