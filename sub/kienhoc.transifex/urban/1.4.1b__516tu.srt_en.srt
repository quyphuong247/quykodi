If we look at a city or city district,
roughly we can make a subdivision into buildings,

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:23,880
overground infrastructure (often for transportation)
and so-called ‘technical infrastructure’.

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,460
The technical infrastructure is the focus
of this video’s theme,

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,630
which will be addressed the coming weeks for
each of the challenges that define each weeks

5
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,649
content.

6
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:42,100
As you can see the technical infrastructure
includes many different fields.

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,969
For this introduction to the theme of Urban
services and infrastructure we will stick

8
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,660
to the three main flows related to physical,
or technical infrastructure:

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,109
energy,
water and waste.

10
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,929
The energy infrastructure in general is subdivided
into electricity,

11
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:02,300
gas,
direct energy cariers,

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,890
like liquid fuels.

13
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,159
And indirect energy carriers,
like hot water (or in some cases cold water

14
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,710
for cooling).

15
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,500
The water related infrastructure concerns
supply related water flows,

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,610
like drinking water and secondary water.

17
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,510
But also waste water.

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:27,840
Waste and waste water treatment are often
referred at as the sanitation infrastructure,

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,510
as they are literally connected to healthy
living environment.

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,320
Waste water is subdivided often according
to different ‘qualities’ or separated

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,930
wastewater streams;
grey water concerns all waste water except

22
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,780
toilet waste water.

23
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,040
Black water is toilet waste water,
while yellow and brown water concerns separated

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,950
urine and faeces flows.

25
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:00,980
But here also hot water and surface water
flows are included as part of water infrastructure.

26
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,250
Waste infrastructure includes different solid
waste fractions,

27
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,979
often subdivide into organic and anorganic
waste flows,

28
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:15,390
but also mixed (or grey) waste and residential
versus industrial waste.

29
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,530
One of the challenges of metropolitan areas
nowadays is that these different technical

30
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,200
infrastructures are often interrelated,
or even connected with one another.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,480
Also,
due to the before explained subdivision for

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,939
different qualities of energy,
water and waste flows,

33
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:40,109
this infrastructure gets more complex near
to users and their connections.

34
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:45,260
This makes that it becomes more important
by the day to be aware of these inter relations.

35
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:53,499
José Ortega y Gasset stated for that reason
“to be an engineer is not enough to be an

36
00:02:53,499 --> 00:03:02,239
engineer” Within this context of further
complexity come in new dimensions due to data

37
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,030
and ICT.

38
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:12,959
Ecologist Eugene Odum once subdivided our
environment into 4 layers:

39
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,230
the A-biotical layer,
the Biotical Layer,

40
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,379
the Technical layer and the Physical layer.

41
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:25,579
Buildings and Infrastructures are part of
the Technical layer.

42
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:30,620
Due to ICT this layered setup is not any more,
by definition,

43
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,579
location fixed,
or vertically aligned,

44
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:39,700
as shows Benjamin Brettons subdivision of
ICT related infrastructures within this technical

45
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,260
layer,
which he calls ‘the Stack’.

46
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,409
This stack implies that nowadays,
it is no longer a strict rule that a person

47
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:54,849
is literally connected by infrastructure to
his or her direct neighbour.

48
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:00,069
These developments regarding urban services
and infrastructures support the shift from

49
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:04,540
a 'focus for the masses',
and supply of fundamental services,

50
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:11,930
towards 'new forms of personalized supply',
integrated and smart,.often multi layered,

51
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,709
and potentially regenerative systems.

52
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:19,889
Such opportunities for metropolitan solutions,
at different scales,

53
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,940
and regarding different infrastructures,
or combinations of them,

54
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,639
like here the example of the solar bike road
in The Netherlands,

55
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,000
will be the subject of the coming weeks regarding
this theme.
