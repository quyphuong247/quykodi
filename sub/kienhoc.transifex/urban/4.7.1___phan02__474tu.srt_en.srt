00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:12,040

between authorities and non-state actors in
efforts to address climate change.

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,690
We see: partnerships between the city government
and companies, for instance in term of generating

50
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,510
and distributing renewable energy in a city.

51
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:29,030
We see citizen participation in urban climate governance and we see best-practice learning between

52
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:37,400
city governments in city networks. For example,
the city of Malmö in Sweden is a frontrunner

53
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,860
when it comes to finding innovative ways to
tackle climate change.

54
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,220
It has become an Eco-city.

55
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Governance as opposed to government has been
a crucial strategy in achieving this aim.

56
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,229
The city government did not just impose Eco-city
measures, but collaborated with private actors

57
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,810
and local communities to make it happen.

58
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,490
The local community was for instance actively
involved through climate-smart food centres

59
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,530
and community gardens.

60
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,300
Solar panels were placed at buildings and
schools to make means for renewable energy

61
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,710
highly visible to the community and to provide
the city of Malmö with a real identity of

62
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:21,470
an eco-city. Another key climate governance
strategy is for cities to engage in international

63
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,289
collaboration in transnational city networks.

64
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:30,550
In these networks, cities from different countries
exchange knowledge and share best practices

65
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,759
about urban climate governance.

66
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,660
These city networks also take on a broader
advocacy role to influence state negotiations

67
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,090
under the United Nations climate convention.

68
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,789
They for instance have put additional pressure
on state governments to agree on ambitious

69
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:53,710
mitigation targets under the UN climate convention
by showing that cities actually can do it

70
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,129
and actually do take action.

71
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:01,970
C40 is amongst the best known and high profile
city networks on climate change.

72
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,460
It involves big capitals, such as New York
and London.

73
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,879
Therefore, this network is key to facilitate
dialogue between major cities.

74
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,440
This network shares best-practises on a range
of issues, including transportation, energy,

75
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,720
and climate risks.

76
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,069
Another example of a well-known city network
is called ICLEI, Local Governments for Sustainability.

77
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,180
It has over 1000 members and is present in
many parts of the world.

78
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,199
This network has a very active secretariat
which helps local governments to improve their

79
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,639
sustainability performance.

80
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,990
It for instance offers a free, online, self-assesment
tool to help local governments evaluate their

81
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,690
progress towards urban sustainable development,
including actions on renewable energy and

82
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,710
more sustainable transport.

83
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,750
A third example is the Asian cities climate
change resilience network.

84
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,849
This network is specialised on adaptation.

85
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:05,229
Participating cities exchange experiences
about urban adaptation governance to learn

86
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:10,949
from one another and in that manner improve
their adaptation planning, for instance on

87
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,560
disaster prevention and post-disaster relief
.

88
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,000
Will cities be successful in our struggle
against climate change?

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,580
Cities at least collaborate much more effectively
to address climate change when compared to

90
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,900
national governments, and have become the
centre stage for pragmatic and innovative

91
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,340
action to realise a resilient and low-carbon
economy.

92
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,260
So what climate actions are being done in
your city?
