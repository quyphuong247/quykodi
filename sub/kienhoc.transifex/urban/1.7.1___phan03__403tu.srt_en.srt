groups of actors between diverse groups of
actors.

88
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,949
‘Governance’ thus refers to the policies
and actions of government,

89
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,909
market and society …that together aim to
influence societal developments.

90
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:38,069
Governance involves a process of interaction,
coordination and collaboration between diverse

91
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:38,669
groups of actors.

92
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,750
Back to the example of sustainable energy
in the built environment.

93
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,310
The EU-energy goals have been transposed into
national policy targets.

94
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,620
To meet these targets,
national governments rely on regional and

95
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,509
local policies stimulating the switch to renewables
and stimulating building owners and home owners

96
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,439
to invest in energy measures.

97
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,270
In turn,
local authorities stimulate citizens with

98
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,240
subsidies and information.

99
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,530
Also private actors play an important role
by providing renewable energy and decentralised

100
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,669
technologies as solar panels.

101
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:30,639
National government sometimes subsidizes renewable
technology development.

102
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,849
There is no silver bullet governance model
to foster sustainable urban development.

103
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:38,530
Our current institutions,
organisations,

104
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,699
rules,
procedures and practices were designed to

105
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:47,479
solve other problems and need to be changed
to solve sustainability problems.

106
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:51,800
Also,
every urban problem consists of a unique constellation

107
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,939
of stakeholders,
urban characteristics and geo-physical conditions,

108
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,560
giving rise to unique sets of constraints
and opportunities.

109
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,819
What we can do is make use of general knowledge
of governance and policy making – when are

110
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:14,840
they effective and why – and apply these
to specific urban challenges.

111
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,129
You now have a better understanding why policy
and governance are relevant for Sustainable

112
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:26,789
Urban Development the relevance and importance
of policy and governance for urban sustainability,

113
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:33,290
and how why to involve different groups of
actors to jointly develop solutions.

114
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,840
To conclude,
I would like to point out two trends to you

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,580
and I invite you to think of the governance
implications of these trends.

116
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,420
The first trend is that the increased availability
and affordability of decentralised technologies,

117
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,210
empowered individual citizens.

118
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,090
They can choose to become more autonomous,
providing in their own energy and water and

119
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,450
other needs,
backed-up by the centralised infrastructures

120
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,720
and service provisions.

121
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,130
The second trend is that more and more,
solutions tend to connect infrastructures

122
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,020
and subsystems.

123
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,910
For example,
the introduction of the electric car connects

124
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,510
the transport system to the energy system.

125
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:23,200
Or the production of biogas from sewage sludge
connects the water system to the energy system.

126
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,000
What are the governance consequences of these
developments for your own urban environment?

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,370
I wish you an inspiring course.

128
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,710
At the end of this course,
I hope that you will Please think about it!.
