In this video I will give you an introduction
to the theme ‘Urban services and Infrastructures’,

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,550
and will shortly address how this challenge
is related to general notions of fundamental

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,500
needs and sustainability.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,410
In the end,
the main goal of any development is to achieve

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,050
a prosperous society.

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,110
But what does that mean?

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,610
This is hard to answer,
as it will be different for all of us,

8
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,519
depending on different living conditions in
our world.

9
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:46,619
The definition of prosperity ‘now’,
depends on the needs of future generations.

10
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,479
UN Habitat introduced some years ago the City-Prosperity Index.

11
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,369
The ranking of cities regarding prosperity
is based on five indicators,

12
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,409
or ‘dimensions’:
Productivity,

13
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:02,820
Infrastructure development,
Quality of life,

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,760
Equity and social inclusion,
and Environmental sustainability.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,470
In a way these five dimensions relate strongly
to the main perspectives,

16
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:18,720
or focuses to achieve sustainable development,
often referred at as Triple P:

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,100
People,
Planet,

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,790
Profit.

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:28,500
Where the notion of Profit was changed in
the 2002 Johannesburg Treaty into Prosperity.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,320
Within this Triple P approach the different
24 aspects to address sustainability in our

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,190
living environment are framed.

22
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,420
In this ‘Planet’ aspects relate to the
technical aspects,

23
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,490
or so-called ‘stocks’ and ‘flows’
in the local environment,

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,990
like energy,
space,

25
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,350
water and waste.

26
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,799
The ‘People’ aspects,
as shown here are related to liveability,

27
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,490
like air or soil contamination,
safety and quality related aspects,

28
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,360
such as available green and social inclusion.

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,690
The ‘Profit’ related aspects concern economic
vitality and future values,

30
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,959
such as local employment,
flexibility and robustness.

31
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,620
Together they address what we could frame
the urban services,

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,459
which often are related to infrastructure
development.

33
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,779
And this aspect was highlighted,
as you saw before,

34
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:28,950
within this City Prosperity Index of UN-Habitat
as a separate indicator of prosperity.

35
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,560
Why?

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,239
This is related to our dependence on areas
around cities,

37
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,650
dependence to resources,
to other places and cities.

38
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,079
And the availability of (often cheap) transport.

39
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,569
This has led to what some call the interconnected
society,

40
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,560
where urbanized area consist of different
urban nodes,

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,849
which are highly interconnected.

42
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,939
This is also called poly-centric urban development.

43
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,900
Like shown here for example for the north-western
part of Europe,

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,099
for the area between London,
Paris,

45
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,249
Berlin and Amsterdam.

46
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:07,419
Triple P,
and in particular the notion of prosperity

47
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:10,969
forms the basis of Sustainable Development.

48
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:15,879
This notion was introduced in ‘the Brundtland
Report’ in 1987 .

49
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,419
In simple words it means that our children
need to inherit an equal or better world than

50
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,689
we have ourselves.

51
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:26,790
So sustainable development is not a static
notion.

52
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,430
It also relates strongly to how we try to
achieve sustainability,

53
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,579
and respond to environmental pressure and
apects of ‘change’,

54
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,269
such as climate change.
