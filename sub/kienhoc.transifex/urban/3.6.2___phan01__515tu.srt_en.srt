Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,209
In this video I will provide one example of
changing urban lifestyles.

3
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:22,869
I will explain to you how changes in urban
lifestyles affect resource use and health.

4
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:24,650
The urban lifestyle is changing.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,430
Economic and social developments lead to all
kinds of new options for citizens.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,510
Today it is rather the consumers than the
producers who decides what food is being produced

7
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,760
and how it is distributed.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,080
This transition is called the 'consumerist
turn'.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,839
But not all consumers are the same.

10
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:46,019
Different consumer lifestyles are visible
in the city.

11
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:48,909
Food is an essential part of everyday life.

12
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:52,420
So,
here I want to look more closely into food

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,619
as part of urban lifestyles.

14
00:00:54,619 --> 00:01:01,500
Into supermarkets and into food that is ready
to be consumed throughout the day.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,990
A lifestyle is a collection of everyday practices
in combination with a storyline.

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,159
The storyline makes the particular combination
of practices comprehensible.

17
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,710
A well-known example of an urban lifestyle
is the Young Urban Professional,

18
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,799
the Yup.

19
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,780
Yuppies were famous in the 1990s.

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,600
Nowadays many people talk about hipsters,
a lifestyle of young urbanites.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,999
There are many more different lifestyles,
especially in modern cities.

22
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:34,859
In metropolitan areas people with different
backgrounds,

23
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,039
schooling and professional careers live together.

24
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,859
Most lifestyles are less outspoken but everyone
has a particular lifestyle.

25
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,689
A lifestyle is however not simply a matter
of individual choice.

26
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,990
They are influenced by changing infrastructures,
the organisation of everyday life in the city,

27
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,479
and by people's biography.

28
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,240
Food illustrates this dynamic very clearly.

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,590
Supermarkets dominate modern urban food provision.

30
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,330
They have become obligatory passage points
for most food sales.

31
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,440
Supermarkets organise supply chains and sell
many different but standardised products.

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,600
Increasingly supermarkets have merged into
a small number of large corporations.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,440
The power of these large supermarket chains
is visible in their decision on where to locate

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,830
their shops.

35
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:33,240
Do they open supermarket outlets in city centres
or only at the outskirts of town?

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,310
These decisions are made by supermarket corporations
and often the infrastructure is geared towards

37
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,190
the more wealthy groups of consumers.

38
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,330
One effect may be that poorer households have
difficult access to good quality and fresh

39
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,440
food.

40
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,320
They no longer have supermarkets that sell
such products within their reach.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,460
This effect is called:
the creation of 'food deserts'.

42
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,510
Here shown in green for the case of Los Angeles!

43
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,730
This supermarket revolution is going on in
many cities around the world.

44
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,720
Top retailers,
such as Walmart,

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,820
Tesco and Carrefour have become large multinational
corporations with supermarkets in many cities.

46
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,890
However,
it is not the same everywhere.

47
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,090
In several cities in Asia,
the traditional wet markets remain very important

48
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,450
and in Western cities we witness the growth
of specialised food shops.

49
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:35,080
So the picture is more diverse than only the
domination of large supermarkets in food sale.

50
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,290
Consumers in cities have become used to the
possibility that they can easily get food

51
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,280
throughout the day.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,770
All sorts of snacks,
ready-to-eat food and drinks are always available.

53
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,930
Citizens expect a high diversity of food-stuffs
to be available within walking distance.

54
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,760
This practice is known as 'grazing' and 'food-on-the-go'.
