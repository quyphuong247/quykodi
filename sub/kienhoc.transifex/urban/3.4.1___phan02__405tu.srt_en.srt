45
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,730
https://youtu.be/OwJQiA1fkh8
networks and grids that remain in public hands.

46
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,599
We see the entry of new service suppliers,
both in water and energy.

47
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:15,600
.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,450
Companies specializing in niche markets for
rain water harvesting systems of green or

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,590
low-priced electricity.

50
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,570
This is the phase of marketization and splintering
grids.

51
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,730
But we also witness the re-entry of local
and individual producers:

52
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,850
consumers who turn into co-providers of solar
electricity,

53
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:41,420
communities operating a wind turbine and delivering
their electricity back to the grid.

54
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,790
Overseeing these developments we can say that
for one:

55
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,530
these developments are both institutional
and technical and secondly:

56
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,850
they have strong implications for how we deal
with the precious resources of energy and

57
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,400
water in our daily lives.

58
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,880
For instance:
the role of consumers has dramatically changed

59
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,970
over time:
from being considered as a "connection" only,

60
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,010
or a captive consumer during the nationalised
phase,

61
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,400
consumers have become a valuable target for
commercialized private service providers in

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,410
the marketized phase.

63
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,290
Next to that consumers have become co-producers
of electricity and water services,

64
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:26,500
sharing these resources via adapted existing
networks or new networks.

65
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,310
So we have seen that water and energy networks
have grown substantially,

66
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,470
and have become interwoven with urban life.

67
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,810
Now they start to diversify in terms of technology,
scale,

68
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,000
markets,
and consumer approaches.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,420
How does this development of water and energy
infrastructures align with environmental innovation?

70
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,390
Besides big infrastructures like hydropower
plants or off-shore wind parks there is also

71
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,290
a tendency to down-scaling in sustainable
water and energy infrastructures.

72
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,220
Both in technical and in organizational terms.

73
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,030
Renewable energy appliances like solar panels,
wind turbines or combined heat power plants

74
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,540
are of a much smaller scale than conventional
power plants.

75
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,120
Also environmental innovation in urban water
infrastructures means experimentation with

76
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,680
local rain water harvesting,
or decentralised water treatment systems.

77
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,630
So splintered infrastructures and environmental
innovation may go hand in hand.

78
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,290
And so goes for consumer involvement in the
provision of sustainable water and energy

79
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,310
services.

80
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,810
With the technical diversification and downscaling
there is a need to involve the urban consumer:

81
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:44,420
not as a passive connection anymore,
but as an active co-provider of greener services.

82
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,670
The grids are opening up and so do the options
for consumers to become involved in sustainable

83
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,010
water and energy services.

84
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,460
How would you become involved in your energy
and water system of provision?

85
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,470
Is co-production an option,
or would you opt for shared or public schemes

86
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,650
for sustainable water or energy provision?
