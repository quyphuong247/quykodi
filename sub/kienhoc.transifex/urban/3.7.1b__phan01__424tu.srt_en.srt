Hello everybody!

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,810
I am here to talk about governance:
or how to operate in multi-actor contexts.

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,729
Or in other words:
Why governance and stakeholder involvement

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,200
are important for innovative metropolitan
solutions.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,359
In this video,
I will give examples of multi-level and networked

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,480
governance.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,339
Governance is defined as the architecture
of interactions between three large sectors

8
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:44,19
of society:
The private sector and the public sector the

9
00:00:44,20 --> 00:00:50,170
public sector and civil society and the civil
society and the private sector.

10
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,680
In liberal democracies,
these large sectors are in positive tension

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,719
with each other.

12
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,129
This means that by applying pressure on one
another,

13
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:07,940
they produce checks and balances that keep
each sector in line with societal needs.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,149
Metropolitan innovators must understand and
operate in complex systems of governance,

15
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:19,90
because that will allow them to make better
decisions and deliver better solutions.

16
00:01:19,90 --> 00:01:25,549
Like in this example of how the governance
of the city of Delhi in India is organized.

17
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,770
But Metropolitan innovators must also be able
to DESIGN new relationships and tools to articulate

18
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,420
different actors and create new forms of collaboration.

19
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,420
This will allow them to deliver MUCH BETTER
tailored and realistic solutions.

20
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,970
Letâ€™s take an example of governance in which
multiple levels of governance are involved

21
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,679
in the management and the design of the built
environment.

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,320
Let us look at the city of London,
in the UK.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,500
The city of London is a county within the
large metropolis of London Its origins can

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,9
be traced to the Roman period,
when it was called Londinium.

25
00:02:10,8 --> 00:02:13,570
It now represents only a tiny part of Greater
London,

26
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,959
occupying an area of 1 by 1 mile in the center
of the metropolis.

27
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,290
However,
it concentrates an enormous power,

28
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,630
with a large number of headquarters of the
most powerful financial institutions in the

29
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,489
world.

30
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:36,40
It is considered by many as the main engine
of British economy.

31
00:02:36,40 --> 00:02:41,260
The city of London is a great example of multilevel
governance.

32
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,698
It is managed as a Ward,
which elects the members of the Court of commons

33
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,430
and the court of Aldermen.

34
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,699
This ward is managed by the City of London
Corporation,

35
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:58,669
a UNIQUE form of local government,
which has lots of responsibilities concerning

36
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:02,000
the management and the design of the built
environment.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,90
But the City of London Corporation is part
of the Local Government Association and London

38
00:03:08,90 --> 00:03:13,419
Borough Council,
and belongs to the Greater London Authority.

39
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:17,150
The Great London Authority belongs to the
council of English regions,

40
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:24,840
that belongs of course to the nation of ENGLAND,
to the United Kingdom and to the European

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,519
Union.
