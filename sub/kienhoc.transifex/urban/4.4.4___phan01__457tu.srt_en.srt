Welcome to the video on climate change and
urban transport.

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,640
In this video I want to make clear that technological
change is by far the most important way to

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,550
go to reach stringent climate goals,
but non-technological measures also can contribute,

4
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,960
and have many other benefits.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,550
Before I discuss different options to reduce
CO2 emissions of transport I give some background

6
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,340
information.

7
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,539
Transport is one of largest CO2 emitting sectors,
and its share is increasing.

8
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,609
CO2 is the most important Green House Gas.

9
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:57,699
In addition,
transport,

10
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:00,829
more than any other sector,
like industry,

11
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:07,030
agriculture or households,
is highly oil dependent – almost all transport

12
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,690
vehicles use fossil fuels.

13
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:18,010
Secondly it is important to realize transport
not only includes urban transport,

14
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,140
but also inter urban,
national,

15
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,680
and international travel and it includes both
passenger and goods transport.

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,250
Thirdly,
this video is on urban areas,

17
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,520
and urban transport is mainly urban road transport.

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,280
What then is the main challenge?

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,070
People want to be mobile,
and companies want to be able to transport

20
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,650
goods.

21
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,360
In other words,
the transport system needs to make destinations

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,660
accessible.

23
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,980
But high levels of mobility endanger the climate.

24
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:07,100
So the main challenge is to maintain (or improve)
accessibility and nevertheless reduce CO2

25
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,640
emissions.

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,810
How can we meet this challenge?

27
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,670
If we want to strongly reduce the CO2 emissions
of transport,

28
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,750
technologies will be way more important than
mobility changes.

29
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:29,500
It is an illusion to think we can reduce these
emissions strongly via behavioral change,

30
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,380
at least not without much opposition.

31
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,220
Non-technological measures will not be sufficient
to reduce CO2 emissions of transport globally

32
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,310
by more than 10-20%,
probably less.

33
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,360
If we look at technological solutions,
it is important to know that transport is

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,580
generally considered to be an expensive sector
to reduce CO2 emissions.

35
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,030
It is generally easier and cheaper to reduce
these emission for stationary sources,

36
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,790
like industry or houses,
and in the past relative emission reductions

37
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,569
in such sectors have exceeded those in the
transport sector.

38
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,900
But something is possible.

39
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,260
So what are some of the promising technologies
today?

40
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,069
I will limit myself to urban transport only.

41
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:32,180
Several alternatives for the current fossil
fuels based road transport system exist,

42
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,230
but electric vehicles and in the longer future
maybe hydrogen vehicles seem the most promising.

43
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,580
And for rail transport a solution could be
to produce electricity sustainably,

44
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,240
via – for example – solar or wind energy.

45
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,540
Electric vehicles are more efficient than
hydrogen vehicles,

46
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,400
but have smaller ranges,
and need charging times that are way longer

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,910
than the time needed to refuel a vehicle.

48
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,980
If we solve the barriers of range or charging
time,

49
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,510
and especially if electric vehicles become
cheaper,

50
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,660
they have huge potential,
especially if we produce electricity in a

51
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,150
clean way.
