economic,
social,

48
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,959
and other changes.

49
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,530
Several organizations rank ports on the basis
of these measures.

50
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,420
As ports expand,
shrink,

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,560
move,
or require infrastructure,

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,040
they compete with other functions of their
host cities.

53
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,079
The timeliness of urban redevelopment thus
also counts in port rankings.

54
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,500
As public and private decision-makers around
the world built new ports and facilities for

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,090
the bigger ships transshipping more and more
goods and people after the 1960s,

56
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,920
they abandoned their old harbors.

57
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,200
Waterfronts in New York,
Hamburg,

58
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,579
Amsterdam,
Philadelphia,

59
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:17,260
and Sydney,
lost their status as global ports.

60
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,590
They became ghost districts,
challenges to urban development.

61
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,530
Many cities looked for new uses for empty
inner-city ports.

62
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,920
Filled with industrial structures and industrial
waste,

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,640
along polluted waters,
these sites needed major investment for redevelopment.

64
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,820
Cities also needed to find employment for
the many people who had lost their jobs in

65
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,880
packaging,
transportation,

66
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,440
and storage.

67
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,860
Waterfront (re)development in some places
focused on preserving traditional port infrastructure

68
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,730
and recovering the water for locals.

69
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,080
Baltimore chose to redevelop the waterfront
for leisure and tourism,

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,960
a project that was then exported to other
port cities around the world.

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,860
The London Docklands controversially redeveloped
an industrial waterfront into office spaces

72
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,380
and river-side housing for young urban professionals.

73
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,670
Rotterdam redeveloped abandoned port land
in the Kop van Zuid area,

74
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,000
while Amsterdam built housing and preserved
large warehouses in their respective former

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,530
port areas.

76
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:39,500
Other port cities redesigned their waterfronts
on the occasion of cultural or sporting events,

77
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,930
as the case of Qingdao shows.

78
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,210
Under the slogan,
“the growing city”,

79
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,300
the City of Hamburg has aimed to counter shrinkage.

80
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,090
It opted to transform the former inner-city
port area,

81
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,940
including the historic Speicherstadt into
a multifunctional district,

82
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,770
the HafenCity.

83
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:08,940
Establishing a master plan for an area of
about 155 hectares , the city started in the

84
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:15,140
1990s to undertake what is one of the largest
redevelopment projects in Europe.

85
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:21,770
After the fall of the wall,
the city bought up land and held a competition,

86
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:29,050
won by a Dutch-German team called Hamburgplan
with Kees Christiaanse/Astoc.

87
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,940
The Western part of the area such as the Sandtorkai
area is almost finished,

88
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:40,190
with some 1500 people living and 6000 working
there.

89
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:46,640
The HafenCity redevelopment aims to create
an integrated urban development with housing,

90
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,500
offices,
shops,

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:55,470
schools and cultural amenities and has held
numerous architectural and urban competitions,

92
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,080
including for the urban spaces.
