On the other hand urban morphological properties
also influences the strength of the urban

43
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,299
heat island.

44
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:34,400
As we saw already, more vegetation in an urban
landscape will allow more energy to be used

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,290
for evaporation and leave less energy for
warming of the atmosphere and buildings.

46
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,930
In addition, street geometry and the availability
of open water surfaces also influence the

47
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,090
urban temperature.

48
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,459
How exactly, I will explain now.

49
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:58,139
When talking about, geometry of the streets
influencing urban temperatures there are two

50
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,329
important counteracting processes.

51
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:04,260
First there is the trapping of heat within
the streets.

52
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:11,680
In more open streets with low buildings heat
is stored in the pavement and in buildings

53
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,019
can more easily escape.

54
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:21,959
Whereas in narrow streets with high buildings
this heat is trapped and can’t hardly escape.

55
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,790
This process is of main importance during
the night time and enhances the Urban Heat

56
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,500
Island for streets with high height to width
ratio’s.

57
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,340
On the other hand, open spaces in the city
receive a lot of energy from the sun during

58
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,160
daytime.

59
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,980
Whereas in narrow streets with high buildings
solar energy usually does not completely enter

60
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,650
the street, resulting in a shadowing effect.

61
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,750
This daytime process causes air temperatures
to decrease with enhanced height to width

62
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,970
ratio’s.

63
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,910
Which of these processes dominates in controlling
the urban heat island varies for different

64
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,700
seasons and latitudes.

65
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,200
For example, in the winter of the mid-latitudes,
so cities like New York, Paris or Moscow.

66
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,230
There is very little incoming solar radiation,
for this reason the trapping of heat is the

67
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,410
dominant process determining the effect on
the height to width ratio.

68
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:31,590
This means that the urban heat island increases
for narrow streets with high buildings.

69
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,850
In a mid-latitude summer we can see that the
urban heat island can also decrease if we

70
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,370
have a larger height to width ratio of the
streets.

71
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,960
This means that during this time the shadowing
effect is the dominant process.

72
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,420
Now, we will have a look at the influence
of open water on the urban temperature.

73
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:59,600
Water is thermally slow, so this means that
it responds slowly to changes in the air temperature.

74
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,460
Therefore the temperature of water varies
very little throughout the day, whereas the

75
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,970
air temperature can fluctuate more than 10
degrees Celsius.

76
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:15,460
Adding open water in a city therefore reduces
the daytime temperatures, when the air temperature

77
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,390
reaches values higher than the water temperature.

78
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:26,140
But during the night when the air temperature
drops below the water temperature, the water

79
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,280
has a warming effect.

80
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,660
And open water enhances the urban heat island.

81
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,350
I hope you stay cool in your city.
