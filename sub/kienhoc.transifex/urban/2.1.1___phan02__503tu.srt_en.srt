52
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,900
https://youtu.be/-5hkp68LjiM
that drive the world-economy.

53
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,540
Within this context,
this weeks challenge of ‘urban growth and

54
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,540
transformation’ will be addressed from the
different themes defined.

55
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:16,209
The first theme that will be reflected upon
is that of the effects of urbanization to

56
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,930
shape and structure of cities.

57
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,920
Key concepts like mono-centric and poly-centric
metropolitan regions will be explained.

58
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:31,780
But also what different approaches or concepts
to urban shape and structure exist.

59
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,100
Like that of the ‘compact city’,
as shown here for instance in the design of

60
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:43,130
“the Great City”,
a new town ecocity near Chengdu China.

61
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,620
Regarding such concepts of the ‘compact
city’,

62
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,090
you will learn that 'urban shape,
services and infrastructures' are highly integrated

63
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,440
and connected,
often leading to multi-layered and complex

64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,530
environments.

65
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,110
But regarding this theme you will also learn
about other concepts that take a different

66
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,930
approach,
like for instance the well-known example of

67
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,250
Masdar City,
a new town Eco city in the United Arab Emirates

68
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,140
Similar to the previous example it also can
be considered an approach based on the ‘compact

69
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,530
city concept’,
with integrated solutions.

70
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,640
The difference however lies in another urban
morphology,

71
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,260
or built-up / open space ratio,
often indicated by the so-called 'fsi' and

72
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,290
'gsi',
notions that will be explained in detail within

73
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,940
this theme of shape and structure as well.

74
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,500
The result in case of Masdar city,
is that its main shape and structure can be

75
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,550
considered as a compact,
though low-rise built-up environment,

76
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,670
with a maximized roof-surface,
to create room for solar panels and other

77
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:54,900
services necessary to achieve the ambition
to become the first zero carbon city in the

78
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,430
world.

79
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,490
And this relates directly to the second theme
of focus in relation to this weeks challenge:

80
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,930
the ‘urban services and infrastructures’.

81
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,440
Which involves energy infrastructure,
sewerage and drinking water infrastructure,

82
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,180
together often framed as ‘sanitation’
infrastructure.

83
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,990
But it also involves transportation,
to which particular attention will be given,

84
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:26,370
as this is a crucial aspect of urban environments
and growth or transformation.

85
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,860
As you can see,
in the extreme case of Masdar city,

86
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,210
transportation can become highly innovative,
with self-driving cars and separated,

87
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,390
non-accessible streets For the time being
however,

88
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,340
the largest part of challenges will concern
existing urban environments,

89
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,640
and only to a limited extent,
new towns like Masdar city.

90
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,770
The challenges related to transport in existing
urban environments concern space conflicts

91
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,970
and often are livability related.

92
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,990
Sensing and Real Time feedback,
together with strategic planning are powerful

93
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,160
tools.

94
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,500
In fact ‘the pain is in the change,
not in the outcome’.

95
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,210
In the images shown here we see an overview
regarding the city of Amsterdam,

96
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,810
where the effects of measures to improve accessibility
and livability by reducing car use,

97
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,050
and increase more sustainable alternatives,
like bicycle use,

98
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,170
are monitored and shown.

99
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:31,160
Also the connection of these ‘urban services
and infrastructures’ with new mobility concepts

100
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,200
and energy generation provides new opportunities,
like shown here,

101
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,580
in the concept to use electric vehicles,
so called EVs,

102
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:47,860
for a temporary storage of electricity,
generated with renewables on top of buildings.
