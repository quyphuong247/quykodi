1
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,489
Three Categories of Time
1. Long time: the drawn-out, years-long kind

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,129
of time that must be managed with patience
and gentle guidance. Our handling of long

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,298
time should be mostly defensive—this is
the art of not reacting impulsively, of waiting

4
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:19,100
for opportunity.
· When you force the pace out of fear and

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,519
impatience, you create a nest of problems
that require fixing, and you end up taking

6
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,948
much longer than if you had taken your time.
· Hasteners may occasionally get there quicker,

7
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:33,260
but papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise,
and they find themselves in constant crisis

8
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,869
mode, fixing the problems that they themselves
have created.

9
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,929
· Sometimes not acting in the face of danger
is your best move—you wait, you deliberately

10
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:47,350
slow down. As time passes it will eventually
present opportunities you had not imagined.

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,058
2. Forced time: the short-term time that we
can manipulate as an offensive weapon, upsetting

12
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:56,829
the timing of our opponents.
· The trick in forcing time is to upset the

13
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,698
timing of others.
· To make them hurry, to make them wait,

14
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,920
to make them abandon their own pace, to distort
their perception of time.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,870
· By upsetting the timing of your opponent
while you stay patient, you open up time for

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,510
yourself, which is half the game.
And finally, End time: when a plan must be

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,600
executed with speed and force. We have waited,
found the moment, and must not hesitate.

18
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,109
· Waiting patiently for the right moment
to act, putting your competitors off their

19
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,870
form by messing with their timing—but it
won't mean a thing unless you know how to

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,430
finish.
· Do not be one of those people who look

21
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,850
like paragons of patience but are actually
just afraid to bring things to a close.

22
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:38,989
· Patience is worthless unless combined with
a willingness to fall ruthlessly on your opponent

23
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:41,890
at the right moment.
· You can wait as long as necessary for the

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,210
conclusion to come, but when it comes it must
come quickly.

25
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:50,189
· Use speed to paralyze your opponent, cover
up any mistakes you might make, and impress

26
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,009
people with your aura of authority and finality.
Mastering Time

27
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,000
First, when your mind is uncluttered by constant
emergencies you will see further into the

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,909
future.
Second, you will be able to resist the baits

29
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,810
that people dangle in front of you, and will
keep yourself from becoming another impatient

30
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,378
sucker.
Third, you will have more room to be flexible.

31
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:13,009
Opportunities will inevitably arise that you
had not expected and would have missed had

32
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,629
you forced the pace.
Fourth, you will not move from one deal to

33
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:20,479
the next without completing the first one.
To build your power's foundation can take

34
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,340
years; make sure that foundation is secure.
Do not be a flash in the pan—success that

35
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,610
is built up slowly and surely is the only
kind that lasts.

36
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,150
Finally, slowing time down will give you a
perspective on the times you live in, letting

37
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,209
you take a certain distance and putting you
in a less emotionally charged position to

38
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,860
see the shapes of things to come. Hasteners
will often mistake surface phenomena for a

39
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,990
real trend, seeing only what they want to
see. How much better to see what is really

40
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,170
happening, even if it is unpleasant or makes
your task harder.

41
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,609
WARNING (But be warned...)
%With the patience of a snake charmer, you

42
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,569
draw the snake out with calm and steady rhythms.
Once the snake is out, though, would you dangle

43
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:06,929
your foot above its deadly head? There is
never a good reason to allow the slightest

44
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,500
hitch in your endgame. Your mastery of timing
can really only be judged by how you work

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,098
with end time—how you quickly change the
pace and bring things to a swift and definitive

46
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:17,658
conclusion.
