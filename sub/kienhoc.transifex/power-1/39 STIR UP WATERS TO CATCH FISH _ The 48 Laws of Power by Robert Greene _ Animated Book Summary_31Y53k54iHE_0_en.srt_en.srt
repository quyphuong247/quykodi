The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 39: Stir Up Waters to Catch Fish

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,140
Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive.
You must always stay calm and objective. But

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,859
if you can make your enemies angry while staying
calm yourself you gain a decided advantage.

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,618
Put your enemies’ off-balance: Find the
chink in their vanity through which you can

5
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:33,119
rattle them and you hold the strings.
By the late 1920s, Hailie Selassie had nearly

6
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,320
achieved his goal of assuming total control
over Ethiopia, a country he felt needed strong

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,549
and unified leadership. As regent to the empress
Zauditu and heir to the throne, Selassie had

8
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:48,619
spent several years weakening the power of
Ethiopia's various warlords. Now only one

9
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:53,198
real obstacle stood in his way: the empress
and her husband Ras Gugsa.

10
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,349
Selassie knew the royal couple hated him and
wanted to get rid of him, so to cut short

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,960
their plotting he made Gugsa the governor
of the northern province of Begemeder, forcing

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,379
him to leave the capital, where the empress
lived. For several years Gugsa played the

13
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:10,769
loyal administrator. But Selassie did not
trust him: He knew that Gugsa and the empress

14
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,618
were plotting revenge. As time passed and
Gugsa made no move, the chances of a plot

15
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:21,390
only increased. Selassie drew Gugsa out, got
under his skin and pushed him into action

16
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,579
before he was ready.
Gugsa fell for the trap that had been laid

17
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:29,438
for him. Before Selassie had ordered Gugsa
to fight the Azebu Gallas, he had secured

18
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,669
the support of the Ethiopian church. And before
the revolt got underway, he had bribed several

19
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,609
of Gugsa's key allies not to show up for battle.
As the rebel army marched south, airplaned

20
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:44,228
flew overhead dropping leaflets announcing
that the highest church officials had recognized

21
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:49,438
Selassie as the true Christian leader of Ethiopia,
and that they had been excommunicated Gugsa

22
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,228
for fomenting a civil war. And as battle loomed
and the support that Gugsa's allies had promised

23
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:59,118
him failed to show up, soldiers began to flee
or defect. When the battle came, the rebel

24
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,359
army quickly collapsed. Refusing to surrender,
Ras Gugsa was killed in the fighting. On April

25
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,340
30, Selassie issued a formal proclamation
announcing his new title: Emperor of Ethiopia.

26
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,509
"A sovereign should never launch an army out
of anger, a leader should never start a war

27
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:21,179
out of wrath." - Sun Tzu, fourth century B.C.
Seven problems with the Angry Response

28
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,530
1. At first it may strike fear and terror,
but only in some, and as the days pass and

29
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,590
the storm clears, other responses emerge.
2. Embarrassment and uneasiness about the

30
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,569
shouter's capacity for going out of control.
3. Resentment festers of what has been said.

31
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:40,030
4. You always make unfair and exaggerated
accusations.

32
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,860
5. A few such tirades and people are counting
the days until you are gone.

33
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,910
6. To show your frustration is to show that
you have lost your power to shape events.

34
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:52,150
7. It is the helpless action of the child
who re-sorts to a hysterical fit to get his

35
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,819
way
Never Let them See You Sweat

36
00:02:54,818 --> 00:03:00,009
Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty.
They only create doubts and uneasiness about

37
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:04,769
your power. Exposing your weakness, these
stormy eruptions often herald a fall.

38
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,408
The essence of the Law: When the waters are
still, your opponents have the time and space

39
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:14,810
to plot actions that they will initiate and
control. So stir the waters, force the fish

40
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,670
to the surface, get them to act before they
are ready and steal the initiative. The best

41
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:26,158
way to do this is to play on uncontrollable
emotions—pride, vanity, love, hate. Once

42
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,780
the water is stirred up, the little fish cannot
help but rise to the bait. The angrier they

43
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,039
become, the less control they have, and finally
they are caught in the whirlpool you have

44
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,818
made, and they drown.
And that is it for this law, be sure to dive

45
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:44,208
deeper into it with Part II 'Emotional Reaction'
and as always thanks for watching.
