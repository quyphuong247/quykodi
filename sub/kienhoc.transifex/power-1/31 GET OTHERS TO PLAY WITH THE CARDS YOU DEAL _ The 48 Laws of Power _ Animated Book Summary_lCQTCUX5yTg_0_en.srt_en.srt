The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 31: Get others to Play with the

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,470
Cards you Deal
The best deceptions are the ones that seem

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,640
to give the other person a choice: Your victims
feel they are in control, but are actually

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,329
your puppets. Give people options that come
out in your favor whichever one they choose.

5
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:31,149
Force them to make choices between the lesser
of two evils, both of which serve your purpose.

6
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,488
Put them on the horns of a dilemma: They are
gored wherever they turn.

7
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:41,640
Ivan the Terrible had to confront an unpleasant
reality: The country desperately needed reform,

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,439
but he lacked the power to push it through.
The greatest limit to his authority came from

9
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:52,579
the boyars, the Russian princely class that
dominated the country and terrorized the peasantry.

10
00:00:52,579 --> 00:01:00,229
In 1553, at the age of 23, Ivan fell ill.
Lying in bed and nearing his death, he asked

11
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:06,560
the boyars to swear alleigiance to his son
at the new czar. Some hesitated, some refused

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,939
and Ivan saw that the boyars could not be
reasoned with. When he recovered, he did not

13
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,719
forget that valuable lesson. The boyars defected
to Poland and Lithuana, the latter by one

14
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:24,000
of Ivan's closest friends, Andrey Kurbski,
who became Ivan's greatest enemy. Not only

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,519
the boyars caused him grief. Russia's vast
size made it a nightmare to defend. Whatever

16
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:36,158
direction Ivan would have turned to, he'd
leave his back wide open for a stab.

17
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,170
December 3rd, 1564 Ivan had left the capitol
to a nearby village, leaving the czar's treasures

18
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,868
and provisions behind without any explanation.
Moscows population feared that Ivan had let

19
00:01:48,868 --> 00:02:00,390
them behind to be slaughtered by the boyars.
As a result they begged the czar to come back,

20
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,228
blaming the boyars for their betrayal. Ivan
listened, but would not change his mind. A

21
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:12,389
few days later the begging had not stopped
and he gave them a choice. "A choice" in the

22
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:17,439
same way the godfather gave the choice of
either signing the contract or getting shot

23
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,550
in the head. What was it, "Either your name
comes on the paper or your brain.", or something

24
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,209
like that.
Ivan would either rule as a dictator or not

25
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:30,370
at all, leaving them vulnerable for whoever
pleased to take the thrown. They accepted

26
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,640
his terms & could no longer rebel against
the dictatorship they had chosen. This is

27
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:41,549
important, THEY made the CHOICE.
Words like "freedom," "options," and "choice"

28
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,080
evoke a power of possibility far beyond the
reality of the benefits they entail. When

29
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,500
examined closely, the choices we have—in
the marketplace, in elections, in our jobs—tend

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,520
to have noticeable limitations:
They are often a matter of a choice simply

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,420
between A and B, with the rest of the alphabet
out of the picture.

32
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:09,208
As long as the faintest mirage of choice flickers
on, we rarely focus on the missing options.

33
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,348
We "choose" to believe that the game is fair,
and that we have our freedom.

34
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:19,519
We prefer not to think too much about the
depth of our liberty to choose.

35
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,629
We are unwilling to probe the smallness of
our choices that stems from the fact that

36
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:31,469
too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety.
The phrase "unlimited options" sounds infinitely

37
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:38,280
promising, but unlimited options would actually
paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose.

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,979
Our limited range of choices comforts us.
Appear to give options where there are none,

39
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,128
this is what the law is about. As long as
people feel they've been able to make their

40
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:53,268
own decision between options considering the
pros and cons of them all, they will behave

41
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,909
in a more positive manner, complying with
what you want.

42
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:02,009
And that is it for this law, be sure to check
out part two, in which you're introduced to

43
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,649
7 of the most common forms of Controlling
the Options. As always thank's for watching.
