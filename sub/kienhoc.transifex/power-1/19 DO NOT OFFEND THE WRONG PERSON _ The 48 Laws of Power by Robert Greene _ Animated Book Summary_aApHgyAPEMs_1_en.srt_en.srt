The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law Number 19... Do Not Offend the Wrong Person

2
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:16,179
There are many different kinds of people in
the world, and you can never assume that everyone

3
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:20,640
will react to your strategies in the same
way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,109
they will spend the rest of their lives seeking
revenge. They are wolves in lambs' clothing.

5
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,710
Choose your victims and opponents carefully.
Never offend or deceive the wrong person!

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,590
Here are the 5 Most Dangerous and Difficult
Typs of People, that you will definately stumble

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,680
upon at some point in your life
1. The Arrogant and Proud Man

8
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,990
Although he may initially disguise it, this
man's touchy pride makes him very dangerous.

9
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,650
Any perceived slight will lead to a vengeance
of overwhelming violence. You may say to yourself,

10
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,960
"But I only said such-and-such at a party,
where everyone was drunk. ..." It does not

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,560
matter. There is no sanity behind his overreaction,
so do not waste time trying to figure him

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,570
out. If at any point in your dealings with
a person you sense as oversensitive with overactive

13
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:09,809
pride, flee, run away! Whatever you are hoping
for from this person, isn't worth it.

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,759
2. The Hopelessly Insecure Man
This man is related to the proud and arrogant

15
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,450
type, but is less violent and harder to spot.
His ego is fragile, his sense of self insecure,

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,009
and if he feels himself deceived or attacked,
the hurt will simmer. He will attack you in

17
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:30,069
bites that will take forever to get big enough
for you to notice. If you find you have deceived

18
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:34,728
or harmed such a man, disappear for a long
time. Do not stay around him or he will nibble

19
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,709
you to death.
3. Mr. Suspicion

20
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:42,109
He sees what he wants to see—usually the
worst—in other people, and imagines that

21
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:47,009
everyone is after him. Mr. Suspicion is in
fact the least dangerous of the three: Genuinely

22
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,989
unbalanced, he is easy to deceive, just as
Stalin himself was constantly deceived. Play

23
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:56,259
on his suspicious nature to get him to turn
against other people. But if you do become

24
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:01,509
the target of his suspicions, watch out.
4. The Serpent with a Long Memory

25
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:06,929
If hurt or deceived, this man will show no
anger on the surface; he will calculate and

26
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:11,810
wait. Then, when he is in a position to turn
the tables, he will exact a revenge marked

27
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,489
by a cold-blooded shrewdness. Recognize this
man by his calculation and cunning in the

28
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:21,200
different areas of his life. He is usually
cold and unaffectionate. Be doubly careful

29
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,859
of this snake, and if you have somehow injured
him, either crush him completely or get him

30
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,010
out of your sight.
5. The Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent

31
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,489
Man
The danger with this man is not that he will

32
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,468
harm you or seek revenge, but merely that
he will waste your time, energy, resources,

33
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:43,348
and even your sanity in trying to deceive
him. Have a test ready for him—a joke or

34
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:48,018
a story. If his reaction is utterly literal,
this is the type you are dealing with. Continue

35
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,750
at your own risk.
5 Final Words of Caution

36
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,979
1. In judging and measuring your opponent,
never rely on your instincts. You will make

37
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:02,590
the greatest mistakes of all if you rely on
such inexact indicators. Nothing can substitute

38
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,128
for gathering concrete knowledge. Study and
spy on your opponent for however long it takes;

39
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:13,608
this will pay off in the long run.
2. Never trust appearances. Anyone with a

40
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:18,439
serpent's heart can use a show of kindness
to cloak it; a person who is blustery on the

41
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:23,780
outside is often really a coward. Learn to
see through appearances and their contradictions.

42
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,949
Never trust the version that people give of
themselves—it is utterly unreliable.

43
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:33,429
3. If you want to turn people down, it is
best to do so politely and respectfully, even

44
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,700
if you feel their request is impudent or their
offer ridiculous. Never reject them with an

45
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,209
insult until you know them better; you may
be dealing with a Genghis Khan.

46
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,560
4. Some people's insecurity and ego fragility
cannot tolerate the slightest offense. To

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,438
see if you are dealing with such a type, test
them first—make, say, a mild joke at their

48
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:59,180
expense. A confident person will laugh; an
overly insecure one will react as if personally

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,680
insulted. If you suspect you are dealing with
this type, find another victim.

50
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,609
5. Swallow the impulse to offend, even if
the other person seems weak. The satisfaction

51
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:15,248
is meager compared to the danger that someday
he or she will be in a position to hurt you.

52
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:20,620
Alright, that's almost it for this law, let
me elaborate more on why I chose this Hitler

53
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,439
figure. I know, it's not the best example
& I also know it's not the only reason he

54
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:31,600
blamed the jewish people, he played the blame
game, propaganda, people were pissed at losing

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,890
the first world war and having to pay reparations, having scarce resources and so

56
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,819
on and he made them responsible for it. BUT
before all that Hitler was living on the streets

57
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,389
trying his luck as an artist. Yes, Adolf Hitler
did paintings & when he reached out to museums

58
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:52,349
& art-shows, he was deeply hurt. A lot of
these organizations were owned by Jewish people,

59
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,910
who he took personal offense to. Never offend
the wrong person. Done.
