The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 29: Plan all the way to the End

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,859
The ending is everything. Plan all the way
to it, taking into account all the possible

3
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:22,710
consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune
that might reverse your hard work and give

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,160
the glory to others. By planning to the end
you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,020
and you will know when to stop. Gently guide
fortune and help determine the future by thinking

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,550
far ahead.
Most men are ruled by the heart, not the head.

7
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,679
Their plans are vague, and when they meet
obstacles they improvise. But improvisation

8
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,719
will only bring you as far as the next crisis,
and is never a substitute for thinking several

9
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:56,089
steps ahead and planning to the end.
In 1863 the Prussian premier Otto von Bismarck

10
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:01,820
surveyed the chessboard of European power
as it then stood. The main players were England,

11
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:07,709
France, and Austria. Prussia itself was one
of several states in the loosely allied German

12
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:13,389
Federation. Austria, dominant member of the
Federation, made sure that the other German

13
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,010
states remained weak, divided and submissive.
Bismarck believed that Prussia was destined

14
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:24,850
for something far greater than being a servant
body to Austria. This is how Bismarck played

15
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:30,449
the game. His first move was to start a war
with lowly Denmark, in order to recover the

16
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:37,200
former Prussian lands of Schleswig-Holstein.
He knew that these rumblings of Prussian independence

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,640
might worry France and England, so he enlisted
Austria in the war, claiming that he was recovering

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,170
Schleswig-Holstein for their benefit. In a
few months, after the war was decoded. Bismarck

19
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,450
demanded that the newly conquered lands be
made part of Prussia. The Austrians of course

20
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,118
outraged, compromised. A year later they also
agreed in selling Holstein.

21
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:06,840
Bismarck's next move was his boldest: In 1866
he convinced King William of Prussia to withdraw

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,098
from the German Federation, and in doing so
to go to war with Austria itself. Altough

23
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:18,119
everyone opposed such a war, Bismarck succeeded
in forcing the conflict and Prussia's superior

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,849
army defeated the Austrians in the brutally
short Seven Weeks War. Bismarck kept going,

25
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:29,979
acquiring more lands for Prussia, even provoking
a war with France. The cycle would go on,

26
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:35,810
until almost mysteriously he stopped. The
other parties would wait in fear for his next

27
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,759
bold move, but there was no more. Bismarck
had planned his campaign all along, instead

28
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,959
of expanding further, he would now, as the
Prince of a greater Prussia, focus on securing

29
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,870
the newly acquired lands.
What good is it to have the greatest dream

30
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,480
in the world if others reap the benefits and
the glory? Never lose your head over a vague,

31
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:06,318
open-ended dream—plan to the end. The only
solution is to plan for the long run. Foresee

32
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,348
the future with as much clarity as the gods
on Mount Olympus, who look through the clouds

33
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:15,909
and see the ends of all things.
According to the cosmology of the ancient

34
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:21,128
Greeks, the gods were thought to have complete
vision into the future. They saw everything

35
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:26,719
to come, right down to the intricate details.
Men, on the other hand, were seen as victims

36
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:32,709
of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions,
unable to see beyond immediate dangers.

37
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:38,080
Heroes, such as Odysseus, who were able to
look beyond the present and plan several steps

38
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,390
ahead, seemed to defy fate, to approximate
the gods in their ability to determine the

39
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:47,988
future.
This comparison is still valid—those among

40
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:54,159
us who think further ahead and patiently bring
their plans to fruition seem to have a godlike

41
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,590
power.
And that is it for this law. Focus on the

42
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,750
ultimate goal, but don't forget the necessary
steps to get there. Be sure to check out Part
