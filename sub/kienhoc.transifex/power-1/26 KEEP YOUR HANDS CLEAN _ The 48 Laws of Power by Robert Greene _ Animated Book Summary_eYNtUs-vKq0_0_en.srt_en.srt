The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law Number 26: Keep Your Hands Clean

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,039
You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency:
Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,240
nasty deeds. Maintain such a spotless appearance
by using others as scapegoats and cat's-paws

4
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:28,059
to disguise your involvement.
Conceal Your Mistakes - Have a Scapegoat Around

5
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,949
To Take The Blame
Our good name and reputation depend more on

6
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,378
what we conceal than on what we reveal. Everyone
makes mistakes, but those who are truly clever

7
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:42,448
manage to hide them, and to make sure someone
else is blamed. A convenient scapegoat should

8
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:47,670
always be kept around for such moments.
Understanding the workings of power and the

9
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,769
importance of appearances shop around for
the most convenient head and have it served

10
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:56,478
up immediately.
Occasional mistakes are inevitable - Handle

11
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:59,649
Them
People of power are undone not by the mistakes

12
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:04,890
they make, but by the way they deal with them.
The mistake does not vanish with an apology;

13
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,219
it deepens and festers. Better to cut it off
instantly, distract attention from yourself,

14
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:17,459
and focus attention on a convenient scapegoat.
Do not give people time to ponder your responsibility

15
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,829
or your possible incompetence.
The bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems

16
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:28,549
a barbaric relic of the past, but the practice
lives on to this day, if indirectly and symbolically;

17
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,609
since power depends on appearances, and those
in power must seem never to make mistakes,

18
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:39,670
the use of scapegoats is as popular as ever.
Besides conveniently shifting blame, a scapegoat

19
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,409
can serve as a warning to others.
Example of Cesare Borgia:

20
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,609
Robert Greene took the following right out
of Niccolo Machiavelli’s “The Prince”.

21
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:54,439
Cesare Borgia used a scapegoat to gain control
of large parts of Italy. He gave Remirro de

22
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:00,429
Orco, a cruel and vigorous man, absolute powers.
With extreme violence he would enforce Cesare’s

23
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:06,310
rule with brutal justice and grow hated by
the local population. To guard his own reputation,

24
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,039
to avoid being associated with Orco’s gruesome
actions, to calm the people’s scream for

25
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,889
revenge he publicly stated that he had in
no way ordered Orco to do what he did and

26
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:22,009
imprisoned, beheaded and blamed him. Cesare
had painted a pleasing picture for the public,

27
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:27,689
who not only wished Orco’s death, but that
his cruelty be repaid. Next to his headless

28
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:33,579
body, Orco’s head was spiked up on a pike.
To quote Achilles fighting Hector at the temple

29
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,260
of the sungod “Why would I kill you now
young prince, if no one sees how you fall?”

30
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:46,169
Cesare built a spectacle for everyone to see.
Not only can you use other as scapegoats,

31
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:51,259
but you can make them your cat’s-paw.
In the fable, the Monkey grabs the paw of

32
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:56,439
his friend, the cat, and uses his paw to get
it to fish chestnuts out of the fire, so as

33
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,409
to get the nuts without hurting himself.
If there is something unpleasant or unpopular

34
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:06,719
that needs to be done, it is far too risky
for you to do the work yourself. You need

35
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,340
a cat’s-paw - someone who does the dirty
work for you. The cat’s-paw grabs what you

36
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,870
need, hurts whom you need hurt, and keeps
people from noticing that you are the one

37
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,620
responsible. Let someone else be the executioner,
or the bearer of bad news, while you bring

38
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,020
only joy and glad tidings.
Cleopatra was more than only a woman, she

39
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:33,319
was a queen, an empress, a goddess. Her appearance
would never be the same, only ever wearing

40
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:38,289
the nicest robes and accessories, probably
one of the most dangerous seductresses in

41
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:43,629
history; like many women still today, she
used her feminine qualities to get men to

42
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:47,739
do as she desired.
At the age of 10 she witnessed her father

43
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,700
Ptolemy XII get overthrown and banished by
her elder sisters. Berenice emerged as the

44
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:59,000
leader of the rebellion, had her other sisters
imprisoned and her own husband murdered to

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,818
secure her own rule. This extreme violence
on one of her own made the public resent her

46
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:09,679
and 4 years later Ptolemy could return, beheading
the elder sisters.

47
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,098
In 51. BC. Ptolemy died and left 4 remaining
children as heirs. The eldest son, the 11

48
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:22,219
years old Ptolemy XIII married the elder sister
Cleopatra. Incest was common in order to keep

49
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,590
royal positions and thus power in the family.
In a fight for power, Cleopatra was exiled.

50
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:33,888
None dared to make the same mistake as Berenice
by killing one of their own. It would inevitably

51
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:39,480
shed a dark light on the murderer. Therefore
Cleopatra bided her time and schemed.

52
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,480
When she heard of Julius Caesar’s plan to
make Egypt a Roman colony, she arranged to

53
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,520
see him, seducing and thereafter using him
as a tool to destroy her siblings and other

54
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:55,299
enemies to get the throne for herself. In
41. BC she would use the same tactics on Marc

55
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,829
Antony. She was able to reduce both of these
very powerful and dangerous men to her cat’s-paws,

56
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:06,639
doing exactly what she wanted them to.
That’s it for this law, however there is

57
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
an additional lesson for men to be learnt
here:

58
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,160
Even a great man such as Julius Caesar was
tamed by feminine charm. Be wary of the Cleopatra’s

59
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,290
in today’s society – their numbers have
grown enormously, while the odds for men to

60
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,330
become a Caesar are constantly diminishing.
As always, thanks’ for watching.
