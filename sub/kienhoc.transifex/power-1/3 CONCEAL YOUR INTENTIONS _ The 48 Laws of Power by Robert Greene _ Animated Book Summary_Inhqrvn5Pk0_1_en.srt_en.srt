The 48 Laws of Power

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,460
by Robert Greene | Law no. 3: Conceal Your Intentions

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,509
Have you ever heard of a skillful general,

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,320
who intends to surprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy?

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,698
Conceal your purpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of

7
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:24,160
your designs until they cannot be opposed,

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,789
until the combat is over. Win the victory before you declare the war.

9
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:33,769
In a word, imitate those war like people whose designs are not known except by

10
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:35,210
the ravaged country

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,929
through which they have passed. (Ninon de Lenclos)

12
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:42,210
It takes effort to control your tongue and monitor what you reveal.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,378
It is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what they want to

14
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:46,919
hear

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,489
rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or think.

16
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:54,929
More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so predictable

17
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,340
and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you,

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,770
and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,109
Train yourself in the art of concealing your intentions.

20
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,368
Master the art and you will always have the upper hand.

21
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:13,670
Our first instinct is to always trust appearances.

22
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,549
This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal one's intentions.

23
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,180
Let's talk about how People Conceal Intentions and Fool You.

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,979
Use Decoyed Objects of Desire to Throw People Off

25
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:29,920
Support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments but will

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,509
help you achieve your goal.

27
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:36,239
Use this tactic in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by closing up

28
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,649
(with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspicious)

29
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,228
but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals!

30
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,609
—just not your real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone:

31
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:50,810
You appear friendly, open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions;

32
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,019
and you send your rivals on time-consuming wild-goose chases.

33
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,349
False Sincerity: People easily mistake sincerity for honesty.

34
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:03,569
Remember—their first instinct is to trust appearances, and since they value

35
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,699
honesty and want to believe in the honesty of those around them,

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,780
they will rarely doubt you or see through your act.

37
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,989
Seeming to believe what you say gives your words great weight.

38
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,170
Remember: The best deceivers do everything

39
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,379
they can to cloak their roguish qualities. They cultivate an air of

40
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,030
honesty in one area to disguise their dishonesty in other.

41
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,750
Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal of weapons.

42
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,219
Bland Facial Expression: Behind a bland,

43
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:34,120
unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned,

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,280
without detection. This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,650
learned to perfect.

46
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,700
Noble Gesture: People want to believe apparently noble gestures

47
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:48,039
are genuine, for the belief is pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive

48
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,419
these gestures can be. Appearing to Belong to a Group:

49
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,639
The tendency to mistake appearances for reality—the feeling that if someone

50
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,229
seems to belong to your group,

51
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:02,349
their belonging must be real. This habit makes the seamless blend a very effective

52
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,289
front.

53
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:06,840
The trick is simple: You simply blend in with those around you.

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,939
The better you blend, the less suspicious you become.

55
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:14,430
Remember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors,

56
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,530
to put on the mask of the inconspicuous.

57
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,909
Do not despair at having to wear such a bland mask

58
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,430
—it is often your unreadability that draws people to you

59
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,189
and makes you appear a person of power.
But, How do People Apply these Ways to

60
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:30,060
Fool You?

61
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,090
Simply dangle an object you seem to desire,

62
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,370
a goal you seem to aim for, in front of people's eyes and they will take the

63
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,620
appearance for reality.

64
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,009
Once their eyes focus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what you are really up to

65
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,140
Politicians use this all the time. Our
first historical example would be

66
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,199
Decoyed Objects of Desire and Making a Woman Fall in Love

67
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,389
The Marquis de Sevigne was inexperienced in the art of love.

68
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,399
He confided in the infamous courtesan of seventeenth-century France,

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,230
Ninon de Lenclos, to instruct him on how to seduce a difficult young countess.

70
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:09,310
She made him follow a plan over a number of weeks,

71
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,310
where the Marquis would be appearing in public always surrounded by beautiful

72
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,970
women, in the very places the countess would be expected to see him.

73
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,030
He was supposed to assume an air of nonchalance.

74
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,728
This increased the jealousy of the young countess, who was not sure of his interest

75
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:24,279
in her.

76
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,489
One day the Marquis, unable to control his passion,

77
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,980
broke from Ninon’s plan, and blurted out to the countess that he loved her.

78
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,040
After this admission, the countess no longer found him interesting and avoided

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,420
him.

80
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,890
The whole premise of dating is based on games, wild moves

81
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,579
and being unpredictable. If you display your feelings too soon it becomes an

82
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:45,879
artless show of passion.

83
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,329
A door closed that would never open again. In seduction, set up conflicting

84
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,849
signals, such as desire and indifference,

85
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,570
and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame their desire to possess you.

86
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,699
Another example: Otto von Bismarck

87
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:05,579
became prime minister of Prussia. Otto
von Bismarck was a deputy the Prussian

88
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:09,490
parliament at a time when many fellow deputies thought it was possible to go

89
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,250
to war against

90
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,480
Austria and defeat it. Bismarck wanted to go to war

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,460
but he knew that the King was not in favour of it. He also knew the Prussian

92
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,560
army was not prepared, so he devised a clever way.

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,019
He publicly stated his praises for the Austrians and talked about the madness

94
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:25,719
of war.

95
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,840
Many deputies changed their votes. Had Bismarck

96
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,750
announced his real intentions, arguing it was better to wait now and

97
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,339
fight later, he would not have won. Most Prussians wanted to go to war at that

98
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,239
moment and mistakenly believed

99
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,189
their army to be superior to the Austrians. Had he gone to the king his

100
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,060
sincerity would have been doubted.

101
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,750
By giving misleading statements about wanting peace and concealing his true

102
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,449
purpose,

103
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,189
Bismarck’s speech catapulted him to the position of prime minister.

104
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:56,410
He later led the country to war against the Austrians

105
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,780
at the right time, when he felt the Prussian army was more capable

106
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,798
and united with Germany.

107
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:06,138
Yet another example: the Duke of
Marlborough use this in the Spanish

108
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,019
Succession

109
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,278
During the War of the Spanish Succession
in 1711

110
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:13,298
the Duke of Marlborough, head of the
English army

111
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:17,778
wanted to destroy a key French fort, because it protected a vital thoroughfare

112
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:21,988
into France. Yet he knew that if he destroyed it, the French would realize

113
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:22,848
what he wanted

114
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:27,858
—to advance down that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned

115
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,718
it with some of his troops,

116
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:33,288
making it appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of his own.

117
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:36,889
The French attacked the fort and the duke let them recapture it.

118
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,549
Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had wanted it for

119
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:43,028
some important reason.

120
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:47,178
Now that the fort was gone, the road was unprotected, and Marlborough could

121
00:06:47,178 --> 00:06:50,788
easily march into France. Henry Kissinger

122
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:55,738
used Bland Face to win opponents: Henry Kissinger would bore his opponents around

123
00:06:55,738 --> 00:07:00,209
the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice, his blank look,

124
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,598
his endless recitations of details; then,

125
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,709
as their eyes glazed over, he would suddenly hit

126
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,749
them with a list of bold terms. Caught off-guard,

127
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:14,989
they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains it,

128
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:18,798
"While playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor.

129
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:22,588
Instead he practices a bland behavior that minimizes readable

130
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:27,329
patterns, frustrates and confuses opponents, permits greater concentration."

131
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:31,358
Spies use "Appearing to Belong to a Group" Method:

132
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:34,588
During the Cold War of the 1950s and '60s,

133
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:38,298
as is now notorious, a slew of British civil servants

134
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:42,738
passed secrets to the Soviets. They went undetected for years because they were

135
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,048
apparently decent

136
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:48,769
chaps, had gone to all the right schools, and fit the old-boy network perfectly.

137
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:53,489
So I paid close attention to all the feedback I've received from you guys

138
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:56,908
and switched up the reviewing of the book's content to a great deal.

139
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:59,918
I hope you like it better this way.

140
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,049
Please let me know and thanks for watching.

141
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,620
 

142
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,019
 

143
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,698
 

144
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,540
the put on mat it is - what the fuck is that sentence

145
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,150
be measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put on mat

146
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:24,888
it is. I'm not putting this in.
