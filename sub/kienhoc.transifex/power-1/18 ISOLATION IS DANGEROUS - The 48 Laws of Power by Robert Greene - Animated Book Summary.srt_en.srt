(ko chuáº©n láº¯m, nhÆ°ng Ä‘á»§ chuáº©n)
the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene
law number 18

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,450
isolation is dangerous the world is
dangerous and enemies are everywhere

3
00:00:14,19 --> 00:00:19,119
everyone has to protect themselves a
fortress seems the safest but isolation

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,910
exposes you to more dangerous than it
protects you from

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,869
it cuts you off from valuable
information it makes you conspicuous and

6
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:26,919
an easy target

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,460
Better to circulate among people find
allies and mingle

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,420
you are shielded from your enemies by
the crowd. There's five dangerous that

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,620
isolation brings. You lose contact with
the sources of your power

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,570
You lose your ear for what is happening
around you you lose your sense of proportion.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,410
you cut yourself off from the kind of
knowledge on with your life depends

13
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,879
you cannot hear what is happening around
you including the plots against you

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,870
it becomes harder to break out of your
isolation when you choose to it sinks

15
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,900
you deep into its quicksand without your
noticing

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,850
compare and contrast the lives of Tan Thuy Hoang
the first emperor of China and Louis 14.

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,719
After outlawing the
writings and teachings of the great

18
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,859
philosopher Confucius, Tan Thuy Hoang made
many enemies and he grew constantly

19
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,689
afraid and even paranoid

20
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:17,499
Louis 14 on the other hand very early
grasp the truth that for a king to

21
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:19,689
isolate himself is greatly dangerous

22
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:22,928
the Emperor withdrew deeper and deeper
interest palace to protect themselves

23
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:25,420
and he slowly lost control of the realm

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,320
He slept in a different room every night
and anyone who inadvertently laid eyes

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,329
on him was instantly beheaded

26
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,380
king Louis's bedroom occupied the literal
center of the palace of both sides and

27
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,710
was the focus of everyone's attention.
Due to his absence

28
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,149
Tan Thuy Hoang it duoc nghe den and ministers and
active political policies without his

29
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:46,539
approval or even his knowledge and also
plotted against him

30
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:50,200
Louis 14 knew that if he was absent
conspiracies would spring up like

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,880
mushrooms after rain animosities will
crystallize into factions and rebellion

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,929
will break out before he has the time to
react. Tan Thuy Hoang travel incognito

33
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:01,420
disguising himself carefully

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,159
on one such trip through the provinces
he suddenly died he died alone far from

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,869
his wife's his family his friends and
his courtiers accompanied only by a

36
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,970
minister and a handful of tÃ¹ nhÃ¢n(?).

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,370
Some speculate that he was poisoned by
the same

38
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,840
scheming ministers who encouraged
his isolation. Louis 14 on the opposite built

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,730
the Palace of Versailles where
everything and everyone's focus was on him

41
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:27,909
these conditions at last I lasted for
Lewis aunt Irene some 50 years of

42
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:31,870
relative peace and tranquility through
it all not a pin drop without ever

43
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,829
hearing it.

44
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:37,239
Place yourself at the center of activity
you should be aware of everything

45
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,19
happening on the street and off anyone
who might be hatching plots against you

46
00:02:41,19 --> 00:02:42,879
Do not feel threatened

47
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,780
this is a dangerous way to start
becoming paranoid do not retreat and

48
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,430
close ranks to find security in a kind
of fortress fight the desire to turn

49
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,959
inward do not rely on information from a
small circle and lose perspective on

50
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,319
events around you do not lose
maneuverability and become an easy

51
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,220
target

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,720
as in warfare and most games of strategy
isolation often precedes defeat and

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,40
death make yourself more accessible seek
out all the Allies and make new ones

54
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:13,239
force yourself into more and more
different circles if you need time to

55
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,980
think then choose isolation only as a
last resort and only in small doses.

56
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,69
Be careful to keep your way back into
society open

57
00:03:21,69 --> 00:03:24,970
you need to be permeable able to flow in
and out of different circles and mix

58
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,840
with different types that kind of
mobility and social contact will protect

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,829
you from plotters, who will be unable to keep
secrets from you, and from your enemies

60
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,910
who will be unable to isolate you from your
allies. Always on the move

61
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,99
you mix and mingle in the rooms of the
palace never sitting or something in one place

63
00:03:42,99 --> 00:03:45,910
no hunter can fix the same on such a
swift-moving creature

64
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,840
now this lies personally what I really
struggle with because i am really

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,329
interested right I've always been this
way

66
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:57,669
I am most comfortable in my head and my
thoughts where everything makes sense

67
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:03,639
right and if i were to unload all my
information that is being processed and

68
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,530
a very special technique rate whatever
you want to call it on to you

69
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,579
you would probably need a therapist for
life I'm kidding but although I'm

70
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:13,299
insured

71
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,168
I enjoy being around friends around
people who I can talk to who I can share

72
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,918
my thoughts with. But me personally I
just need some kind of distance

73
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,690
especially when I'm in work mode

74
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,320
when I am really just killing it you
know whether that is five to seven

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,360
workouts a week doing my workouts
meditating nutrition and sleeping and

76
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,680
all that stuff but sooner or later i
have to see a different face, a face at

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,330
all because all this just staring at a
computer and a laptop at the piece of

78
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,380
paper and just working you get pretty
antisocial you lose touch with people

79
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,580
you you're not out there anymore and
it's just negative and a lot of waste.

80
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,90
that's why I'm really relieved that in a
few weeks I'll be going on holidays to

81
00:04:52,90 --> 00:04:55,690
finally see my relatives again see how
they're doing and I just couldn't go

82
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,250
there for four years

83
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,520
maybe it's because of school or
universities or work

84
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,799
whatever it was always you know doing
something for somebody else's benefit

85
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,320
and i'm done with that, I've made the decision

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,920
I'm gonna be my own boss I'm going to
work for myself I'm going to express

87
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,770
that that others are trying to suppress
right

88
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,400
I mean I had friends that I distance
myself from that I had to distance

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,440
myself from because I would read the
book the 48 laws of power for example in

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,860
school during lunch time and they would
give me shit about it

91
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,790
I'm serious they would call me a bookworm
or something like that and I pretty

92
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:36,40
early came to the decision that this guy
is a moron and not really helping me

93
00:05:36,40 --> 00:05:40,120
he's trying to keep me down with that
common these so-called friends see you

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,740
developing yourself

95
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,430
advancing constantly while they're
keeping themselves at their low level

96
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,80
getting wasted every weekend and doing
drugs and whatnot just surround yourself

97
00:05:50,80 --> 00:05:51,820
with people that you want to be like

98
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,200
and funny enough when I distance myself
from these negative naysayers haters

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,680
whatever you want to call them as I
believe like attracts like

100
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,910
I found new friends with the same
interests as me who were also passionate

101
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,169
about reading such books and working out
and talking about nutrition and

102
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,99
meditation and how to build your own
business you know being entrepreneurial

103
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,400
and and really just killing it in life

104
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,570
and that's what I want to be like I know
I kind of went off topic here but I just

105
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,599
really had to share this fox with you
and you might have a different opinion

106
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,229
that's awesome dude just let's talk
about it in the comments on Twitter

107
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,99
I don't care let's just I want to get
discussions going on to my videos that

108
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,560

second of all I want to understand where

111
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,20
you're coming from what you're doing in
your life and how you use these laws

112
00:06:43,20 --> 00:06:47,580
so if you're down for a chat just common
I'm here all night baby we can talk at

113
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,90
this point it's really easy to answer to
every comment because there's not a lot

114
00:06:51,90 --> 00:06:52,919
of them that may change right

115
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,960
I will try but let's not get that far
into the future already and to sum it
