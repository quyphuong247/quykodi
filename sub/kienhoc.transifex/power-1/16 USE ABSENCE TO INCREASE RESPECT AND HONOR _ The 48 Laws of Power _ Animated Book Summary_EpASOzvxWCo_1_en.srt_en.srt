The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,580
Law no. 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,359
Too much circulation makes the price go
down: the more you're seen and heard from,

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,899
the more common you appear.

6
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:20,858
If you're already established in a group,
temporary withdrawal from it will make

7
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:21,920
you more talked-about,

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,618
even more admired. You must learn when to
leave. Create value through scarcity.

9
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:29,899
At the start of an affair, you need to heighten your presence in the eyes

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:30,459
of the other.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,109
If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten. But once your lover's

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,200
emotions are engaged, and the feeling of love has crystallized, absence inflames

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,080
and excites.

14
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,179
Giving no reason for your absence excites even more:

15
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,240
The other person assumes he or she is at fault.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,400
While you are away, the lover's imagination takes flight, and a

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,509
stimulated imagination cannot help but make love grow stronger.

18
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:55,869
Conversely, when you become too present, too accessible,

19
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:59,849
leaving no room for the imagination, the more you pursue, the less they love you.

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,780
... that's why when I don't write back in a
week she's already nagging and

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,829
you know givng me shit about it I'm sure
you know that

22
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:11,819
we're busy growing our empire right? - What withdraws, what becomes scarce,

23
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,288
suddenly seems to deserve our respect and honor. What stays

24
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:18,998
too long, inundating us with its presence, makes us disdain it.

25
00:01:18,998 --> 00:01:22,769
Take the romance of Sir Guillaume de Balaun and Madame Guillelma de Javiac.

26
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,459
(...) I'm just going to call her GELMA

27
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:31,269
Guillelma de Javiac. Guillaume was the perfect knight,

28
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:35,569
who wrote poetry and songs to Madame Guillelma. She fell deeply in love with him,

29
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,269
but because he wanted to feel the ultimate bliss that comes with

30
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,989
reconciliation after a quarrel,

31
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:44,888
he feigned great anger with her and left. In order for his plan to work,

32
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:48,938
she would have to be upset with him, but his leaving only made her long for him

33
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:49,449
more,

34
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,990
so his plan, in essence, had backfired.

35
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:55,599
When he saw her again, he drove her away with harsh words and threatening

36
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,030
gestures that she vowed

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,280
never to see him again. He regretted what he had done so he rode to Javiac,

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,219
but the lady would not receive him, and ordered her servants to chase him away.

39
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,310
Over the next year, Sir Guillaume wrote many letters and poems to her and was

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,590
miserable without her.

41
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,340
She finally forgave him and this is when he finally experienced the joy that comes

42
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,140
with reconciliation after a quarrel.

43
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,679
Okay... picking up women and the late

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,349
middle-age, what the hell. Absence diminishes minor passions and inflames

45
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,109
great ones, as the wind douses a candle and fans a fire.

46
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,540
La Rochefoucauld. Here are The 10 Games of Hide-and-Seek

47
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:34,629
A strong presence will draw power and attention to you.

48
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,900
Shine more brightly than those around you.

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,080
Too much presence creates the opposite effect:

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,850
The more you are seen and heard from, the more your value degrades.

51
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:48,019
You must learn to withdraw yourself before you are unconsciously pushed away.

52
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,659
Starve the other person of your presence.
Force their respect by threatening

53
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:55,568
the possibility that they will lose you for good.

54
00:02:55,568 --> 00:03:00,078
By completely withdrawing for a while, you create a kind of death before death.

55
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,849
When you come back, it will be as if you had come back from the dead.

56
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,030
And lastly an air of resurrection will cling to you,

57
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,079
and people will be relieved at your return. The Other Side of the Coin

58
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:16,099
This law only applies once a certain level of power

59
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,349
has been attained.

60
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,530
The need to withdraw only comes after you have established your presence;

61
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,009
leave too early and you do not increase your respect, you are simply

62
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:25,819
forgotten.

63
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,519
When you are first entering onto the world's stage, create an image that is

64
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,549
recognizable,

65
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:34,030
reproducible, and is seen everywhere. Until that status

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,539
Until that status is attained, absence is dangerousâ€”instead of fanning the flames,

67
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:41,819
it will extinguish them. So, that's it for
this law. If you like the video watch the

69
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,849
subscribe and do all that stuff, because
that helps my channel out to a great

70
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:46,299
deal.

71
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:47,340
Thanks a lot and

72
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,170
I'll see you tasty little lemon drops
tomorrow, where we continue our important

73
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:51,938
work.

74
00:03:51,938 --> 00:04:00,979
Totally improvised ending. Alright.

75
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:04,209
 

76
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,270
