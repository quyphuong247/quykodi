The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 34: Be Royal in Your Own Fashion

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,289
- Act Like A King
The way you carry yourself will often determine

3
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:20,820
how you are treated: In the long run, appearing
vulgar or common will make people disrespect

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,410
you. For a king respects himself and inspires
the same sentiment in others. By acting regally

5
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,570
and confident of your powers, you make yourself
seem destined to wear a crown.

6
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,850
Powerful people may be tempted to affect a
common-man aura, trying to create the illusion

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,399
that they and their subjects or underlings
are basically the same. But the people whom

8
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,000
this false gesture is intended to impress
will quickly see through it. They understand

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,658
that they are not being given more power—that
it only appears as if they shared in the powerful

10
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:53,030
person's fate.
Leaders who try to dissolve that distance

11
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,100
through a false chumminess gradually lose
their ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,600
love. Instead they elicit contempt, they are
too uninspiring even to be worth the guillotine—the

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,700
best they can do is simply vanish in the night,
as if they were never there.

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,310
When Christopher Columbus was trying to find
funding for his legendary voyages, many around

15
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,269
him believed he came from the Italian aristocracy,
a descendant from the legendary Roman general

16
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:23,780
Colonius. An illustrious background indeed.
But it was nothing more than illustrious fantasy,

17
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,780
for Columbus was actually the son of Domenico
Colombo, a weaver, who held a wine shop and

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,670
had made a living selling cheese. Columbus
himself had created the myth of his noble

19
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,019
background, for he felt that he had a kind
of royalty in his blood, destined for greatness.

20
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:44,449
Using the fabricated story of his noble background,
he married into an established Lisbon family

21
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,719
that had excellent connections with Portguguese
royalty. Using his in-laws he managed to have

22
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:54,818
a meeting with the King of Portugal, whom
he petitioned to finance a westward voyage

23
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,748
aimed at discovering a shorter route to Asia,
which he would do in the King's name, demanding

24
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:05,289
incredibly bold hereditary rights for himself.
He shall be titled the Grand Admiral of the

25
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:11,719
Oceanic Sea, the office of viceroy over any
lands he found and 10 percent of the future

26
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,598
commerce with such lands. Columbus made these
demands even though he had previously been

27
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:21,949
a mere merchant, he knew almost nothing about
navigation, he could not work a quadrant and

28
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:26,500
he had never led a group of men. Altough the
king refused with a smile, he treated his

29
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,150
demands as legitimate, leaving the door open
for the future.

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,700
By asking for the moon, he had instantly raised
his own status, for the king assumed that

31
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:39,639
unless a man who set such a high price on
himself were mad, which Columbus did not appear

32
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,988
to be, he must somehow be worth it.
Unlike Columbus, here's what WE generally

33
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:47,980
tend to do...
1. We set up boundaries that only get firmer

34
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:50,250
with time.
2. We come to expect less from the world.

35
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,150
3. We accept limitations that are really self-imposed.
4. We bow and scrape and apologize for even

36
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,408
the simplest of requests.
The Solution for these are;

37
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,709
1. We have to deliberately force ourselves
in the opposite direction.

38
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,390
2. Downplay the failures and ignore the limitations.
3. Make ourselves demand and expect as much

39
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,899
as a child.
This Strategy of the Crown is

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,269
1. Based on a simple chain of cause and effect.
2. If we believe we are destined for great

41
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:19,120
things, our belief will radiate outward.
3. This outward radiance will infect the people

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,650
around you.
4. Your limits and boundaries disappear.

43
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,760
5. You will be surprised how often it bears
fruit.

44
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,818
6. Be overcome by your self-belief.
Even while you know you are practicing a kind

45
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:34,828
of deception on yourself. Act like a king
or queen and you are likely to be treated

46
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:41,370
as one.
The Difference of this strategy is that;

47
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,000
1. The crown may separate you from other people.
2. It is up to you to make that separation

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,489
real.
3. You have to act differently, demonstrating

49
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,500
your distance from those around you. One way
to emphasize your difference is to always

50
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,030
act with dignity, no matter the circumstance.
5. Do not confuse regal bearing with arrogance,

51
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,500
it betrays insecurity.
Greene mentions 3 Strategies to Reinforce

52
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,628
a Royal Demeanor
The first would be A. The Columbus Strategy:

53
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,560
1. Always make a bold demand.
2. Set your price high.

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,170
3. Do not waver.
B. The David and Goliath Strategy:

55
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,349
1. In a dignified way, go after the highest
person in the building.

56
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,620
2. By choosing a great opponent, you create
the appearance of greatness.

57
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,519
3. This puts you on the same plane as the
chief executive you are attacking.

58
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,359
And lastly C. The Gift Strategy:
1. Give a gift of some sort to those above

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,699
you.
2. By giving your patron a gift, you are saying

60
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,789
that the two of you are equal.
3. It is the old con game of giving so that

61
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,460
you can take.
The gift strategy is subtle and brilliant

62
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:41,579
because you do not beg: You ask for help in
a dignified way that implies equality between

63
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,750
two people, one of whom just happens to have
more money.

64
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,180
Remember: It is up to you to set your own
price. Ask for less and that is just what

65
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,889
you will get. Ask for more, however, and you
send a signal that you are worth a king's

66
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,459
ransom. Even those who turn you down respect
you for your confidence, and that respect

67
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,539
will eventually pay off in ways you cannot
imagine.

68
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,490
But obviously there's a risk of reversal to
this, so be warned...

69
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:12,160
The idea behind the assumption of regal confidence
is to set yourself apart from other people,

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,670
but if you take this too far it will be your
undoing. Never make the mistake of thinking

71
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:22,000
that you elevate yourself by humiliating people.
Also, it is never a good idea to loom too

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,240
high above the crowd - you make an easy target.
And there are times when an aristocratic pose

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,480
is eminently dangerous.
Finally, it is true that you can sometimes

74
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,180
find some power through affecting a kind of
earthy vulgarity, which will prove amusing

75
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,670
by its extremeness. Separating yourself from
other people by appearing even more vulgar

76
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,540
than they are, this game is dangerous: There
will always be people more vulgar than you,

77
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,800
and you will easily be replaced the following
season by someone younger and worse.

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,400
And that is it for this law, set your price
high from the start and confidently own up

79
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,269
to it. And as always, thank's for watching.
