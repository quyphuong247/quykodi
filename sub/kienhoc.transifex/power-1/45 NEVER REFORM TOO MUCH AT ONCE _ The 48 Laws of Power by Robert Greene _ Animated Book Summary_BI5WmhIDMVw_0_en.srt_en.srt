00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:13,690
The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law 45: Preach Change But Never Reform Quickly

2
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:18,189
Everyone understands the need for change in
the abstract, but on the day-to-day level

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:23,520
people are creatures of habit. Too much innovation
is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,050
you are new to a position of power, or an
outsider trying to build a power base, make

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,090
a show of respecting the old way of doing
things. If change is necessary, make it feel

6
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:41,000
like a gentle improvement on the past.
Sometime in the early 1520s, King Henry VIII

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,009
of England decided to divorce his wife, Catherine
of Aragon, because she had failed to bear

8
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:52,250
him a son, and because he had fallen in love
with the young and comely Anne Boleyn. The

9
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,149
pope opposed the divorce, and threatened the
king with excommunication. The king’s most

10
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,649
powerful minister, Cardinal Wolsey, also saw
no need for divorce—and his halfhearted

11
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,899
support of the king cost him his position
and soon his life.

12
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:11,820
One man in Henry’s cabinet, Thomas Cromwell,
not only supported him in his desire for a

13
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:17,579
divorce but had an idea for realizing it:
a complete break with the past. He convinced

14
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,530
the king that by severing ties with Rome and
making himself the head of a newly formed

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,340
English church, he could divorce Catherine
and marry Anne. By 1531 Henry saw this as

16
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,549
the only solution. To reward Cromwell for
his simple but brilliant idea, he elevated

17
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:38,110
this son of a blacksmith to the post of royal
councillor.

18
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:44,159
So far, as we've seen in Law 36: Disdain Things
You Cannot Have, this strategy was a great

19
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,950
success. King Henry successfully impregnated
his new, fertile wife and could now rest assured

20
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,950
his legacy would carry on. But this new character,
Thomas Cromwell - he wasn't in any way subtle

21
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,840
about his approach. He envisioned a new Protestant
order in England, with the power of the Catholic

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,719
Church smashed and its vast wealth in the
hands of the king and the government. And

23
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,408
his ways of going about it were unabashedly
bold. He began to seize the holdings of the

24
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:16,449
churches and monasteries of England, putting
them out of existence one by one. Virtually

25
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:20,199
overnight, England was converted to a new
official religion.

26
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,780
A terror fell on the country. Some people
had suffered under the Catholic Church, which

27
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,009
before the reforms had been immensely powerful,
but most Britons had strong ties to Catholicism

28
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:35,530
and to its comforting rituals. They watched
in horror as churches were demolished, images

29
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,890
of the Madonna and saints were broken in pieces,
stained-glass windows were smashed, and the

30
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:46,949
churches’ treasures were confiscated.
1535 powerful revolts in the North of England

31
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:51,689
threatened to topple Henry from his throne.
By the following year he had suppressed the

32
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:57,680
rebellions, but he had also begun to see the
costs of Cromwell’s reforms. The king himself

33
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,939
had never wanted to go this far—he had only
wanted a divorce.

34
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:09,239
Consequences of Change
1. The man who initiates strong reforms often

35
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,870
becomes the scapegoat for any kind of dissatisfaction.
2. Eventually the reaction to your reforms

36
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,599
may consume you, for change is upsetting to
the human animal, even when it is for the

37
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,039
good.
You can see this, for example, with the youtube

38
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:29,400
comment section. When it actually improved,
but people were still upset, because change

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,099
is generally a wish people have, but dislike
when it's happening. Ironic, to say the least.

40
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,900
· The world is and always has been full of
insecurity and threat.

41
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,599
· We latch on to familiar faces and create
habits and rituals to make the world more

42
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:47,259
comfortable.
3. Change can be pleasant and even sometimes

43
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:52,689
desirable in the abstract, but too much of
it creates an anxiety that will stir and boil

44
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,829
beneath the surface and then eventually erupt.
You are Not a Psychic but Anticipation is

45
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:54,900
a Good Thing
1. Never underestimate the hidden conservatism

46
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,349
of those around you. It is powerful and entrenched.
2. Never let the seductive charms of an idea

47
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:55,419
cloud your reason:
3. You cannot make people see the world your

48
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:55,458
way.
4. You cannot wrench them into the future

49
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:55,530
with painful changes. They will rebel.
5. If reform is necessary, anticipate the

50
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:55,598
reaction against it and find ways to disguise
the change and sweeten the poison.

51
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:55,658
The Powerful Past
1. What has happened before seems greater;

52
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:55,719
habit and history give any act weight.
· Use this to your advantage.

53
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:55,780
2. When you destroy the familiar you create
a void or vacuum.

54
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:55,840
· People fear the chaos that will flood in
to fill it.

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:55,900
3. You must avoid stirring up such fears at
all cost.

56
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:55,969
4. Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the
past, however remote, to create a comforting

57
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,030
and familiar presence.
· This will give your actions romantic associations,

58
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,098
add to your presence, and cloak the nature
of the changes you are attempting.

59
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:56,189
5. The fact that the past is dead and buried
gives you the freedom to reinterpret it. To

60
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:56,289
support your cause, tinker with the facts.
6. The past is a text in which you can safely

61
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:59,060
insert your own lines.
So, how does one approach times of reforming

62
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,780
change?
1. A simple gesture like using an old title

63
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,090
or keeping the same number for a group will
tie you to the past and support you with the

64
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,878
authority of history.
2. Make a loud and public display of support

65
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,280
for the values of the past.
3. Seem to be a zealot for tradition and few

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,988
will notice how unconventional you really
are.

67
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:22,329
4. Quietly enact a radical change, while appearing
to safeguard tradition.

68
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,519
5. The changes you make must seem less innovative
than they are.

69
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,728
· If your reform is too far ahead of its
time, few will understand it, and it will

70
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:36,740
stir up anxiety and be hopelessly misinterpreted.
6. If you work in a tumultuous time, there

71
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,588
is power to be gained by preaching a return
to the past, to comfort, tradition, and ritual.

72
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:48,658
7. During a period of stagnation, on the other
hand, play the card of reform and revolution—but

73
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:52,879
beware of what you stir up.
· Those who finish a revolution are rarely

74
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,218
those who start it. You will not succeed at
this dangerous game unless you are willing

75
00:04:57,218 --> 00:05:02,418
to forestall the inevitable reaction against
it by playing with appearances and building

76
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:04,990
on the past.
As always be warned

77
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,829
· The past is a corpse to be used as you
see fit.

78
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:13,338
· If what happened in the recent past was
painful and harsh, it is self-destructive

79
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:18,249
to associate yourself with it.
· Even an ugly recent history will seem preferable

80
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:22,409
to an empty space.
· Fill that space immediately with new rituals

81
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:25,509
and forms.
· Soothing and growing familiar, these will

82
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:31,408
secure your position among the masses.
The perfect example, once again, is, as detailed

83
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:37,598
in Law 26: Keep Your Hands Clean, Cesare Borgia,
who was facing a great disdain from the populus

84
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:42,009
for all the gruesome actions that had come
with his ascent to the throne. They wanted

85
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:47,069
immediate change or a revolution would've
broken out. Cesare picked up on that, blamed

86
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:52,050
Remiro Di Orco, made a public display of his
spiked up head, then went on to throw many

87
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,528
balls, fetes, hand out food - basically appear
like a saint. In short, he calmed the people

88
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:04,509
who had wanted his downfall with prompt change
and strategic generosity as seen in Law 40

89
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:10,439
with Louis XIV, by leaving the dark past behind
and announcing the good times that lie ahead

90
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,189
but we'll talk more about Cesare Borgia in
an upcoming video on 'Il Principe' by the

91
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:21,409
Lord of Darkness himself, Niccolo Machiavelli.
As always thanks for watching!
