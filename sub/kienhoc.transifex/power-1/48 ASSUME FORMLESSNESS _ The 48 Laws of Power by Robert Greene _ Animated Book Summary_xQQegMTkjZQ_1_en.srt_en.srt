The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law 48: Assume Formlessness

2
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:19,300
By taking a shape, by having a visible plan,
you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,588
a form for your enemy to grasp keep yourself
adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact

4
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:29,268
that nothing is certain and no law is fixed.
The best way to protect yourself is to be

5
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:35,179
as fluid and formless as water; never bet
on stability or lasting order. Everything

6
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:41,070
changes.
When a Spartan boy reached the age of seven,

7
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,829
he was taken from his mother and placed in
a military club where he was trained to fight

8
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:51,599
and underwent the strictest discipline. The
boys slept on beds of reeds; they were allotted

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,500
only one outer garment to wear for an entire
year. They studied none of the arts, music

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,210
was banned and only slaves were permitted
to practice the crafts that were necessary

11
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,750
to sustain them.
The only skills the Spartans taught were those

12
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,469
of warfare. Children seen as weaklings were
left to die in a cavern in the mountains.

13
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:17,650
No system of money or trading was allowed
in Sparta; acquired wealth, they believed,

14
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:24,260
would sow selfishness and dissension, weakening
their warrior discipline. Sparta was a society

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,939
dedicated to the art of war. Spartans would
be tougher, stronger, and fiercer than their

16
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,519
neighbors. This was the only way they could
ensure their stability and survival.

17
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:41,429
The Spartans’ single-mindedness allowed
them to forge the most powerful infantry in

18
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,490
the world. They marched in perfect order and
fought with incomparable bravery. Their tight-knit

19
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:52,429
phalanxes could vanquish an army ten times
their size, as they proved in defeating the

20
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,260
Persians at Thermopylae. A Spartan column
on the march would strike terror in the enemy;

21
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,840
it seemed to have no weaknesses.
Yet although the Spartans proved themselves

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,280
mighty warriors, they had no interest in creating
an empire. They only wanted to keep what they

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,390
had already conquered and to defend it against
invaders. Decades would pass without a single

24
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:21,579
change in the system that had succeeded so
well in preserving Sparta’s status quo.

25
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,760
At the same time that the Spartans were evolving
their warlike culture, Athens was rising to

26
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:32,370
equal prominence. They took the sea, became
great merchants and spread their currency

27
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,709
throughout the Mediterranean.
Unlike the rigid Spartans, the Athenians responded

28
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,509
to every problem with consummate creativity,
adapting to the occasion and creating new

29
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:48,729
social forms and new arts at an incredible
pace. Their society was in constant flux.

30
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:55,659
In 431 B.C., the war that had been brewing
between Athens and Sparta for so long finally

31
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:00,568
erupted. It lasted twenty-seven years, but
after many twists of fortune, the Spartan

32
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:07,348
war machine finally emerged victorious.
Sparta had defeated Athens, but the fluid

33
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:13,679
Athenian way of life was slowly breaking down
its discipline and loosening its rigid order.

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,819
They were adapting to losing their empire,
managing to thrive as a cultural and economic

35
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:23,419
center.
Meanwhile Sparta grew weaker and weaker. Some

36
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:28,109
thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost
an important battle with the city-state of

37
00:03:28,110 --> 00:04:08,040
Thebes. Almost overnight, this once mighty
nation collapsed and would never recover.

38
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,679
In facing a serious problem—controlling
superior numbers—Sparta reacted like an

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,060
animal that develops a shell to protect itself
from the environment. But like a turtle, the

40
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,870
Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They
had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to

41
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,240
relieve the tension, a constant anxiety about
the status quo. Victory would mean new lands

42
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,370
to govern, which they did not want; defeat
would mean the end of their military machine,

43
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:45,680
which they did not want, either. Only stasis
allowed them to survive. But nothing in the

44
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,990
world can remain stable forever, and the shell
or system you evolve for your protection will

45
00:04:50,990 --> 00:05:00,410
someday prove your undoing.
"When you want to fight us, we don't let you

46
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,410
and you can't find us. But when we want to
fight you, we make sure that you can't get

47
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,410
away and we hit you squarely . . . and wipe
you out . . . The enemy advances, we retreat;

48
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:16,030
the enemy camps, we harrass; the enemy tires,
we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue."
