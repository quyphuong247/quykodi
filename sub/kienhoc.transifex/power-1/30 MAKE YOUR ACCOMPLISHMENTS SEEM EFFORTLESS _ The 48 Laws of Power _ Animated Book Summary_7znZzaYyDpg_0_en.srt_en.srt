The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 30: Make Your Accomplishments Seem

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,750
Effortless
Your actions must seem natural and executed

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,449
with ease. All the toil and practice that
go into them, and also all the clever tricks,

4
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:26,789
must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly,
as if you could do much more. Avoid the temptation

5
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,039
of revealing how hard you work—it only raises
questions. Teach no one your tricks or they

6
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,359
will be used against you.
You will often have to use tricks and ingenuity

7
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,338
to create your effects, but your audience
must never suspect the work or the thinking

8
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:48,018
that has gone into them. Nature does not reveal
its tricks, and what imitates nature by appearing

9
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:54,988
effortless approximates nature's power.
In 16th century Japan, Sen no Rikyu was the

10
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:00,320
preferred tea master. All though not from
a noble family, Emperor Hideyoshi found him

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,269
to be an important adviser on aesthetic and
even political matters. Rikyu's secret was

12
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:12,209
to appear natural, concealing the effort behind
his work. One evening, while having tea at

13
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:18,309
a friend's house, Rikyu saw his host go outside,
hold up a lantern in the darkness, cut a lemon

14
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,840
off a tree and bring it. This charmed Rikyu-
the host needed a relish for the dish he was

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,439
serving, and had spontaneously gone outside
to get one. But when the man offered the lemon

16
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,748
with some Osaka rice cake, Rikyu realized
that he had planned creating this effect of

17
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:41,030
beauty Rikyu found so desirable. The gesture
no longer seemed spontaneous - it was a way

18
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,909
for the host to prove his cleverness, but
he had accidently revealed how hard he was

19
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:51,420
trying. Rikyu politely declined the cake,
excused himself and left.

20
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,799
To Sen no Rikyu the sudden appeareance of
something naturally, almost accidently graceful

21
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,819
was the height of beauty. This beauty came
without warning and seemed effortless. Nature

22
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:09,469
created such things by its own laws and processes,
but men had to create their effects through

23
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:14,870
labor and contrivance. And when they showed
the effort of producing the effect, the effect

24
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,860
was spoiled.
Secret Practices Makes Perfect

25
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,530
1. You must research and practice endlessly
before appearing in public, onstage or anywhere

26
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,430
else.
2. Never expose the sweat and labor behind

27
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,659
your poise. Some think such exposure will
demonstrate their diligence and honesty, but

28
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:37,949
it actually just makes them look weaker as
if they weren't really up to the job.

29
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,679
3. Keep your effort and your tricks to yourself
and you seem to have the grace and ease of

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,670
a god.
... The Book of the Courtier by Baldassare

31
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:51,068
Castiglione speaks of Sprezzatura, the capacity
to make the difficult seem easy.

32
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:57,128
4. It is relevant to all forms of power, for
power depends vitally on appearances and the

33
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:01,729
illusions you create.
5. Your public actions are like artworks:

34
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:06,000
They must have visual appeal, create anticipation,
and even entertain.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,938
6. When you reveal the inner workings of your
creation, you become just one more mortal

36
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:15,039
among others.
7. What is understandable is not awe-inspiring

37
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,769
— we tell ourselves we could do as well
if we had the money and time.

38
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,908
8. Avoid the temptation of showing how clever
you are — instead conceal the mechanisms

39
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:28,900
of your cleverness.
9. Do not give people ideas they can use against

40
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,510
you because can’t see the advantages of
keeping silent.

41
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:38,449
10. Resist the temptation to want your vanity
gratified by having your hard work and cleverness

42
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:42,018
applauded.
11. Do not vie for sympathy for the hours

43
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:48,390
it has taken to reach your point of artistry.
12. Learn to control this propensity to blab,

44
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,458
for its effect is often the opposite of what
you expected.

45
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,049
Two Reminders 1. The more mystery surrounds
your actions, the more awesome your power

46
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:01,379
seems. You appear to be the only one who can
do what you do—and the appearance of having

47
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:07,340
an exclusive gift is immensely powerful.
2. Finally, because you achieve your accomplishments

48
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,340
with grace and ease, people believe that you
could always do more if you tried harder.

49
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,840
This elicits not only admiration but a touch
of fear. Your powers are untapped — no one

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,379
can fathom their limits.
Word to the Wise - There are also times when

51
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,379
revealing the inner workings of your projects
can prove worthwhile. It all depends on your

52
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:32,920
audience's taste, and on the times in which
you operate. As long as the partial disclosure

53
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,069
of tricks and techniques is carefully planned,
rather than the result of an uncontrollable

54
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:44,139
need to blab, it is the ultimate in cleverness.
It gives the audience the illusion of being

55
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:50,310
superior and involved, even while much of
what you do remains concealed from them.

56
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,810
And that is it for this law, as always thank's
for watching.
