00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,000

The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene

00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,218
Law number four ... Always Say Less than Necessary

5
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:16,699
There are times when it is unwise to be silent.

6
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:21,079
Silence can arouse suspicion and even insecurity, especially in your superiors;

7
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,719
a vague or ambiguous comment can open you up to interpretations you had

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,890
bargained for.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,550
Silence and saying less than necessary must be practiced with caution,

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,289
then, and in the right situations. Let us take a look at 6 ways to exert more

11
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,089
power by practicing listening.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,170
Make People Reveal More About Themselves

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,719
Speaking less will make people reveal more about themselves.

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,109
This is information you may be able to use against them later on.

15
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:49,909
Your short answers and silences will put them on the defensive,

16
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,919
and they will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,340
that will review valuable information
about them and their weaknesses.

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,910
The longer you listen, the more others move their lips and teeth. As they move

19
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:05,500
their lips and teeth, you can thereby understand their real intentions.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,849
number two ... People Listen and Interpret Your Every Word Carefully

21
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:14,140
Speaking less will force people to
listen and interpret your every word

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,939
carefully. Your silence will make other people uncomfortable.

23
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,239
Humans are machines of interpretation and explanation;

24
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,949
they have to know what you are thinking. When you carefully control what you reveal,

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,020
they cannot pierce your intentions or your meaning. They will leave a meeting

26
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:33,289
with and they will go home and ponder your every word.

27
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:37,700
This extra attention to your brief comments will only add to your power.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,429
Masters of enigma Andy Warhol and Marcel Duchamp

29
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:45,799
knew the power of saying less and keeping people guessing. The less Duchamp

30
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,409
talked about his work, the more it was talked about in the art circles.

31
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,519
Andy Warhol recognized it was hard to talk people into doing what you wanted,

32
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,469
so when interviewed, he would give vague and ambiguous answers and let the

33
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:59,739
interviewer find his own interpretation.

34
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,560
number three ... Once The Words Are Out, You Cannot Take Them Back

35
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,500
Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm:

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,120
The momentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,030
will be outweighed by the price you pay.
Number four ...

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,919
The More You Say, The More Common You Appear | When you are trying to impress

39
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,878
people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in

40
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:23,548
control.

41
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,890
Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original

42
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:29,958
if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike.

43
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,840
Number five ... Saying Less Will Keep You From Saying Something Foolish or Even

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,640
Dangerous.

45
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,759
Around 454 B.C, Coriolanus was a great military hero of ancient

46
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,209
Rome. People held him in awe. He decided to run for senate and he spoke his

47
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:44,729
mind,

48
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:49,229
hardly able to control his arrogance and boastfulness. He slandered and insulted

49
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:49,818
people.

50
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:52,938
The more speeches he made, the less people respected him.

51
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:56,509
He suffered the peopleâ€™s wrath and was eventually banished from the city.

52
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:01,250
Number six ... People Will Not Deceive You As They Will Never Know Your Position

53
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,519
Louis XIV was a man of very few words.

54
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,938
His infamous "I shall see" was one of several

55
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,840
extremely short phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests.

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,959
Louis was not always this way; as a young man he was known for talking at

57
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:16,468
length,

58
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:21,068
delighting in his own eloquence. His later taciturnity was self-imposed,

59
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:25,199
an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below him off-balance.

60
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,968
No one knew exactly where he stood, or could predict his reactions.

61
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:32,638
No one could try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to

62
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,139
hear,

63
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:37,209
because no one knew what he wanted to hear. As they talked on and on to the

64
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,170
silent Louis,

65
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,908
they revealed more and more about themselves, information he would later

66
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:44,090
use against them to great effect.

67
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,248
In the end, Louis's silence kept those around him terrified

68
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:50,598
and under his thumb. It was one of the foundations of his power.

69
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,759
As Saint-Simon wrote, "No one knew as well as he

70
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,209
how to sell his words, his smile, even his glances.

71
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,700
Everything in him was valuable because he created differences,

72
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,238
and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness of his words."

73
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,188
Saying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only.

74
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:12,328
In most areas of life, the less you say, the more profound and mysterious you

75
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:13,040
appear.

76
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:18,048
By saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning and power.

77
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:23,258
Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something foolish,

78
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:32,850
even dangerous. Thank's for watching!

79
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,789
 

80
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:34,878
