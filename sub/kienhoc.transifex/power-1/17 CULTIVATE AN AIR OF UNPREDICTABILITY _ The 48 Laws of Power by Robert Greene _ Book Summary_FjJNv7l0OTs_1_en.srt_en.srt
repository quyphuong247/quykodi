The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene | Law Number 17... Cultivate an air of Unpredictability

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,099
Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,580
need to see familiarity in other people's
actions. Your predictability gives them a

4
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:23,699
sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately
unpredictable. Behavior that seems to have

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,339
no consistency or purpose will keep them off-
balance and they will wear themselves out

6
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:33,039
trying to explain your moves. Taken to an
extreme, this strategy can intimidate and

7
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,929
terrorize.
5 Ways to Keep Your Opponent Off-Balance

8
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,359
1. Appear to have no clear strategy.
2. Scramble old patterns.

9
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,090
3. Alter your behavior, to improvise and overcome
the weight of routine and habit

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,370
4. Unsettle those around you to keep the initiative
on their side

11
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:54,149
5. Strike without warning, to make others
tremble when they least expect it.

12
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,570
To illustrate this law we will use the game
of chess. Chess, contains the concentrated

13
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,509
essence of life: First, because to win you
have to be supremely patient and farseeing;

14
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:09,000
and second, because the game is built on patterns,
whole sequences of moves that have been played

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,959
before and will be played again, with slight
alterations, in any one match.

16
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,438
Your opponent analyzes the patterns you are
playing and uses them to try to foresee your

17
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:23,769
moves. Allowing him nothing predictable to
base his strategy on gives you a big advantage.

18
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:27,789
In chess as in life, when people cannot figure
out what you are doing, they are kept in a

19
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:32,689
state of terror—waiting, uncertain, confused.
It is a device that the powerful have used

20
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:36,099
for centuries
Scrambling your patterns on a day-to-day basis

21
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:40,879
will cause a stir around you and stimulate
interest. People will talk about you, ascribe

22
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,208
motives and explanations that have nothing
to do with the truth, but that keep you constantly

23
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:50,039
in their minds. In the end, the more capricious
you appear, the more respect you will garner.

24
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:53,209
Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable
manner!

25
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:56,270
2 Reasons that ‘Predictability’ Will Work
In Your Favor

26
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:01,548
1. It sets up a smoke screen, a comfortable
front behind which you can carry on deceptive

27
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:05,249
actions.
2. It allows you on rare occasions to do something

28
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:09,459
completely against the pattern, unsettling
your opponent so deeply he will fall to the

29
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:14,289
ground without being pushed.
In 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman were

30
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:18,549
scheduled to fight for the world heavyweight
boxing championship. In a press conference

31
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,450
before the big fight, he said he was going
to change his style and punch it out with

32
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:27,449
Foreman. No one, least of all Foreman, believed
this for a second. To everyone's amazement,

33
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,359
Ali did exactly what he had said he would
do.

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,920
As Foreman waited for him to dance around,
Ali went right up to him and slugged it out.

35
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,750
He completely upset his opponent's strategy.
At a loss, Foreman ended up wearing himself

36
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,729
out, not by chasing Ali but by throwing punches
wildly, and taking more and more counterpunches.

37
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,859
Finally, Ali landed a dramatic right cross
that knocked out Foreman.

38
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,590
The habit of assuming that a person's behavior
will fit its previous patterns is so strong

39
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,810
that not even Ali's announcement of a strategy
change was enough to upset it. Foreman walked

40
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,120
into a trap—the trap he had been told to
expect.

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,060
WARNING: (this law just like many of the laws
of this book can backfire on you, if not practised

42
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,890
with caution)
Unpredictability can work against you sometimes,

43
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:16,419
especially if you are in a subordinate position.
There are times when it is better to let people

44
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:20,759
feel comfortable and settled around you than
to disturb them. Too much unpredictability

45
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,899
will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness,
or even of some more serious psychic problem.

46
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,039
Such power should only be used judiciously.
That's it for this law, I hope you found it

47
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:47,509
resourceful as always. Subscribe if you'd
