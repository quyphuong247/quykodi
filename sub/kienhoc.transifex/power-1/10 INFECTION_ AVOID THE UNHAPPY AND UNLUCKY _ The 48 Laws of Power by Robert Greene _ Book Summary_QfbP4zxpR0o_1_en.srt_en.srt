The 48 Laws of Power ... by Robert Greene
Law number ten... Infection: Avoid the unhappy

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,689
and unlucky
You can die from someone else's misery—emotional

3
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:21,320
states are as infectious as diseases. You
may feel you are helping the drowning man

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,800
but you are only precipitating your own disaster.
The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,759
on themselves; they will also draw it on you.
Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,619
The infector possesses an inward instability
that radiates outward drawing disaster to

7
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:43,640
all that they touch. Marie Gilbert A.K.A Lola
Montez of Ireland was one such person. Lola

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,338
found herself in the role of a courtesan (prostitute
of the royal court). In today’s society

9
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:52,858
Lola would be considered a gold-digger. She
only sought out men with high social standing

10
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,019
in the community that she could use for her
own gain.

11
00:00:56,018 --> 00:01:00,738
Once she would have her hooks in these men,
their slow demise began. One of her victims

12
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:06,099
was king Ludwig of Bavaria, who felt compelled
to help Lola yet once he was warned of the

13
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:11,129
dangers of his affair with her, he could not
seem to resist Lola’s aura and almost found

14
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,750
his once peaceful country in a state of civil
war. It was not until then that the king finally

15
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,739
ordered Lola to leave but a month after she
left King Ludwig was forced to relinquish

16
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:24,769
his throne.
There are many men who suffered because of

17
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:29,328
their association with Lola Montez.
King Ludwig said that he was “bewitched”

18
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:34,379
by Lola. Lola was an unstable, incurable and
infectious character type. This is not to

19
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,009
say that these characteristics are only restricted
to women, this is to say that there are some

20
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,590
people whose emotions are so powerful that
they infect the very soul of the people that

21
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,820
they touch.
How to Recognize an Infector

22
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:50,129
1. They draw misfortune upon themselves.
2. They have a turbulent past.

23
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,649
3. They have a long line of broken relationships.
4. They have an unstable career.

24
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,579
5. They have a forceful character that sweeps
you up and makes you lose reason.

25
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:02,468
6. They have a desire to destroy and unsettle
and is chronically dissatisfied.

26
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:06,368
7. Look at the effect that they have on the
world around them.

27
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:09,669
What to Do When You Meet an Infector
1. Don’t argue with them, this is part of

28
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,399
how they trap you.
2. Don’t try to help them no matter what

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,650
they say.
3. Don’t pass the person onto your friends

30
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,750
or you will become enmeshed.
4. Flee the infector's presence or suffer

31
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,889
the consequences.
Learn To Fear the Power of Infection

32
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:26,309
The risk of associating with infectors is
that you will waste valuable time and energy

33
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,780
trying to free yourself. Through a kind of
guilt by association, you will also suffer

34
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,250
in the eyes of others.
On the other side of the spectrum of infectors

35
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,599
are those people who attract happiness through
their good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence.

36
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,250
They are a source of plea-sure, and you must
associate with them to share in the prosperity

37
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,120
they draw upon themselves. All positive qualities
can infect us, but taking advantage of the

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,140
emotional side of this osmosis may be difficult.
5 Ways to Affect Positive Change through Your

39
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,669
Associations
1. If you are miserly by nature, associate

40
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:03,389
with the generous and they will infect you,
opening up everything that is tight and restricted

41
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:08,939
in you. Only generous souls attain greatness.
2. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful.

42
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,879
3. If you are prone to isolation, force yourself
to befriend the gregarious.

43
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,509
4. Never associate with those who share your
defects—they will reinforce everything that

44
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:32,030
holds you back.
5. Only create associations with positive

45
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,770
affinities.
Your rule for life…

46
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,050
Recognize the fortunate so that you may choose
their company and the unfortunate so that

47
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,880
you may avoid them. Misfortune is usually
the crime of folly, and among those who suffer

48
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,069
from it there is no malady more contagious:
Never open your door to the least of misfortunes,

49
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:54,780
for, if you do, many others will follow in
its train… Do not die of another's misery.
