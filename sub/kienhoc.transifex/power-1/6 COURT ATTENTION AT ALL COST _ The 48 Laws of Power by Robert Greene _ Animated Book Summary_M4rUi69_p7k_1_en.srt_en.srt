The 48 Laws of Power

3
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:10,588
by Robert Greene | Law number ... Six | Court Attention at all Cost

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:13,888
Be ostentatious and be seen. ... What is not seen

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,910
is as though it did not exist. ... It was light that first caused all creation to

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,719
shine forth.

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,868
Display fills up many blanks, covers up deficiencies,

8
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:25,140
and gives everything a second life, especially when it is backed by genuine

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,070
merit.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,089
Baltasar Gracian | Everything is judged by its appearance;

11
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,420
what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd,

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,000
then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,039
Make yourself a magnet of attention by appearing larger,

14
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,489
more colorful, more mysterious, than the bland and timid masses.

15
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:48,599
Why Fame Is Important In Every Field Of Work

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,210
Burning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born with.

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,230
You have to learn to attract attention. At the start of your career, you must

18
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,789
attach your name and reputation to a quality,

19
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,729
an image, that sets you apart from other people. This image can be something like

20
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,578
a characteristic style of dress,

21
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:09,319
or a personality quirk that amuses people and gets talked about.

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,539
Once the image is established, you have an appearance,

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,920
a place in the sky for your star. Our
first historical example:

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,539
The court of Louis XIV contained many talented writers,

25
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,259
artists, great beauties, and men and women of impeccable virtue,

26
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,248
but no one was more talked about than the singular Duc de Lauzun.

27
00:01:28,248 --> 00:01:33,208
The duke was short, almost dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of

28
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:33,950
behavior

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,629
—he slept with the king's mistress, and openly insulted not only other courtiers

30
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:40,368
but the king himself.

31
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:43,608
Louis, however, was so beguiled by the duke's

32
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:47,438
eccentricities that he could not bear his absences from the court.

33
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,608
It was simple: The strangeness of the duke's character

34
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:54,828
attracted attention. Once people were enthralled by him, they wanted him around

35
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:55,798
any cost.

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,079
The great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he had to remain in the public

37
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,298
eye at any cost.

38
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,450
Almost as important as the inventions themselves was how he presented them to

39
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,079
the public

40
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,419
and courted attention. Edison would design visually dazzling experiments to

41
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,488
display his discoveries with electricity.

42
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:16,560
He would talk of future inventions that seemed fantastic at the time

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,129
—robots, and machines that could photograph thought

44
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:23,889
—and that he had no intention of wasting his energy on, but that made the

45
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,309
public talk about him.

46
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,520
He did everything he could to make sure that he received more attention than his

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
great rival Nikola Tesla,

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,550
who may actually have been more brilliant than he was but whose name was

49
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,640
far less known.

50
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,349
In 1915, it was rumored that Edison and Tesla would be joint recipients of that

51
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,039
year's Nobel Prize in physics.

52
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,289
The prize was eventually given to a pair of English physicists;

53
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:48,179
only later was it discovered that the prize committee had actually

54
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,450
approached Edison,

55
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:53,299
but he had turned them down, refusing to share the prize with Tesla. By that time his fame was more secure

56
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,950
than Tesla's, and he thought it better to refuse the honor

57
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:59,989
than to allow his rival the attention that would have come

58
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,600
even from sharing the prize. Let's look
at 6 Ways You Can Become famous

59
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,829
and make your ideas more popular than the competition's. Number one ... Attack the

60
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,750
Sensational/

61
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,330
Scandalous | If you find yourself in a lowly position

62
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,410
that offers little opportunity for you to draw attention, an effective trick is to

63
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:18,849
attack the most visible,

64
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,150
most famous, most powerful person you can find.

65
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,620
Example of Pietro Aretino: When Aretino, a

66
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,950
a young Roman servant boy of the early sixteenth century, wanted to get attention as

67
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,208
a writer of verses,

68
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,479
he decided to publish a series of satirical poems

69
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,649
ridiculing the pope and his affection for a pet

70
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,580
elephant.

71
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,530
The attack put Aretino in the public eye immediately.

72
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,739
A slanderous attack on a person in a position of power

73
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,819
would have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use such tactics

74
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:52,199
sparingly after you have the public's attention, then

75
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,639
the act can wear thin. Number two ... Keep Reinventing Yourself

76
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,009
Once in the limelight you must constantiy renew it by adapting and

77
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,098
varying your method of courting attention.

78
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:07,268
If you don't, the public will grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move

79
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:08,719
on to a newer star.

80
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,949
The game requires constant vigilance and creativity.

81
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:17,469
Number three ... Be Unpredictable | People feel superior to the person whose

82
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,919
actions they can predict.

83
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,969
If you show them who is in control by playing against their expectations,

84
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,000
you will gain their respect and tighten your hold on their fleeting attention.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,449
Pablo Picasso - The Greatest Painter In The World

86
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,819
Picasso never allowed himself to fade into the background;

87
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:36,969
if his name became too attached to a particular style,

88
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,960
he would deliberately upset the public with a new series of paintings that went

89
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,719
against all expectations.

90
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,360
Better to create something ugly and
disturbing, he believed,

91
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,580
than to let viewers grow too familiar with his work.

92
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:54,250
Number four ...Create an Air of Mystery | In a world growing increasingly banal

93
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,709
and familiar, what seems enigthatic instantly draws attention.

94
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:01,598
Never make it too clear what you are doing or about to do. Do not show all your

95
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:02,339
cards

96
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,598
An air of mystery heightens your presence; it also creates anticipation

97
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:11,060
—everyone will be watching you to see what happens next. Use mystery to beguile,

98
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,240
seduce, even frighten. If you do not declare yourself immediately,

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,060
you arouse expectation. ... Mix a little mystery with everything,

100
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,009
and the very mystery stirs up veneration. And when you explain,

101
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,259
be not too explicit. ... In this manner you imitate the Divine way

102
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,779
when you cause men to wonder and watch.

103
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:34,159
Baltasar Gracian, once again. Number five ...
Better to be Attacked

104
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,800
Slandered Than Ignored. It is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar

105
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,420
appearance of yours should not be controversial,

106
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,290
that to be attacked is somehow bad. Nothing could be further from the truth.

107
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,390
To avoid being a flash in the pan, and having your notoriety

108
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,029
eclipsed by another, you must not discriminate between different types of

109
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:54,699
attention;

110
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:59,729
in the end, every kind will work in your favor. Welcomed personal attacks and feel

111
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,439
no need to defend yourself.

112
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,759
P.T. Barnum - The Greatest Entertainer in the World

113
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,909
Barnum learned about courting attention to his favor. Any form of publicity would

114
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,820
benefit his

115
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,040
entertainment business, no thatter if it were bad publicity.

116
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,520
He promoted his shows of curiosities to authences with all kinds of gimmicks.

117
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,589
He would offer Free Music for Millions, but hire bad musicians,

118
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,250
so the crowd would end up buying tickets to the show so they could avoid the

119
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,860
bands.

120
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,920
He planted articles in newspapers and even sent anonymous letters to keep

121
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,470
his name in the limelight.

122
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,640
Number six ... Make Yourself Appear Larger Than Life

123
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,909
Society craves larger-than-life figures,

124
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,160
people who stand above the general mediocrity. Never be afraid,

125
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,900
then, of the qualities that set you apart and draw attention to you.

126
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,889
Court controversy, even scandal. It is better to be attacked,

127
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,560
even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this law,

128
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,560
and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them.

129
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,600
That's it for this law, if however

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,070
that was not resourceful enough for you and you want more information,

131
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,360
I have begun to put more content on my
website illacertus.com

132
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,699
so you might wanna check it out. Anyways
thanks for watching!

133
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,738
 

134
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:18,899
 

135
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:18,959
