10 Truths about People
1. Most people are too imprisoned in the moment

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,580
to plan with any kind of foresight.
2. They do not possess the ability to ignore

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,179
immediate dangers.
3. People believe that pleasure translates

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,910
into power.
4. They are powerless of being able to overcome

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,390
the natural human tendency to react to things
as they happen.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,550
5. They have not taken the time to train themselves,
to step back, imagining the larger things

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,480
taking shape beyond their immediate vision.
6. Most people believe that they are in fact

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,750
aware of the future that they are planning
and thinking ahead.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,780
7. They are only succumbing to their desires,
to what they want the future to be.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,039
8. Their plans are vague, based on their imaginations
rather than their reality.

11
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,450
9. They may believe they are thinking all
the way to the end.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,420
10. They are really only focusing on the happy
ending, and deluding themselves by the strength

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,280
of their desire.
Remember: When you see several steps ahead,

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,980
and plan your moves all the way to the end,
you will no longer be tempted by emotion or

15
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,899
by the desire to improvise. Your clarity will
rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that

16
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:13,670
are the primary reasons why so many fail to
conclude their actions successfully. You see

17
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,840
the ending and you tolerate no deviation.
If you are clear and far-thinking enough,

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,280
you will understand that the future is uncertain,
and that you must be open to adaptation. Only

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,509
having a clear objective and a far-reaching
plan allows you that freedom.
