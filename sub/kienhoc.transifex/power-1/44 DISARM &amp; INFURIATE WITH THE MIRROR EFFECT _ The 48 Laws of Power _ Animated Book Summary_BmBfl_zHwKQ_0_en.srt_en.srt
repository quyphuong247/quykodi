00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:11,280
The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 44: Disarm and Infuriate with the

2
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,958
Mirror Effect
The mirror reflects reality, but it is also

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:21,320
the perfect tool for deception: When you mirror
your enemies, doing exactly as they do, they

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,359
cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror
Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,070
overreact. By holding up a mirror to their
psyches, you seduce them with the illusion

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,640
that you share their values; by holding up
a mirror to their actions, you teach them

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,929
a lesson. Few can resist the power of the
Mirror Effect.

8
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:45,698
Example:
Early on in his career, the ambitious statesman

9
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:50,568
and general Alcibiades of Athens (450-404
B.C.) fashioned a formidable weapon that became

10
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:55,399
the source of his power. In every encounter
with others, he would sense their moods and

11
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,268
tastes, then carefully tailor his words and
actions to mirror their inmost desires. He

12
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:05,560
would seduce them with the idea that their
values were superior to everyone else’s,

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,719
and that his goal was to model himself on
them or help them realize their dreams. Few

14
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,709
could resist his charm.
The first man to fall under his spell was

15
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:20,929
the philosopher Socrates. Alcibiades represented
the opposite of the Socratic ideal of simplicity

16
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,210
and uprightness: He lived lavishly and was
completely unprincipled. Whenever he met Socrates,

17
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,629
however, he mirrored the older man’s sobriety,
eating simply, accompanying Socrates on long

18
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:38,289
walks, and talking only of philosophy and
virtue. Socrates was not completely fooled—he

19
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,450
was not unaware of Alcibiades’ other life.
But that only made him vulnerable to a logic

20
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,840
that flattered him: Only in my presence, he
felt, does this man submit to a virtuous influence;

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,409
only I have such power over him. This feeling
intoxicated Socrates, who became Alcibiades’

22
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:01,920
fervent admirer and supporter, one day even
risking his own life to rescue the young man

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,629
in battle.
Alcibiades then charmed the Athenians, got

24
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:11,500
accused of profaning sacred statues and fled,
he then charmed the Spartans, impregnated

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:18,120
the king's wife and fled and lastly he charmed
the Persians, secretly helped the Athenians

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,109
win their war with Sparta and, well fled Persia,
but returned back home where the Athenians

27
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:30,930
embraced him with open arms in 408 B.C.
Wherever Alcibiades went, whoever he had to

28
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,459
deal with, he would leave behind his own values
and appear to share the values of his victims.

29
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,699
No one could resist a man who not only concurred
with them, but also admired their ways of

30
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:47,919
living, seeming to be one of their own. This
mirror effect, this very early discovery of

31
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,179
what some call a neuro simplistic programming
technique today, was way more effective than

32
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,209
any sharpened sword and shield Alcibiades
could have wielded.

33
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:03,908
Greene describes these Four Main Mirror Effects
1. The Neutralizing Effect, 2. The Narcissus

34
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:11,108
Effect, 3. The Moral Effect and 4. The Hallucinatory
Effect. All good and well, but what does that

35
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:15,939
mean illacertus? I am so glad you asked.
1. The Neutralizing Effect

36
00:03:15,938 --> 00:03:21,078
Do what your enemies do, following their actions
as best you can, and they can't see what you're

37
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,150
up to as their strategy for dealing with you
depends on your reaction.

38
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,799
2. The Narcissus Effect
You look deep into the souls of other people;

39
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,459
fathom their inmost desires, their values,
their tastes, their spirit; and you reflect

40
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,299
it back to them, feeding their narcissism.
3. The Moral Effect

41
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,180
You mirror what other people have done to
you, and do so in a way that makes them realize

42
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,528
you are doing to them exactly what they did
to you.

43
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:52,688
4. The Hallucinatory Effect
comes from creating a perfect copy of an object,

44
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:57,698
a place or a person.
Mirroring people is extremely effective

45
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,129
You give them the feeling that you share their
thoughts and goals.

46
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:05,388
If they suspect you have ulterior motives,
the mirror shields you, preventing them from

47
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:09,959
figuring you out.
By playing the double, you steal their thunder,

48
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,139
suck away their initiative and make them feel
helpless.

49
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,629
You also gain the ability to choose when and
how to unsettle them.

50
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:22,250
The mirror saves you mental energy: simply
echoing the moves of others gives you the

51
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,629
space you need to develop a strategy of your
own.

52
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:31,339
But tread lightly
Mirrors contain great power but also dangerous

53
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:36,839
reefs.· You can often back into a mirrored
situation without fully understanding it.·

54
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,560
Most often you suffer by the comparison, seeming
either weaker than the previous occupant of

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,290
your position or else tainted by any unpleasant
associations that person has left behind.·

56
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,250
Avoid the association-effects like the plague.
· In a mirrored situation you have little

57
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,470
or no control over the reflections and recollections
that will be connected to you.· Any situation

58
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,220
beyond your control is dangerous. · Doesn’t
matter if the person or event has positive

59
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,590
associations, you will suffer from not being
able to live up to them, since the past generally

60
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:13,229
appears greater than the present. · If you
recognize people associating you with some

61
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,290
past event or person, do everything you can
to separate yourself from that memory and

62
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,220
to shatter the reflection. As always thanks
for watching.
