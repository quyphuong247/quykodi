The 48 Laws of Power

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,109
by Robert Greene | Law number nine ... Win Through Your Actions - Never Through Argument

4
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:15,980
Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,730
victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,859
than any momentary change of opinion.

7
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:25,630
It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions,

8
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:28,980
without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,579
Take the example of the engineer in Athens receiving orders from his

10
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:36,829
commander Mucianus to send the largest ship’s mast

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,980
to be used to help in the siege of the town of Pergumus. The engineer argued

12
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:41,250
that

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,378
what the commander needed was not the larger mast, but the smaller

14
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,269
which would be better suited for the task. Mucianus was infuriated

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,730
and sent for the engineer who continued to try to explain his reasoning

16
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:56,339
for sending the smaller mast. For his disobedience, he was flogged and scourged

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,000
with rods until he died.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,020
The engineer’s argument went on deaf ears.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,710
Nobody cared whether or not it was more prudent to use the smaller mast.

20
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,929
The fact of the matter was that a superior gave a command

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,780
and he decided that by insulting the intelligence of his master

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,159
by arguing was more important. Unlike Michelangelo,

23
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,430
the engineer did not exercise the correctness of his ideas

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,830
indirectly. When Florence’s mayor, Piero Sorderini

25
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:25,459
told Michelangelo that the nose on his sculpture that he had been commissioned

26
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,399
to do of a young David with sling in hand was too big,

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,030
e did not argue that the nose was just right, Michelangelo merely took the mayor

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,719
onto the scaffolding and gave the appearance of changing the nose.

29
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,828
Sorderini was pleased and no one was offended.

30
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:43,688
You’ve definitely heard the old adage, “Actions speak louder than words.”

31
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:46,719
Actions and demonstrations are much more powerful than

32
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,009
any rhetoric that one can spew out his mouth. There are no offensive words,

33
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:55,459
no possibility of misinterpretation. No one can argue with demonstrated proof.

34
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:59,129
As Baltasar Gracian remarks, "The truth is generally seen,

35
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:03,789
rarely heard." Yet beyond actions, the most powerful persuasion is symbolic.

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,368
Symbols like a flag or mythic story or monument is something we all understand

37
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:09,909
without the exchanging of

38
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:10,899
one word.

39
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,419
Henry Kissinger, who in 1979 suddenly broke off an intense meeting with the

40
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,098
Israelis over the return of the Sinai desert to go sight-seeing to an ancient

41
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,369
place and Masada,

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,500
Masada is where seven thousand Jewish warriors were said to commit mass suicide

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,840
in A.D. 73 rather than give in to the Roman troops.

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
The Israelis knew that Kissinger’s message was much more than just a

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,680
warning;

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,920
it was a significant emotional symbol that made them think far more seriously

47
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,199
than

48
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,009
any oratorical rhetoric he could have placated. Choose Your Battles

49
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,030
Wisely

50
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,959
Sometimes it is best to conserve your energy and walk away.

51
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,750
Then there are other times when the heat of an argument will be beneficial to you.

52
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,799
On the opposite end of the spectrum it is advantageous to argue with all the

53
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,109
convictions you can muster.

54
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:58,150
The more emotional, the better, especially when caught in a web of deception,

55
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,438
you need to draw the other person into the argument so as to distract and

56
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:02,289
confuse.

57
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,479
Phases of a Convincing Deceptive Argument

58
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:10,000
1. Feign ignorance: Like the con artist, Victor Lustig

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,789
who sold boxes for $10,000 and claimed that the boxes could make

60
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:14,289
money.

61
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:18,138
When confronted by Sheriff Richards of Remsen County, Oklahoma

62
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:22,489
that the box did not work, he acted as if he could not believe it.

63
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:27,060
He went as far as to ask the sheriff if he had operated it properly.

64
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,639
This is the way to place doubt in the mind of the offended party.

65
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,069
I mean, that's hilarious - a box that can make money. Two

66
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:37,259
Put a technical spin or rhetoric on the deception:

67
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,978
In the case of Lustig, he was masterful in his wording about the box.

68
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,519
This was nothing more than a bunch of technical jobber jabber that further

69
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,729
confused the sheriff,

70
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:49,870
who then let his guard down because of his own insecurity about the function of the

71
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,389
box.

72
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:55,530
3. Offer something for nothing: Lustig offered to give the sheriff his money back

73
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,370
and to come back to the town to fix the box although he knew that the box would

74
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,180
never work

75
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,500
and the money was not real. He diffused a situation that could have been

76
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,539
deadly for him.

77
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:08,548
He had won the argument and was able to get the sheriff jailed for passing

78
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,810
counterfeit bills in the process.

79
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,379

84
