The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 41: Avoid Stepping into a Great

2
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,718
Man's Shoes
What happens first always appears better and

3
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,969
more original than what comes after. If you
succeed a great man or have a famous parent,

4
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,929
you will have to accomplish double their achievements
to outshine them. Do not get lost in their

5
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:30,899
shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own
making: Establish your own name and identity

6
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:37,869
by changing course. Slay the overbearing father,
disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining

7
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:42,359
in your own way.
Power depends on appearing larger than other

8
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,350
people, and when you are lost in the shadow
of the father, the king, the great predecessor,

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,289
you cannot possibly project such a presence.
But how does the Son Step Out of the Father's

10
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:56,460
Shadow?
For one he could adopt the ruthless strategy

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,308
of Alexander the Great: disparage the past,
create your own kingdom and put the father

12
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,989
in the shadows instead of letting him do the
same to you.

13
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:10,319
This is a dialoge from the movie 'Alexander'
between Parmenion and my great great great

14
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:17,849
etc. grandfather.
Parmenion: I pray to Apollo you soon realize

15
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,309
how far you've turned from your father's path.
Alexander: Damn you Parmenion, by the gods

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,990
and your Apollo! War was in my father's guts!
It wasn't over ripe and reason like yours.

17
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:35,228
Parmenion: He never lusted for war, Alexander,
or enjoyed it so. He consulted his peers in

18
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:40,900
council, among equals! The Macedonian way.
He didn't make decisions based on his personal

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,310
desires.
Alexander: I've taken us further than my father

20
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:56,710
ever dreamed! Old man, we're in a new world.
1. If you cannot materially start from ground

21
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:01,649
zero—it would be foolish to renounce an
inheritance—you can at least begin from

22
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,239
ground zero psychologically.
2. Throw off the weight of the past and chart

23
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,250
a new direction.
3. Recognize like Alexander instinctively

24
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,598
that privileges of birth are impediments to
power.

25
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,810
4. Be merciless with the past, not only with
your father and his father but with your own

26
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,319
earlier achievements.
5. Only the weak rest on their laurels and

27
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:31,068
dote on past triumphs; in the game of power
there is never time to rest.

28
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:37,359
Louis XIV died, in 1715, after a glorious
fifty-five year reign, all eyes focused on

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,209
his great-grandson and chosen successor, the
future Louis XV.

30
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:48,039
From a country that had descended into civil
war in the late 1640s, Louis XIV forged the

31
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:53,329
mighiest realm in Europe. Great generals would
tremble in his presence. A cook once made

32
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:59,640
a mistake in preparing a dish and committed
suicide rather than face the king's wrath.

33
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:05,359
Louis had many mistresses, but their power
ended in the bedroom. He filled his court

34
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,500
with the most brilliant minds of the age.
The symbol of his power was Versailles: Refusing

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,789
to accept the palace of his forefathers, the
Louvre, he built his own palace in what was

36
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:24,239
then the middle of nowhere, symbolizing that
this was a new order he had founded, one without

37
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,950
precedent. He made Versailles the centerpiece
of his reign, a place that all the powerful

38
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:36,339
of Europe envied and visited with a sense
of awe. "In essence, Louis took a great void

39
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:43,209
- the decaying monarchy of France - and filled
it with his own symbols and radiant power."

40
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:49,140
Louis XV, on the other hand, symbolizes the
fate of all those who inherit something large

41
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,339
or who follow in a great man's footsteps.
It would seem easy for a son or successor

42
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,459
to build on the grand foundation left for
them, but in the realm of power the opposite

43
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:06,340
is true. The pampered, indulged son almost
always squanders the inheritance, for he does

44
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,598
not start with the father's need to fill the
void.

45
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:16,738
As Machiavelli states, necessity is what impels
men to take action, and once the necessity

46
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,768
is gone, only rot and decay are left. (KEY
PHRASE)

47
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,040
"But when they began to make sovereignty hereditary,
the children quickly degenerated from their

48
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,810
fathers; and, so far from trying to equal
their father's virtues, they considered that

49
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:39,280
a prince had nothing else to do than to excel
all the rest in idleness, indulgence, and

50
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,388
every other variety of pleasure." - Niccolo
Bernardo Machiavelli

51
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:52,650
Here's 5 Reasons to Bury the Past
1. The past prevents the young hero from creating

52
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:56,719
his own world.
2. He must do as his father did, even after

53
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,150
that father is dead or powerless.
3. The hero must bow and scrape before his

54
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:06,459
predecessor and yield to tradition and precedent.
4. What had success in the past must be carried

55
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:10,349
over to the present, even though circumstances
have greatly changed.

56
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,720
5. The past also weighs the hero down with
an inheritance that he is terrified of losing,

57
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,759
making him timid and cautious.
The question then arises, how does one Bury

58
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,770
the Past?
Power depends on the ability to fill a void,

59
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:31,149
to occupy a field that has been cleared of
the dead weight of the past.

60
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:36,388
1. Only after the father figure has been properly
done away with will you have the necessary

61
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:42,019
space to create and establish a new order.
2. Variations on the execution of the king

62
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:47,529
that disguise the violence of the impulse
by channeling it in socially acceptable forms.

63
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:53,198
3. Perhaps the simplest way to escape the
shadow of the past is simply to belittle it,

64
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,129
playing on the timeless antagonism between
the generations, stirring up the young against

65
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:01,259
the old.
4. Establish distance from your predecessor

66
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:07,259
which demands some symbolism, a way of advertising
itself publicly... as Louis had changed the

67
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:13,509
king's palace from the Louvre to Versailles.
Essentially, the problem is the following

68
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:18,810
1. The overbearing predecessor fills the vistas
before you with symbols of the past.

69
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,350
2. You have no room to create your own name.
And 3. The superstitious belief that if the

70
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,199
person before you succeeded by doing A, B,
and C, you can re-create their success by

71
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,288
doing the same thing. You MUST go with the
times, adapt and overcome.

72
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:41,228
This is part of the solution
1. Hunt out the vacuums—those areas in culture

73
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:44,918
that have been left vacant.
2. With this you can become the first and

74
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,538
principal figure to shine.
3. Make a name for yourself where no shadows

75
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:55,439
could obscure your presence.
But remember: You are your own father. Do

76
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,969
not let yourself spend years creating yourself
only to let your guard down and allow the

77
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,160
ghost of the past—father, habit, history—to
sneak back in.

78
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,699
As always tread lightly.
The past often has elements worth appropriating,

79
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,530
qualities that would be foolish to reject
out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even

80
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:21,198
Alexander the Great recognized this important
fact because he was influenced by his father's

81
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,780
skill in organizing an army. Making a display
of doing things differently from your predecessor

82
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:33,198
can make you seem childish and in fact out
of control, unless your actions have logic

83
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,370
of their own.
Finally, it is often wise to keep an eye on

84
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,680
the young, your future rivals in power. Just
as you try to rid yourself of your father,

85
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,449
they will soon play the same trick on you,
denigrating everything you have accomplished.

86
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:52,840
Just as you rise by rebelling against the
past, keep an eye on those rising from below,

87
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,259
and never give them the chance to do the same
to you.
