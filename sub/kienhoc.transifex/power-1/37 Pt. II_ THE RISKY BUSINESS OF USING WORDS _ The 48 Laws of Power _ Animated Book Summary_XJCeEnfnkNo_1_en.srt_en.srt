The Risky Business of Using Words
Words are dangerous instruments, and often

2
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:11,649
go astray.
· The words people use to persuade us virtually

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,649
invite us to reflect on them with words of
our own; we mull them over, and often end

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:21,448
up believing the opposite of what they say.
(That is part of our perverse nature.)

5
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,929
· It also happens that words offend us, stirring
up associations unintended by the speaker.

6
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:30,739
· Words put you on the defensive
· If you have to explain yourself your power

7
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:35,379
is already in question.
· Words stir up arguments and divisions

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,969
The Positive Affect of Using Visuals
Visuals, short-circuits the labyrinth of words.

9
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:47,280
· It discourages questions, creates forceful
associations, resists unintended interpretations,

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,379
communicates instantly, and forges bonds that
transcend social differences.

11
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:56,109
· It strikes with an emotional power and
immediacy that leave no gaps for reflection

12
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,189
and doubt.
· Like music, it leaps right over rational

13
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,858
and reasonable thoughts.
· The image, on the other hand, imposes itself

14
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,659
as a given.
· Images bring people together.

15
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,820
Understand the Primacy of Sight among the
Senses

16
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,500
The visual has come to dominate the other
senses and is the sense we most depend on

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,719
and trust.
· As Baltasar Gracian said, "The truth is

18
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,719
generally seen, rarely heard."
Never neglect the way you arrange things visually.

19
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,548
· Factors like color, for example, have enormous
symbolic resonance.

20
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,240
The visual contains great emotional power.
· Find and associate yourself with the images

21
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,839
and symbols that will communicate in this
immediate way today, and you will have untold

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,950
power.
Most effective of all is a new combination—a

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,460
fusion of images and symbols that have not
been seen together before, but that through

24
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,739
their association clearly demonstrate your
new idea, message or religion.

25
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,560
· The creation of new images and symbols
out of old ones in this way has a poetic effect—

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,649
viewers' associations run rampant, giving
them a sense of participation.

27
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:01,170
The Sequence of Visual Images
The order in which they appear creates a symbol.

28
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,920
· The first to appear, for instance, symbolizes
power.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,340
· The image at the center seems to have central
importance.

30
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,969
You can make your own mythology out of figures
from more recent history.

31
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:15,680
· The idea is to give yourself an aura, a
stature that your normal banal appearance

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,120
simply will not create.
Using symbols also has a courtier-like effect,

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,950
since they are often gentler than brutish
words.

34
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:27,789
Use the power of symbols as a way to rally,
animate, and unite your troops or team.

35
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:32,359
The best way to use images and symbols is
to organize them into a grand spectacle that

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,819
awes people and distracts them from unpleasant
realities.

37
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:40,199
· People love what is grand, spectacular,
and larger than life.

38
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,378
Appeal to their emotions and they will flock
to your spectacle in hordes.

39
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:49,959
The visual is the easiest route to their hearts.
Remember: Your search for power depends on

40
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,420
shortcuts. You must always circumvent people's
suspicions, their perverse desire to resist

41
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:00,429
your will. Images are an extremely effective
shortcut: Bypassing the head, the seat of

42
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,110
doubt and resistance, they aim straight for
the heart. Overwhelming the eyes, they create

43
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,050
powerful associations, bringing people together
and stirring their emotions. With the white

44
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,000
light of the moon in their eyes, your targets
are blinded to the deceptions you practice.
