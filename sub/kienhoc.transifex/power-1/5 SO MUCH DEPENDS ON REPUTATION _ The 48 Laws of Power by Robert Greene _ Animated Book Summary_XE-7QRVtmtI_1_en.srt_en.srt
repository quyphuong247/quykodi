The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number five ...

00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,960
So Much Depends on Reputation - Guard it With Your Life

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,710
Reputation is the cornerstone of power. In the social realm,

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,778
appearances are the barometer of almost all our judgments.

7
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:23,230
Your reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appearances,

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,699
distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you're really like,

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,160
and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges you

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,659
a powerful position to be in. Why is Reputation Important?

11
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:38,099
A strong reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,640
strengths without you having to spend much energy.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,469
It can also create an aura around you that will instill respect,

14
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,689
even fear. In the fighting in the North African desert during World War II,

15
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,369
the German general Erwin Rommel had a reputation for cunning and

16
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:55,919
deceptive maneuvering that struck terror into everyone who faced him.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,160
Even when his forces were depleted and the British tanks outnumbered his by five to

18
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:00,648
one,

19
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:04,250
entire cities would be evacuated at the news of his approach.

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,819
As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you,

21
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,769
and if it inspires respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive

22
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:12,539
on the scene,

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,510
or utter a single word. During China’s War of the Three Kingdoms

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,560
A.D.207-265, General Liang was able to fool his rival Sima Yi simply

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,280
by letting his track record for being an undefeated leader in battle do the work

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,960
for him.

27
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,589
Liang’s troops were far outnumbered by Sima Yi’s, yet he devised a clever last

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,728
resort plan.

29
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,090
Liang donned a Taoist robe and played the lute upon the wall of the

30
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,299
city he was defending.

31
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:42,200
His soldiers opened the gates and hid. When Sima Yi’s troops advanced upon the

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,150
unguarded city,

33
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,240
Yi recognized his opponent sitting alone upon the wall.

34
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,969
Fearing a trap, Sima Yi called his soldiers to retreat.

35
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:54,368
How To Build A Reputation? In the beginning, you must work to establish a

36
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:56,530
reputation for one outstanding quality,

37
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,159
whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality sets you apart and gets

38
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,570
other people to talk about you.

39
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,539
You then make your reputation known to as many people as possible,

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,469
and watch as it spreads like wildfire. Do this subtly, though;

41
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,909
take care to build slowly, and with a firm foundation.

42
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,169
Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and

43
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:20,679
hoarded. Especially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,300
strictly,

45
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,310
anticipating all attacks on it. Make your reputation simple and base

46
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,789
it on one sterling quality. This single quality—efficiency, say, or seductiveness

47
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:35,229
becomes a kind of calling card that announces your presence and places

48
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:40,030
others under a spell. A reputation for honesty will allow you to practice all

49
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,310
manner of deception.

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,479
Casanova used his reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his future

51
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,509
conquests;

52
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:50,799
women who had heard of his powers became immensely curious, and wanted to discover

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,769
for themselves

54
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:56,209
what had made him so romantically successful. We'll cover 4 Ways to

55
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,330
Safe-Guard And Grow Your Reputation

56
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,870
Never appear desperate in your self-defense against the slander of

57
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,539
others

58
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,590
Do not let yourself get angry or defensive at the slanderous comments of

59
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,379
your enemies,

60
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,030
it reveals insecurity, not confidence in your reputation.

61
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,169
Take the high road instead, and never appear desperate in your self-defense.

62
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:20,619
Number two ... Sow doubt and spread rumors about your rival

63
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,039
An attack on another man's reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you

64
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,509
have less power than he does.

65
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:31,048
He has much more to lose in such a battle, and your own thus-far-small reputation

66
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,170
gives him a small target when he tries to return your fire.

67
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,219
P.T. Barnum used such campaigns to great effect in his early career.

68
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,530
But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem to engage in

69
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,669
petty vengeance.

70
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:46,958
If you do not break your enemy's reputation cleverly, you will

71
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,599
inadvertently ruin your own.

72
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,250
Even if they deny it, people will still be wondering why they are so defensive.

73
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,849
Barnum used this tactics to ruin his competition's Peale's reputation by sowing

74
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:58,989
doubts about Peale's

75
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,319
museum stability and solvency. Doubt is a powerful weapon:

76
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,298
Once you let it out of the bag with insidious rumors, your opponents are in a

77
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:06,909
horrible

78
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,849
dilemma. On the one hand they can deny the rumors, even prove that you have

79
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,759
slandered them.

80
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,828
But a layer of suspicion will remain: Why are they defending themselves so

81
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:16,939
desperately?

82
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:21,238
Maybe the rumor has some truth to it? If, on the other hand, they take the high road

83
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,899
and ignore you, the doubts, unrequited, will be even stronger.

84
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:28,120
If done correctly, the sowing of rumors can so infuriate and unsettle

85
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,329
your rivals that in defending themselves

86
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:34,829
they will make numerous mistakes. This is the perfect weapon for those who have no

87
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:35,589
reputation

88
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:40,629
of their own to work from. Number three ...
If you go too far in attacking another’s

89
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,360
reputation, it draws more attention to your wrongfulness than to the

90
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,139
person you are slandering. Thomas Edison, considered the inventor who

91
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,449
harnessed electricity,

92
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:53,139
believed that a workable system would have to be based on direct current

93
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,180
(DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared to have succeeded in

94
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,970
creating a system based on alternating current

95
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,480
(AC), Edison was furious. He determined to ruin Tesla's reputation, by making the

96
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,520
public believe that the AC system

97
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,629
was inherently unsafe, and Tesla irresponsible in promoting it.

98
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,620
To this end he captured all kinds of household pets and electrocuted them to

99
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,590
death with an AC current.

100
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:22,009
When this wasn't enough, in 1890 he got New York State prison authorities

101
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,529
to organize the world's first execution by electrocution,

102
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:30,049
using an AC current. But Edison's electrocution experiments had all been

103
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,360
with small creatures;

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,430
the charge was too weak, and the man was only half

105
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,079
killed. In perhaps the country's crudest state-authorized

106
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,310
execution, the procedure had to be repeated. It was an awful spectacle.

107
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,399
Although, in the long run, it is Edison's name that has survived,

108
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,989
at the time his campaign damaged his own reputation more than Tesla's.

109
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,418
He backed off. The lesson is simple—never go too far in attacks like these,

110
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:57,049
for that will draw more attention to your own wrongfulness than to the person

111
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,210
you're slandering.

112
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:03,060
Number four ... Use humor or gentle mockery at your rival’s expense

113
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,490
When your own reputation is solid, use subtler tactics, such as satire and

114
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,180
ridicule,

115
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,120
to weaken your opponent while making you out as a charming rogue. The mighty

116
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,899
lion toys with the mouse that crosses his path

117
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:18,589
—any other reaction would mar his fearsome reputation.

118
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:22,709
Once Barnum did have a reputation of his own, he used the fake hypnotism

119
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:26,229
demonstration: He ridiculed his rival Peale's reputation.

120
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,689
He was extremely successful. Once you have a solid base of respect, ridiculing

121
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:34,180
your opponent puts him on the defensive and draws more attention to you,

122
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,939
enhancing your own reputation. Outright slander and insult are too strong at

123
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:41,689
this point; they are ugly, and may hurt you more than help you.

124
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:45,410
But gentle humor and mockery suggest that you have a strong enough sense of

125
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,170
your own worth

126
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,819
to enjoy a good laugh at your rival's expense. A humorous front can make you out

127
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,680
as a harmless entertainer while poking holes in the reputation of your rival.

128
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,590
How To Improve A Bad Reputation? Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so

129
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,889
that you are prevented from establishing a new one.

130
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,289
In such cases it is wise to associate with someone whose image counteracts

131
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,030
your own,

132
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,169
using their good name to whitewash and elevate yours.

133
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,470
It is hard, for example, to erase a reputation for dishonesty by yourself;

134
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,530
but a paragon of honesty can help. When P. T. Barnum wanted to clean up a

135
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,229
reputation for promoting vulgar entertainment,

136
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,080
he brought the singer Jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a stellar, high-class

137
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,060
reputation, and the American tour Barnum sponsored for her greatly enhanced his

138
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,639
own image

139
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,740
greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of

140
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,560
nineteenth-century America were long

141
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,100
unable to rid themselves of a reputation for cruelty and mean-spirit.

142
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,930
Only when they began collecting art, so that the names of Morgan and Frick

143
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,459
became permanently associated with those of da Vinci and Rembrandt,

144
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,229
were they able to soften their unpleasant image. If you've found this video recourseful,

145
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,970
please leave a like and help us grow illacertus reputation on the

146
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,530
internet.

147
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,519
Thank's a lot for watching!

148
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,060
 

149
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,459
 

150
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,288
 

151
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:08,348
