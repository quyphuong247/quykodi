The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law Number 12... Use Selective Honesty to

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,019
Disarm Your Victim
One sincere and honest move will cover over

3
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:19,368
dozens of dishonest ones. Open-hearted gestures
of honesty and generosity bring down the guard

4
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:24,179
of even the most suspicious people. Once your
selective honesty opens a hole in their armor,

5
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,099
you can deceive and manipulate them at will.
A timely gift—a Trojan horse—will serve

6
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,399
the same purpose.
7 Ways You Can Disarm Anyone

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,670
1. Through an act of apparent sincerity and
honesty.

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,140
This is called selective honesty. Who will
distrust a person literally caught in the

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,219
act of being honest? This is an unexpected,
well-timed gesture that conflicts the emotions

10
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:50,230
and distracts the one being disarmed and have
the most brutal and cynical beast in the kingdom

11
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:54,919
eating out of your hand. In ancient China
this was called the “giving before the take.”

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,100
The giving makes it hard for the other person
to see the taking.

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,058
Count Victor Lustig is one of the best examples
of this law at work. Lustig was a con man

14
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,469
of great distinction, refinement and culture,
and his knowledge of human psychology was

15
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,269
his most important characteristic. He was
so confident in himself that he was able to

16
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:17,789
con Al Capone, the most feared gangster of
his time, out of $5,000. Capone never knew

17
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,170
what happened because Lustig disarmed him
through selective honesty.

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,320
Lustig returned $50,000 to Capone for allowing
him to take the money in order to double it

19
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,209
in sixty-days. Lustig took the money and left
it in a safety deposit box until the sixty-days

20
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:36,129
were up. He went back to Capone, apologized
profusely about the deal falling through and

21
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:40,859
returned the original $50,000. Capone had
already pegged Lustig as a con artist, but

22
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,218
when Lustig returned the money, it confused
Capone and he dropped his guard and gave Lustig

23
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:50,649
$5,000 just for “being honest.”
2. Learn to give before you take.

24
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:55,478
It softens the ground, takes the bite out
of a future request, or simply creates a distraction.

25
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:02,200
And the giving can take many forms: an actual
gift, a generous act, a kind favor, an "honest"

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,429
admission—whatever it takes.
3. Use selective honesty on your first encounter

27
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:09,759
with someone.
First impressions last a long time. If someone

28
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,469
believes you are honest at the start of your
relationship it takes a lot to convince them

29
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,889
otherwise.
A con man by the name of Lord John Gordon-Gordon

30
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,329
proved to Jay Gould, another con man, that
phony Erie railroad stocks that Gould had

31
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,550
invested in was the work of top executives
at railroad. Gould was so grateful to Gordon-Gordon

32
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,219
that they became friends buying the controlling
interest of the railroad. Soon Gordon-Gordon

33
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:35,969
betrayed Gould and disappeared. Gordon-Gordon
was a con man, but his initial act of honesty

34
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:40,620
and support had so blinded Gould that it took
the loss of millions for him to see through

35
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,310
the scheme
4. You must build a reputation for honesty

36
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,569
based on a series of acts.
Duke Wu of Cheng married off his daughter

37
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,069
and killed one of his ministers in order to
take over the powerful kingdom of Hu. The

38
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,919
ruler of Hu heard that the minister was executed
for telling Cheng to conquer the kingdom of

39
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,289
Hu. Hu’s ruler also considered the marriage
of Cheng’s daughter and other acts of kindness

40
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:07,870
from Cheng and let down his guard. A few weeks
later Cheng forces swept through Hu and took

41
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,009
the country, never to relinquish it.
5. Give a gift.

42
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:16,659
Few people can resist a gift, even from the
most hardened enemy, which is why it is often

43
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:21,250
the perfect way to disarm people. A gift brings
out the child in us, instantly lowering our

44
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,889
defenses. Although we often view other people's
actions in the most cynical light, we rarely

45
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,819
see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which
quite often hides ulterior motives. A gift

46
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,199
is the perfect object in which to hide a deceptive
move.

47
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,119
6. Practice the tactic with caution
Unless you can make the gesture seem sincere

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,020
and heartfelt, DO NOT PLAY WITH FIRE. If people
see through it, their disappointed feelings

49
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,450
of gratitude and warmth will become the most
violent hatred and distrust.

50
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:53,879
7. It is better to play the rogue
When you have a history of deceit behind you,

51
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,590
no amount of honesty, generosity, or kindness
will fool people. In fact it will only call

52
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,879
attention to itself. Once people have come
to see you as deceitful, to act honest all

53
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,009
of a sudden is simply suspicious. Overt deceptiveness
will sometimes cover your tracks, even making

54
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:14,689
you admired for the honesty of your dishonesty.
if you're known for lying, don't lie about

55
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:22,589
not lying.
if you try, you may insult your enemies' intelligence

56
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:25,929
"he's a deceitful man, but at least he doesn't
try to cover it pathetically"
