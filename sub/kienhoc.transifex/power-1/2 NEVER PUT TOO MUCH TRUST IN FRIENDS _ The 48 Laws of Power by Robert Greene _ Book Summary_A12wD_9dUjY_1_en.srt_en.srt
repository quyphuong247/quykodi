The 48 Laws of Power

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:11,199
by Robert Greene | Law no. 2: Never Put too Much Trust in Friends

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,129
Problem about working with friends is that it confuses the boundaries and

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,259
distances that working requires.

6
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:20,920
If both partners in the arrangement understand the dangers involved,

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,199
a friend often can be employed to great effect. You must never let your guard

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,779
down in such a venture, however;

9
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:30,420
always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional disturbance

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,010
uch as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of power, and

11
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,229
even the closest of friends can be transformed into the worst of

12
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:42,299
enemies. In order to fully understand, let’s take a look at history and learn

13
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:43,570
from others mistakes.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,770
The law has been observed with Michael III of the Byzantine Empire and his friend,

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,610
Basilius.

16
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:52,219
In the mid-ninth century A.D. Michael placed too much trust in his

17
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,620
friend, Basilius.

18
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,549
they had met a few years before when
Michael have been visiting the stables

19
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:02,030
They had met a few years before, when Michael had been visiting the stables

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,879
His strength and courage had impressed Michael, who immediately raised Basilius

21
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,719
from the obscurity of being a horse trainer

22
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,359
to the position of head of stables. He loaded his friend with gifts and favors

23
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,709
until they became inseparable.

24
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:19,829
Michael turned the peasant Basilius into a sophisticated and educated courtier.

25
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:24,590
who later on became greedy for more wealth and power and had his former

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,219
benefactor and best friend Michael
murdered.

27
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:31,509
Michael III staked his future on the sense of gratitude he thought Basilius

28
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:32,868
must feel for him.

29
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:37,310
He had created a monster. He had allowed a man to see power up close

30
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,509
a man who then wanted more, who asked for anything

31
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,399
and got it, who felt encumbered by the charity he had received and simply did

32
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,430
what many people do in such a situation:

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,000
They forget the favors they have received and imagine they have earned their success by their

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,109
own merits.

35
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,188
Another example is the Song Dynasty

36
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:57,758
who ruled China for 300 years,

37
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,938
but how? "I destroy my enemies when I make
them my friends".

38
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:06,889
-Abraham Lincoln | For several centuries after the fall of the Han Dynasty

39
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,729
A.D. 222, Chinese history followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups, one

40
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:13,750
after the other.

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,818
Army men would plot to kill a weak emperor,

42
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:20,229
then would replace him on the Dragon Throne with a strong general.

43
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:23,659
The general would start a new dynasty and crown himself emperor;

44
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,000
to ensure his own survival he would kill off his fellow generals.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,250
A few years later, however, the pattern would resume: New generals would rise up

46
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,930
and

47
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,150
assassinate him or his sons in their turn. To be emperor of China

48
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,280
was to be alone, surrounded by a pack of enemies—it was the least powerful, least

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,009
secure position in the realm.

50
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,079
In A.D. 959, General Zhao Kuangyin

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,150
I hope I'm saying this right: became Emperor Song

52
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,580
Emperor Song knew that his "friends" in the army would chew him up like meat,

53
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,519
and if he somehow survived, his "friends" in the government

54
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,349
would have him for supper. Emperor Song persuaded his generals

55
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,310
to retire to a life of nobility and give up their dreams of grabbing his throne

56
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,420
one day. He spared those who conspired against him,

57
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:13,689
and was able to win over enemies with his generosity.

58
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,789
Song was finally able to break the pattern of coups,

59
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:21,679
violence, and civil war. So, what can we
learn from these historical events

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,920
here are the Lessons for Working With Friends and Enemies

61
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:28,869
Friends will not openly disagree with you in order to avoid

62
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,829
arguments. Enemies expect nothing so they will be surprised

63
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,280
when you are generous.

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,030
An enemy spared the guillotine will be more grateful to you than a friend.

65
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,669
When you decide to hire a friend you will discover qualities they have kept

66
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:42,289
hidden,

67
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,328
be on the lookout for any signs of emotional disturbance such as envy and

68
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:52,388
ingratitude. Skill and competence are more important than friendly feelings.

69
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,200
Hiring friends will limit your power.
All working situations require a kind of

70
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,780
distance between people.

71
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,590
You destroy an enemy when you make a friend of him. An enemy at your heels keeps

72
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,319
you sharp,

73
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:04,049
alert,

74
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,570
and focused. That's quite a long list to
consider.

75
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,919
Have you ever experienced anything alike?
Please let us know

76
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:20,589
and thanks for watching!

77
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,959
 

78
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,019
