00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,039
Sucker
No one likes feeling stupider than the next

3
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,989
person. The trick, then, is to make your victims
feel smart—and not just smart, but smarter

4
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:22,589
than you are. Once convinced of this, they
will never suspect that you may have ulterior

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,379
motives.
6 Ways to Appear More Stupid Than the Mark

6
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,390
1. Never inadvertently insult or impugn a
person's brain power.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,250
2. Subliminally reassure people that they
are more intelligent than you are.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,960
3. Convince them that you are a bit of a moron,
and you can run rings around them.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,160
4. The feeling of intellectual superiority
you give them will disarm their suspicion-muscles.

10
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,479
5. Given how important the idea of intelligence
is to most people's vanity

11
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,539
6. Make people feel they are more sophisticated
than you are and their guard will come down.

12
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,899
The Swine and the Tiger
The Chinese have a phrase, "Masquerading as

13
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,329
a swine to kill the tiger." This refers to
an ancient hunting technique in which the

14
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:05,149
hunter clothes himself in the hide and snout
of a pig, and mimics its grunting.

15
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:10,079
Masquerading as a swine works wonders on those
who, like tigers, are arrogant and overconfident:

16
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:14,199
The easier they think it is to prey on you,
the more easily you can turn the tables.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,639
This trick is also useful if you are ambitious
yet find yourself low in the hierarchy: Appearing

18
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:23,149
less intelligent than you are, even a bit
of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like

19
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:27,388
a harmless pig and no one will believe you
harbor dangerous ambitions. They may even

20
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:30,728
promote you since you seem so likable, and
subservient.

21
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:34,920
In general, men, always make people believe
they are smarter and more sophisticated than

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,840
you are. They will keep you around because
you make them feel better about themselves,

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,728
and the longer you are around, the more opportunities
you will have to deceive them.

24
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,278
The mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his
way, and lets it get close, savoring the prospect

25
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:51,748
of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who
has the last laugh.

26
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:54,748
Intelligence Can Pay-off
To reveal the true nature of your intelligence

27
00:01:54,748 --> 00:02:00,060
rarely pays; you should get in the habit of
downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently

28
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,599
learn the truth—that you are actually much
smarter than you look—they will admire you

29
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,719
more for being discreet than for making your
brilliance show. At the start of your climb

30
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,689
to the top, of course, you cannot play too
stupid: You may want to let your bosses know,

31
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:15,680
in a subtle way, that you are smarter than
the competition around you. As you climb the

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,170
ladder, however, you should to some degree
try to dampen your brilliance.

33
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,449
There is, however, one situation where it
pays to do the opposite— when you can cover

34
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:27,229
up a deception with a show of intelligence.
In matters of smarts as in most things, appearances

35
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:31,259
are what count. If you seem to have authority
and knowledge, people will believe what you

36
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,378
say. This can be very useful in getting you
out of a scrape.

37
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,798
Here's a modern-day example of a type of person
you probably know. When I was in college there

38
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:43,599
was this obsessively hard-working girl that
would always get the best marks. But she saught

39
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,128
attention so desperately, by trying to act
dumber than she was, ironicly making her look

40
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:53,729
dumb in unintended ways. The whole class disliked
and even felt anger at times. She would act

41
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:58,509
as if she just started learning for an exam
5 minutes before the start & literally achieve

42
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:08,488
results nobody could by not learning for hours.
Everybody was aware of it: way too obvious.

43
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,530
It made her talked about, but never in a good
way. In my eyes, she could have sticked to

44
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,280
her hard work, which is nothing to be ashamed
of and most probably she would of gotten admired.

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,859
There was really no smart strategy behind
it, I don't know what was, but all of us stopped

46
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:26,530
caring very fast, as some people are not worth
figuring out. Please avoid being this type

47
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,000
of person. And that's it for this law. Hope you enjoyed it and thank's for watching.
