00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:13,609
Law Number 20... Do Not Commit to Anyone
It is the fool who always rushes to take sides.

2
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:17,890
Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself.
By maintaining your independence, you become

3
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,230
the master of others— playing people against
one another, making them pursue you.

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,629
Do Not Commit To Anyone but Be Courted By
All

5
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,428
If you allow people to feel they possess you
to any degree, you lose all power over them.

6
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,759
By not committing your affections, they will
only try harder to win you over. Stay aloof

7
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,619
and you gain the power that comes from their
attention and frustrated desire. Play the

8
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:43,320
Virgin Queen: Give them hope but never satisfaction.
The Aura of Power Grows With Time

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,378
You must learn the tricks that will enhance
your image. Emanate mystery and desirability,

10
00:00:48,378 --> 00:00:52,588
never discouraging anyone's hopes but never
yielding. When you hold yourself back, you

11
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:57,350
incur not anger but a kind of respect. You
instantly seem powerful because you make yourself

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,649
un-graspable, rather than succumbing to the
group, or to the relationship, as most people

13
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,709
do. As your reputation for independence grows,
more and more people will come to desire you,

14
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:10,449
wanting to be the one who gets you to commit.
The moment you commit, the magic is gone.

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,609
You become like everyone else. People will
try all kinds of underhanded methods to get

16
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:16,469
you to commit.
They will give you gifts; shower you with

17
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,079
favors, all to put you under obligation.
Accept the gifts and favors if you so desire,

18
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,109
but be careful to maintain your inner aloofness.
You cannot inadvertently allow yourself to

19
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:31,049
feel obligated to anyone. Encourage the attention,
stimulate their interest, but do not commit

20
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,060
at any cost. The goal is not to put people
off, or to make it seem that you are incapable

21
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,390
of commitment. You have to bend to their attention
occasionally, then—but never too far. Desire

22
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,739
is like a virus: If we see that someone is
desired by other people, we tend to find this

23
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:50,649
person desirable as well. Like the Virgin Queen,
you need to stir the pot, excite interest,

24
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,870
and lure people with the possibility of having
you.

25
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,478
Do Not Commit To Anyone - Stay Above the Fray
Do not let people drag you into their petty

26
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,590
fights and squabbles. Seem interested and
supportive, but find a way to remain neutral;

27
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,030
let others do the fighting while you stand
back, watch and wait. When the fighting parties

28
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,539
are good and tired they will be ripe for the
picking. You can make it a practice, in fact,

29
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,789
to stir up quarrels between other people,
and then offer to mediate, gaining power as

30
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:19,560
the go-between.
Master Your Emotions

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,900
Do not allow whatever compassion and pity
you possess to suck you in. You must seem

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,459
interested in other people's problems; even
sometimes appear to take their side. You must

33
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:33,459
maintain your inner energy and sanity by keeping
your emotions disengaged. Never let your interest

34
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:38,169
in their affairs and petty squabbles go beyond
the surface. Give them gifts, listen with

35
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:42,620
a sympathetic look, even occasionally play
the charmer—but inwardly keep them all at

36
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,079
arm's length. By refusing to commit and thus
maintaining your autonomy you retain the initiative.

37
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:52,459
Your moves stay a matter of your own choosing,
not defensive reactions to the push-and-pull

38
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,519
of those around you.
Attention

39
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,968
Both parts of this law will turn against you
if you take it too far. The game proposed

40
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,269
here is delicate and difficult. If you play
too many parties against one another, they

41
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,609
will see through the maneuver and will gang
up on you. If you keep your growing number

42
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:13,620
of suitors waiting too long, you will inspire
not desire but distrust. People will start

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,319
to lose interest. Eventually you may find
it worthwhile to commit to one side—if only

44
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,108
for appearances' sake, to prove you are capable
of attachment.

45
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,870
Even then, however, the key will be to maintain
your inner independence—to keep yourself

46
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,150
from getting emotionally involved. Preserve
the unspoken option of being able to leave

47
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,680
at any moment and reclaim your freedom if
the side you are allied with starts to collapse.

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,120
The friends you made while you were being
courted will give you plenty of places to

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,739
go once you jump ship. CASANOVA. One of the
greatest seducers in history - used this law

50
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,709
to make himself more desired by women when
he'd pursue more than one at a time, they

51
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,959
wanted to win him over, outdoing all other
women in the process. He was the prize they

52
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,699
would win in this competition. A person having
more than a few options can care less if one

53
00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:00,000
of the options falls away. So make sure you have more than one option. When you're applying for a job and they

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
ask you: "Are you looking at different job situations at the moment?"

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Never say no! Even if it's not true, say "Yes, of course!

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I got this company and this company, this company interested in me and they even wait for positive

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
feedback from me, because I'm awesome and they want me.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Alright, that's it for this law, thank's for watching and if you haven't already -
