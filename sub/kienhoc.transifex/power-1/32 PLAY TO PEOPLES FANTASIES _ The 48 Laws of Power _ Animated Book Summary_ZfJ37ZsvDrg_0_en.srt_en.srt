00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:11,550
The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 32: Play to People's Fantasies

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,820
The truth is often avoided because it is ugly
and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,179
reality unless you are prepared for the anger
that comes from disenchantment. Life is so

4
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,109
harsh and distressing that people who can
manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:31,750
are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks
to them. There is great power in tapping into

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,109
the fantasies of the masses.
Such is the power of the fantasies that take

7
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:41,560
root in us, especially in times of scarcity
and decline. People rarely believe that their

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,609
problems arise from their own misdeeds and
stupidity. Someone or something out there

9
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:52,750
is to blame—the other, the world, the gods—and
so salvation comes from the outside as well.

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,149
To gain power, you must be a source of pleasure
for those around you—and pleasure comes

11
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,729
from playing to people's fantasies. Never
promise a gradual improvement through hard

12
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,938
work; rather, promise the moon, the great
and sudden transformation, the pot of gold

13
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:13,219
aka the lose-16 pounds-in-a-week diet, the
6 minute abs, the 4 hour workweek, become

14
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:19,280
a millionaire overnight & the congratulations
you're our millionth visitor, you won an iPad-popup.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,930
It appeals to us so much, because the marketers
behind these know our fantasies too well.

16
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,159
No disrespect to Tim Ferris, I love this guy...
I will certainly take on his books as well.

17
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,859
Anyways.
1570 Venice lost the valuable island Cyprus

18
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:39,659
to the Turks. Once one of the wealthiest of
places, Venice found itself in poverty. Thinking

19
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,930
of ways to turn the economy around Venice
got notice of a man called 'Il Brigadino',

20
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:51,118
an alchemyst who could turn worthless objects
into gold with a secret substance. This man

21
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,769
would be the solution, he was invited to reside
in Venice at the expense of the states treasures.

22
00:01:56,769 --> 00:02:02,099
Il Brigadino would have gold coins clinking
in his hands, accompanied by two dogs at all

23
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:07,019
times. His palace, the state provided, would
have golden plates, golden watches, buttons

24
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,620
and what not. Everyone was pleased to see
this magical man in their neighborhood. They

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,280
would buy coal, and books on Alchemy, learning
how to do it themselves. Would not be concerned

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,979
about the practice, Il Brigadino himself.
The state became impatient, some advicing

27
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:27,539
not to push him over the edge. So, Il Brigadino
gave a demonstration, creating gold dust out

28
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,729
of a mineral in his hands for everyone to
see. After a while, the doubts grew and Il

29
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,979
Brigadino explained he could double all the
gold right away, but if they waited for 7

30
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:42,579
years the gold would multiply many times more.
A part of the city formed an angry mob, choosing

31
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,599
not to believe this sorcery anymore, Il Brigadino
stated that they had betrayed him and left

32
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,709
Venice, continuing his deception in different
areas living like a noble prince.

33
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,680
What the people had not noticed, of course,
was the little tube of glass he had hidden

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,959
in his sleeve, that poured the gold dust.
His image, his actions, his bold appearance,

35
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,459
the fact that he was wanted by other states
had set Il Brigadinos reputation as a true

36
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:15,659
Alchemyst in stone. People wanted to believe,
so badly, they threw away all rational thoughts

37
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,770
and like like little children believing in
the tooth-fairy preferred not to see the truth

38
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,050
behind this Charlatan-like figure.
Here's my perspective: ironically Il Brigadino

39
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:31,510
or by his real name, Cypriot Mamugna, did
know how to turn something into gold, though

40
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:35,620
the gold would only be for himself and the
ingredients were not objects that you can

41
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,870
touch with your hands, but people's fantasies
& beliefs. Does that make him any less of

42
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,930
an Alchemist? What is there more profitable
than a persons wishes, dreams and fantasies

43
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,810
paired with strong belief? Once we choose
to believe something; we will stick with it,

44
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,870
because we rationalize our actions. Not to
do so, would be like betraying our own judgment

45
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,840
and if we cannot rely on our past decisions,
that would mean facing... confronting the

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,780
sad and ugly truth. It would be too painful
to admit we have been fooled, we've made bad,

47
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,300
wrong, poor decisions, we've followed a cause
led by a fraud, who took our money. It's too

48
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,500
much of a shame. Sadly, this behaviour, this
utter denial and justification of our wrongdoings

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,189
sticks with so many people for their entire
lives. Once we choose to pursue our career

50
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:28,149
ladder by traditional means, in slavery, the
chain around our neck being a tie, we come

51
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:33,659
to despise everything else. We cannot believe
in entrepreneurialism being real, being an

52
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,650
option, because if it was, we'd get our hopes
up and we're afraid, very afraid of that.

53
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:45,859
With each year that goes by, we reinforce
these ideas, everytime we choose safety we

54
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,370
reinforce fear.
That is it for this law... Be sure to check

55
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,879
out Part II, Reality versus Fantasy as always
thank's for watching.
