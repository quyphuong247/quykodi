1
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,868
So here I was in a small city in Switzerland
on a Friday afternoon & I had just finished

2
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:22,089
class. Normally that would've meant "Everything's
fine! I can forget my worries until Monday.

3
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:26,929
It's time to relax... but was it?" The final
exams were coming dangerously close and the

4
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:32,320
pressure I felt grew accordingly. To say I
was unprepared would've been an understatement.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,520
What would happen if I failed? I imagined
all the consequences and broke down. I swore

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,880
to myself "I cannot repeat another year in
that school. I just can't and I won't." And

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,250
even if I managed to take on these exams,
what job would I pursue? I had procrastinated

8
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,700
sending out my applications like a champ.
Would anyone employ me after looking at my

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,700
marks? I had priotitized working out 4-5 times
a week without missing one single training,

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,719
I didn't care about marks. The only classes
I paid close attention to were history & economics.

11
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:10,000
I could've cared less about Shakespeare or
learning by heart where on the world map lies

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,069
Timbuktu or Burkina Faso. After all I could
just look it up on my phone, it made no sense

13
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:21,000
to me. And I thought about all the essential
things that we didn't learn one bit about.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,250
It all seemed upside down and I felt frustrated.
Not to mention the horrible books we were

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,359
forced to read... making me hate books. I
figured they just weren't my thing. I wasn't

16
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,599
meant to become that kind of scholar, that
kind of smart person.

17
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,609
Two weeks before that point in my life, I
had made it a personal project to try out

18
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:44,359
lucid dreaming. I had followed internet instructions,
writing down every detail of the dreams I

19
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:50,780
remembered. Soon, I was able to remember every
dream, it worked... But every single night

20
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,810
it was a nightmare. It felt so real, I couldn't
possibly tell I was dreaming, let alone take

21
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,280
control of the dream, which had been the goal
of the experiment. I woke up each morning

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,920
feeling not like I had been resting, but mentally
crushed. Stressed out, sweating. I dreamt

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,170
about sleeping in on the day of my exams,
about failing miserably. While I was pondering

24
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:15,949
the question on the piece of paper, the time
went by in an instant. 5 more minutes, the

25
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:21,028
prof proclaimed, finish what you can. My papers
were still empty. Just as I wanted to write

26
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:26,068
the answer, the question above changed infront
of my eyes. I wanted to stand up, scream,

27
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:28,578
but I couldn't move, I was losing my shit
and then...

28
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:35,609
[ALARM CLOCK]
I had to stop the experiment. It became clear

29
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:41,319
to me, I had tried to escape reality by trying
to take control of my dreams. Atleast at night,

30
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:46,458
I thought, I could live life how I wanted
it to be, but trying to escape my problems

31
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:52,209
didn't work. It never does.
So here I was, on my way to the bus station

32
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:57,348
as usual, but this Friday, instead of going
home directly, I decided to check something.

33
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:04,289
An idea had crossed my mind. The other day
I had watched a YouTube video, I still remember

34
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:07,979
the channel. GoStrongTV. Whatever happened
to that guy, he's not making any more videos,

35
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,848
unfortuneately, but he changed the course
of my life & he doesn't even know it. I was

36
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:16,358
doing something else while watching the video
as I often do, but then he caught my full

37
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:20,760
attention. He had quoted a short excerpt of
the 50th Law.

38
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,759
"The very first thing I remember in my early
childhood is a flame, a blue flame jumping

39
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,348
off a gas stove somebody lit... I was three
years old... I felt fear, real fear, for the

40
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:36,798
first time in my life, but I remember it also
like some kind of adventure, some kind of

41
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,480
weird joy, too. I guess that experience took
me someplace in my head I hadn't been before.

42
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,408
To some frontier, the edge, maybe, of everything
possible... the fear I had was almost like

43
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:52,209
an invitation, a challenge to go forward into
something I knew nothing about. That's where

44
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,878
I think my personal philosophy of life...
started, with that moment... in my mind I

45
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:02,808
have always believed and thought since then
that my motion had to be forward, away from

46
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:07,519
the heat of that flame."
It stunned me. I felt like I had just heard

47
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,739
one of the truest things in my life. I knew
something wasn't adding up, I just had no

48
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,629
idea what it was. That moment I knew this
was something good. This author was the first

49
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:21,949
person to tell it like it is and I could sense
that... And then I noticed, it said at the

50
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:29,250
bottom of the text '50 Cent'. I was confused,
50 Cent, the rapper, wrote a book? I had listened

51
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,240
to 50 ever since I had an MP3 player. Through
his music, the way he was presented on MTV

52
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,350
and his movie Get Rich or Die Tryin' he had
become something like an idol to me. Especially

53
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,200
as I lacked a strong father figure, I had
searched for people to admire in music & movies.

54
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,279
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Lee, Van Damme,
even Eminem being some of the others. But

55
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,449
I had never imagined 50 Cent writing a book
and who was this Robert Greene? How are they

56
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,180
connected?
So, instead of going home I decided to check

57
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,259
for myself. For the first time of my life,
I voluntarily entered a book shop. I entered

58
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:11,689
a new world of possibilites & freedom, not
that I knew it at the time.

59
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:16,569
Excuse me, do you have a book called The 50th
Law? - Who's it from?" - "Umm, 50 Cent." She

60
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:22,089
gave me a weird look & typed it into the keyboard.
"With Robert Greene?", "I think so, yea.",

61
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:26,629
"Looks like we've got one copy here. Just
a moment.", "She disappeared behind a staff

62
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:32,199
only door and came back with a black covered
book, golden scripture.", "That'll be 19 francs

63
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,909
90."
I was so all over the place I hadn't even

64
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:41,040
checked the insides of my wallet. I had one
20 francs bill with me, a complete coincidence.

65
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,150
When I look back at that moment, I think about
just how inexpensive changing your life can

66
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:52,139
be. Books are a bargain. The value of a book
should never be underestimated. Reading should

67
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,250
never be underestimated and someone should
fire all those idiots in charge of what material

68
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,699
is to be read in the public school system.
You know what, the whole school system is

69
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,789
fucking outdated. What a bunch of morons in
authority of our education. Once you're out

70
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,620
you gotta unlearn school, if you want to make
it big. What a fucking joke.

71
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,000
I didn't wait at all. I started reading the
book on the bus all the way home and continued

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,670
going through chapter after chapter in my
bed. Now I couldn't put it aside. It was like

73
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,699
a scene from a movie, where the main protagonist,
who has been hit by life's hardships finally

74
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,560
has that vital moment of awakening. Every
chapter, every line, every quote resonated

75
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,569
with me so deeply I felt incredible. I had
never read something so true and life-changing.

76
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,779
I finished the book in one sitting. The time
had passed so quickly I didn't realize it

77
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:45,529
was 3 in the morning. But I didn't need to
go to sleep. This couldn't wait. I sat down

78
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:49,629
on the computer and started writing everything
that was going through my head. I revisited

79
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,689
all the pages I had marked, wrote down what
I was doing wrong, what I had to change and

80
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:59,730
how I would go about it. The essence of the
book, Nihil Timendum Est, FEAR NOTHING became

81
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:05,790
my personal motto, my mantra. I'd repeat it
to myself every time I felt slightly anxious,

82
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,020
every time I hesitated & eventually taking
decisive, bold action wasn't something I had

83
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:15,810
to think about anymore, I didn't need to push
myself to it, it became my natural reaction.

84
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,389
I wouldn't be afraid of anything, I wouldn't
cower in my bed, covered in the fetal position

85
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,650
anymore, whishing things had been and had
gone different, I wasn't going to ask myself

86
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:30,229
any longer 'what if, this or what if, that...',
I wouldn't hesitate chatting up that beautiful

87
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,520
girl, I wouldn't be afraid of standing up
for myself, I wouldn't be afraid of pushing

88
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,370
past my comfort zone, instead I looked forward
to it and most important of all I wouldn't

89
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,959
be afraid of failing my exams & even if I
failed, fuck the school system, I would either

90
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:49,769
find or create another way, a way to survive
whatever the scenario, only a complete fool

91
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:55,259
would not employ someone of my calibre. Yes,
I didn't have the best marks and yes, I didn't

92
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:01,449
fit into this mindless, drug-taking, alcohol-consuming
mess of a group I thought of as my only friends,

93
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,829
but I did have not only the brains, but the
courage to question the system I was in and

94
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:11,279
to do whatever it took to make it work for
me... not the other way around. I swore to

95
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,388
myself I wouldn't slave away for someone else's
benefit until the age of retirement and still

96
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:22,100
worry about how I'm going to pay my bills.
I could not pity myself anymore. I had never,

97
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,550
and still to this day have never, asked myself
'Why is it always me?', that's a stupid question,

98
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,719
because it implies that only you are suffering...
bad shit happens to everyone, but to say I

99
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,709
had never felt like screaming it at the top
of my lungs would be a lie. It just so happened

100
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:44,179
that I had much more shit to go through than
most. Your first 18-24 years you're a leaf

101
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,099
in the fucking wind. You don't choose your
circumstances, but wishing it were different

102
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,749
doesn't change anything.
So, if you're still watching this I take it

103
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:58,028
you can relate on some level & I'd like to
share what lessons I took away from the 50th

104
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:02,708
Law. Now I'm going to make this short and
to the point. As humans we do tend to overcomplicate

105
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,778
things and I'm completely sold to the idea
that it can be as simple as what's coming

106
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,370
now.
1. Intense Realism

107
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,198
We live in an age of general anxiety. We fear
not, if we'll survive the next attack from

108
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:19,469
an enemy tribe, if we'll gather and hunt enough
natural resources to sustain ourselves or

109
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,540
if we'll find shelter and warmth nearby a
fireplace in a cave. While the intensity of

110
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:29,730
the dangers we face lessened throughout human
evolution, our sense of fear, an emotion that

111
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,659
kept us alive, manifested in a different form,
one that greatly limits our potential and

112
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:40,230
our worries dramatically grew in number.
Instead of real threats, we began to fear

113
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,659
the loss of material wealth, worry about our
status in society, about what the unknown

114
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:49,929
future will bring, about illness and growing
old, things as petty and nonessential as the

115
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:55,188
uneducated opinions of people we personally
dislike. Not until we have a near death experience

116
00:09:55,188 --> 00:10:00,639
or almost lose one of our loved ones are we
reminded of what truly matters. And it's at

117
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,539
this point, when we live through a tragedy,
that we are aware, that we see the world through

118
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:11,049
our heart... for a couple of days, maybe even
weeks, until we forget and get sucked back

119
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:16,528
into focusing on our next promotion, social
acceptance and superficial qualities.

120
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:21,028
We avoid the truth and seek comfort in lies
we get told and tell ourselves. For every

121
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:26,389
unpleasant thought we have, there's someone
soothing playing to our fantasies. They might

122
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:31,278
say "You shouldn't worry about your time on
earth, you will live a better life after death,

123
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:37,869
if you believe in and join our religion / cause."
Or they might say "It is not your fault you

124
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:44,829
feel miserable, they are the ones responsible
for your suffering. Help us fight them collectively."

125
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:50,198
And they may also say "You do not have to
work hard at all, play it smart instead and

126
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:56,808
buy our program. We guarantee easy and fast
results. Just follow our secret code to cheat

127
00:10:56,808 --> 00:11:01,539
the system." And we choose to listen to them,
because it's what we want to hear. The truth

128
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:07,610
is more often than not undesirable. Honesty
is punished. We get mad at people who tell

129
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,300
the truth. Stating the obvious has become
a social faux-pas resulting in modernday which

130
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:17,998
hunts designed to ruin our lives, if we don't
fit in, thus further encouraging group think

131
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:22,920
and growing our fear of not belonging, of
standing out with genuine authenticity, thus

132
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,899
drawing unwanted attention to ourselves.
See the reality of the world you live in.

133
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,308
Question the status quo. Knowledge is power.
The more you obtain of it the better off you

134
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:37,808
are. Remind yourself constantly what's important
and what isn't. We've been wired in a way

135
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:42,919
that makes us pay attention to the negative
and black out the positive. You're aware of

136
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:48,338
this and you don't let yourself be seduced
by comfortable lies, constant outrage and

137
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:53,709
wishful thinking.
2. Self-Reliance

138
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:58,518
Being independent. Relying on nobody else,
but yourself is probably the greatest achievement

139
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,480
for any humanbeing. What's more dangerous
and appealing, than a person who doesn't need

140
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,058
anyone and anything. You don't like what they
have to offer, you just walk away. You got

141
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:13,868
leverage, you don't have to depend on anyone.
You either find a way or you make one. No

142
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:18,480
one holds great power over you, because you
can survive without them. They cannot control

143
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,289
you as you don't require them one bit. Be
self-reliant and no challenge is too big for

144
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:28,099
you. Your resilience is incredible. Where
others wait for things to happen, you've already

145
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,449
gotten into the habit of making things happen
years ago. You trust yourself, because you

146
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:36,838
know what you're capable of. You start by
taking small steps into the right direction

147
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,220
and every step you take adds to your confidence.
I'm reviewing Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay

148
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,519
on Self-Reliance next. I expand upon what
it means to be and how to become self-reliant.

149
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,078
This whole chapter in the 50th law was inspired
by Emerson's essay. It's had a tremendous

150
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,618
impact on Robert Greene. And I'm convinced
you'll draw value from it for yourself.

151
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:02,399
3. Opportunism
Open your eyes, opportunities are everywhere

152
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,178
around you, but they have a lifespan - a time
window, so you have to act swiftly. Time doesn't

153
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:13,240
wait for you. Time doesn't wait for anyone.
When 50 saw he could tap into the music business

154
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,909
& leave behind dealing drugs & gang wars on
the streets, he took that opportunity & ran

155
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:22,669
with it. He understood, the time to act boldly
had come. He established himself swiftly,

156
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,828
before that life on the streets would have
gotten him killed or imprisoned for life.

157
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:31,458
Start looking for a way out & when you see
a chance for yourself, take it. Look, if you

158
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,838
had, one shot, or one opportunity. To seize
everything you ever wanted. In one moment.

159
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,639
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
That's the intro to Lose Yourself by Eminem.

160
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,100
And if you can relate to this, you know exactly
what I'm talking about. You might not be able

161
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,170
to get out of it tomorrow. You gotta leave
the hood behind. Crime is not worth it in

162
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:55,849
the longrun. Realize the one's keeping you
from getting out, the ones saying you've changed

163
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,499
and you're not you anymore, they're not your
friends. They're fucking losers. You don't

164
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:06,699
owe them a thing. You don't need them for
you count on nobody else but yourself. Remember,

165
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:09,938
you're self-reliant.
There's a good reason Greene's books are the

166
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:14,828
most-read in prison. They know the streets
& they wanna leave that shit behind, man.

167
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:20,438
This applies everywhere. In business, especially
today, keep looking for opportunities. You

168
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:24,789
don't owe your company shit. They will saw
you off the minute they can replace you with

169
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:29,849
someone more cost-efficient. Doesn't matter
how much smarter you are. It's a profit-driven

170
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,819
machine, there's no room for feelings. The
guy telling you you're fired won't give a

171
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:39,678
fuck about you ending up underneath a brige
with your family, why would you be so foolish

172
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:44,499
to give a fuck about him? You might feed the
lion one second and the next he's fucking

173
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:49,629
eating you, alright? Because it's not enough,
it's never enough in this business driven

174
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:55,199
economy. Especially since your'e being exploited.
You depend on that job to keep food on the

175
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,368
table, you're not self-reliant. I know it's
tough, no one said it was easy. You have to

176
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:05,149
get more income sources going. That's just
a fact in today's world. You got the internet.

177
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:08,480
Get creative. Otherwise you're building on
quicksand.

178
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,119
4. Momentum
It takes more energy to push an object than

179
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:18,360
to keep it moving. The most difficult part
is starting. Taking that first bold action,

180
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,089
even though it's scary, and establishing momentum.
Keeping at it day in and day out. Greatness

181
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,739
is developed through hours and hours every
day of the week, every month of the year.

182
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:33,459
Don't allow any slack. If your day sucked
shit, go to bed and start again. It's not

183
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:38,549
an excuse, that you if failed on Monday you
keep failing on Tuesday. You keep going. You

184
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:43,169
gotta have that vision. See the light at the
end of the tunnel and remind yourself everytime

185
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:48,178
you think about giving up that you will never
see the light and make it out if you quit.

186
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:52,958
You cannot stop now, you've come to far to
give up. You're being watched. I don't care

187
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,528
if it's your father, your mother, your siblings,
your partner, your children. They are watching

188
00:15:57,528 --> 00:16:02,470
you and they expect you to do great things.
They expect you to lead by example and make

189
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:09,939
them proud. You cannot quit, you must keep
going. Repeat after me. I can, I will, I must.

190
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:14,568
Breathe life into it. There's no plan B. Good.
5. Resisting

191
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:19,678
Oh man this is the worst. Look around you
& tell me honestly - what do you see? You

192
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:25,019
see a bunch of mediocre, average, unoriginal
copies of eachother blindly following along

193
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:29,948
without questioning anything and they're all
coping. They're trying to ease the pain they

194
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:34,738
feel, because they've given up. They're coping
with alcohol, drugs, junk food, material possessions

195
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:40,189
and the worst about it is. They become a slave
to their possessions. They cannot resist giving

196
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:45,039
in to addiction. Giving in to vices and feeling
out of control about it. I don't know one

197
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,480
person, myself included, that isn't or hasn't
been addicted to some destructive habit. Most

198
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,079
of us are literally incapable of taking care
of our bodies and what we put into it, because

199
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:59,519
we lack self-discipline. I had a friend who
smokes two packs a day and he's been saying

200
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,199
how he wants to quit for over 3 years now.
He knows what to do, but he can't. I'm no

201
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,250
saint, either. I fucking love video games.
It's the worst thing that's ever happened

202
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,769
to me. Immediate gratification, endless fun,
a way to escape my problems. I sit on my computer

203
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:19,970
conquering the whole world as Napeoleon Bonaparte,
what a time to be alive, right? It's a double

204
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,370
edged sword really. I've become pretty good
at disciplining myself today, but I'm afraid

205
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:28,969
of getting anywhere near videogames for they
will consume me. I lose all sense of time

206
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,829
and give up on everything that's important.
I can wake up feeling ready for a tough workout,

207
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:38,059
sit down & start a game, get comfortable within
minutes and then feel like 'fuck it, I'll

208
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:43,529
workout tomorrow.' So I don't allow myself
to do that. I don't buy or even install video

209
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,789
games anymore. I resist being a slave to what's
addicting to me.

210
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:52,279
50 Cent's example was being around drugs all
day. When you're selling that stuff on the

211
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,500
streets of Queens, a question presents itself.
Do you try your own product? Do you get high

212
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:04,130
& drunk at parties all week long? 50 saw what
it made out of people. He saw living examples

213
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,330
of what would happen with him. It's not pretty
being a crackfiend, so he made the decision

214
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:15,119
to stay away from it. Look, 50's music is
all about how hard he parties all day long.

215
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,319
"In da club" is the record that made him famous.
He doesn't actually do any of that. While

216
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,629
you're in the club getting drunk and listening
to his songs, he's working on his new album,

217
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,960
on his movies, on his vitamin water. He's
hustling his ass off, while you think it's

218
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,710
all about party, hoes & streetlife. Resist
being average guys. And I know some of you

219
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,150
beat yourselves up over it. We're all human
we're not perfect. And taking control of ourselves

220
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,100
builds our character. Self-discipline comes
with happiness.

221
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:50,549
6. Authority
This is about leadership. Picture Leonidas,

222
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,829
king of the Spartans or any great leader for
that matter. Picture Alexander the Great,

223
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:59,609
leading the spearhead of his cavalry. They
have no fear. How else, could they set the

224
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:05,359
tone and be in charge. Look at a pack of wolves,
they follow the strongest, fiercest leader,

225
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,169
not the weak and defenseless. If you're going
to lead the people following you to success

226
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:16,320
they will follow you. If you've got no followers,
you're not worth following. You want authority,

227
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,389
you have to earn it. Work for it.
7. Connection

228
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:25,070
I've already talked about this. In Robert's
words Know your environment inside out.

229
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:29,859
Direct quote "Most people think first of what
they want to express or make, then find the

230
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:34,669
audience for their idea. You must work the
opposite angle." Now what stuck with me from

231
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,910
Ayn Rand's Fountainhead was the architect
saying something along the lines of "I don't

232
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,600
build in order to sell, I sell in order to
build." It's not quite the same, but I'll

233
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,419
leave it up to you to make the connection.
A little word play here.

234
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,279
8. Mastery
Greene went ahead and made a whole book in

235
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:59,440
addition to this chapter. You can become a
master if you put in the time. No matter what

236
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,900
environment you were brought up in. If a 12
year old orphan can build an empire without

237
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,830
going to school, then fighting 4-5 years older
dealers for territory, then running the streets,

238
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:14,569
then dominating the music industry and then
selling shit like vitamin water. I'm still

239
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:19,960
baffled that actually sells, than so can you.
Check out my review on Mastery here. Don't

240
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,309
worry, it'll open up in a new tab.
9. Self-Belief

241
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:29,789
To me this all ties down to being self-reliant.
Being fearless demands you trust yourself

242
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:35,279
with such strength, that you have no doubts,
when it comes to your success. Your confidence

243
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,289
is grounded on knowing who you are and seeing
yourself in action. It's not just a mental

244
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:45,829
shift. You're congruent. Your words, thoughts
and actions are in alignment. In other words,

245
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:50,629
you're for real. You're not arrogant, you're
just so far beyond what your average person

246
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,650
looks like that you can't help but believe
in yourself. You've faced far more serious

247
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,930
problems than the fears of the mediocre. Their
limits are a joke to you. And they should

248
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:08,620
be. Believe in yourself.
10. Mortality

249
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:14,539
We are going to die. There is no way around
it. You fear death, because you fear life.

250
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,539
If you were living life to the fullest, you
would be prepared to die at any moment. Like

251
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,629
let's imagine for a second, this was our final
destination, I know it's a scary thought,

252
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,190
but bear with me. If we asked ourselves right
now "Did I truly live the life I wanted and

253
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,450
make the most out of it?" The answer for most
of us would be "No, not really.", but here's

254
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,569
the positive. It's not too late for us, we're
very fortunate to have opportunities that

255
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:40,799
our ancestors couldn't even dream up. You
can start right now and if you've already

256
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,399
started, you can keep going. Every morning
you wake up is a blessing. You might not see

257
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,750
that, because you hate your job, I've been
there, but that doesn't mean you hate life.

258
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,920
Your job is the problem. It's designed to
waste your life, so the people you're working

259
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,330
for live all the memories & stories that you
deserve. You want a reason to subscribe? I'll

260
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:04,379
go hard on this subject very soon, on how
to make the system work for you, not the other

261
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,190
way around.
Live an extraordinary life. Your days are

262
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,309
numbered. You won't get another chance. This
is what you've got. You can play and win the

263
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:16,559
game with the hand you've been dealt. It's
up to you how well you execute, no matter

264
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,190
the circumstances you were born in. You might
have to work harder than everybody else in

265
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,850
order for it to pay off in the end, but you
can't expect anything, if you waste your time.

266
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:29,589
Eventually, every second you chose to sacrifice
for immediate gratification will accumulate

267
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:34,329
and hit you hard. Value your time, invest
it intelligently, know who to have time for

268
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:39,490
and how much, appreciate every moment and
you will see positive results. If you fuck

269
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,559
up today, start again tomorrow. Not new year's
eve, but the second you wake up, it's on.

270
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,359
Break the devil's cycle, before you become
entrenched in it.

271
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,209
Once you realize, once you believe this, I
wholeheartedly do, you can stop wishing for

272
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,000
things to happen, you can let go of the negative
experiences you've had in your past and focus

273
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,140
on living in the present, while preparing
for the future. And I said preparing for the

274
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,680
future, not worrying about it.
All our lives are temporary. You feel uncomfortable

275
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,310
hearing that, because you're most likely concious
you're wasting more time, than you should.

276
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:18,309
We all are. Have a sense of urgency. I love
ancient history and one of the things they

277
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:23,009
believed is that the gods are doomed for they
live forever. The fact that we won't live

278
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:27,730
forever makes everything better. Every moment
is precious. Our memory of our loved ones

279
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,230
and past relationships pains us, when in fact
it's how we will be remembered that will make

280
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:37,809
us live on. We all know of Achilles, because
his story was written down in the Iliad and

281
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:42,970
you don't have to storm Troy to reach immortality,
but realize that your time in this world is

282
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,620
limited. Time cannot be recovered, so invest
it wisely. Most of us need to stop thinking

283
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:56,449
tomorrow and start thinking NOW. Not sometime
later today, but right now. Life is precious,

284
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,740
because it ends.
Thank you for being here, for not getting

285
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:07,140
offended by nothing, for actually facing the
reality like a strong and smart person should,

286
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,850
for not giving up on yourself, I know it's
hard sometimes... and most importantly, thank

287
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:17,829
you for having the courage and the strength
to be your self. Nihil Timendum Est. Fear

288
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:21,909
nothing... That's it... that's all I got.
Talk to you soon.
