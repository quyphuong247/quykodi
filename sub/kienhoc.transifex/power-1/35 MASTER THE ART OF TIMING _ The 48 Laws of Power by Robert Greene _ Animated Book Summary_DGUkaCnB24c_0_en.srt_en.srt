The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 35: Master the Art of Timing

2
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:15,939
Never seem to be in a hurry—hurrying betrays
a lack of control over yourself, and over

3
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:19,769
time. Always seem patient, as if you know
that everything will come to you eventually.

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,960
Become a detective of the right moment; sniff
out the spirit of the times, the trends that

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,769
will carry you to power. Learn to stand back
when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike

6
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:35,030
fiercely when it has reached fruition.
Time is an artificial concept that we ourselves

7
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,768
have created to make the limitlessness of
eternity and the universe more bearable, more

8
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:45,238
human. Since we have constructed the concept
of time, we are also able to mold it to some

9
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,599
degree, to play tricks with it. The time of
a child is long and slow, with vast expanses;

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,189
the time of an adult whizzes by frighteningly
fast.

11
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:59,670
Joseph Fouché, initially a mathematics teaching
priest, never took his vows. He had waited

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,198
for his chance to follow bigger dreams and
when 1789 the French Revolution broke out,

13
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,548
he became a revolutionary. To miss the boat
at this critical moment could have spelt disaster.

14
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,590
Fouché merely adapted to the spirit of the
times.

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,170
Befriending the revolutionary Robespierre,
he quickly rose in the rebel ranks and was

16
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,509
elected as the representative of Nantes to
the National Convention created that year

17
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:27,618
to frame a new constitution for a French republic.
When Fouché arrived in Paris to take his

18
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:32,319
seat at the convention, a violent rift had
broken out between the moderates and the radical

19
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,618
Jacobins. Fouché sensed that in the long
run neither side would emerge victorious.

20
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,590
Power rarely ends up in the hands of those
who start a revolution, or even of those who

21
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,640
further it; power sticks to those who bring
it to a conclusion. That was the side Fouché

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,899
wanted to be on.
Until his death he would change sides several

23
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:55,599
more times, supporting the execution of Louis
XVI, turning against his former friend Robespierre,

24
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,468
then supporting a young Napoleon, only to
be conspiring against him alongside Talleyrand

25
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:04,399
later on.
Fouché had remarkable patience. Without patience

26
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,318
as your sword and shield, your timing will
fail and you will inevitably find yourself

27
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,969
a loser. When the times were against Fouché,
he did not struggle, get emotional or strike

28
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:17,818
out rashly. He kept his cool and remained
a low profile, patiently building support

29
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,488
among the citizenry, the bulwark in his next
rise to power.

30
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,860
Observing this law closely; here are the 10.
Key Lessons in the Art of Timing

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,000
1. It is critical to recognize the spirit
of the times.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,120
2. You must always work with the times, anticipate
twists and turns, and never miss the boat.

33
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,590
3. Recognize time not by what is loudest and
most obvious in it but by what lies hidden

34
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,500
and dormant.
4. Recognizing the prevailing winds does not

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,848
necessarily mean running with them.
5. Any potent social movement creates a powerful

36
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:50,479
reaction, and it is wise to anticipate what
that reaction will be,

37
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,908
6. Rather than ride the cresting wave of the
moment, wait for the tide's ebb to carry you

38
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,120
back to power.
7. Upon occasion bet on the reaction that

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,709
is brewing, and place yourself in the vanguard
of it.

40
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:01,039
8. Without patience as your sword and shield,
your timing will fail and you will inevitably

41
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,269
find yourself a loser.
9. Do not struggle, get emotional, or ..

42
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:01,599
10. Keep your cool and maintain a low profile,
patiently building support to your rise to

43
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,318
power. (Christopher Columbus)
"Recognize the moment, then, to hide in the

44
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:08,048
grass or slither under a rock, as well as
the moment to bare your fangs and attack.

45
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,200
Space we can recover, time never." Napoleon
Bonaparte, 1769-1821

46
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,219
Time depends on perception, which can be willfully
altered. This is vital in mastering the art

47
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:21,329
of timing. If the inner turmoil caused by
our emotions tends to make time move faster,

48
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,769
it follows that once we control our emotional
responses to events, time will move much more

49
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,938
slowly. This altered way of dealing with things
tends to lengthen our perception of future

50
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:35,299
time, opens up possibilities and allows us
the patience that is the principal requirement

51
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,430
in the art of timing.
And that is it for this law, please feel free

52
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,569
to dive in deeper into part II "Mastering
Time" and as always thank's for watching.
