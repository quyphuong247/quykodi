1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:07,790
7 most common forms of "controlling the options"
1. Color the Choices. As President Richard

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,019
Nixon's secretary of state, Kissinger considered
himself better informed than his boss, and

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,780
believed that in most situations he could
make the best decision on his own. Kissinger

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,600
would propose three or four choices of action
for each situation, and would present them

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:30,920
in such a way that the one he wanted would
sound the most superior. This is an excellent

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,210
device to use on the insecure master.
2. Force the Resister. One of the main problems

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,920
faced by Dr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer
of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,829
relapse. His patients would soon relapse into
old habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming

9
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:54,009
to see him. To avoid this, Erickson began
ordering some patients to have a relapse,

10
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:59,698
to make themselves feel as bad as when they
first came in—to go back to square one.

11
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,390
Faced with this option, the patients would
usually "choose" to avoid the relapse— which,

12
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,028
of course, was what Erickson really wanted.
3. Alter the Playing Field. In the 1860s,

13
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:15,608
John D. Rockefeller set out to create an oil
monopoly. He began secretly buying up the

14
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:20,399
railway companies that transported the oil.
When he then attempted to take over a particular

15
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:25,549
company, he reminded them of their dependence
on the rails. Refusing them shipping, or simply

16
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,700
raising their fees, could ruin their business.
Rockefeller altered the playing field so that

17
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,630
the only options the small oil producers had
were the ones he gave them.

18
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:41,449
4. The Shrinking Options The late-nineteenth-century
art dealer Ambroise Vollard perfected this

19
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,189
technique. Customers would come to Vollard's
shop to see some Cézannes. He would show

20
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:51,858
three paintings, neglect to mention a price,
and pretend to doze off. The visitors would

21
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:56,598
have to leave without deciding. They would
usually come back again and again, and would

22
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,539
be shown paintings of lesser value every time.
Finally the buyers would realize they had

23
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,849
better grab what he was showing them, because
tomorrow they would have to settle for something

24
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:11,730
worse, perhaps at even higher prices.
5. The Weak Man on the Precipice The weak

25
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:16,348
are the easiest to maneuver by controlling
their options. Cardinal de Retz, the great

26
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:22,039
seventeenth-century provocateur, served as
an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orleans,

27
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,658
who was notoriously indecisive. Retz discovered
a way to handle him: He would describe all

28
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:32,848
sorts of dangers, exaggerating them as much
as possible, until the duke saw a yawning

29
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:37,738
abyss in every direction except one: the one
Retz was pushing him to take.

30
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,680
6. Brothers in Crime This is a classic con-artist
technique: You attract your victims to some

31
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,989
criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood
and guilt between you. They participate in

32
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,400
your deception, commit a crime and are easily
manipulated. Serge Stavisky, the great French

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,109
con artist of the 1920s, so entangled the
government in his scams and swindles that

34
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:04,569
the state did not dare to prosecute him, and
"chose" to leave him alone.

35
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:11,139
7. The Horns of a Dilemma This idea was demonstrated
by General William Sherman's infamous march

36
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:16,468
through Georgia during the American Civil
War. Although the Confederates knew what direction

37
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:21,299
Sherman was heading in, they never knew if
he would attack from the left or the right,

38
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,468
for he divided his army into two wings—and
if the rebels retreated from one wing they

39
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:30,299
found themselves facing the other.
But be warned...

40
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,810
This tactic works best for those whose power
is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly

41
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,468
without incurring suspicion, resentment, and
anger. As a rule, it is rarely wise to be

42
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:47,030
seen as exerting power directly and forcefully.
It is usually more elegant and more effective

43
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,989
to give people the illusion of choice.
There are situations in which it is to your

44
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,450
advantage to allow your rivals a large degree
of freedom: As you watch them operate, you

45
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:01,188
give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather
information, and plan your deceptions.
