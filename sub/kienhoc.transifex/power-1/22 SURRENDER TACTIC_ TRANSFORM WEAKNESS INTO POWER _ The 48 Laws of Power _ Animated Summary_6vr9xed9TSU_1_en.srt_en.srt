Law Number 22... Surrender Tactic: Transform
Weakness into Power

2
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:17,649
When you are weak, never fight for honor’s
sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender

3
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:22,679
gives you time to recover, time to wait for
his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction

4
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,539
of fighting and defeating you- surrender first.
By turning the other cheek, you infuriate

5
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,019
and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool of
power.

6
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,549
8 Reasons to Surrender
1. When you are weak, there is nothing to

7
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:39,219
gain by fighting a useless fight.
2. No one comes to help a weaker adversary;

8
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:43,009
they will not put themselves in danger.
3. You are alone and must submit.

9
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,259
4. Fighting gives you nothing but martyrdom.
5. People who do not believe in your cause

10
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:50,409
also die.
6. Never sacrifice time for recovering in

11
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:52,959
exchange for honor in a battle that you cannot
win.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,719
7. Surrender conceals great power.
8. Lulling your enemy into complacency gives

13
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,010
you time to recoup, undermine and revenge.
In 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Goujian

14
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:07,280
of Yue suffered a horrible defeat from the
ruler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Goujian

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,228
wanted to flee, but he had an adviser who
told him to surrender and to place himself

16
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:15,618
in the service of the ruler of Wu, from which
position he could study the man and plot his

17
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:20,450
revenge. Deciding to follow this advice, Goujian
gave the ruler all of his riches, and went

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,030
to work in his conqueror's stables as the
lowest ser­vant.

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,609
For three years he humbled himself before
the ruler, who then, finally satisfied of

20
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:34,030
his loyalty, allowed him to return home. Inwardly,
however, Goujian had spent those three years

21
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,239
gathering information and plotting re­venge.
When a terrible drought struck Wu, and the

22
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,149
kingdom was weak­ened by inner turmoil, he
raised an army, invaded, and won with ease.

23
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:47,659
That is the power behind surrender: It gives
you the time and the flexibility to plot a

24
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,570
devastating counter-blow. Had Goujian run
away, he would have lost this chance.

25
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:56,839
What is the Point of Surrendering?
You use surrender to gain access to your enemy.

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,049
You learn his ways, insinuate yourself with
him slowly, outwardly conform to his customs,

27
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,909
but inwardly maintain your own culture. You
will emerge victorious, for while he con­siders

28
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,739
you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions
against you, you are using the time to catch

29
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:17,109
up and surpass him. This soft, permeable form
of in­vasion is often the best, for the enemy

30
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:20,430
has nothing to react against, prepare for,
or resist

31
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,829
The point of surrendering is to save your
hide for a later date when you can reassert

32
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:29,349
yourself. It is precisely to avoid martyrdom
that one surren­ders, but there are times

33
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,918
when the enemy will not relent, and martyrdom
seems the only way out. Furthermore, if you

34
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,949
are willing to the surrender tactic, others
may gain power and inspiration from your example.

35
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:43,169
If you find yourself temporarily weakened,
the surrender tactic is perfect for raising

36
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:48,019
yourself up again—it disguises your ambition;
it teaches you patience and self-control,

37
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,439
key skills in the game; and it puts you in
the best possible position for taking advantage

38
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,750
of your op­pressor's sudden slide. If you
run away or fight back, in the long run you

39
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,400
cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost
always emerge victorious.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,260
And that's it for this law, hope you found
it resourceful and thank's for watching.

41
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:10,370
One more thing; I now got a Twitter account
for new uploads & quotes from the book. If

42
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,739
that floats your boat, you may wanna follow
me. *the author laughs,

43
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,000
because he's so EFFIN FUNNY!*
