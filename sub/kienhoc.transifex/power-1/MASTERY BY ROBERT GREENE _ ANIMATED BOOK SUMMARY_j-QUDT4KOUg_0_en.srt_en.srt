1
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:18,089
I remember, when I was studying economics
about 4 years ago and I had to write this

2
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,820
50-page dissertation on a one-month internship.
I was working at a construction site and it

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,750
wasn't really an internship, to begin with.
I wasn't treated preferentially in any way

4
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,320
and I had no one showing me around or explaining
just about anything, so I mostly worked long

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,250
days of pure physical labor with only half
an hour of lunch time. Now, while the other

6
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,730
students of my class were sitting in an office
comfortably complaining about having nothing

7
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:45,279
to do, I was outside by 30-something degrees
with an obligatory helmet on my head that

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,179
seemed to absorb and contain all the sunbeams
in case I wasn't already sweating profusely.

9
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:54,698
However, I preferred it to the other half
of the time, when it rained like I was standing

10
00:00:54,698 --> 00:01:00,509
underneath a waterfall, but the weather was
really just a minor thing. My fellow classmates

11
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:07,459
could start at 9 am and go home at 3 pm, whereas
I had to work twice as long and x-times as

12
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:12,530
hard. Ironically all of us were avoiding checking
the clock, so time would pass sooner, but

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,939
I wished it was out of boredom. After that
one month, what could have initially been

14
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:23,349
my summer holidays, the last thing I wanted
to do was write a 50-page dissertation. It

15
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:29,349
did not help, when school started again about
2 weeks later. All the homework, new assignments,

16
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:35,259
weekly exams, demanding projects - all of
it was too important to neglect and of immediate

17
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:38,078
priority.
So the deadline approached with remarkable

18
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,029
speed. And all of a sudden, we had one week
left to turn it in. (All of a sudden, right?

19
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,879
I totally have myself to blame and would act
differently today, but that was the mindset

20
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:54,078
I was in 4 years ago.) I did not even manage
to start Saturday, it was so much, that it

21
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,828
paralyzed me. I did not know where or how
to start and so I chose to waste the whole

22
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:07,250
day in denial. Predictibly irrational behaviour.
On Sunday, I managed to create a structure,

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,099
a table of content, that would match all the
objectives and ended up writing four quality

24
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,849
pages, not that much. I soon realized that
my biggest problem was the time I had to spend

25
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:24,569
additionally on researching. I had had no
time to take notes, since I had been lifting

26
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:30,180
heavy shit & operating machines all day. Nobody
on the construction site had the time or even

27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,219
the expertise to explain the business side
of things to me. With about 2 & a half hours

28
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,909
of sleep I went to class on Monday and as
it turned out, I wasn't the only one in this

29
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:45,799
self-imposed predicament and we all knew what
we had to do. Throughout the whole week, whatever

30
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:51,489
time window we had, we would work on our dissertations.
In every class with access to computers, of

31
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,449
which we didn't have many, in every 15 min
break once a day and even a class or two where

32
00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:02,199
we managed to escape without consequences.
My day and night cycle was ridicioulous. I'd

33
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:07,419
get home, completely exhausted, sleep for
3 hours and then work through the whole night.

34
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:12,000
I worked on it until it was time to get on
the bus again or until I felt so tired that

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,379
I read the same sentence 5 times and it still
didn't make any sense to me. Like I couldn't

36
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:22,418
read the alphabet anymore. The words just
became a meaningless pulp of symbols and every

37
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:28,590
few minutes I would realize my mind had wandered
off into a completely unrelated thought process

38
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,109
and I had lost track of what I was doing.
If that was the case I usually took a quick

39
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:38,639
2 hour nap to continue where I had left of.
Surprisingly that 2 hour nap was enough to

40
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:45,120
revitalize my energy. I was forcing the words
to come out, I had never written so creatively

41
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,049
and professionally before. We have to turn
it in by Friday, 12 am or we'll lose 20% of

42
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:57,019
the possible points. A disastrous punishment.
The whole week passed very quickly, but at

43
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:03,699
the same time it felt like 2 months. On Friday
11:30, 30 minutes before I had to hand it

44
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:09,000
in, I was ready to print the damn thing and
the fucking printer doesn't work. I almost

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,719
started panicking & then something took over,
I saw the world in slowmotion and we figured

46
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,120
it out. I ended up reaching it in on time,
but it felt like the whole week, every time

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,970
I resisted falling asleep or giving up and
I kept struggling and used every time window

48
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,400
imaginable contributed to me making it. As
I've mentioned in an earlier video, I call

49
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,089
this forced creativity, when you have no other
option, you start seeing solutions that weren't

50
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:43,529
there before. You become inventive and inspired
and conquer impossible odds.

51
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:48,259
The whole week is a blur to me, like a night
out you've completely forgotten through consuming

52
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,019
too much alcohol and then you slowly recover
some pieces of the puzzle, but you're not

53
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:57,539
able to put the whole picture together.
Months later we were called in student by

54
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,350
student and the teacher, who was notorious
for being the biggest asshole on campus, gave

55
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,750
me the best mark possible and even asked if
he could use the last part of my work for

56
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,060
future teaching. We're talking about a guy
who would rather cut his own foot off, than

57
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,870
give an undeserved good mark and big words
of admiration.

58
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,560
That dissertation to this day is one of my
best works and even reading it feels strange.

59
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,060
It's like someone with far superior skills
wrote it, I don't even remember writing many

60
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,370
of its parts, but I did write them. I know
that as a fact, because I can remember the

61
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,040
emotions I felt. Anxious that I wouldn't make
it, completely stressed out, but at the same

62
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,980
time like I was achieving something great
and a sort of pride that it wasn't a big enough

63
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,930
challenge for me, that I could not only make
it, but make it great. Believe me, when I

64
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,959
say. If I had done what seems to be the right
thing, to work a month in advance and invest

65
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,139
an hour every day, I would probably never
have reached that sort of focus, dedication

66
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,550
and creativity. It would not have been an
A+, that's for sure.

67
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,060
I remember that on Monday I felt the full
weight of what was on the line and I made

68
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,060
a decision, I was going to hustle. Not like
I was arrogantly proud, more like "Even, if

69
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,649
it all went down in a fiery blaze of hell,
at the very least, I would've tried and given

70
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:25,049
it my all and it worked out perfectly. Robert
Greene has told a very similar story to this

71
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,480
one about experiencing Mastery, ironically,
when his agents gave him a strict deadline

72
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,870
to finish writing Mastery. Now, I'm not comparing
my writing skills to Robert Greene's. He is

73
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,759
my favorite author and his skill is impeccable.
I'm comparing the situation, but even there

74
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,300
- the period of time, he was in that state,
was something around 8 weeks. No wonder he

75
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,420
says writing his books almost kills him. He
literally said I thought I was going to die.

76
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,150
As Greene said himself, the first 2-3 days
he felt anger and didn't want to accept the

77
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:01,620
situation, sort of wasting that time, but
then he realized what was on the line (his

78
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,110
book wouldn't have been published, a fucking
disaster) and decided to give it his best,

79
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,389
to try and make it happen and he did and it
worked out perfectly. That's one way to be

80
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:17,970
put on Deathground, whereas I had noone else
to blame but myself. But when I read Mastery

81
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,480
for the first time, I could relate so much,
because I had come to same conclusions Robert

82
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,470
Greene had. I was reading part of my own thoughts
in a much more eloquent and reasearched way.

83
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,690
However and this is where we get to the bottom
of things. What I just described is a glimpse

84
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:40,519
of what Mastery looks like, I immediately
went back to being normal, there was no deadline,

85
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:45,439
no need for taking on such a huge workload
in a challenging period of time. Imagine,

86
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:51,579
for a second, if Mastery, if how I handled
that situation was my regular way of living,

87
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:55,699
but I wouldn't feel drained of energy and
eventually burn out that way. That sort of

88
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:01,399
laser-like focus, determination and speed
would be the norm. I would have the feeling

89
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:08,209
that I have a greater command of reality,
other people and myself at all times. That

90
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:14,930
would be true Mastery. I'm working on it and
I hope you are, too.

91
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,810
Mastery by Robert Greene is by far one of
the best books you will ever read.

92
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,370
Mastery explains how you can become a leader
in any given field by examining the lives

93
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,199
and pathways to success of historical masters
such as Mozart, Einstein, Benjamin Franklin

94
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,560
and Darwin, as well as 'living' masters Greene
has interviewed. So for all of you struggling

95
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,179
with connecting the historical examples to
today, there's a lot to be learned by contemporary

96
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,149
masters who are crushing it in life right
now.

97
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:49,990
For all you power-hungry folks out there.
Understand this: the ultimate form of power

98
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:56,690
is mastery. As a master you are at the height
of your power and most people, not you, because

99
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,650
I believe in you, as you are in fact watching
a self-development video right now, but most

100
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:07,449
people won't ever achieve mastery in anything.
So the question is - why?

101
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:13,240
"Everyone holds his fortune in his own hands,
like a sculptor the raw material he will fashion

102
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,810
into a figure. But it's the same with that
type of artistic activity as with all others:

103
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,509
We are merely born with the capability to
do it. The skill to mold the material into

104
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:31,039
what we want must be learned and attentively
cultivated." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

105
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:37,639
That's the answer. All of us can, but few
of us will, because it's hard. It's difficult,

106
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,569
but it wouldn't be worth doing otherwise.
Let me tell you why most people feel really

107
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,620
fucking bad about themselves. They're miserable,
because everytime they face resistance they

108
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,250
have two options. a) Do something about it.
Solve the problem. Attack it head on. Work

109
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,039
hard. or b) choose the easy way. Choose immediate
gratification that will work against them

110
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,759
in the long run, and not to forget, blame
everyone & everything else. Take no responsibility

111
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:13,980
whatsoever and just wait for things to happen.
And that same kind of mindset makes them believe

112
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,320
they're not capable of doing great things.
Fact is they are capable, but it's so much

113
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,420
more comfortable to sit around and do nothing
while blaming your made-up, self-imposed inability

114
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:30,849
forced on you by the rich & famous, who want
to keep you down and are constantly conspiring

115
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,460
against you improving yourself. Please, for
your sake and mine. Don't think like that

116
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,850
and internalize "Only a break that is earned
is worth taking." It will make you so much

117
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,480
happier.
Keys to Mastery

118
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,450
Everyone can achieve Mastery / It is not a
lack of innate talent, superior genetics or

119
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,410
whatever else you blame it on. This wrong
notion that the successful people have something

120
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:04,719
you don't is comfortable thinking as it doesn't
require you to take action. No more excuses,

121
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,528
mastery can be achieved by anyone. I'm looking
at you. You are a future master, if you decide

122
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:15,639
to put in the hours it takes to get there.
That's good news and you should celebrate.

123
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,569
Nothing beats hard work. Winning the lottery
for example, it's a small fucking chance for

124
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,190
that anyways, as far as I'm concerned, it's
a government driven scam, playing on your

125
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,170
fantasies, but let's say you actually win
the lottery. That doesn't magically give you

126
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:33,799
any valuable skills, you'll have the money,
sure, but becoming a master at something you

127
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:39,159
love doing is so much more, than finding a
way to make good money with it. And waking

128
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:44,370
up everyday being able to do whatever it is
you want will only make you happy if you've

129
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:50,528
got a purpose. What's your why? Why do you
get up in the morning? If the answer is, because

130
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:56,269
you have to... that's not a good answer. To
me, becoming a little bit better every day

131
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,819
is the main reason I got the motivation to
jump out of bed in the morning with a smile,

132
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,080
because I'm constantly transforming as a human
being to becoming a better person and if I

133
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,000
can help others, like you, by doing so, that
will only make me a happier person.

134
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,139
Now, this is a personal mantra of mine. Born
a peasant die a king. Do not accept the roles

135
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:23,240
society foists on you. That's you born as
a peasant, right here, see? No offense. Aaaand

136
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,990
this is a crown, it implies that this guy
right here is a king, that can be you. Be

137
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:38,730
royal in your own fashion.
Rediscover your inner child's fascination

138
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,690
/ As children we tend to be drawn to something
naturally. It is through school, friends and

139
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,120
parenting that we get pushed into the opposite
direction. We're told to become lawyers and

140
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,240
doctors, we're told to go to college/university
and pursue the jobs that pay the highest salaries.

141
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,839
We're told to fit in and our uniqueness is
buried. No one asks us what we as individuals

142
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,620
would love to do. But here's the catch, we
can only truly master a field, if we're genuinely

143
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:14,549
driven by positive, core emotions like love
and passion for our craft. How else, could

144
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:20,490
you expect to be happy? You won't have the
necessary drive to make it, if you hate every

145
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,560
living second of whatever it is you feel forced
to do. Sorting through bland business documents

146
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,528
all day in some office cubicle I think is
the last thing anybody wants to do. Following

147
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:36,679
your heart will be an emotional rollecoaster
and the one and only essential thing that

148
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:42,049
will make you push through the hardships that
you will definitely live through is true,

149
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:49,899
geniune passion for what you do.
While reading through Mastery I made a bunch

150
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,860
of notes that I compiled into the next 20
lessons I felt are the most important. I know

151
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,690
it's a long video, but stick with me here,
I'm convinced you'll find it helpful and if

152
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,750
not I congratulate you for you must have already
mastered everything.

153
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:08,899
1) Know thyself, what kind of vocation or
career do you feel drawn to as an individual.

154
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:17,899
You absolutely have to figure that out.
2) Seek out mentors, commit to apprenticeships,

155
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:23,250
in which you'll undergo years of humble observation,
skill acquisition and making your own reference

156
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,789
experiences, instead of basing all your knowledge
on theoretical studies.

157
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:33,099
3) Revert to a feeling of deep humility and
open-mindedness, eager to learn from everyone.

158
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,330
4) Cross the threshold past the initial, fatiguing
stages of learning. Embrace resistance and

159
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,540
pain, dismiss of limiting comfort and false
sense of security latching on to what's familiar.

160
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:50,110
5) Once you've completed your apprencticeship,
make a shift. Take bold, self-secure actions

161
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,230
and apply your skills, connecting new ideas
and letting your own creativity free.

162
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,200
6) Learn to handle criticism and failure,
be grateful for the chance to grow and improve

163
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,720
through your mistakes.
7) The main separation of true masters to

164
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,889
others is not an intellectual, but an emotional
component. To quote Eric Thomas "In school

165
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:14,250
there were guys way smarter than me. [...] Most
of them aren't doing what I'm doing, why?

166
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,379
Cuz you gotta have heart."
8) Social intelligence is key to your way

167
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:25,399
to the top. Your ablility to emphasize with
people, see and understand their perspective

168
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,230
will prove most valuable. Again, you gotta
have heart, not just for what you do, but

169
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,200
for yourself and other people.
9) We tend to be judgemental, idealize or

170
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,670
even demonize people, chances are you might
not understand something they do. Be a neutral

171
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:45,860
observer when learning, don't project your
own thoughts, emotions and insecurities onto

172
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,730
others.
10) At the same time people will do that to

173
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,980
you. They could hinder your progress through
their envy, conformism, rigidity, narcassism,

174
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,120
laziness, irresponsibility and passive aggression.
Learn to dodge those vices like the potentially

175
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,750
deadly bullets they are.
11) Acta non verba. Speak through your accomplishments,

176
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,549
your point is proven, you can't be sabotaged.
Almost nothing good comes from talking about

177
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:15,769
your future projects to people who don't have
the same values, the same wordlview, as you

178
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,230
do.
12) Your ego will get in the way from time

179
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:25,399
to time. It's important to know you're not
your thoughts, your actions matter most. Hence

180
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,100
try to distance yourself emotionally from
your ego, see yourself through the lense of

181
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,350
others and work on your flaws and shortcomings.
13) Don't take criticism personally from people

182
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,870
who don't know what they're talking about.
Likewise, when criticizing someone, choose

183
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,429
your words carefully, make it constructive
and talk like an expert only on subjects you're

184
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:48,088
familiar with.
14) Remember how energetic and full of life

185
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:53,450
you were as a child? The sense of wonder and
endless curiosity about everything? Relearn

186
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,250
to see the world through that lense. It will
stimulate your creativity like nothing else.

187
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,289
15) Dispel of all your preconceived notions
about the world. Dismissing of all limiting

188
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:09,308
beliefs and releasing your imagination will
prove powerful beyond measure. Be as fluid

189
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:14,798
as water and think outside the box.
16) Change is good, unconventional approaches

190
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:20,489
are what starts innovation. Having unpopular
beliefs is a sign, you're onto something.

191
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:25,119
To quote Mark Twain "Whenever you find yourself
on the side of the majority - it is time to

192
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:30,069
pause and reflect." Challenge and question
popular ideas.

193
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:35,329
17) Learning is a gift on its own, soon enough
you'll be connecting a wide array of ideas

194
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:41,128
from different fields of study and disciplines
coming to conclusions on universal truths.

195
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:46,079
Take Josh Waitzkin for example. Once he mastered
the chessboard, he was able to transfer what

196
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,908
he learned onto his brazilian jiu jitsu and
master the sport within a much shorter period

197
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:56,499
of time.
18) What's your why? You have to visualize,

198
00:17:56,499 --> 00:18:01,220
write down and repeat what you're living for,
what's your purpose, what's your destiny?

199
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,909
Feel conciously connected to it and you won't
be able to wait to get up in the morning,

200
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,289
see what new challenges you'll face while
pursuing your dreams.

201
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:14,759
19) Picture success as a heavy rooftop and
the pillars to support it are self-discipline,

202
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:21,349
passion, persistence, concentration, sweat,
self-reliance, observance, confidence, self-trust,

203
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:25,689
commitment, modesty, formlessness, fearlessness
and openmindedness.

204
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,249
20) There's also ways to make that rooftop
lighter by dismissing of hindrances such as

205
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:38,339
complacency, conservatism, helplessness, impatience,
grandiosity, inflexibility, distractions,

206
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:44,720
egotism and overall negativity.
In closing, I wholeheartedly recommend reading

207
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,608
the book yourself. No amount of animated videos
would be able to serve as a substitute for

208
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:53,918
it or the other books for that matter. It's
probably one of the most important one's you'll

209
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,590
ever read. If you haven't realized by now
Robert Greene is one of the top authors living

210
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:04,569
today, I guess there's no saving you. I'm
joking, of course, but then again every joke

211
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:08,339
has a little bit of truth in it.
As always thanks for watching.

212
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:11,788
Don't miss out on my mentoring and subscribe
for more supplementary animated video book

213
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:31,749
summaries which will serve you on your own
way to becoming a true master.
