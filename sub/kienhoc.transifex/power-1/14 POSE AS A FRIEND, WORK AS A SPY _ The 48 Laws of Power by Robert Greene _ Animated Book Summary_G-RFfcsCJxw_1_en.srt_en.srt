The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene | Law Number 14... Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,179
Knowing about your rival is critical. Use
spies to gather valuable information that

3
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:21,719
will keep you a step ahead. Better still:
Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters,

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,049
learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to
get people to reveal their weaknesses and

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,160
intentions. There is no occasion that is not
an opportunity for artful spying.

on Your Payroll

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,189
1. You will gain some valuable information.
2. You will know their comings and goings,

8
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:43,369
changes in taste, and other such tidbits of
information that will be priceless.

9
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:48,009
3. You will appear to be all knowing because
you will be one step ahead of your competition.

10
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:53,460
4. Your knowledge of your mark can also make
you seem charming, so well can you anticipate

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,390
his desires.
5. No one sees the source of your power, and

12
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,799
what they cannot see they cannot fight.
The Risks of Hiring Spies

13
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,369
· You have little control over the people
who are doing the work.

14
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:12,000
· Perhaps they will ineptly expose your spying.
· They may secretly turn against you.

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,359
6 Tips on the Art of SPYING
1. Pose as a friend while secretly gathering

16
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,819
information.
People will think that you genuinely like

17
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:24,529
them and mistake your interest as friendship.
2. Learn to possess the ability to suppress

18
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,099
your thoughts in the conversation, speak when
only necessary.

19
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:32,030
3. Learn to make others talk endlessly about
themselves.

20
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:46,039
They will inadvertently reveal their intentions
and plans.

21
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:53,379
4. Organize social gathering with people whom
you are interested in knowing.

22
00:01:53,379 --> 00:02:09,349
This is when most people’s guards are down.
5. Stir up people’s emotions by contradicting

23
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,859
them.
In their emotional state they will reveal

24
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,209
all kinds of truths about themselves, truths
you can later use against them.

25
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,390
6. Give them a false confession.
By pretending to bare your heart to another

26
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:25,128
person, you make them more likely to reveal
their own secrets.

27
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:29,209
This can also be a test to see if you can
trust the person with your secret and reveal

28
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:34,340
their true character, loyalty and honesty.
This kind of knowledge is often the most valuable

29
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,050
to predict future actions.
The Risks of Spying Directly

30
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:45,630
· People may begin to suspect you are worming
secrets out of them under the guise of conversation.

31
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,340
· Your search for gems of information cannot
be too obvious.

32
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,959
· Your probing questions will reveal more
about yourself and your intentions than about

33
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,069
the information you hope to find about them.
Information is critical to power, but just

34
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:03,089
as you spy on other people, you must be prepared
for them to spy on you. One of the most potent

35
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,890
weapons in the battle for information, then,
is giving out false information. By feeding

36
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:13,208
people wrong information, then, you gain a
potent advantage. While spying gives you a

37
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,509
third eye, disinformation puts out one of
your enemy's eyes. A Cyclops, he always misses

38
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:46,238
his target.
