The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 36: Disdain things you cannot have

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,750
By acknowledging a petty problem you give
it existence and credibility. The more attention

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,990
you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him;
and a small mistake is often made worse and

4
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:24,269
more visible when you try to fix it. It is
sometimes best to leave things alone. If there

5
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,009
is something you want but cannot have, show
contempt for it. The less interest you reveal,

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,840
the more superior you seem.
In the year 1527, King Henry VIII of England

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,879
decided he had to find a way to get rid of
his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Catherine had

8
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,070
failed to produce a son, a male heir who would
ensure the continuance of his dynasty, and

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,439
Henry thought he knew why: He had read in
the Bible the passage, "And if a aman shall

10
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:53,640
take his brother's wife, it is an unclean
thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness;

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,460
they shall be childless." Before marrying
Henry, Catherine had married his older brother

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,798
Arthur, but Arthur had died five months later.
Henry had waited an appropriate time, then

13
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:08,099
had married his brother's widow.
Catherine was the daugher of King Ferdinand

14
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,390
and Queen Isabella of Spain, and by marrying
her Henry had kept alive a valuable alliance.

15
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,280
Now, however, Catherine had to assure him
that her brief marriage with Arthur had never

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,909
been consummated. Otherwise Henry would see
their marriage as null and void. Catherine

17
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:27,820
insisted that she had remained a virgin through
her marriage to Arthur, and Pope Clement VII

18
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:32,269
supported her by giving his blessing to the
union, which he could not have done had he

19
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:37,649
considered it incestuous.
The King, convinced that she was lying and

20
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:43,390
god punished them for their forbidden relationship,
Henry applied to the Vatican, but Pope Clement

21
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,968
would never annul the marriage.
And so, Henry simply started his own church,

22
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:52,759
putting himself at the top and annulling his
marriage that way. The Pope was furious and

23
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,879
kept threatening the King with excommunication
from the Catholic church, but King Henry simply

24
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,548
ignored him and his now banished-from-the-court
ex-wife completely.

25
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,770
When you pay attention to a person, the two
of you become partners of sorts, each moving

26
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:11,759
in step to the actions and reactions of the
other. In the process you lose your initiative.

27
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,500
It is a dynamic of all interactions: By acknowledging
other people, even if only to fight with them,

28
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,930
you open yourself to their influence. Had
Henry locked horns with Catherine, he would

29
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,040
have found himself mired in endless arguments
that would have weakened his resolve and eventually

30
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,389
worn him down. Henry would have none of this.
He played a devastating power game - total

31
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:37,469
disdain. By ignoring people you cancel them
out. This unsettles and infuriates them - but

32
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:41,378
since they have no dealings with you there's
nothing they can do.

33
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:46,120
"MAN: Kick him - he'll forgive you. Flatter
him - he may or may not see through you. But

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,158
ignore him and he'll hate you." Idries Shah,
Caravan of Dreams, 1968

35
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:56,459
There's essentially Two Strategies to Execute
The Sour-Grapes Approach: If there is something

36
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,069
you want but that you realize you cannot have
it, the worst thing you can do is draw attention

37
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:05,518
to your disappointment by complaining about
it. An infinitely more powerful tactic is

38
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,049
to act as if it never really interested you
in the first place.

39
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,188
And The Treating it Lightly Approach: When
you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people's

40
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:19,219
attention by making it clear that the attack
has not even registered. Look away, or answer

41
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:24,789
sweetly, showing how little the attack concerns
you. Similarly, when you yourself have committed

42
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:30,269
a blunder, the best response is often to make
less of your mistake by treating it lightly.

43
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,049
But as always be warned...
Develop the skill of sensing problems when

44
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:39,260
they are still small and taking care of them
before they become intractable. Learn to distinguish

45
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:44,060
between the potentially disastrous and the
mildly irritating, the nuisance that will

46
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,688
quietly go away on its own. In either case
never completely take your eye off it. As

47
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:53,400
long as it is alive it can smolder and spark
into life.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,938
And that is it for this law, as always thanks
for watching.
