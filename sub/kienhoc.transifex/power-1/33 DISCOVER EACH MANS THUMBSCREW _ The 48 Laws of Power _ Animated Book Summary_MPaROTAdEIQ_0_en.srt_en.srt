00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:12,669
The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 33: Discover Each Man's Thumbscrew

2
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:17,960
Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle
wall. That weakness is usually insecurity,

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,820
an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can
also be a small secret pleasure. Either way,

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,929
once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn
to your advantage.

5
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:31,879
One of the most important things to realize
about people is that they all have a weakness,

6
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,750
some part of their psychological armor that
will not resist, that will bend to your will

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,679
if you find it and push on it. Some people
wear their weaknesses openly, others disguise

8
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,679
them. Those who disguise them are often the
ones most effectively undone through that

9
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:52,460
one chink in their armor.
In 1615 the 30 year old bishop of Lucon, later

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,908
known as Richelieu, turned to the throne of
15 year old King Louis XIII, and to the Queen

11
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:03,750
Mother Marie de' Medicis, who sat beside Louis,
as the regent ruling France until her son

12
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,489
reached his majority. Everyone expected Richelieue
to flatter the King, but instead he gave words

13
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:17,858
of admiration to the Queen, who loved to get
attention from men. Her lover Concino Concini,

14
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:23,078
an Italian courtier was her favorite. Therefore
Richelieu treated him as if he were the King

15
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:30,489
himself. However Louis XIII was underestimated,
in one blow he killed off his mothers lover,

16
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:34,879
Concini and imprisoned his associates.
Richelieu questioned his strategy, had he

17
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,239
done the right thing? He chose to stand beside
the Queen, who was now a virtual prisoner,

18
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,748
shut up in the Louvre. He served as a liason
between the Queen and the King. For his loyalty

19
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:54,129
the Queen made him Cardinal and plead to her
son not to get rid off Richelieu whom he despised.

20
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:59,228
Later on the King would take Richelieu's advice
to the point of depending on him, just as

21
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:04,108
the Queen was depending on him. He stopped
serving the Queen and focused on his new authority

22
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:10,329
of power. The king had none other to trust
and affairs of state came hard to him. And

23
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,450
so for the next 18 years, Richelieu, exploiting
the king's weaknesses, governed and molded

24
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:21,359
France according to his own vision, unifying
the country and making it a strong European

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,360
power for centuries to come.
Richelieu studied the persons who had the

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,650
real power, found their biggest flaw, weakness
in their character and played on it wonderfully

27
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,849
to make them depend on him. Once the power
had gone to another he would adapt his strategies

28
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:41,348
accordingly.
In the office I see people doing this wrong

29
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:46,009
all the time. Your boss, your superior is
above you in the hierarchy, altough nowadays

30
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:50,870
instead of getting banished or killed you're
fired, your career is being damaged. Managers

31
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,860
are some of the most Machiavellian people
out there and you're going to argue with them

32
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,360
about the tasks they give you? Don't go that
way. You don't like authorities telling you

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,159
what to do, welcome to the club, but if you're
going to stay there I really want you to consider

34
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:08,780
doing all the work as good as you can, while
not overdoing it. When your superior delegates

35
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,769
more work to you, you do an outstanding job,
chances are, he'll take the praise for it,

36
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:19,400
it's expected, do not get emotional, instead
become the one running the daily business,

37
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,000
he's now dependent on you and every now and
again you'll see windows of opportunity to

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,229
let your talents shine through and get ranked
higher.

39
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:32,798
I found myself in such a position, I was working
my ass off. From the time I came into the

40
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,890
building I sat down and didn't get up, I ate
at my desk at lunch, to keep up with the constantly

41
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:43,289
growing to-do list and honestly I did a pretty
good job. Now... they did not appreciate my

42
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:48,729
efforts, who would have thought, even though
I was an intern. It was really just a title,

43
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:55,018
a sorry excuse to pay me absolute shit, but
have me work more than anybody else. Not only

44
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,280
was my co-worker a single 40-something woman
who had completely lost her sanity, by not

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,408
being ****** for over a decade, she tried
to manipulate me into doing work as well,

46
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:10,769
while I was already solving issues she had
caused within the system. I was pissed off,

47
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,680
but I NEVER showed any anger on the outside.
I actually got complemented on my ability

48
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,280
to always stay calm even in very hectic situations.
They just didn't notice how enraged I was

49
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,529
on the inside several times. Anyways, among
other ways to defend myself I decided I was

50
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:33,079
going to take 2 weeks off right then and there.
It was my right to take that vacation and

51
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:38,579
I got the approval. Law no. 16. Use Absence
to increase respect and honor. Now, when I

52
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:44,079
came back I was treated so much differently,
I finally felt appreciated and even heard

53
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:50,669
an occasional thank you. What had happened
was, they finally saw just how much I was

54
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,000
investing in the daily business and it crashed
hard when I was gone. My coworker couldn't

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,699
get anything done, which raised the authorities
awareness and she fell pretty hard after that,

56
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,939
but that's a sweet story for another time.
Look when I got into business, when I got

57
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:09,329
my first office job, which is only 2 and a
half years ago, but mind you, I've been through

58
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:13,819
some shit in my life, which has forced me
to become good at reading people, observing

59
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:18,920
my environment so that that transformed wonderfully
into the office and I should also mention

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,009
that at the very same time I got into this
mess, I was reading the 48 Laws of Power for

61
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:30,230
the first time. So I had references to what
people were doing and I was shocked, I was

62
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,240
shocked at the amount of power and mind games
that were going on. It came out to be not

63
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,879
only an internship on doing business, but
on how to survive that environment, if that

64
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,209
makes sense. I'm thinking about doing an extensive
series where I would go through some pretty

65
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:49,629
good stories with you, because I got a lot
of true, crazy shit to tell you. You'll have

66
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:53,430
modern-day references, we'll go through the
laws and analyze what happened with their

67
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,930
help among other sources, why it worked or
didn't work. I also made some bad mistakes

68
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,079
considering these laws and of course I'm also
going to talk about that. I like to be honest

69
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,039
and open with you, I won't be able to name
any persons or companies, as that would certainly

70
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,740
get me into trouble, but other than that I
don't censor myself. That's important for

71
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,410
me and I'm convinced those stories would give
you valuable insight on office politics and

72
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:29,970
some of my background with the 48 Laws of
Power. What do you think? Please, let me know.
