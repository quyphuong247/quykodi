The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 37: Create Compelling Spectacles

2
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,449
Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures
create the aura of power—everyone responds

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,539
to them. Stage the spectacles for those around
you, full of arresting visuals and radiant

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,359
symbols that heighten your presence. Dazzled
by appearances, no one will notice what you

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,960
are really doing.
People do not always want words, or rational

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,768
explanations, or demonstrations of the powers
of science; they want an immediate appeal

7
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:39,448
to their emotions. Give them that and they
will do the rest—such as imagine they can

8
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:44,588
be healed by the light reflected from a rock
a quarter million miles away.

9
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:50,408
In the early 1780s, word spread through Berlin
of the strange and spectacular medical practice

10
00:00:50,408 --> 00:00:56,158
of a Dr. Weisleder. He performed his miracles
in an enourmous conerted beer hall, outside

11
00:00:56,158 --> 00:01:01,829
which Berliners began to notice ever longer
lines of people - the blind, the lame, anyone

12
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,819
with an illness incurable by normal medicine.
When it leaked out that the doctor worked

13
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:12,179
by exposing the patient to the rays of the
moon, he soon became dubbed The Moon Doctor

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,979
of Berlin.
Sometime in 1783 it was reported that Dr.

15
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:22,688
Weisleder had cured a well-to-do woman of
a terrible ailment. He suddenly became a celebrity.

16
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,129
Previously only the poorest of Berliners had
been seen waiting outside the beer hall in

17
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:32,750
their rags; now magnificient carriages were
parked outside, and gentlemen in frock coats,

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,429
and ladies with enormous coiffures, lined
the street as sunset drew near.

19
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:41,469
As they waited to get in, the poorer clients
would explain to the upper class people that

20
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:46,978
the doctor only practiced when the moon was
in its increscent phase. Many would add that

21
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,670
they themselves had already been exposed to
the healing powers he called forth from the

22
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:58,030
rays of the moon. Even those who felt cured
kept coming back, drawn by this powerful experience.

23
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,978
Once the people reached the doctor or his
wife on the 2nd floor, having passed the spectacular

24
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:07,978
first floor, he would take the patient, uncover
the afflicted body part, and lift the boy

25
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,009
up to the window which faced the light of
the moon. He would rub the site of the injury

26
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:17,068
or illness, mumble something unintelligible,
look knowingly at the moon, and then after

27
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:20,039
collecting his fee, send the patient on their
way.

28
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,179
Dr. Weisleder may have known nothing about
medicine, but he understood human nature.

29
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,010
He recognized that people that do not always
want words, or rational explanations, or demonstrations

30
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:35,039
of the powers of science; they want an immediate
appeal to their emotions. Give them that and

31
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,019
they will do the rest - such as imagine they
can be healed by the light reflected from

32
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:44,188
a rock a quarter million miles away. The spectacle
was simple and it needed to be; the Dr. would

33
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:49,098
not explain why his technique worked, he let
his patients fill in the blanks with their

34
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:53,369
placebo effects, their need to be heard and
so on.

35
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,560
Here are the 4 essential steps Dr. Weisleder
used to Seem Larger Than Life

36
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,489
1. Play with images, weaving visual clues
into an encompassing gestalt.

37
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:09,469
2. Establish a trademark to set yourself apart.
3. Find an image or symbol from the past that

38
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:14,370
will neatly fit your situation.
4. Put it on your shoulders like a cape.

39
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,129
And that is it for this law, dive deeper into
the theory with Part II 'The Gist of a Spectacle'

40
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:22,259
and as always thank's for watching.
