The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 28: Enter Action with Boldness

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,269
If you are unsure of a course of action, do
not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations

3
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:23,269
will infect your execution. Timidity is dangerous:
Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes

4
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:28,879
you commit through audacity are easily corrected
with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold;

5
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,879
no one honors the timid.
In May of 1925, five of the most successful

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,230
dealers in the French scrapmetal business
found themselves invited to an 'official',

7
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:45,449
but 'highly confidental' meeting in the most
luxurious hotel in Paris. Bursting with curiosity

8
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,359
the men met the host, general director Monsieur
Lustig. He explained that the government had

9
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,129
planned to destroy the Eiffeltower and the
metal would be sold to the highest bidder.

10
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,790
Lustig gave them all the possible information
they needed, not leaving out one tiny detail.

11
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:07,849
As to why, he explained the Eiffeltower needed
many repairs, as was recently in the newspapers,

12
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:13,049
the maintenance costs had grown and in times
of the crisis they faced, many Parisians would

13
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,579
be delighted to see it go, Lustig provided
them with sheets of government stationery

14
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,969
filled with figures, such as the tonnage of
the tower's metal. As they calculated possible

15
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,689
profits they could make from selling the metal,
they grew increasingly euphoric. The businessmen

16
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:35,640
were then driven to the Eiffeltower in a limo,
where Lustig would continue his speech. It

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:44,060
all seemed so real. Too big of a target, too
extraordinary to not be real, way too bold.

18
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:50,040
Several days after the offers were submitted,
one of the five, a Monsier P., received notice

19
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,618
that his bid was the winner and that to secure
the sale he should come to the suite at the

20
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:02,510
hotel within two days, bearing a certified
check for more than 250'000 francs (the equivalent

21
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,769
of 1 million dollars today). However Monsier
P. started having doubts, the whole thing

22
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:15,110
seemed a bit odd, suspicious to say the least.
Why for example did they meet in a hotel and

23
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,200
not in an official government building? Why
hadn't he heard of the officials? Upon arrival

24
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:27,780
Monsieur Lustig, a master con-artist robbed
Monsier P. not only from his hesitations,

25
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,830
but from all the money he had bid on the Eiffeltower.
When Monsier P. realized he was scammed, it

26
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,170
was no option for him to go to the police.
His reputation would have been destroyed,

27
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:45,619
causing business suicide. Everyone would laugh
at him, pointing to the man who thought he

28
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:52,300
was in all seriousness buying the Eiffeltower.
Amazingly, the story does not end here. Monsier

29
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,069
Lustig returned to Paris six months later
and sold the Eiffeltower once more for a sum

30
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:05,389
in francs equivalent today to over one-and-a-half
million dollars. Boldness in the truest of

31
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:12,119
its forms. Largeness of scale deceives the
human eye. It distracts and awes us, and is

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,310
so self-evident that we cannot imagine there
is any illusion or deception afoot. Asking

33
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,848
for more puts the other person on the devensive,
cuts out the nibbling effect of compromise

34
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:33,370
and doubt, and overwhelms with its boldness.
This is the story of Ivan the Terrible.

35
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,849
In 1533, Vasily, the Grand Duke of Moscow
and ruler of a semi-united Russia, proclaimed

36
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:46,539
his three-year-old son, Ivan IV, as his successor.
Until Ivan reached his majority, however,

37
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:51,959
his mother Helena would have the ruling hand.
She sought out help from her trusted friend

38
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:59,209
Prince Ivan Obolensky to help her. The boyar
clan, the opposite party, poisened Helena

39
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:05,848
and had Obolensky starve to death in prison.
At the age of 8, Ivan was now a despised orphan.

40
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:11,479
The boyars would treat him roughly, dress
him up in robes with a ceptar, mocking him,

41
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,500
beating and banishing his only friend. He'd
roam the palace, ill-cloathed, hungry and

42
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,560
hiding from the boyars.
He remained strictly silent throughout all

43
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,839
of this. They thought their plan had worked,
they had crushed the little man, Ivan was

44
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:34,089
no longer a threat. They could ignore him.
December 29th, 1543 Ivan turned 13 and asked

45
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:39,739
Prince Andrei Shuisky, the head of the boyars,
to come to his room. When the Prince arrived,

46
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,350
the room was filled with palace guards. Ivan
pointed with his finger, ordering Andrei's

47
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:51,689
arrest, death and that his body be thrown
to the bloodhounds in the royal kennel. Over

48
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:57,029
the next few days Ivan had all of Andrei's
close associates arrested and banished, the

49
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:02,779
boyars now stood in mortal terror of the young
future Ivan the Terrible, who had planned

50
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:09,649
and waited for five years to take revenge
with this one swift and bold act that would

51
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:15,899
secure his power for decades to come.
I've separated the theory of this law into

52
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,909
a second part, because it would've been a
real drag to animate in the same way and not

53
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,259
at all pleasing to the eye and also, because
the average attention span is far less then

54
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:31,160
4 minutes. So, don't miss out on the rest
to understand what's behind Monsieur Lustig's

55
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,370
incredible con and Ivan the Terrible's bloodthirsty
boldness, through which he would later earn

56
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,490
his name. As always thank's for watching.
