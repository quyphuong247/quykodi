The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law Number 13... Asking for Help Appeal to

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,629
People's Self Interest
If you need to turn to an ally for help, do

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,830
not bother to re­mind him of your past assistance
and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore

4
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:23,149
you. Instead, uncover some­thing in your
request, or in your alliance with him, that

5
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:28,109
will benefit him, and emphasize it out of
all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically

6
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,109
when he sees something to be gained for himself.
Self-Interest Is the Lever that Moves People

7
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:37,429
The art of asking people for help depends
on your ability to understand the person you

8
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:41,939
are dealing with, and to not confuse your
needs with theirs. Know that even the most

9
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,489
powerful person is locked inside needs of
his own, and that if you make no appeal to

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,420
his self-interest, he merely sees you as desperate
or, at best, a waste of time.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,900
What Not To Do When Making Your Appeal
1. Don’t bring up the past

12
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:00,489
Bringing up the past, rather good or bad,
will not help you in your cause. The justice

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,530
and nobility of your cause will not prevail.
Not only is a man not obliged to be grateful,

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,140
gratitude is often a terrible burden that
he gladly discards. It is best to speak pragmatically

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,420
to pragmatic people. People rarely act against
their own interests.

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,810
Like in the case of the Corcyrans and the
Corinthians who were at the brink of war with

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,379
one another. They both wanted to win over
the Athenians as an ally because to do so,

18
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:28,959
would surely win the war. Both sides were
to send representatives to plead their case

19
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,679
to the Athenians. The Corcyra representative
could only offer one thing and that was an

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,250
alliance of mutual interests to create a formidable
force that could intimidate the rival state

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,739
of Sparta. The representative from Corinth
only talked about their past relationship

22
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:47,560
with Athens and went on to list the many services
Corinth had performed for Athens, and the

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,960
importance of showing gratitude to one's friends.
Needless to say, The Athenians were offended

24
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,658
by the Corinthian ambassador by his subtle
way of asking them to feel guilty about past

25
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,740
generosities. The Athenians could have cared
less and allied with the Corcyrans.

26
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,239
2. Don’t Be Trapped In Your Own Wants and
Desires

27
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,228
Do not start from the assumption that the
people you are appealing to have a selfless

28
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,780
interest in helping you. Don’t talk as if
your needs matter to people—they probably

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,810
could care less, especially referring to larger
issues: a great cause, or grand emotions such

30
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,640
as love and gratitude when simple, everyday
realities would have much more appeal.

31
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,279
When the Dutch began to arrive in Japan in
great numbers, Ieyasu, the Japanese emperor,

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,699
was much relieved. He needed Europeans for
their know-how in guns and navigation, and

33
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,810
here at last were Europeans who cared nothing
for spreading religion—the Dutch wanted

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,659
only to trade. Ieyasu swiftly moved to evict
the Portuguese who were desperately trying

35
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,030
to convert the Japanese people to Catholicism.
From then on, he would only deal with the

36
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,629
practical-minded Dutch. Japan and Holland
were vastly different cultures, but each shared

37
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:56,620
a timeless and universal concern: self-interest.
3. Don’t confuse your needs with others

38
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,239
Once you make people see how you can in some
way meet their needs or advance their cause,

39
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,430
their resistance to your requests for help
will magically fall away. At each step on

40
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,469
the way to acquiring power, you must train
yourself to think your way inside the other

41
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:14,128
person's mind, to see their needs and interests,
to get rid of the screen of your own feelings

42
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:19,429
that obscure the truth. Master this art and
there will be no limits to what you can accomplish.

43
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,939
The Motivation is Superiority
Believe it, or not, there are people who are

44
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,878
not motivated through cynical self-interests.
These are people who thrive on opportunities

45
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,159
to display their good heart. They prefer to
be able to exercise charity, mercy, and justice,

46
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,229
which are their ways of feeling superior to
you:

47
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,768
Because of their superior position, if you
ask this person for help, you emphasize their

48
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:46,759
power and position. The only requirement from
you is that all of this is done in public,

49
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,079
the more public, the better. It is truly their
pleasure to give and to be seen giving. They

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,410
are dying to fund your project, to introduce
you to powerful people—this is the wine

51
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,829
that intoxicates them.
You must have the wisdom to distinguish the

52
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,930
differences among powerful people and figure
out what makes them tick. When they ooze greed,

53
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:24,370
do not appeal to their charity. When they
want to look charitable and noble, do not

54
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,959
appeal to their greed.
