The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 38: Think as you like, but behave

2
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:14,599
like others
If you make a show of going against the times,

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,570
flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox
ways, people will think that you only want

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,649
attention and that you look down upon them.
They will find a way to punish you for making

5
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:28,739
them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend
in and nurture the common touch. Share your

6
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:34,780
originality only with tolerant friends and
those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,649
People who flaunt their infatuation with a
different culture are expressing a disdain

8
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,000
and contempt for their own. They are using
the outward appearance of the exotic to separate

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,058
themselves from the common folk who unquestioningly
follow the local customs and laws, and to

10
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,798
express their sense of superiority.
Otherwise they would act with more dignity,

11
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:57,228
showing respect for those who do not share
their desires. Indeed their need to show their

12
00:00:57,228 --> 00:01:01,368
difference so dramatically often makes them
disliked by the people whose beliefs they

13
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:05,680
challenge, indirectly and subtly, perhaps,
but offensively nonetheless.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,500
Here's a historical example for someone breaking
this law as so few people even today seem

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,728
to be aware of how to blend in.
Around the year 478 B.C., the city of Sparta

16
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:21,560
sent an expedition to Persia led by the young
Spartan nobleman Pausanias. The city-states

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,079
of Greece had recently fought off a mighty
invasion from Persia, and now Pausanias, along

18
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:30,858
with allied ships from Athens, had orders
to punish the invaders and win back the islands

19
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:36,019
and coastal towns that the Persians had occupied.
Both the Athenians the Spartans had great

20
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:40,978
respect for Pausanias - he had proven himself
as a fearless warrior, with a flair for the

21
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:46,799
dramatic. With amazing speed, Pausanias and
his troops took Cyprus, then captured Byzantium.

22
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,450
Now master of part of the Persian empire,
Pausanias began to show signs of behaviour

23
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,939
that went beyond his normal flamboyance.
He appeared in public wearing pomades in his

24
00:01:55,938 --> 00:02:01,428
hair and flowing Persian robes, and accompanied
by a bodyguard of Egyptians. He held lavish

25
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:06,609
banquets in which he sat in the Persian manner
and demanded to be entertained. He stopped

26
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:11,729
seeing his old friends, entered into communication
with the Persian King Xerxes, and all in all

27
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,679
affected the style and manner of a Persian
dictator.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,340
Clearly power and success had gone to Pausania's
head. He then went ahead and flaunted his

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,360
disdain for the Greeks' simple way of life,
insulted the common Greek soldier and even

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,230
showed evidence that he had dreams of becoming
a kind of Greek Xerxes.

31
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:33,939
The spartans relieved Pausanias of his command
and called him home sparing him.

32
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:38,469
When they learnt from his intentions to attack
Greece alongside the Persians, thinking he

33
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:43,489
was invincible, the Spartans made arrangements
for his arrest. Pausanias however trapped

34
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:48,180
in the sacred temple refused to surrender
and eventually died of starvation.

35
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,469
The Trick to your Uniqueness
1. You pretend to disagree with dangerous

36
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:57,530
ideas, but in the course of your disagreement
you give those ideas expression and exposure.

37
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,199
2. You seem to conform to the prevailing orthodoxy,
but those who know will understand the irony

38
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,030
involved. You are protected.
3. There is no point in making a display of

39
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,590
your dangerous ideas if they only bring you
suffering and persecution.

40
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,680
4. Martyrdom serves no purposeâ€”better to
live on in an oppressive world, even to thrive

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,500
in it.
5. Find a way to express your ideas subtly

42
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,610
for those who understand you.
6. Lying your pearls before swine will only

43
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,269
bring you trouble.
The Truth

44
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:30,370
1. We all tell lies and hide our true feelings,
for complete free expression is a social impossibility.

45
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,658
2. From an early age we learn to conceal our
thoughts, telling the prickly and insecure

46
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:40,250
what we know they want to hear, watching carefully
lest we offend them.

47
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,669
3. There are ideas and values that most people
accept, and it is pointless to argue.

48
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:48,179
4. We believe what we want to, but on the
outside we wear a mask.

49
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,360
5. There are people, however, who see such
restraints as an intolerable infringement

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,390
on their freedom.
6. They have a need to prove the superiority

51
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,369
of their values and beliefs.
7. In the end, their arguments convince only

52
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,218
a few and offend a great deal more.
8. The reason arguments do not work is that

53
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:07,750
most people hold their ideas and values without
thinking about them.

54
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,709
9. There is a strong emotional content in
their beliefs:

55
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,709
10. They really do not want to have to rework
their habits of thinking, and when you challenge

56
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,399
them, whether directly through your arguments
or indirectly through your behavior, they

57
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,409
are hostile.
And that is it for this law, be sure to dive

58
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,470
deeper with Part II 'The Real Power' and as
always thanks for watching.
