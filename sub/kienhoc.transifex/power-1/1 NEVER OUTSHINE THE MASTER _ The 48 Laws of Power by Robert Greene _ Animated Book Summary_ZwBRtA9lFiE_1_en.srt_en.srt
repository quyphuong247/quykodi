00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,559
The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,769
Law no. 1: Never Outshine The Master

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:16,048
Always make those above you feel
comfortably superior.

4
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:19,609
In your desire to please or impress them, do not go too far

5
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,609
in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite â€“ inspire fear and

6
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,460
insecurity.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,019
Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you'll

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,919
attain the heights of power.
Especially that last part sounds very

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,870
promising.

10
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:37,509
In order to fully understand let's take
a look at history and learn from others'

11
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:38,488
mistakes.

12
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,530
The law has been observed in the story
of King Louis XIV and his finance

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,259
minister Nicholas Fouquet.

14
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:48,899
First of all, who was Louis XIV, or Louis Quatorze as the fine frenchman would say

15
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,820
He was the king monarch of Versailles and
in my humble opinion probably the most

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,649
interesting of all the French monarchs.

17
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,878
His most famous quote is 'L'etat c'est moi!'

18
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:02,199
literally 'I am the state'. He portrayed
himself as the Sun King

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,920
and had such might and power among his
lands, that he could make any decision

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,820
he wanted without

21
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,969
any discussion. He would ask for a
pen and the whole room would be

22
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,659
fighting each other for the chance to
give him theirs,

23
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,840
as to get in his good graces or be able
to say they've done the Great King a

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,469
favor.

25
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:22,500
This behavior was the Nicholas Fouquet's
downfall. In seventeenth-century France

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,319
Nicholas Fouquet had spent enormous
sums in building a magnificent chateau

27
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,629
on his estate of Vaux-le-Vicomte.

28
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:32,679
When the Prime Minister died, the
position was abolished instead of replaced with

29
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:33,409
Fouquet

30
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,769
the kings smart finance minister. In
order to not lose the king's trust and

31
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,159
regain his attention,

32
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,689
he then planned the most spectacular party France had ever seen

33
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,959
to show off its connections, cultivated
manner and

34
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,439
charm. It was a great tribute to the
guest of honor,

35
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,609
the king himself. Thinking this move
would make him an indispensable asset

36
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:59,478
Fouquet had actually offended his master,
who was outraged by the fact people were

37
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:02,450
more charmed by his finance minister
than by himself

38
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,689
Fouquet unintentionally outshone his
master, making the King feel

39
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:07,340
insecure.

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,939
He was arrested the next day and spent
the last twenty years of his life

41
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:14,189
in solitary confinement high in the Pyrenees mountains

42
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:17,430
for having stolen enormous amounts from the country's treasury.

43
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,390
The accusations were false, but such was
the price of his actions,

44
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:22,899
best intentions aside.

45
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,120
A second example would be Galileo
Galilei:

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,599
one of the greatest minds of the 16th
century who used this law in his favor.

47
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,328
Galileo was was clever in observing this
law by giving glory to his patrons.

48
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:41,040
In order to solve his perennial problem
of funding, he dedicated his discovery of

49
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,598
the moons of Jupiter

50
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,108
to the Medici. Since the Royal symbol of
the Medici family was the planet jupiter.

51
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:51,469
He then commissioned an emblem for them with each moon representing one of the

52
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:51,989
sons

53
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,019
who revolved around the patriarch. The
Medici family became his major patron,

54
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,480
appointing him their official court
mathematician and philosopher,

55
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,929
thereby giving him a more comfortable
life and a steady salary.

56
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,609
So what are the lessons we should take
away from the misfortune of Fouquet and

57
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,170
the brilliance of Galileo?

58
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,348
Present your ideas in a way that they
eco your boss' thought.

59
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:19,348
Act less smarter than your boss. Do not
take your position at work

60
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:23,908
or in life for granted. Always make sure
to make it seem like you want to seek

61
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,370
the superiors expertise

62
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,859
and advice. Discrete flattery is very
powerful.

63
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:32,879
The 48 Laws of Power is an
outstandingly great book written

64
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,030
by an amazing author. The amount of
research Robert Green does on his topics

65
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,509
is

66
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:42,310
just ridiculous. I'll definitely read his
works until he retires or I forget the

67
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,969
alphabet.

68
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:46,959
I'll make sure to cover every single
chapter of this book on this channel

69
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,060
in a similar visually animated fashion.
I'm really open to suggestions

70
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,870
and discussions in the comments so
please feel free to share your thoughts

71
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,709
with me on any subject.

72
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,919
And my question to you is have you ever
experienced this law?

73
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,410
Please let me know & thanks for watching.
