The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law 47: In Victory Learn When To Stop

2
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:18,329
The moment of victory is often the moment
of greatest peril. In the heat of victory,

3
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,929
arrogance and overconfidence can push you
past the goal you had aimed for, and by going

4
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:28,230
too far, you make more enemies than you defeat.
Do not allow success to go to your head. There

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,689
is no substitute for strategy and careful
planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it,

6
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:38,640
stop.
No single person in history has occupied a

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,158
more delicate and precarious position than
the king’s mistress. She had no real or

8
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:49,109
legitimate power base to fall back on in times
of trouble; she was surrounded by packs of

9
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:54,600
envious courtiers eagerly anticipating her
fall from grace; and finally, since the source

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,429
of her power was usually her physical beauty,
for most royal mistresses that fall was inevitable

11
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:06,400
and unpleasant.
When Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson was a middle-class

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,609
child of nine, she had been told by a fortune-teller
that she would someday be the king’s favorite.

13
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:19,390
This seemed an absurd dream, since the royal
mistress almost always came from the aristocracy.

14
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,030
Jeanne nevertheless believed herself destined
to seduce the king, and doing so became her

15
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,960
obsession.
She applied herself to the talents the king’s

16
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:34,699
favorite had to have—music, dancing, acting,
horseback riding—and she excelled in every

17
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,579
one of them. Word quickly spread of her beauty,
talent, charm, and intelligence.

18
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:44,909
Jeanne Poisson became close friends with Voltaire,
Montesquieu, and other great minds of the

19
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,269
time, but she never lost sight of the goal
she had set herself for as a girl: to capture

20
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:56,949
the heart of the king.
In 1744 Louis XV’s current mistress, the

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,640
Duchesse de Chateauroux, died. Jeanne placed
herself everywhere he would be: at masked

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,569
balls at Versailles, at the opera, wherever
their paths would cross, and wherever she

23
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,908
could display her many talents.
The king succumbed to her charms, and in a

24
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:18,068
ceremony at Versailles in September of 1745,
this twenty-four-year-old daughter of a middle-class

25
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:23,748
banking agent was officially inaugurated as
the king’s mistress. From now on she would

26
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:29,449
be known as Madame de Pompadour.
She organized elaborate hunting parties, masked

27
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:34,378
balls, and whatever else it would take to
keep the king amused and diverted outside

28
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:39,608
the bedroom. She became a patroness of the
arts, and the arbiter of taste and fashion

29
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:43,810
for all of France.
Her enemies at the court only grew in number

30
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,109
with each new success, but Madame de Pompadour
thwarted them in a totally novel way for a

31
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:57,109
king’s mistress: with extreme politeness.
In 1751, when Madame de Pompadour was at the

32
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:03,120
height of her power, she experienced her worst
crisis. She found it increasingly difficult

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,908
to meet the king’s demands in bed. This
was usually the point at which the mistress

34
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:13,688
would meet her end, struggling to maintain
her position as her beauty faded.

35
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:19,318
But Madame de Pompadour encouraged the king
to set up a brothel on the grounds of Versailles.

36
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:23,449
There the middle-aged king could have liaisons
with the most beautiful young girls in the

37
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:27,369
realm.
Her reign as mistress had lasted an unprecedented

38
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,278
twenty years. “She was regretted by all,”
wrote the Duc de Croy, “for she was kindly

39
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:39,378
and helpful to everyone who approached her.”
Madame de Pompadour was aware of the temporariness

40
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:44,739
of her power. She succeeded where all others
had failed because she never pressed her good

41
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,239
fortune. Instead of bullying the courtiers
from her powerful position as the king’s

42
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,558
mistress, she tried to win their support.
She never revealed the slightest hint of greed

43
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:59,968
or arrogance. When she could no longer perform
her physical duties as mistress, she did not

44
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:05,058
fret at the thought of someone replacing her
in bed. She simply encouraged the king to

45
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:10,430
take young lovers, knowing that the younger
and prettier they were, the less of a threat

46
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,620
they posed, since they could not compare to
her in charm and sophistication and would

47
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,259
soon bore the monarch.
Notice how Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, aside

48
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:27,000
from her origins, appeared to be perfect and
still managed not to stir up too much envy...

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,009
and where there was trouble brewing she dealt
with it with extreme kindness. Much like the

50
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:37,819
generous act of gifting valuable materials,
she would offer her uniquely positive character

51
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:43,810
with a genuine smile.
As always thanks for watching!
