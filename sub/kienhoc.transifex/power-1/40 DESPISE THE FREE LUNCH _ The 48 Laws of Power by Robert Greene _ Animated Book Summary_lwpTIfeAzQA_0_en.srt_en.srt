The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 40: Despise the Free Lunch

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,439
What is offered for free is dangerous—it
usually involves either a trick or a hidden

3
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,129
obligation. What has worth is worth paying
for. By paying your own way you stay clear

4
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:27,879
of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also
often wise to pay the full price—there are

5
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:33,119
no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish
with your money and keep it circulating, for

6
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:40,518
generosity is a sign and a magnet for power.
Being open and flexible with money also teaches

7
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:46,420
the value of strategic generosity, a variation
on the old trick of "giving when you are about

8
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,948
to take." By giving the appropriate gift,
you put the recipient under obligation. Generosity

9
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:59,268
softens people up—to be deceived. By gaining
a reputation for liberality, you win people's

10
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:04,618
admiration while distracting them from your
power plays. By strategically spreading your

11
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:10,430
wealth, you charm the others, creating pleasure
and making valuable allies.

12
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,820
Louis XIV had an eagle eye for the strategic
power of money. When he came to the throne,

13
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:21,519
the powerful nobility had recently proven
a thorn in the monarchy's side, and seethed

14
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,868
with rebelliousness. So he impoverished these
aristocrats by making them spend enormous

15
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:32,640
sums on maintaining their positions in the
court. Making them dependent on royal largesse

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,539
for their livelihood, he had them in his claws.
Next Louis brought the nobles to their knees

17
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:43,810
with strategic genorosity. Whenever he noticed
a stubborn courtier whose influence he needed

18
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,728
to gain, or whose troublemaking he needed
to squelch, he would use his vast wealth to

19
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:54,950
soften the soil. First he would ignore his
victim, making the man anxious. Then the man

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,299
would suddenly find that his son had been
given a well-paid post, or that funds had

21
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:04,350
been spent liberally in his home region, or
that he had been given a painting he had long

22
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:10,258
coveted. Presents would flow from Louis's
hands. Finally, weeks or months later, Louis

23
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:15,889
would ask for the favor he had needed all
along. A man who had once vowed to do anything

24
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:22,348
to stop the king would have made him rebellious;
this was far more insidious. Facing hardened

25
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:29,818
earth in which nothing could take root, Louis
loosened the soil before he planted his seeds.

26
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,509
Louis understood that there is a deep-rooted
emotional element in our attitude on money,

27
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:39,829
an element going back to childhood. When we
are children, all kinds of complicated feelings

28
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,409
about our parents center around gifts; we
see the giving of a gift as a sign of love

29
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:51,500
and approval. And that emotional element never
goes away. The recipients of gifts, financial

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,019
or otherwise, are suddenly as vulnerable as
children, especially if the gift comes from

31
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:01,390
someone in authority.
5 Simple Lessons

32
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:08,679
1. Friends who offer favors without asking
for payment will later want something far

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,400
dearer than the money you would have paid
them.

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,730
· The bargain has hidden problems, both material
and psychological. Learn to pay and to pay

35
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,828
well.
2. Bait your deceptions with the possibility

36
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:24,900
of easy money.
· People are essentially lazy, and want wealth

37
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,110
to fall in their lap rather than to work for
it.

38
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,639
3. For a small sum, sell them advice on how
to make millions

39
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:43,659
· That small sum will become a fortune when
multiplied by thousands of suckers.

40
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:53,039
4. Lure people in with the prospect of easy
money and you have the room to work still

41
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,019
more deceptions on them.
· Greed is powerful enough to blind your

42
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:02,640
victims to anything.
And lastly, 5. Greed does not pay. (If you're

43
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,229
greedy, you will end up like Ebeneezer Scrooge)
Be generous instead and receive the love back

44
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:13,000
that you gave out to the world. You give ahundred
gifts more, athousand gifts more, it does

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:27,930
not matter, you will receive more than enough
gifts back. Merry Christmas and thanks for

46
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,470
watching.)
