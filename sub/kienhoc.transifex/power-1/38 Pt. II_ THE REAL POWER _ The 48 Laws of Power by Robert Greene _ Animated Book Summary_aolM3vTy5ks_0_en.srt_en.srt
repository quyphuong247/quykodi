00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:06,378
The Real Power
1. Wise and clever people learn early on that

2
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:10,699
they can display conventional behavior and
mouth conventional ideas without having to

3
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:13,729
believe in them.
2. The power these people gain from blending

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,469
in is that of being left alone to have the
thoughts they want to have.

5
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:21,669
3. They express their ideas to the people
they want to express them to, without suffering

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,420
isolation or ostracism.
4. Once they have established themselves in

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,240
a position of power, they can try to convince
a wider circle of the correctness of their

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,988
ideas— perhaps working indirectly.
The Commonsense

9
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:37,789
1. Use your invaluable ability to be all things
to all people.

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,030
2. When you go into society, leave behind
your own ideas and values, and put on the

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,640
mask that is most appropriate for the group
in which you find yourself.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,759
3. People will swallow the bait because it
flatters them to believe that you share their

13
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,289
ideas.
4. They will not take you as a hypocrite if

14
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,750
you are careful—for how can they accuse
you of hypocrisy if you do not let them know

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,960
exactly what you stand for?
5. They will not see you as lacking in values.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,930
Of course you have values—the values you
share with them, while in their company.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,130
Authority: Do not give dogs what is holy;
and do not throw your pearls before swine,

18
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:14,589
lest they trample them under foot and turn
to attack you. (Jesus Christ, Matthew 7:6).

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,159
But be warned
The only time it is worth standing out is

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,049
when you already stand out— when you have
achieved an unshakable position of power,

21
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,060
and can display your difference from others
as a sign of the distance between you. There

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,430
is always a place for the gadfly, the person
who successfully defies custom and mocks what

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,340
has grown lifeless in a culture.
