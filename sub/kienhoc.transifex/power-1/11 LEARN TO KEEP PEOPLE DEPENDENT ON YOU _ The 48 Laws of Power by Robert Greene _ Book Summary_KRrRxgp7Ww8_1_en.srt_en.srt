The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law Number Eleven... Learn To Keep People

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,699
Dependent on You
To maintain your independence you must always

3
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:18,000
be needed and wanted. The more you are relied
on, the more freedom you have. Make people

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,300
depend on you for their happiness and prosperity
and you have nothing to fear. Never teach

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,868
them enough so that they can do without you.
Necessity rules the world. People rarely act

6
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:30,730
unless compelled to. If you create no need
for yourself, then you will be done away with

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,329
at first opportunity. If, on the other hand,
you understand the Laws of Power and make

8
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,429
others depend on you for their welfare, if
you can counteract their weakness with your

9
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:44,149
own "iron and blood," as Bismarck said. Then
you will survive your masters just as he did.

10
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:48,359
You will have all the benefits of power without
the thorns that come from being a master.

11
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,660
Bismarck understood the importance of keeping
people dependent. He sought out a weak ruler,

12
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:58,648
Frederick William IV, king of Prussia and
created a relationship of dependency. He was

13
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,879
a key player in restoring the king’s power
so much so that when the king died, his brother

14
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,140
who preceded him depended on Bismarck as well.
Bismarck became their strength, their intelligence

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,469
and their spine and in the process, he became
a powerful force to reckon with, he was the

16
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:16,459
man behind the throne, calling the shots.
10 Ways to Manipulate Power

17
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:22,739
1. Do seek out weak people in power
Seeking out those already in power is foolish.

18
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,489
They will swallow you up and spit you out.
They do not need anything from you

19
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,868
2. Get people to do as you wish without force
or hurt.

20
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:35,549
If you have to bully someone into doing what
you want, that is not power. The key is making

21
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,840
the person believe that your services are
needed and without you they will be completely

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,090
lost.
3. Enmesh yourself in the work of your superior

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,630
By doing this your superior knows that to
get rid of you is futile. They can not afford

24
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:51,959
to train another without losing time and a
lot of money.

25
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,639
4. Possess a talent and creative skill that
simply cannot be replaced.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,259
People will think twice before getting rid
of you because to get rid of you may spell

27
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:12,620
disaster or even death.
5. Create a situation in which you can always

28
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,580
latch on to another patron
This just simply means you have other places

29
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,810
that will welcome your skills and talents
in your sights. Your employer knows that they

30
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,490
cannot easily find another worker with your
particular talent so they will jump hoops

31
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,640
to keep you in their employ.
6. Have the appearance of specialized knowledge

32
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,859
and skill
This gives you leeway in your ability to deceive

33
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,360
those above you into thinking they cannot
do without you. It is always in your power

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,630
to make your skills indispensible.
7. Wrap yourself around the source of power

35
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,069
You have placed yourself in a position that
to cut you away would cause great trauma.

36
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,289
You do not necessarily have to entwine yourself
around the superior; another person will do,

37
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:55,049
as long as he or she too is indispensable
in the chain.

38
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,510
8. Use the secret intelligence tactic
By knowing people’s secrets, you seal your

39
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:03,469
position with them. The downside to this is
that the paranoia and insecurity that the

40
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:08,259
power that it provides cancels itself out.
What good is power without peace?

41
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:12,719
9. Do not imagine your superior’s dependence
on you will make them love you

42
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,389
It is more than likely that they resent and
fear you, which is better that they fear the

43
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,599
consequences of losing you rather than out
of love for your company.

44
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,259
10. Better to place yourself in a position
of mutual dependence

45
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:28,479
The weakness of making others depend on you
is that you are in some measure dependent

46
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,979
on them. Although this is true, you will not
have the unbearable pressure of being on top,

47
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,979
and your superior will in essence be your
slave, for he will depend on you.

48
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,530
Louis XI (1423-1483) the great Spider King
of France once asked his astrologer to tell

49
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,590
of his own fate and how long he had to live.
The astrologer replied, “I shall die just

50
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,060
three days before Your Majesty.” The king
was vexed because he had planned to kill the

51
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,120
astrologer that day fearing the astrologer
had killed people to prove his forcasting

52
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,170
or that his might in astrology was real and
therefore dangerous in of itself. The king

53
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:06,089
spared his life, looked after him, gave him
gifts and even had several doctors check his

54
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,789
health to ensure he would live as long as
possible. The astrologer actually survived

55
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:25,420
the king by several years, proving his mastery
of power.
