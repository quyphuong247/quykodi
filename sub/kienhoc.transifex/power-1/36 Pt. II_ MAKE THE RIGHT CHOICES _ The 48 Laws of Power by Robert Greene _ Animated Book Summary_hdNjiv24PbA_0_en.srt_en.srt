1
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:06,339
Make the Right Choices
You choose to let things bother you.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,280
· You choose not to notice the irritating
offender.

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,088
The most powerful move is to consider the
matter trivial and unworthy of your interest.

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:18,260
· What you do not react to cannot drag you
down in a futile engagement.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,030
Your pride is not involved.
· The best lesson you can teach an irritating

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,140
gnat is to consign it to oblivion by ignoring
it.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,588
If it is impossible to ignore then conspire
in secret to do away with it.

8
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:33,850
· Never inadvertently draw attention to the
bothersome insect that will go away on its

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,219
own.
If you waste time and energy in such entanglements,

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,409
it is your own fault.
· Learn to play the card of disdain and turn

11
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,459
your back on what cannot harm you in the long
run.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,880
The Offensive Aspect of the Law: Playing the
card of contempt is immensely powerful for

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,000
it lets you determine the conditions of the
conflict. The war is waged on your terms.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,409
This Is The Ultimate Power Pose: You are the
king or queen and you ignore what offends

15
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:02,819
you. Watch how this tactic infuriates people—half
of what they do is to get your attention,

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,640
and when you withhold it from them, they flounder
in frustration.

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,790
Desire Often Creates Paradoxical Effects:
The more you want something, the more you

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,560
chase after it, the more it eludes you. The
more interest you show, the more you repel

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,530
the object of your desire. This is because
your interest is too strong—it makes people

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,670
awkward, even fearful. Uncontrollable desire
makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic.

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,920
· You need to turn your back on what you
want, show your contempt and disdain. This

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,500
is the kind of powerful response that will
drive your targets crazy. They will respond

23
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,340
with a desire of their own, which is simply
to have an effect on you—perhaps to possess

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,859
you, perhaps to hurt you. If they want to
possess you, you have successfully completed

25
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:50,688
the first step of seduction. If they want
to hurt you, you have unsettled them and made

26
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:56,269
them play by your rules. If choosing to ignore
enhances your power, it follows that the opposite

27
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:01,349
approach—commitment and engagement—often
weakens you. By paying undue attention to

28
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,789
a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer
it takes you to crush such an enemy, the larger

29
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,169
the enemy seems.
Remember: The powerful responses to nagging,

30
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:16,379
petty annoyances and irritations are contempt
and disdain. Never show that something has

31
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:22,388
affected you, or that you are offended—that
only shows you have acknowledged a problem.

32
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:25,689
Contempt is a dish that is best served cold
and without affectation.
