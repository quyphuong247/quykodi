00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:11,388
The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law 42: Strike the Shepherd and the Sheep

2
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:16,019
Will Scatter
Trouble can often be traced to a single strong

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:21,600
individual - the stirrer, the arrogant underling,
the poisoner of goodwill. If you allow such

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,690
people room to operate, others will succumb
to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,618
they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate
with them - they are irredeemable. Neutralize

6
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:37,238
their influence by isolating or banishing
them. Strike at the source of the trouble

7
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:42,899
and the sheep will scatter.
"Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter."

8
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:51,210
"When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter."
"Cut the snake at the head."

9
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,140
These are fairly common proverbs,
but what do they mean?

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,378
Within any group, trouble can most often be
traced to a single source, the unhappy, chronically

11
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:09,340
dissatisfied one who will always stir up dissension
and infect the group with his or her ill ease.

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,030
Before you know what hit you the dissatisfaction
spreads. Act before it becomes impossible

13
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,629
to disentangle one strand of misery from another,
or to see how the whole thing started.

14
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:27,819
Isolation, then, is one of the most powerful
ways to deal with that source of trouble.

15
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:32,459
Who Should You Isolate?
· Powerful people who have alienated themselves

16
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,319
from the group.
· People whose power has gone to their heads,

17
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,718
and they consider themselves superior.
· Those people who have perhaps lost their

18
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:47,428
knack of communicating with ordinary folk,
basically people breaking law 18, isolation

19
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:51,259
is dangerous.
· Search out people who hold high positions

20
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:57,890
yet who find themselves isolated on the board.
And find the one head that matters—the person

21
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,409
with willpower, or smarts, or, most important
of all, charisma.

22
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:08,659
Identify and Shut the Hell Raisers Down
1. First, recognize troublemakers by their

23
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,689
overbearing presence, or by their complaining
nature.

24
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:17,068
2. Once you spot them do not try to reform
them or appease them—that will only make

25
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:20,759
things worse.
3. Do not attack them, whether directly or

26
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,870
indirectly, for they are poisonous in nature
and will work underground to destroy you.

27
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,340
4. Do as the Athenians did: Banish them before
it is too late.

28
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,049
5. Separate them from the group before they
become the eye of a tornado.

29
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,819
6. Do not give them time to stir up anxieties
and sow discontent.

30
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:43,208
7. Do not give them room to move. Let one
person suffer so that the rest can live in

31
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,900
peace.
8. Once you recognize who the stirrer is,

32
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,158
pointing it out to other people will accomplish
a great deal.

33
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:55,039
9. Understanding who controls the group dynamic
is a critical realization.

34
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:01,479
10. Stirrers drive by hiding in the group,
disguising their actions among the reactions

35
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:08,899
of others.
But why isolate, can't you just hire an assassin

36
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,620
and go about your daily life? Well, that is
an option, but as history has shown, not a

37
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,879
very good one. You see, getting rid of someone
doesn't dissolve the loyalty of those who

38
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,560
were close to your enemy. Rather isolate,
as

39
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,459
· They are vulnerable to you, and your presence
becomes magnified.

40
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,789
· It can prove a powerful way of bringing
people under your spell to seduce or swindle

41
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,908
them.
· Here they feel weak, and succumb to deception

42
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:39,489
more easily.
· Powerful though they may be, people like

43
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,408
this can be turned to use.
· It is often better to isolate your enemies

44
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:51,068
than to destroy them—you seem less brutal.
· They are like apples falling into your

45
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:57,438
lap, easily seduced, and able to catapult
you into power yourself.

46
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:03,229
· Isolation disheartenes the sheep beyond
any rational measure.

47
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:09,509
· Cancer begins with a single cell; excise
it before it spreads beyond cure.

48
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:14,169
How does one isolate his enemies?
· Render their actions visible and they lose

49
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:17,599
their power to upset.
· Separate your victims from their power

50
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,439
base or their usual social context.
· The result is the same as that achieved

51
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:28,110
with the help of an assassin, for in the game
of power, isolation spells death.

52
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,220
There's 3 kinds of isolation,
· the Physical (banishment or absence from

53
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,260
the court).
· the Political (narrowing their base of

54
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,789
support).
· and the Psychological (alienating them

55
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,950
from the group through slander and insinuation).
Remember these when someone is trying to isolate

56
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,789
you.
Machiavelli wrote "Any harm you do to a man

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,680
should be done in such a way that you need
not fear his revenge.", basically what Law

58
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,910
15 is all about: crushing your opponents completely.
If you act to isolate your enemy, make sure

59
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:09,290
he lacks the means to repay the favor. If
you apply this Law, in other words, apply

60
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,290
it from a position of superiority, so that
you have nothing to fear from his resentment.

61
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:26,280
I've recently watched a great movie with Keyanu
Reeves, that tells the story of the '47 Ronin.'

62
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:32,159
As a samurai warrior you swore allegiance
to your masters, if they were to be killed,

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,720
their death had to be avenged. If the samurai
refused to take revenge in their fallen leader's

64
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,810
name, they would lose the honor of being a
samurai, from there on living a dishonorable

65
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:50,120
life in shame as Ronin. What happens in the
movie is what happens if you fail to isolate

66
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,350
your enemy from his followers. Even postmortem,
(when they're dead.. that is), your enemies

67
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,580
may come to haunt you in the form of their
allies.

68
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:03,620
I really recommend that movie. It's a great
movie.

69
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,459
It is.
As always thanks for watching.
