The 48 Laws of Power

3
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:08,650
by Robert Greene. Law number seven...

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,669
Get Others to Do the Work for You | Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other

5
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:15,629
people to further your own cause.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,990
Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy,

7
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,959
it will give you an aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,980
forgotten and you will be remembered.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,339
Never do yourself what others can do for you. Thomas Edison was the consummate

10
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,239
genius of other people’s efforts.

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,299
After hiring a Serbian scientist and inventor by the name of Nikola Telsa

12
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:39,149
who toiled day and night to improve Edison’s antiquated invention, dynamos,

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,780
or as we know them today generators. Tesla was told by Edison that he would

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,340
receive $50,000

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,500
for redesigning this system of electrical current. Within a year Telsa created an

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,119
improved version of the dynamo

17
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:54,009
and instead of receiving $50,000, he was given a raise by Edison

18
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,558
who knew that his company would get credit for the work that was done by

19
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,149
Tesla.

20
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:02,710
Nikola Tesla is a prime example of what not to do. He was never credited for

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,550
any of his work.

22
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:06,560
He was the inventor of the alternate current system (AC)

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,250
which is synonymous with Westinghouse. Financiers divested Tesla from the

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,760
credit,

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,280
patents and riches that he would have received which approximates at $12

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,299
million dollars

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,180
instead of the $216,000 that he accepted as payment.

28
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,000
He was not even acknowledged for his patent filed in 1897 when another man,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,049
Marconi took credit for inventing the radio. Tesla is the true father of the

30
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:28,570
radio.

31
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:32,649
This is a sad yet true story about a man who was obsessed with his work,

32
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,850
yet really never got the accolades, or the money, nor the respect that he deserved.

33
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:42,089
Edison on the other hand saw the requisite to hire the best in the field

34
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,750
to do work that he himself would take credit for. This does not beg the

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,299
question, who would you rather be?

36
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,329
But it is a cautionary lesson. 4 Reasons Why You Should Utilize Others

37
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,840
Nobody likes a run-down, burned-out hero

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,549
If you insist on doing all the work yourself then you will never get very

39
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,049
far.

40
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,069
Hiring someone or others to do the work for you will give you a godlike quality

41
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:08,169
that others will admire. Take artist Peter Paul Rubens for example,

42
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,819
he assembled a vast array of outstanding artists to paint canvases so that when

43
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:13,959
a client would visit

44
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,959
Rubens’s studio it appeared to the client that Rubens was working

45
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,310
arduously on his painting when in essence the painting was already nearly finished.

46
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,610
Number two ... There are some skills that you do not possess

47
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,700
Hiring people who possess skills that you yourself lack

48
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,509
is probably one of the wisest decisions you can make. Like in the case of artist

49
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:32,109
Rubens,

50
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,690
he hired different types of artists. One artist specialized in robes;

51
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:39,719
another specialized in backgrounds and so on. This is what enabled him to appear

52
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,199
to be working diligently on his paintings.

53
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,409
Although he had procured others to do these paintings, he was able to put his

54
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,139
name on the work, thus being the genius who got the credit and the money.

55
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,659
Number three ...  Standing on the shoulders of giants can be brilliantly manipulated

56
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,349
Isaac Newton, a genius in his own right made his discoveries

57
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,199
built on the achievement of others. Shakespeare borrowed plots and other works

58
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,419
from several writers

59
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,869
and we can only guess how many people plagiarized the works of Shakespeare

60
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,509
himself.

61
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:11,018
Using the knowledge of the past just makes you a clever borrower

62
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,870
and this in of itself is genius. Number
four ... Sharing the credit with others

63
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,530
There is absolutely nothing wrong with sharing the credit with someone especially when that someone

64
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,890
especially when that someone is your superior.

65
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:25,669
Take Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state under Richard Nixon.

66
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:29,599
If it had not been for Kissinger’s diplomacy Nixon’s historic visit to the

67
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,150
People’s Republic of China

68
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,920
would not have been as successful as it was. Knowing when to hold back by not

69
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,109
hogging the spotlight is also a talent that will be beneficial in the long term.

70
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,950
Be wise in your decision. Make sure that your position is unshakable

71
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:46,578
or you will be accused of pushing people out of the limelight and deception is

72
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,840
not a word that you want associated with you. Picture the vulture,

73
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,509
he has it the easiest. The hard work of others becomes his work

74
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,689
due to their failure to survive and they become his nourishment.

75
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:00,750
While you are working hard, he is hovering. Do not fight him, join him.

76
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,000
He is vigilant, ruthless and quiet. Three qualities that you must acquire to

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,400
secure credit for an invention or creation until you can make it your own.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,400
The credit for an invention is as important, if not more important

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,239
than the invention itself. Bismarck once said, “Fools say that they learn from

80
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,119
experience.

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,810
I prefer to profit by others’ experience.”
So, with all that being said - thanks for

82
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,540
watching!

83
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,870
 

84
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,100
 

85
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,160
