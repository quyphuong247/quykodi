00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,769
The 15 Laws of Court Politics
1. Avoid Ostentation. It is never prudent

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:10,129
to prattle on about yourself or call too much
attention to your actions. The more you talk

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,839
about your deeds the more suspicion you cause.
You also stir up enough envy among your peers

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,519
to induce treachery and backstabbing.
2. Practice Nonchalance. Never seem to be

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,570
working too hard. Your talent must appear
to flow naturally, with an ease that makes

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,670
people take you for a genius rather than a
workaholic. It is better for them to marvel

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,379
at how gracefully you have achieved your accomplishment
than to wonder why it took so much work.

8
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:36,849
3. Be Frugal with Flattery. It may seem that
your superiors cannot get enough flattery,

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,210
but too much of even a good thing loses its
value. It also stirs up suspicion among your

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,289
peers. Learn to flatter indirectly—by down-playing
your own contribution, for example, to make

11
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,550
your masters look better.
4. Arrange to Be Noticed. There is a paradox:

12
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:55,479
You cannot display yourself too brazenly,
yet you must also get yourself noticed. This

13
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:01,148
task requires much art. It is often initially
a matter of being seen, in the literal sense.

14
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:05,989
Pay attention to your physical appearance,
then, and find a way to create a distinctive—a

15
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:10,109
subtly distinctive—style and image.
5. Alter Your Style and Language According

16
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:15,319
to the Person You Are Dealing With. The pseudo-belief
in equality—the idea that talking and acting

17
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:20,139
the same way with everyone, no matter what
their rank, makes you somehow a paragon of

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,840
civilization—is a terrible mistake. Those
below you will take it as a form of condescension,

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,219
which it is, and those above you will be offended,
although they may not admit it. You must change

20
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,640
your style and your way of speaking to suit
each person. This is not lying, it is acting,

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,250
and acting is an art, not a gift from God.
Learn the art.

22
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,019
6. Never Be the Bearer of Bad News. The king
kills the messenger who brings bad news: This

23
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,590
is a cliché but there is truth to it. You
must struggle and if necessary lie and cheat

24
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,740
to be sure that the lot of the bearer of bad
news falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring

25
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,828
only good news and your approach will gladden
your master.

26
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:00,328
7. Never Affect Friendliness and Intimacy
with Your Master. He does not want a friend

27
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,899
for a subordinate, he wants a subordinate.
Never approach him in an easy, friendly way,

28
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:09,669
or act as if you are on the best of terms—that
is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal

29
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,609
with you on this level, assume a wary chumminess.
Otherwise err in the opposite direction, and

30
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,340
make the distance between you clear.
8. Never Criticize Those Above You Directly.

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,759
This may seem obvious, but there are often
times when some sort of criticism is necessary—to

32
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,899
say nothing, or to give no advice, would open
you to risks of another sort. You must learn,

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,129
however, to couch your advice and criticism
as indirectly and as politely as possible.

34
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:38,620
Think twice, or three times, before deciding
you have made them sufficiently circuitous.

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,840
Err on the side of subtlety and gentleness.
9. Be Frugal in Asking Those Above You for

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,729
Favors. Nothing irritates a master more than
having to reject someone's request. It stirs

37
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:54,018
up guilt and resentment. Ask for favors as
rarely as possible, and know when to stop.

38
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,530
Rather than making yourself the supplicant,
it is always better to earn your favors, so

39
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,080
that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most
important: Do not ask for favors on another

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,700
person's behalf, least of all a friend's.
10. Never Joke About Appearances or Taste.

41
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:11,310
A lively wit and a humorous disposition are
essential qualities for a good courtier, and

42
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,080
there are times when vulgarity is appropriate
and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke about

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,050
appearance or taste, two highly sensitive
areas, especially with those above you. Do

44
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,260
not even try it when you are away from them.
You will dig your own grave.

45
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:29,598
11. Do Not Be the Court Cynic. Express admiration
for the good work of others. If you constantly

46
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,329
criticize your equals or subordinates some
of that criticism will rub off on you, hovering

47
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,140
over you like a gray cloud wherever you go.
People will groan at each new cynical comment,

48
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:44,009
and you will irritate them. By expressing
modest admiration for other people's achievements,

49
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:49,289
you paradoxically call attention to your own.
12. Be Self-observant. The mirror is a miraculous

50
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,949
invention; without it you would commit great
sins against beauty and decorum. You must

51
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,500
be the mirror, training your mind to try to
see yourself as others see you. Are you acting

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,310
too obsequious? Are you trying too hard to
please? Do you seem desperate for attention,

53
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,750
giving the impression that you are on the
decline? Be observant about yourself and you

54
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,110
will avoid a mountain of blunders.
13. Master Your Emotions. As an actor in a

55
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,160
great play, you must learn to cry and laugh
on command and when it is appropriate. You

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,790
must be the master of your own face. Call
it lying if you like; but if you prefer to

57
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,379
not play the game and to always be honest
and upfront. Do not complain when others call

58
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:30,399
you obnoxious and arrogant.
14. Fit the Spirit of the Times. A slight

59
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,060
affectation of a past era can be charming,
as long as you choose a period at least twenty

60
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,978
years back; wearing the fashions of ten years
ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the role

61
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:44,939
of court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking
must keep up with the times, even if the times

62
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:51,019
offend your sensibilities. You are best off
at least being able to mimic the spirit of

63
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:53,399
the times.
15. Be a Source of Pleasure. This is critical.

64
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,000
It is an obvious law of human nature that
we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful,

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,550
while charm and the promise of delight will
draw us like moths to a flame. Make yourself

66
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,228
the flame and you will rise to the top. Not
everyone can play the role of favorite, for

67
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:12,240
not everyone is blessed with charm and wit.
But we can all control our unpleasant qualities

68
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,009
and obscure them when necessary.
They deceptively play with appearances, only

69
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:21,819
letting those around them see what they want
them to see. With so much deception and manipulation

70
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:25,909
afoot, it is essential to keep people from
seeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight

71
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,330
of hand.
