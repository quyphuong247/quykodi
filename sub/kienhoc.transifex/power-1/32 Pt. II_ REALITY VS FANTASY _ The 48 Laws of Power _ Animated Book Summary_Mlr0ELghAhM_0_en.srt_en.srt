REALITY VS FANTASY
As you search for the fantasy that will take

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,960
hold of the masses, then, keep your eye on
the banal truths that weigh heavily on us

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,539
all. Never be distracted by people's glamorous
portraits of themselves and their lives; search

4
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:21,150
and dig for what really imprisons them. Once
you find that, you have the magical key that

5
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,629
will put great power in your hands.
Although times and people change, let us examine

6
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:31,948
a few of the oppressive realities that endure,
and the opportunities for power they provide:

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,880
The Reality: Change is slow and gradual. It
requires hard work, a bit of luck, a fair

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,340
amount of self-sacrifice, and a lot of patience.
The Fantasy: A sudden transformation will

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,329
bring a total change in one's fortunes, bypassing
work, luck, self-sacrifice, and time in one

10
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:55,179
fantastic stroke.
Promise a great and total change—from poor

11
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,420
to rich, sickness to health, misery to ecstasy—and
you will have followers.

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,359
The Reality: The social realm has hard-set
codes and boundaries. We understand these

13
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:10,009
limits and know that we have to move within
the same familiar circles, day in and day

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,478
out.
The Fantasy: We can enter a totally new world

15
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:18,109
with different codes and the promise of adventure.
To bring power, fantasy must remain to some

16
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:24,259
degree unrealized, literally unreal.
The Reality: Society is fragmented and full

17
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,118
of conflict.
The Fantasy: People can come together in a

18
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:32,228
mystical union of souls.
Promise such a union and you can gain much

19
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:36,868
power, but it is a dangerous power that can
easily turn against you. This is a fantasy

20
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:42,000
for demagogues to play on.
The Reality: Death. The dead cannot be brought

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,759
back, the past cannot be changed.
The Fantasy: A sudden reversal of this intolerable

22
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,890
fact.
Something seems real precisely because the

23
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,259
public and the experts as well, so desperately
want to believe they are.

24
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:01,438
Reminder: The key to fantasy is distance.
The distant has allure and promise, seems

25
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,548
simple and problem free. What you are offering,
then, should be ungraspable. Never let it

26
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:12,040
become oppressively familiar; it is the mirage
in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker

27
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:18,479
approaches. Never be too direct in describing
the fantasy—keep it vague. As a forger of

28
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,000
fantasies, let your victim come close enough
to see and be tempted, but keep him far away

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,949
enough that he stays dreaming and desiring.
WARNING

30
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:32,568
Fantasy usually contains an element of play—the
public half realizes it is being duped, but

31
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:37,669
it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing
the entertainment and the temporary diversion

32
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:42,429
from the everyday that you are providing.
So keep it light—never come too close to

33
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,650
the place where you are actually expected
to produce results. That place may prove extremely

34
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,069
hazardous.
