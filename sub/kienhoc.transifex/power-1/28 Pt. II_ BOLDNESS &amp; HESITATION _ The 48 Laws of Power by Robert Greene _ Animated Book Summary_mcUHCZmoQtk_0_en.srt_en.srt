1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,330
Boldness and Hesitation: Elicit very different
psychological responses in their targets:

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,169
Hesitation puts obstacles in your path
Boldness eliminates them.

3
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:16,769
Once you understand this, you will find it
essential to overcome your natural timidity

4
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,119
and practice the art of audacity.
The following are among the most pronounced

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,850
psychological effects of boldness and timidity:
1. The Bolder the Lie the Better

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,279
Entering action with boldness has the magical
effect of hiding our deficiencies.

7
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:37,219
When putting together a con or entering any
kind of negotiation, go further than you planned.

8
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,899
Ask for the moon and you will be surprised
how often you get it.

9
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:46,049
2. Lions Circle the Hesitant Prey
In a first encounter, you demonstrate your

10
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,308
willingness to compromise, back down, and
retreat, you bring out the lion even in people

11
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:56,468
who are not necessarily bloodthirsty.
Everything depends on perception, and once

12
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:01,189
you are seen as the kind of person who quickly
goes on the defensive, who is willing to negotiate

13
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:04,588
and be amenable, you will be pushed around
without mercy.

14
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:10,618
3. Boldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority
The bold move makes you seem larger and more

15
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,450
powerful than you are. If it comes suddenly,
with the stealth and swiftness of a snake,

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,289
it inspires that much more fear.
By intimidating with a bold move, you establish

17
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:25,968
a precedent: in every subsequent encounter,
people will be on the defensive, in terror

18
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:30,849
of your next strike.
4. Going Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the

19
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:34,349
Deeper Grave
If you enter an action with less than total

20
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,769
confidence, you set up obstacles in your own
path.

21
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:43,858
When a problem arises you will grow confused,
seeing options where there are none and inadvertently

22
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:48,390
creating more problems still.
Retreating from the hunter, the timid hare

23
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:55,009
scurries more easily into his snares.
5. Hesitation Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates

24
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,468
Them
When you take time to think, to hem and haw,

25
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,209
you create a gap that allows others time to
think as well.

26
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:06,599
Your timidity infects people with awkward
energy, elicits embarrassment. Doubt springs

27
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,829
up on all sides.
Boldness Destroys Such Gaps.

28
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,590
The swiftness of the move and the energy of
the action leave others no space to doubt

29
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,939
and worry.
In seduction, hesitation is fatal.

30
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,719
The bold move crowns seduction with triumph:
It leaves no time for reflection.

31
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,439
6. Audacity Separates You from the Herd
Boldness gives you presence and makes you

32
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,579
seem larger than life.
The timid fade into the wallpaper, the bold

33
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,580
draw attention, and what draws attention draws
power.

34
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,820
We cannot keep our eyes off the audaciousâ€”we
cannot wait to see their next bold move.

35
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:48,169
You must practice and develop your boldness.
You will often find uses for it. The best

36
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:53,699
place to begin is often the delicate world
of negotiation, particularly those discussions

37
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,849
in which you are asked to set your own price.
How often we put ourselves down by asking

38
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:01,289
for too little.
But be warned...

39
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:06,509
Boldness should never be the strategy behind
all of your actions. It is a tactical instrument,

40
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:11,769
to be used at the right moment. Plan and think
ahead, and make the final element the bold

41
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,290
move that will bring you success. In other
words, since boldness is a learned response,

42
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,500
it is also one that you learn to control and
utilize at will.
