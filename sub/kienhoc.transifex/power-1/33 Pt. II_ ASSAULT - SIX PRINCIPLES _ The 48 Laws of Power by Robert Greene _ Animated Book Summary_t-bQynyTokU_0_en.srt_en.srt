In planning your assault, keep these Six principles

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,379
in mind:
1. Pay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,910
Signals
As Sigmund Freud remarked, "No mortal can

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,649
keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he
chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes

5
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:24,579
out of him at every pore." This is a critical
concept in the search for a person's weakness—it

6
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:28,880
is revealed by seemingly unimportant gestures
and passing words.

7
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,329
The key is not only what you look for but
where and how you look.

8
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,429
Train yourself to listen.
Start by always seeming interested—the appearance

9
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:41,519
of a sympathetic ear will spur anyone to talk.
Share a secret with them. It can be completely

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,010
made up, or it can be real but of no great
importance to you· This will usually elicit

11
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:50,140
a response that reveals a weakness.
Train your eye for details

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,509
How someone tips a waiter.
What delights a person.

13
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:57,539
Hidden messages in clothes.
Find people's idols, the things they worship

14
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,259
and will do anything to get—perhaps you
can be the supplier of their fantasies.

15
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:06,439
2. Find the Helpless Child
Most weaknesses begin in childhood, before

16
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,509
the self builds up compensatory defenses.
A. Perhaps the child was pampered or indulged

17
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,609
in a particular area. If they reveal a secret
taste, a hidden indulgence, indulge it. In

18
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,599
either case they will be unable to resist
you. The indulgence or the deficiency may

19
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,309
be buried but never disappears. B. Perhaps
a certain emotional need went unfulfilled.

20
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,868
If your victims or rivals went without something
important, such as parental support, when

21
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:36,519
they were children, supply it. Learn about
a childhood need; a powerful key to a person's

22
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,739
weakness. One sign of this weakness is that
when you touch on it the person will often

23
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,339
act like a child. Be on the lookout, then,
for any behavior that should have been outgrown.

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,530
3. Look for Contrasts
An overt trait often conceals its opposite.

25
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,019
1. People who thump their chests are often
big cowards; a prudish exterior may hide a

26
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:01,810
lascivious soul 2. The uptight are often screaming
for adventure; the shy are dying for attention.

27
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,430
3. Probe beyond appearances, you will often
find people's weaknesses in the opposite of

28
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,218
the qualities they reveal to you.
4. Find the Weak Link

29
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:16,340
Sometimes in your search for weaknesses it
is not what but who that matters. A. There

30
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,709
is often someone behind the scenes who has
a great deal of power, a tremendous influence

31
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,598
over the person superficially on top. These
behind-the-scenes powerbrokers are the group's

32
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,378
weak link: Win their favor and you indirectly
influence the king. B. Find the one person

33
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:36,318
who will bend under pressure. When a group
under attack closes ranks to resist an outsider—there

34
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,638
is always a weak link in the chain.
5. Fill the Void

35
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:45,558
The two main emotional voids to fill are insecurity
and unhappiness. 1. The insecure are suckers

36
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:50,229
for any kind of social validation; as for
the chronically unhappy, look for the roots

37
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:55,539
of their unhappiness. 2. The insecure and
the unhappy are the people least able to disguise

38
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:59,798
their weaknesses. The ability to fill their
emotional voids is a great source of power,

39
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,558
and an indefinitely prolonged one.
6. Feed on Uncontrollable

40
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:10,650
The uncontrollable emotion can be a paranoid
fear. 1. Fear disproportionate to the situation.

41
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,260
2. Or any base motive such as lust, greed,
vanity, or hatred. People in the grip of these

42
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,019
emotions often cannot control themselves,
and you can do the controlling for them.

43
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,739
Five Reminders
1. Since we all try to hide our weaknesses,

44
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,878
there is little to be learned from our conscious
behavior. What oozes out in the little things

45
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,268
outside our conscious control is what you
want to know.

46
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,408
2. Find the weak link, the person in control
is often not the king or queen; it is someone

47
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:42,198
behind the scenes, the favorite, the husband
or wife, even the court fool. This person

48
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,269
may have more weaknesses than the king himself,
because his power depends on all kinds of

49
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,879
capricious factors outside his control.
3. When searching for suckers, always look

50
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,948
for the dissatisfied, the unhappy, and the
insecure. Such people are riddled with weaknesses

51
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,519
and have needs that you can fill. Their neediness
is the groove in which you place your thumbnail

52
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,620
and turn them at will.
4. Always look for passions and obsessions

53
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,120
that cannot be controlled. The stronger the
passion, the more vulnerable the person: This

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,158
may seem surprising, for passionate people
look strong. In fact, however, they are simply

55
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,000
filling the stage with their theatricality,
distracting people from how weak and helpless

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,899
they really are.
5. Look at the part of a person that is most

57
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:27,789
visible—their greed, lust, intense fear.
These are the emotions they cannot conceal,

58
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,490
and over which they have the least control.
And what people cannot control, you can control

59
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,449
for them.
But as always be warned.

60
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,329
Playing on people's weakness has one significant
danger: You may stir up an action you cannot

61
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:45,089
control. In your games of power you always
look several steps ahead and plan accordingly.

62
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:50,019
And you exploit the fact that other people
are more emotional and incapable of such foresight.

63
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:54,370
But when you play on their vulnerabilities,
the areas over which they have least control,

64
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,790
you can unleash emotions that will upset your
plans.

65
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,710
Push timid people into bold action and they
may go too far; answer their need for attention

66
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,799
or recognition and they may need more than
you want to give them. The helpless, childish

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,639
element you are playing on can turn against
you. The more emotional the weakness, the

68
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,759
greater the potential danger! Know the limits
to this game, then, and never get carried

69
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,649
away by your control over your victims. You
are after power, not the thrill of control.
