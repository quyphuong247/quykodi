00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,699
The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law Number 24: Play the Perfect Courtier

2
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:15,619
The perfect courtier thrives in a world where
everything revolves around power and political

3
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:21,269
dexterity. He has mastered the art of indirection;
he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts

4
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,969
power over others in the most oblique and
graceful manner. Learn and apply the laws

5
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:30,250
of courtier-ship and there will be no limit
to how far you can rise in the court.

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,640
In the past the court garnered around the
ruler, and had many functions: Besides keeping

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,090
the ruler amused, it was a way to solidify
the hierarchy of royalty, nobility, and the

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,910
upper classes, and to keep the nobility both
subordinate and close to the ruler, so that

9
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:48,989
he could keep an eye on them. The court serves
power in many ways, but most of all it glorifies

10
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,469
the ruler, providing him with a microcosmic
world that must struggle to please him.

11
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:59,210
Alexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean
basin and the Middle East through to India

12
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,058
was mentored & tutored by the great Aristotle.
He complained that on his long campaigns he

13
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:10,950
could not discuss philosophical matters with
anyone worthy of such a conversation. Aristotle

14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,889
suggested Alexander best take Callisthenes,
a former pupil of Aristotle and a promising

15
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:22,358
philosopher with him on his journeys. But
Callisthenes believed in pure philosophy,

16
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:27,780
free from censorship – he would speak his
mind instead of tailoring his words carefully

17
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,989
as Aristotle had taught him. One day Callisthenes
dared offend Alexander one too many times

18
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,169
and was put to death.
Being honest all the time will make more enemies

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,709
than you can count. Criticism is to be given
with extreme caution, best avoided or given

20
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:49,509
indirectly as in the next example.
During the Han Dynasty 2’000 years ago Chinese

21
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,299
scholars compiled a series of writings called
the 21 Histories, an official biography of

22
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,840
each dynasty. In each history the scholars
would write down “Unusual Events” such

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,200
as earthquakes and floods, that could be historically
verified, but among the listings one would

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,379
find bizarre manifestations of two-headed
sheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly

25
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,370
appearing in different parts of the sky. The
emperor that the world revolved around was

26
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,379
not easy to council. Many servants would find
themselves fall out of favor, lose their positions

27
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:30,250
and lives. When you criticize someone of great
power, in his anger he sees the one criticizing,

28
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,150
not the criticism itself. For that matter,
the Chinese scholars came up with a way to

29
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,400
hide themselves of the emperor’s eyes and
advice him safely. Inserting sightings of

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,069
strange phenomena into the court chronicles
was the only way to warn him. The emperor

31
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:50,419
would read of moons out of orbit and realize
he was being cautioned. He was unbalancing

32
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:54,679
the universe.
Jean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,750
painter of the Napoleonic court. He was to
capture the historic events taking place after

34
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,318
Napoleons defeat and imprisonment in an epic
painting. Talleyrand, main negotiator of the

35
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:10,030
French and the Duke of Wellington, the main
negotiator of the English both approached

36
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,688
him with the same request; to be the center
of attention and to be in the very center

37
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:20,328
of the painting. He created a painting that
honored and satisfied both sides. On one side

38
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:24,489
the Duke enters the room and all eyes are
turned toward him, making him the center of

39
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,299
attention. In the very center of the painting,
meanwhile, sits Talleyrand.

40
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:34,019
You will stumble upon difficult situations
where it will seem you can only satisfy one

41
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,329
of your authorities. You gain favorability
from one and disdain from the other. Like

42
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,120
Jean-Baptiste be on the lookout for a win-win-win
solution.

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,688
One afternoon in ancient China, Chao ruler
of Han got so drunk, that he fell asleep in

44
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:55,239
the garden. The crownkeeper whose sole task
was to look after the rulers crown as his

45
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,628
name suggests, saw the ruler lay on the ground
and put his own coat over him as it was getting

46
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:06,729
cold. When he awoke, the coatkeeper was punished
for neglecting his duties and the crownkeeper

47
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:13,060
was beheaded for overstepping his boundaries.
Go the extra-mile, overdeliver, but never

48
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,160
do too much. Save your energy for time outside
the court.

49
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,200
Fra Filippo Lippi, the Italian Renaissance
painter, sailing for amusement in a small

50
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,539
boat, was captured by pirates who sold him
and his friends into slavery. Finding himself

51
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,439
in a cell with a white wall and access to
charcoal, still in chains, he drew a great

52
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,439
portrait of his owner who soon heard of this
and free’d Filippo upon discovering his

53
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,569
talent, that seemed like a miracle, a gift
from god.

54
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:46,540
Use your skills and talents to be discovered
and get out of imprisonment and slavery. There’s

55
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,629
most likely something you can do greater than
others, use it to flatter your masters and

56
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:57,319
buy their mercy and support.
Alfonso I of Aragon once had a servant who

57
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,689
told him about a dream he supposedly had.
In the dream the king had gifted him weapons,

58
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:09,009
horses and clothes. Alfonso found it humorous
to make the dream a reality, claiming a godlike

59
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:14,509
power for himself. When the same servant approached
him again, having yet another dream of this

60
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:19,589
kind, the king was insulted. He smiled and
said “don’t believe in dreams from now

61
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:24,089
on; they lie.”
Never ask for too much and know when to stop,

62
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:29,129
also never underestimate the intelligence
of your masters. I’m honestly surprised

63
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,659
this story didn’t end with the servant being
sentenced to death, as it was so often the

64
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,410
case in history. If you think you aren’t
getting enough; join the queue with the other

65
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,910
millions of people and instead of complaining,
start using your free time to build your own

66
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,280
source of income, but how the things are running
now; you won’t get much for free in the

67
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,939
traditional way of employment, it’s already
hard to get what you should be getting. So

68
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,149
again, asking for favors from your boss, don’t
go too far.

69
00:05:56,149 --> 00:06:01,439
Here's 16 Successful Courtier Plays
1. They please but are not pleasing too much.

70
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,259
2. Obeying but somehow distinguishing himself
from the other courtiers.

71
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,939
3. Never distinguishing himself so far as
to make the ruler insecure.

72
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,689
4. Have mastered the science of manipulating
people.

73
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:16,259
5. They make the king feel more kingly;
6. They make every-one else fear their power.

74
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,439
7. They are magicians of appearance, knowing
that most things at court are judged by how

75
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,079
they seem.
8. They are gracious and polite.

76
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:28,029
9. Their aggression is veiled and indirect.
10. Masters of the word, they never say more

77
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,979
than necessary.
11. They get the most out of a compliment

78
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,430
or hidden insult.
12. They are magnets of pleasure— People

79
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,980
want to be around them because they know how
to please.

80
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,040
13. They neither fawn nor humiliate themselves.
14. They are wizards in the accumulation of

81
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,379
influence
15. They become the king's favorites, enjoying

82
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,769
the benefits of that position.
16. They often end up more powerful than the

83
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:52,329
ruler.
The royal court may have more or less disappeared,

84
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,870
or at least lost its power, but courts and
courtiers still exist because power still

85
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,870
exists. The laws that govern court politics
are as timeless as the laws of power. There

86
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,269
is much to be learned, then, from great courtiers
past and present.

87
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:10,829
Play the perfect courtier, the greatest chapter
of the book in my humble opinion. In September

88
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:15,159
I'm going to make a podcast on how to play
the courtier in the modern-day world, at your

89
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,060
office job, how to deal with your colleagues,
superiors etc. If you haven't already made

90
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,889
the connection, let me explain. Not a lot
has changed since the beginning of history.

91
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:30,189
As Robert Greene said "the exact same things
are going on today, it's just less bloody."

92
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:34,969
Think of your boss as the King, your superiors
as nobility, your colleagues as courtiers

93
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,710
or servants. We all are servants in a way
if we're employed. The manipulation & power

94
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:44,739
games that is going on in the office is something
you're not taught in school. So, I congratulate

95
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,519
you, you awesome badass, for picking up the
book & watching these videos. You know better

96
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,439
& you arm yourself with powerful knowledge.
I'll leave you with these final words: A man

97
00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:00,579
who knows the court is master of his gestures,
of his eyes and of his face; he is profound,

98
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:05,870
impenetrable; he dissimulates bad offices,
smiles at his enemies, controls his irritation,

99
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,959
disguises his passions, belies his heart,
speaks and acts against his feelings. Jean

100
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,370
de la Bruyere. Thank's for watching.
