Hello & welcome to my channel, illacertus.
Here you'll find the best books on power,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,220
strategy, war & seduction summarized in an
animated fashion.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,519
The footage you're watching right now is a
sped-up compilation of some of my recent work

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,310
on The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene for
which I just got done covering all the chapters.

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:23,618
You might ask yourself, why is this book so
important? It's essentially THE best self-development

6
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:28,829
book out there, helping me and countless others
make sense of the very political & profit

7
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:34,000
driven, modern-day world we live in, while
it also serves as a fantastic introduction

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,420
to Machiavellianism basing its observations
on relevant historical events & figures.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,730
Each video on The 48 Laws of Power playlist
starts by explaining the definition of the

10
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:52,628
Law like this.
The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene

11
00:00:52,628 --> 00:01:01,518
Law 48: Assume Formlessness
By taking a shape, by having a visible plan,

12
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:06,519
you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking
a form for your enemy to grasp keep yourself

13
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:12,140
adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact
that nothing is certain and no law is fixed.

14
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,909
The best way to protect yourself is to be
as fluid and formless as water; never bet

15
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,909
on stability or lasting order. Everything
changes.

16
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,159
Then, with the help of my illustrations, we
look into examples from historical characters

17
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,840
such as Napoleon, Louis XIV, Alexander the
Great, Socrates, the Spartans and many more

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,728
where the specific law has been observed and
either applied correctly or completely ignored.

19
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:42,340
And finally, at the end of the video we explore
the concepts & ideas behind each chapter,

20
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,159
draw our conclusions & recap the lessons we've
learned.

21
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,368
You'll find that the quality of the videos
improves A LOT throughout the series and it's

22
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:55,478
important to know that each law has its own
theme, meaning you can start anywhere & skip

23
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:00,289
ahead to the chapter that most interests you.
With this book coming to an end I'm already

24
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:05,840
working on The 50th Law, The Art of Seduction
& Mastery by my favorite author Robert Greene

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,439
plus The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli, The
Art of War by Sun Tzu and Ralph Waldo Emerson's

26
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,430
essay on Self-Reliance to name just a few
works in the process.
