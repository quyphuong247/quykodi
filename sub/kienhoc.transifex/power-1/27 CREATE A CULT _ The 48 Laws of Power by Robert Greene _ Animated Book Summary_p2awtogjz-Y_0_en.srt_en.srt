The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law Number 27: Create a Cult: Play on People's

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,929
Need to Believe
People have an overwhelming desire to believe

3
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:19,480
in some­thing. Become the focal point of
such desire by offering them a cause, a new

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,359
faith to follow. Keep your words vague but
full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,220
ra­tionality and clear thinking. Give your
new disciples rit­uals to perform, ask them

6
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:35,640
to make sacrifices on your behalf. In the
absence of organized religion and grand causes,

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,789
your new belief system will bring you untold
power.

8
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,149
The gimmicks of the charlatans may seem quaint
today, but there are thousands of charlatans

9
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,350
among us still, using the same tried-and-true
methods their predecessors refined centuries

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,489
ago, only changing the names of their elixirs
and modernizing the look of their cults. We

11
00:00:53,488 --> 00:01:00,189
find these latter-day charlatans in all arenas
of life—business, fashion, politics, art.

12
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:04,390
Many of them, perhaps, are following in the
charlatan tradition without having any knowledge

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,539
of its history, but you can be more systematic
and deliberate. Simply follow the five steps

14
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:13,629
of cult-making that our charlatan ancestors
perfected over the years.

15
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:17,938
5 Ways to Create a Cult
1. Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple

16
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,739
First attract attention. This you should do
not through actions, which are too clear and

17
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,188
readable, but through words, which are hazy
and deceptive. Your initial speeches, conversations,

18
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:31,779
and interviews must include:
The promise of something great and transformative.

19
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,009
The other a total vagueness.
2. Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over

20
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,890
the Intellectual
Once people have begun to gather around you,

21
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,218
two dangers will present themselves:
a. Boredom - will make people go elsewhere.b.

22
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:50,998
Skepticism - will allow them the distance
to think rationally about whatever it is you

23
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:54,998
are offering.· Blowing away the mist you
have artfully created and revealing your ideas

24
00:01:54,998 --> 00:02:00,699
for what they are. You need to amuse the bored,
then, and ward off the cynics. Use theater,

25
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,389
or other devices of its kind. · Surround
yourself with luxury, dazzle your followers

26
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:09,849
with visual splendor, and fill their eyes
with spectacle. Not only will this keep them

27
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,479
from seeing the ridiculousness of your ideas,
the holes in your belief system, it will also

28
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,689
attract more attention, more followers.
3. Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion

29
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:24,539
to Structure the Group
5 Ways to Organize Your Cult-Like Following

30
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:30,039
Find a way both elevating and comforting.
Create rituals for your followers.

31
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,449
Organize them into a hierarchy, ranking them
in grades of sanctity, and giving them names

32
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:40,139
and titles that resound with religious overtones
Ask them for sacrifices that will fill your

33
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:44,789
coffers and increase your power.
To emphasize your gathering's quasi-religious

34
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:51,628
nature, talk and act like a prophet:
You are a priest, a guru, a sage, a shaman,

35
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:56,639
or any other word that hides your real power
in the mist of religion.

36
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,658
4. Disguise Your Source of Income
Your group has grown, and you have structured

37
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:06,949
it in a churchlike form. Your coffers are
beginning to fill with your followers' money.

38
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:12,060
Yet you must never be seen as hungry for money
and the power it brings. It is at this moment

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,780
that you must disguise the source of your
income.

40
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,590
Never reveal that your wealth actually comes
from your followers' pockets; instead, make

41
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,039
it seem to come from the truth of your methods.
Followers will copy your each and every move

42
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,370
in the belief that it will bring them the
same results, and their imitative enthusiasm

43
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,170
will blind them to the charlatan nature of
your wealth.

44
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:38,348
5. Set Up an Us-Versus-Them Dynamic
The group is now large and thriving, a magnet

45
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:43,658
attracting more and more particles. To keep
your followers united, you must now do what

46
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:49,009
all religions and belief systems have done:
Create an us-versus-them dynamic.

47
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:54,449
Make sure your followers believe they are
part of an exclusive club, unified by a bond

48
00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:00,060
of common goals.· Manufacture the notion
of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There

49
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,780
is a force of nonbelievers that will do anything
to stop you.· If you have no enemies, invent

50
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,289
one. Given a straw man to react against, your
followers will tighten and cohere.

51
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,878
But be warned
If at any moment the group sees through you,

52
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,988
you will find yourself facing not one deceived
soul but an angry crowd that will tear you

53
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:25,579
to pieces as avidly as it once followed you.
For this reason, use spies, be on top of everything,

54
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,949
and keep your bags packed.
