The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law Number 23... Concentrate Your Forces

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,678
Conserve your forces and energies by keeping
them concentrated at their strongest point.

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,579
You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining
it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow

4
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,859
mine to another-intensity defeats extensity
every time. When looking for sources of power

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,269
to elevate you, find the one key patron, the
fat cow who will give you milk for a long

6
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,929
time to come
Maybe you can relate to the following?

7
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:39,719
Are you in a state of total distraction and
diffusion, hardly able to keep your mind in

8
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,320
one direction before you are pulled in a thousand
others? The modern world’s level of conflict

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,210
is higher than ever and you internalize it
in your life.

10
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,079
The solution is a form of retreat inside yourself
to the past, to more concentrated forms of

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,539
thought and action.
Single-mindedness of purpose.

12
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:59,839
Total concentration on the goal.
Then use these qualities against people less

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,640
focused.
Such an arrow will find its mark every time

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,319
and overwhelm the enemy. This is what happened
to ancient Athens, which lusted for the faraway

15
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,228
island of Sicily and ended up losing its empire.
The Romans stretched the boundaries of their

16
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:17,049
empire to encompass vast territories; in doing
so they increased their vulnerability, and

17
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:21,889
the chances of invasion from yet another barbarian
tribe. Their useless expansion led their empire

18
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:25,629
into oblivion.
Concentrate on a single goal, a single task,

19
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:29,379
and beat it into submission. You will need
help from other people, usually those who

20
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:33,339
are more powerful than you. More energy is
saved and more power attained when you affix

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,240
yourself to a single, appropriate source of
power.

22
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,528
Find out who controls the operation.
Find out the real director behind the scenes.

23
00:01:40,528 --> 00:01:45,420
Power itself always exists in concentrated
forms. In any organization it is inevitable

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,748
for a small group to hold the strings. And
often it is not those with the titles. In

25
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:53,858
the game of power, only the fool flails about
without fixing his target.

26
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:58,438
You cannot hit two targets with one arrow.
If your thoughts stray, you miss your enemies’

27
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,408
heart. Mind and arrow must become one.
Two Dangers in Concentration

28
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,409
When fighting a stronger army, concentrating
your forces only makes you an easier target—better

29
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,120
to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate
your enemy with the elusiveness of your presence.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,438
Tying yourself to a single source of power
has one preeminent danger: If that person

31
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:21,688
dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suffer.
In cases when you may need protection, then,

32
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:26,060
it is often wise to entwine yourself around
several sources of power. Such a move would

33
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,500
be especially prudent in periods of great
tumult and violent change, or when your enemies

34
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,250
are numerous. The more patrons and masters
you serve the less risk you run if one of

35
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,620
them falls from power. Such dispersion will
even allow you to play one off against the

36
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,340
other. Even if you concentrate on the single
source of power, you still must practice caution,

37
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,218
and prepare for the day when your master or
patron is no longer there to help you.

38
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:53,289
Finally, being too single-minded in purpose
can make you an intolerable bore, especially

39
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:57,289
in the arts.
That's it for this law, if you haven't already

40
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:02,158
- check out the new format series I've started
uploading. I call them podcast shorts & it's

41
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,209
a great way, I feel, to share my thoughts
with you on relevant subjects surrounding

42
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,310
this channel, if you dislike it, however,
I will concentrate my forces on this series

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,438
that you guys seem to like watching so much.
Thank's for the support.
