The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 43: Work on the Heart and Mind

2
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:16,019
of Others
Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:21,269
work against you. You must seduce others into
wanting to move in your direction. A person

4
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,359
you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn.
And the way to seduce others is to operate

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,380
on their individual psychologies and weaknesses.
Soften up the resistant by working on their

6
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:34,460
emotions, playing on what they hold dear and
what they fear. Ignore the hearts and minds

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,670
of others and they will grow to hate you.
Example:

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,960
Near the end of the reign of Louis XV, all
of France seemed desperate for change. When

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,780
the king’s grandson and chosen successor,
the future Louis XVI, married the fifteen-year-old

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,198
daughter of the empress of Austria, the French
caught a glimpse of the future that seemed

11
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:59,640
hopeful. The young bride, Marie-Antoinette.
But as soon as Marie-Antoinette became queen

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,228
she abandoned herself to the pleasures she
loved the most—ordering and wearing the

13
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:09,780
most expensive gowns and jewelry in the realm;
sporting the most elaborate hair in history,

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,129
her sculpted coiffures rising as much as three
feet above her head; and throwing a constant

15
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:21,828
succession of masked balls and fêtes. All
of these whims she paid for on credit, never

16
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:25,919
concerning herself with the cost or who paid
the bills.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,390
She had been running up her huge expenditures,
the country was headed for ruin, but her subjects

18
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:39,909
could rot in hell for all she cared.
In 1789, an unprecedented event took place:

19
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:44,609
the beginning of the French Revolution. The
queen did not worry—let the people have

20
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:48,839
their little rebellion, she seemed to think;
it would soon quiet down and she would be

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,340
able to resume her life of pleasure. That
year the people marched on Versailles, forcing

22
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,340
the royal family to quit the palace and take
residence in Paris. This was a triumph for

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,020
the rebels, but it offered the queen an opportunity
to heal the wounds she had opened and establish

24
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:09,829
contact with the people. The queen, however,
had not learned her lesson: Not once would

25
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:17,170
she leave the palace during her stay in Paris.
In October of 1793, when the revolution officially

26
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:22,399
declared the end of the monarchy, she was
found guilty and finally knelt at the guillotine,

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,150
unrepentant and defiant to the bitter end.
Here are five of the most disastrous attitudes

28
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,209
in the Realm of Power
1. Types like Marie-Antoinette live in their

29
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,459
own bubble.
2. They seem to feel they are born kings and

30
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,430
queens, and that attention is owed them.
3. They do not consider anyone else's nature,

31
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,330
but bulldoze over people with their self-righteous
arrogance.

32
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,549
4. Pampered and indulged as children, so as
adults they still believe that everything

33
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:52,129
must come to them; convinced of their own
charm.

34
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:57,408
5. They make no effort to charm, seduce, or
gently persuade anyone.

35
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,649
The Energy and Art of Seduction commands that
1. At all times you must attend to those around

36
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,069
you, gauging their particular psychology,
2. Tailor your words to what you know will

37
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:12,378
entice and seduce them.
3. The higher you are elevated above the crowd,

38
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:17,328
the greater the need to remain attuned to
the hearts and minds of those below you,

39
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:21,260
4. Create a base of support to maintain you
at the pinnacle.

40
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:25,158
Wrong Moves
· Your first option, "to not distress yourself

41
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:30,348
with such petty affairs," may be quick and
easy, but over time it brews ugly emotions

42
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:35,268
in the hearts of the vanquished.
· Their resentment turns to hatred; such

43
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,799
animosity keeps you on the edge.
· You spend your energy protecting what you

44
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,000
have gained, growing paranoid and defensive.
· Without that base of support, your power

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,489
will teeter, and at the slightest change of
fortune those below will gladly assist in

46
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:58,120
your fall from grace.
· Force will only strengthen their resistance.

47
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,519
Think Critically Before You Act
· Use patience, it brings you peace of mind;

48
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,169
it converts a potential enemy into a pillar
of support.

49
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:12,280
· Take the time to calculate and attune yourself
to your targets' emotional makeup and psychological

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,560
weaknesses.
· Be alert to what separates them from everyone

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,970
else (their individual psychology) and what
they share with everyone else

52
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,600
· Soften them up, alternate harshness with
mercy.

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,879
· Play on their basic fears: hate, jealousy
and also primary emotions

54
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,730
· Once you break them down, you will have
a lifelong friend and fiercely loyal ally.

55
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,910
· Demonstrating, as simply as possible, how
an action will benefit them.

56
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,170
· Self-interest is the strongest motive of
all: it secures the deal.

57
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,980
· The wider your support base the stronger
your power.

58
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,810
But tread lightly
Understanding that one alienated, disaffected

59
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,350
soul can spark a blaze of discontent, you
too must constantly win over more allies on

60
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,220
all levels—a time will inevitably come when
you will need them.

61
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,580
And as always thanks for watching.
