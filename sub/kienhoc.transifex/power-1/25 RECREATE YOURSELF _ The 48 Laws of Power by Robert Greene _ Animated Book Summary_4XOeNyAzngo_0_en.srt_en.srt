The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law Number 25: Recreate Yourself

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,620
Do not accept the roles that society foists
on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new

3
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:20,679
identity, one that commands attention and
never bores the audience. Be the master of

4
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:25,879
your own image rather than letting others
define it for you. Incorporate dramatic devices

5
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,489
into your public gestures and actions—your
power will be enhanced and your character

6
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,399
will seem larger than life.
3 Ways to Be The Consummate Chameleon

7
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,929
1. You must learn to enlarge your actions
through dramatic techniques such as surprise,

8
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:44,070
suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic
identification.

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,140
2. You must be constantly aware of your audience
- of what will please them and what will bore

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,000
them.
3. You must arrange to place yourself at the

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,689
center, to command attention, and never to
be upstaged at any cost.

12
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:02,570
Because of his own obsessive interest in drama,
Julius Caesar was perhaps the first public

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,849
figure to understand the vital link between
power and theater. He sublimated this interest

14
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:13,108
by making himself an actor and director of
the world stage. Even while dying, he kept

15
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:18,419
his sense of drama. Drawing the top of his
gown over his face, he let go of the clothes

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,140
lower part so that it draped his legs, allowing
him to the covered and decent. According to

17
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,968
the Roman historian Suetonius, his final words
to his old friend Brutus, who was about to

18
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:36,089
deliver a second blow, were in Greek, and
as if rehearsed for the end of a play: "You

19
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,799
too, my child?"
Understand the following: The world wants

20
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,920
to assign you a role in life. And once you
accept that role you are doomed. Your power

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,269
is limited to the tiny amount allotted to
the role you have selected or have been forced

22
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:57,548
to assume. An actor, on the other hand, plays
many roles. Enjoy that protean power, and

23
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:02,420
if it is beyond you, at least forge a new
identity, one of your own making, one that

24
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,140
has had no boundaries assigned to it by an
envious and resentful world. This act of defiance

25
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,539
is Promethean: It makes you responsible for
your own creation.

26
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,109
Your new identity will protect you from the
world precisely because it is not "you"; it

27
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,989
is a costume you put on and take off. You
need not take it personally. And your new

28
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,009
identity sets you apart, gives you theatrical
presence. Those in the back rows can see you

29
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:31,649
and hear you. Those in the front rows marvel
at your audacity.

30
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,510
The Promethean task of the powerful is to
take control of the process, to stop allowing

31
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:41,750
others that ability to limit and mold them.
Remake yourself into a character of power.

32
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,979
Working on your-self like clay should be one
of your greatest and most pleasurable life

33
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:53,179
tasks. It makes you in essence an artist—
an artist creating yourself. In fact, the

34
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,409
idea of self-creation comes from the world
of art.

35
00:02:56,408 --> 00:03:00,878
Steps in the process of self-creation is
1. You must be Self-Conscious

36
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:06,268
Being aware of yourself as an actor and taking
control of your appearance and emotions.

37
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,049
2. You must learn Self-Control.
Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can

38
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:17,409
mold his or her face to the emotion required.
3. Creation of a memorable character

39
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:22,769
A character that compels attention, that stands
out above the other players on the stage.

40
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,989
Good drama, however, needs more than an interesting
appearance, or a single stand-out moment.

41
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,390
Drama takes place over time—it is an unfolding
event. Rhythm and timing are critical. One

42
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,048
of the most important elements in the rhythm
of drama is suspense.

43
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,090
The key to keeping the audience on the edge
of their seats is letting events unfold slowly

44
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,688
then speeding them up at the right moment,
according to a pattern and tempo that you

45
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:50,188
control.
Besides covering a multitude of sins, good

46
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:55,370
drama can also confuse and deceive your enemy.
Other dramatic effects for your repertoire

47
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,370
include the beau geste, an action at a climactic
moment that symbolizes your triumph or your

48
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,688
boldness. You must also appreciate the importance
of stage entrances and exits.

49
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:11,539
Remember that overacting can be counterproductive—it
is another way of spending too much effort

50
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:16,250
trying to attract attention. It is less what
you do that matters, clearly, than how you

51
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,610
do it—your gracefulness and imposing stillness
on the social stage count for more than overdoing

52
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,860
your part and moving around too much.
Finally: Learn to play many roles, to be whatever

53
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,449
the moment requires. Adapt your mask to the
situation—be protean in the faces you wear.

54
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,889
And that is it for this law, I hope you've
subscribed already, because otherwise, man

55
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,060
I can't help you. It's really that simple,
you have to help yourself and click that button.

56
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,839
Thank's for watching.
