The 48 Laws of Power

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,480
by Robert Greene |  Law number seventeen ... Make Other People Come To You

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,410
Use Bait if Necessary - When you force the other person to act,

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,390
you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you,

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,429
abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains

7
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:25,899
—then attack. You hold the cards.

8
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,618
Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, the foreign minister to Napoleon can attest to

9
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:30,129
this caveat.

10
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:33,238
Talleyrand was a mastermind manipulator who was behind the dramatic

11
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:34,769
escape of Napoleon

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,530
after his exile to the island of Elba. Talleyrand knew that Napoleon’s

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,050
arrogance was his weakness

14
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,229
and he played to that weakness like a strategic poker player.

15
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,019
Not showing his true feelings toward the emperor, Talleyrand bided his time,

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,760
made the right connections, which helped create the most elaborate scheme to

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,369
dethrone one of the world’s most

18
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:56,828
infamous people, Napolean Bonaparte.
These are some strategies to keep in

19
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,500
mind during war times.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,539
Reacting rather than directing. Keep others reacting to your moves, keep them

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,710
on the defensive.

22
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,349
Play to their ineffectiveness to stay calm. Aggression

23
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:13,109
versus effective action. Don’t waste a lot of energy trying to make your point,

24
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,599
bide your time like Talleyrand. Make the other person come to you,

25
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,959
set the bait. Control the situation.
Know your opponents weakness.

26
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,539
He who has control has the power. Master your emotions.

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,150
Never be influenced through your anger. Aggressive people are never in control.

28
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,650
Case and point: During the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905,

29
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,250
Japan was able to plant false information that made the Russian fleet

30
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,650
go 6000 miles

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,780
out of the way and forced the Russians into hostile territory.

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,890
The Russian seamen were weak and exhausted by the journey and although

33
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,978
Japan had the weaker naval militia,

34
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:51,109
they planted the bait which gave them the upper-hand on the Russians and

35
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,090
needless to say

36
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,728
the Japanese crushed the Russians because of their reaction to the rumor.

37
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:58,798
Now, 5 Benefits to making your opponents come to you

38
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,409
It is a wise thing to lure your opponent on hostile ground;

39
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,310
it is a subtle way to put him on the defensive.

40
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,030
Your opponent will be nervous which will cause him to rush his actions and make

41
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,819
mistakes.

42
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:13,370
You want to create the illusion that your opponent is in control of the

43
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,150
situation.

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,150
Oftentimes, your opponent’s greed, desires and emotions will be their great

45
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,960
motivator which means that they can be easily led around and/or defeated.

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,900
Getting people to dig their own graves forces their hand and makes you appear

47
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,000
powerful and demand respect.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,300
Now, is there ever a good time to go to your opponent, you ask?

49
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,469
Yes, of course there is an exception to the rule when you should go to your

50
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:34,979
opponent.

51
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,409
Depending on the situation, bait and wait is a wise choice

52
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:41,629
but taking the lead to attack your opponent can be advantageous

53
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,250
as well. The element of surprise does not give the opponent time to think of a

54
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,169
counter attack.

55
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:49,329
They are left at your mercy and must respond to your terms.

56
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,890
Your biggest issue is to know what tactic to use and the right time to use it

57
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:56,699
To bait and wait or to strike with force, that is the dilemma.

58
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:59,839
You can be like the bear hunter who lays the honey bait trap.

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,860
He doesn’t exhaust himself and risk his life to find the bear

60
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,910
he lays a trap and waits patiently for the bear to come to him.

61
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,849
Or if time is not on your side, strike quickly to intimidate and control.

62
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,150
Choose your approach wisely. And that's
that for this law,
