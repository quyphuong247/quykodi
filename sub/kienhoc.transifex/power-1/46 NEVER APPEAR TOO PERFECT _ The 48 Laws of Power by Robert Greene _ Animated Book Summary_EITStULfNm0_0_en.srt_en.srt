The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
Law number 46: Never Appear Too Perfect

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,149
Appearing better than others is always dangerous,
but most dangerous of all is to appear to

3
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:23,269
have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates
silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally

4
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:29,278
display defects, and admit to harmless vices,
in order to deflect envy and appear more human

5
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:35,250
and approachable. Only gods and the dead can
seem perfect with impunity.

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,058
Now, this is not so much about being perfect,
in the literal sense like "You don't ever

7
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:45,500
make mistakes, you're just a god among the
mortals, impeccable in every way, whatever

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,908
you decide to do you're successful, no failures,
weaknesses whatsoever." It's not about that,

9
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:55,628
as a human being, and this is my personal
opinion, feel free to disagree with me, you

10
00:00:55,628 --> 00:01:00,798
cannot possibly be perfect. You definitely
can reach Mastery in your craft, but you cannot

11
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:07,140
be perfect. It's a law of nature, we humans,
we're NOT perfect. You can accept your weaknesses

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,560
and work on them, not allowing yourself to
be bad at anything... or you solely focus

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,640
on your strengths and expand on them, ignoring
what you're bad at. But too much of any of

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,530
these and you're either a Jack of all trades,
or a very limited talent, missing out on everything

15
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,450
else you chose to ignore. I think we all need
to find a healthy balance between the two

16
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,799
and most importantly have a need, a craving,
a sort of hunger for knowledge to eventually

17
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,630
become a well-rounded, interesting, charmful,
unique and successful individual.

18
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:43,578
That being said I got good news and bad news
for you.

19
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:48,408
The good news is, you're watching this, that
alone is proof to me, that you have that hunger

20
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,819
for knowledge. Congratulations, you have the
potential to reach the top.

21
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:59,200
The bad news, and this is where the law gets
into play. On your way to that vision of yours,

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,460
to becoming the best version of yourself,
to reach Mastery, whatever you wanna call

23
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:08,139
it, you will face a lot of resistance. And
the worst part is, it will come from people

24
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,659
you love, like family and friends and it will
come from authorities, people whose opinions

25
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,030
you could care less about, but have to care
about, if you wanna keep your shitty job.

26
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,009
You have to understand that once you're succeeding
people will get jealous and feel a lot of

27
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:28,239
envy towards you. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once
wrote, "Envy is the tax which all distinction

28
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,360
must pay."
If you're trying be yourself, to find yourself

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,140
and not become your average, modern-day dumb,
fat, lazy, piece of shit without motivation,

30
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:43,859
goals or any skills -person. Then you are
already a target for those people I just described.

31
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,400
And I don't mean to offend anybody, but it
is most likely you know people like that and

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,780
even worse you're close to them. Also, it
is incredibly easy for someone to drag you

33
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,549
down with that Crab-bucket mentality, if you
allow it, if you let it affect you. And the

34
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:03,340
people that have the most effect on you are
the people that are close to you.

35
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,269
Let's just be real and look at reality for
what it is. I know humans are creatures of

36
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:15,280
emotions, not reason, but what the hell is
this nonsensical catering to everyone's emotions,

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,658
feelings... creating safe spaces, completely
blocking out logic and rational thinking.

38
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:25,908
Safe Spaces, what the fuck are you talking
about? Do you honestly think the guys who

39
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:29,378
stormed Omaha beach on D-Day had their fucking
safe space!?

40
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:36,389
I bit my tongue. *psychopathic laugh* ;)
I'm sorry, let's move on.

41
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:43,268
So, we know by now that we're not talking
about avoiding appearing perfect to others,

42
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,789
we're talking about simply appearing to be
better than very viciously insecure people

43
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:52,269
who will take personal offense if they see
you succeed. They hate themselves for not

44
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:57,289
doing what you're doing, but they project
their hate towards you, since, in their mind,

45
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:03,039
it is you who makes them feel bad. They might
have lied to themeselves a million times that

46
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,098
they're happy with their average and even
less than average existence and they've bought

47
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:14,679
into it and now you come along breaking their
self-delusion or atleast challenging their

48
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,689
frame, their little bubble, their quote on
quote reality.

49
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:23,730
But how do you avoid that and still go about
improving yourself? Because you will get hate

50
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,819
no matter what. I've now spent over 500 hours
working on these videos, believe it or not

51
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,639
and still every so often someone's gonna say
the stupidest shit you could imagine to try

52
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,569
and insult me. I have done no wrong to these
people, but they still manage to find reasons

53
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:45,389
to hate on me AND they will find reasons to
hate on you. Two things on that, first I'm

54
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,949
a grown man, I don't need a safe space to
deal with it and 2nd, on my own channel, where

55
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,969
I'm in a position of power, where I can just
ignore and mute and block people who are fucking

56
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,490
retarded, I can care less about offending
haters and haters are always losers, it's

57
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,550
a self-fulfilling prophecy. What you put out
into the world you'll get back eventually,

58
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,829
what goes around, comes around.
But I digress, the point is I can not give

59
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:15,939
a shit on my channel, but in the office for
example, in school, university whatever. If

60
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:21,759
you wanna get far you'll have to try and hide
how powerful you really are and trust me you

61
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,719
are powerful.
"It takes great talent and skill to conceal

62
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,200
one’s talent and skill." - LA ROCHEFOUCAULD
But, how do you deal with this primal mess?

63
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,459
Accept the fact that there will be people
who will surpass you in some way, and you

64
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:41,000
may envy them.
Make that feeling a way of pushing yourself

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,079
to equal or surpass them some-day.
Let envy turn inward and it poisons the soul;

66
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,750
expel it outward and it can move you to greater
heights.

67
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,579
Understand that as you gain power, those below
you will feel envious of you. They may not

68
00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:01,550
show it but it is inevitable. Do not naively
accept the facade they show you—read between

69
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,879
the lines of their criticisms, their little
sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing,

70
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,310
the excessive praise that is preparing you
for a fall, the resentful look in the eye.

71
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,589
Half the problem with envy comes when you
do not recognize it.

72
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:20,109
Since it is far easier to avoid creating envy
in the first place than to get rid of it once

73
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,189
it is there, you should strategize to forestall
it before it grows.

74
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:28,519
It is often your own actions that stir up
envy, your own unawareness.

75
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,069
By becoming conscious of those actions and
qualities that create envy, you can take the

76
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:37,879
teeth out of it before it nibbles you to death.
· Expect that when people envy you they will

77
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,560
work against you insidiously. They will put
obstacles in your path that you will not foresee,

78
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,790
or that you cannot trace to their source.
It is hard to defend yourself against this

79
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,220
kind of attack. And by the time you realize
that envy is at the root of a person's feelings

80
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:57,260
about you, it is often too late: Your excuses,
your false humility, your defensive actions,

81
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:03,719
will only exacerbate the problem.
Reasons Not to Stir Up Envy

82
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,800
Be careful not to affect a false modesty that
people can easily see through.

83
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,030
Your humility, and your openness to those
you have left behind, has to seem genuine.

84
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:16,699
Any hint of insincerity will only make your
new status more oppressive.

85
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,110
Do not alienate your former peers.
Emphasize how lucky you have been.

86
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,889
Make your happiness seem more attainable to
other people, and the need for envy less acute.

87
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,399
Appear Imperfect
Give those who envy you something to feed

88
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,219
on, distracting them from your more important
sins.

89
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,650
Do not try to help or do favors for those
who envy you; they will think you are condescending

90
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,719
to them.
Consider showing your wealth only on the inside

91
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,370
of your house. Not like Dan Bilzerian for
example, although I love the guy I'm not hating

92
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,350
on him.
Apply this wisdom to your own character.

93
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,410
Finally, be aware that some environments
are more conducive to envy than others. Where

94
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,450
there is a veneer of equality. Envy is also
destructive in democratic environments where

95
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:06,110
overt displays of power are looked down upon.
Be extra sensitive in such environments. It

96
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,830
is almost impossible to avoid envy in such
cases, and there is little you can do but

97
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:17,430
accept it graciously and take none of it personally.
Now before we end this video, I have a few

98
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,139
more words to say. This law ties in perfectly
with Law 1: Never Outshine the Master and

99
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:29,279
Law 20: Never Offending the Wrong Person.
We're almost finished with the book guys,

100
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,860
some of you need give a little more effort
with connecting the books tenets. Everything's

101
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,969
been said atleast 5 times, Greene is my favorite
author, but his books can be quite repetitive

102
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:44,290
at times. Why? Because most of the laws either
work together perfectly well or they contradict

103
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:50,068
eachother. Each reversal is a direct contradiction.
It does not mean a law is wrong, it means

104
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:54,818
everything is situational and it is up to
your awareness and critical thinking abilities

105
00:08:54,818 --> 00:09:01,208
to spot the right time and the right setting
to apply or ignore the law. I hope that makes

106
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:06,119
some sense to you guys, that's something I
can't teach you. Have personal experiences,

107
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,850
observe and analyze everything, reflect and
try to make connections. I suspect I've achieved

108
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,899
this form of clarity through reading social
cues very well, understanding social dynamics

109
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,789
and having gone through all those experiences
and constantly tried to make sense of them.

110
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:29,438
The 6th chapter of Mastery is all about that,
and to quote Greene once again "Success attained

111
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:36,230
without social intelligence is not true mastery,
and will not last."

112
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,100
As always, thanks for watching.
