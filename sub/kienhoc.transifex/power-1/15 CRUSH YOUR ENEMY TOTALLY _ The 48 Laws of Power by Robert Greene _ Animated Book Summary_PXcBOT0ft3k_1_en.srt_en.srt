The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene | Law Number 15... Crush Your Enemy Totally

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,400
All great leaders since Moses have known that

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,289
a feared enemy must be crushed completely.
(Sometimes they have learned this the hard

4
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:22,969
way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter
how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually

5
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:28,538
break out. More is lost through stopping halfway
than through total annihilation: The enemy

6
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:33,789
will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush
him, not only in body but in spirit.

7
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:38,509
4 Ways to Kill or be Killed
1. Do not sympathize with your enemies.

8
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:42,979
Your enemy will bide his time and strike back
when you least expect.

9
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:48,289
2. When you pity or hope for reconciliation,
it will make you hesitate.

10
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:52,219
They may act friendly for the time being,
but they will eventually destroy you

11
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,189
3. An enemy that is left around is like a
half-dead viper that you nurse back to health.

12
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:00,049
You only strengthen their fear and hatred
of you.

13
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:05,179
4. Give your enemies nothing to negotiate,
no hope, no room to maneuver.

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,789
Do not humiliate, yet nurture these resentful
vipers who will one day kill you.

15
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:14,060
This is all the truer with a former friend
who has become an enemy. The law governing

16
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,060
fatal antagonisms reads: Reconciliation is
out of the question. You must exterminate,

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,478
crush, and deny them the chance to return
to haunt you.

18
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,228
Such is the case of Hsiang Yu and his enemy
Liu Pang. Hsiang had proven his ruthlessness

19
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:32,170
on many an occasion, but with Liu Pang he
acted differently. Every time he had his rival

20
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,539
in his hands, something made him hesitateâ€”a
fatal sympathy or respect for the man who

21
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,560
had once been a friend and comrade in arms.
But the moment Hsiang made it clear that he

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,390
intended to do away with Liu, yet failed to
accomplish it, he sealed his own doom.

23
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,399
Liu would not suffer the same hesitation once
the tables were turned. Now Hsiang Yu was

24
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,929
on the run from Liu and when he came upon
a small group of his own retreating soldiers,

25
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:59,289
he cried out, "I hear Liu Pang has offered
one thousand pieces of gold and a fief of

26
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,868
ten thousand families for his head. Let me
do you a favor." He then slits his own throat

27
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,009
and dies.
It is not, of course, a question of murder,

28
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,680
it is a question of banishment. Sufficiently
weakened and then exiled from your world,

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,879
your enemies are rendered harmless.
They have no hope of recovering, insinuating

30
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,098
themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot
be banished, at least understand that they

31
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,878
are plotting against you, and pay no heed
to whatever friendliness they feign.

32
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,929
Sometimes It Is Better To Let Your Enemies
Destroy Themselves

33
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,319
Leave your enemy an escape route. A retreat
is the ultimate demoralizing defeat. Let them

34
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,128
be the agents of their own destruction. The
result will be the same.

35
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:41,158
The risk of crushing an enemy is you embitter
them so much so that they spend years and

36
00:02:41,158 --> 00:03:33,870
years plotting revenge. Do not let your guard
down, but simply crush them again.
