00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,290
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,580


3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,350
DARREN: Paul, to be honest I'm really happy with that second class.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,300
I really liked the tools that you shared.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,040
And I think it's critical to really understand

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,690
your customer, your competitors, and truthfully the broader environment that

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,840
surrounds your company.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,440
And as I was thinking about it, one word came to mind.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,030
And that word is "information".

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,850
And why is because to use those tools effectively,

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,430
I think you have to have good information.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,930
Before you can actually do that SWOT analysis,

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,360
you really have to understand the fine details that surround it.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,550
And I just want to know, do you agree?

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,512
Is that critical?

16
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:49,720
PAUL: Well, for sure, Darren.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,560
And in a little while, I'm going to talk to some

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,000
of the specific tools around market research that we can use.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,240
But one of the challenges today is we're drowning in data.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,150
We're really, really lacking in good insight and rich information.

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,410
And so I really want to focus on quality over quantity and what's useful,

22
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,100
rather than what's easy to get.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,290
And I was hoping that you might be able to bring this to life

24
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,590
with one of your little stories around research insights.

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,804
DARREN: I love a story.

26
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:20,470
PAUL: All right.

27
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,320
Over to you.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,820
DARREN: OK.

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,850
So one thing that excites me about this notion of market research

30
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,630
and information is it's something that I've been doing personally

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,990
for a number of years.

32
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,940
In fact, in doing my PhD a number of years ago,

33
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,150
I was trained pretty extensively on a number of different types of research

34
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,930
approaches.

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,055
And these are the things that Paul's going to bring

36
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:43,700
to light in just a few minutes.

37
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,825
But these are things that many of you have probably

38
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:50,360
heard about, survey techniques, focus groups, in depth interviews,

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,600
observation.

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,390
These are some of the very basic types of ways

41
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,890
that we get information about the consumer,

42
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,930
because you can't really understand consumers.

43
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,390
You can understand competitors.

44
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,620
You can't understand the marketplace unless you have this good information.

45
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,270
And so I'm thinking about a story, an experience in my life

46
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,789
that really has made this powerful.

47
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:16,100
I think of a brand that I did a project for probably about 10 or so years ago.

48
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,450
And this product is kind of a unique product,

49
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,180
but something that's just frankly really fun.

50
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,170
And the brand and the product is Agent Provocateur.

51
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,730
It's a brand out of the UK, and they make lingerie.

52
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,780
And I know what you're thinking right away is,

53
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,700
oh my god, that must've been a hilarious type of research project.

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,630
And it was in so many ways.

55
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,840
Why is because it's a product that's in some ways a bit socially sensitive.

56
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,270
And so we weren't able to just call people up in a phone survey

57
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,940
to do this type of project.

58
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,810
We had to think very carefully about how could we get the best

59
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,780
information from the consumer?

60
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,110
And what had happened, the scenario is that this brand had come to Canada

61
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,860
where I live here in Vancouver.

62
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,320
And they have decided that they wanted to open up a retail store here

63
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,900
in Vancouver.

64
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,160
And before doing that, just like we learned last day,

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,090
they wanted to get a good assessment of the marketplace.

66
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,800
Understand the consumer, understand the competition,

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,150
and understand what people would thing about this new product that

68
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,170
was going to launch here in Vancouver.

69
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,720
And so they asked me, Darren, for your part of the research process

70
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,560
we really want that deep dive on the consumer.

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,020
What do they think?

72
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,010
And so I built my research team.

73
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,870
And we did a little bit of practice to see

74
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,453
how we could get the best information.

75
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:40,230
And we learned very quickly that people were a bit uncomfortable

76
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,630
to talk about a product like lingerie.

77
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,380
And so we decided that what we would do is

78
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,920
choose interviewers that were younger, that weren't intimidating in any way.

79
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,960
And we had these interviewers approach people

80
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,495
on the street in downtown Vancouver and offer them an incentive.

81
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:59,570
And so we offered them a $5 Starbucks card

82
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,070
if they would be willing to answer just a few questions about lingerie.

83
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,447
And what we were surprised was that this technique really kind of

84
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,530
knocked down the barriers.

85
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,560
And people were actually very open and actually

86
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,470
had a lot of fun with answering the survey.

87
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,100
And so we were happy to see that when we did the survey,

88
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,330
we had close to 500 responses, which is a nice little piece or chunk

89
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,260
of information that we could work with.

90
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,060
And what was interesting in this specific experience

91
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,210
was that we learned about a number of variables

92
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,650
that were going to be critical to the company as they move forward.

93
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,580
Now before we started this whole research project

94
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,980
and got all these responses, the company had given us some hypotheses.

95
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,480
Or in other words, some guesses or some ideas

96
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,750
about what they thought the consumers in this area would think.

97
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,181
And what they had thought was that their brand--

98
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,930
because they were very proud of the brand,

99
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,721
had been very successful in other markets--

100
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,520
would be very well known in Vancouver.

101
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,835
That was one hypothesis.

102
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:00,710
A second hypothesis, they thought that people

103
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,580
would be pretty excited about the way they did their marketing and promotion.

104
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,160
Specifically, how they communicated to the people in the marketplace.

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,370
And the third thing is they thought that they

106
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,190
really quite knew what types of consumers

107
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,510
would be interested in their products.

108
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,980
Now, one thing to know about Agent Provocateur is their price point

109
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,070
is very, very high.

110
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,500
So when you think about the products, it's very expensive.

111
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,640
For a matching pair of a bra and panties, you're looking at $150 to $200

112
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,660
here in North America.

113
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,490
And that's fairly expensive for some consumers.

114
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,450
And so when we did the research and the results came in,

115
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,230
we were quite surprised that we found on that first question, how well known

116
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,520
were they, they weren't well known.

117
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,430
Very few people here in the marketplace actually knew who they were.

118
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,610
In fact, when we asked people what did they

119
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,650
think the high end or the luxury brands were for lingerie,

120
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,990
people often said Victoria's Secret.

121
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,520
And this upset the company greatly, because they thought what?

122
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,395
If that's what people think high end lingerie is, we have a lot of education

123
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:10,390
to do with our consumers.

124
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,530
That's the way they felt.

125
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,450
The second thing that they found quite interesting

126
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:20,400
was that the type of promotion that they do with the company was a little bit

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,500
risque, in terms of they liked to set up storefronts and have

128
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,770
displays that feature mannequins wearing the lingerie.

129
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,810
And for some people, maybe that's a little too much

130
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,150
in a North American context.

131
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,210
So we showed pictures of these storefronts to consumers

132
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,220
and asked them, did they think it was appropriate or inappropriate?

133
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,670
And as you might guess, we found a bimodal result.

134
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,950
So some people were like, yeah, I love it.

135
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,010
And other people were like, no that's not appropriate for here in Vancouver.

136
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,740
The third and, to me perhaps most interesting, thing we

137
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,870
found from the research was their prediction

138
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,250
was that wealthier consumers-- consumers that

139
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,030
were earning a fair amount of money annually in their households,

140
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,700
well into the six figures-- would be the primary customer.

141
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,920
That this is the group of people-- and we'll

142
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,315
talk next class on the notion of segmentation--

143
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:16,440
but this would be the group of people that would be

144
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,460
really excited to buy these products.

145
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,800
They were shocked though when we found that there was actually

146
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,210
two groups of people when you looked at income

147
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,640
that wanted to buy these products.

148
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,180
Yes, the wealthy.

149
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,520
But also, people that were only making $20,000 to $30,000 or so a year.

150
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,240
Why did they want to buy this high end luxury product?

151
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,320
Well, it's a phenomenon that we call trading up often in consumer behavior.

152
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,530
And it's the idea that sometimes as consumers, there's

153
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,830
certain products that you really want that you can't afford,

154
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,730
but you'll save up for them.

155
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:59,030
And you'll forgo other things because you want that expensive thing.

156
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,450
Some people, that's vacations.

157
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,200
Some people, that's cars.

158
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,020
Some people, that's a piece of art.

159
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,660
And for a good chunk of consumers, it was actually this high end fashion

160
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,800
brand.

161
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
That they wanted to buy, and they would be a lot cheaper perhaps

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,310
for a month on their other expenses.

163
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,760
Now the company was obviously interested and surprised to learn

164
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,010
about these bits of information.

165
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,440
And why it was important was it empowered them as an organization

166
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,520
when they opened their store to know more about the consumer,

167
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,440
understand how to better promote their product,

168
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,309
what the pricing structure would be, what they needed

169
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,450
to do with respect to their brand.

170
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,670
The information empowered the organization to do a much better job,

171
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,890
and hopefully for them be successful.

172
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,620
Now, Paul's going to break all of this down for us, because to tell a fun

173
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,610
