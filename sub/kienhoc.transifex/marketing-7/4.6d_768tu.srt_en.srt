PAUL CUBBON: I've touched on the difference between pricing strategy

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,750
and pricing tactics a couple of times.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,840
And I want to just give you some examples that

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,090
will allow you to see the difference between doing something where you're

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,880
in charge-- you're setting the strategy and then the tactics cascade

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,330
down as ways of implementing that strategy-- versus where you are

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,100
tactically and sometimes almost automatically reacting

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,464
to somebody else and their strategy.

10
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:37,380
How to think about it?

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,090
Do you want to set the strategy and then implement through your tactics?

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,400
Or do you want your tactics to actually reflect your reaction

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,700
to someone else's strategy?

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,820
It's a key point.

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,750
So let me take this forward for you.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,690
Whether you are leading or reacting to others on pricing in the marketplace,

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,800
is a key thing to consider.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,402
The next thing that relates to that is, what are your objectives

19
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:03,860
if you are going to change pricing?

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,380
So I want you to consider the following.

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,760
This line here represents time.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,970
And what typically happens is if our volume is steady over time here

23
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,670
and then we actually discount our pricing,

24
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,330
when we discount our pricing at this stage

25
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,060
here, then what we typically see, we would expect,

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,950
if the sensitivity of the purchaser to the discounted price is sufficient,

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,040
we'll see our volume go up.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,890
So our volume goes up like that.

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,990
And then what happens when here we bring our pricing back up

30
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,480
to where it was before?

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,800
Well, the volume comes down like this.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,730
And then, unfortunately in this situation,

33
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:59,410
we see almost a mirror image of our volume gain in a volume loss.

34
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,410
So what's happened here?

35
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,040
How do we make sense of this?

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,220
We discounted the price.

37
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,720
Why?

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,840
Because maybe we thought more people were going to buy.

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,830
What's happened here is either our existing loyal customers

40
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,720
have stockpiled a brand they were prepared

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,414
to pay full price for at a lower price.

42
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:18,080
Have you ever found yourself doing that?

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,160
Going in and buying five boxes of cereal or five boxes of cookie?

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,270
They're your favorite cookies, and wow, they gave them away to you.

45
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,510
And so you have paid less for them.

46
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,160
The company's made less money.

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,900
Or the alternative scenario is that people who weren't your customers

48
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,570
tried you, but they only tried you because you were cheap.

49
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,480
And after they tried you, whatever they thought of you,

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,560
it wasn't enough to pay the regular price.

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,200
So that's the first situation.

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,149
Typically, it's not a good scenario.

53
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:51,440
And if you do it repeatedly, what you're doing is you're cheapening your brand.

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,980
You're diluting your margin.

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,750
And you're educating your potential customers,

56
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,180
even your ones that like you, to wait until you are on discount

57
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,280
before they buy from you.

58
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,220
So let's look at a second scenario.

59
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,305
A second scenario is this one, and we can go more quickly now.

60
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:11,740
And basically, it goes like this.

61
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,710
So this is where the price goes down, and this

62
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,420
is where the price comes back up.

63
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,480
And so we're getting some additional volume.

64
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,690
But really, we've either got our existing customers stockpiling,

65
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,220
but they consumed more or they gave it away to friends, whatever it may be,

66
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,520
or we brought in some new customers to trial us.

67
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,790
They quite liked it, but they weren't prepared to carry on.

68
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,520
What we really want to do is this third scenario.

69
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,040
We want to do something like this.

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,530


71
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,870
So what's happening over time is this is when our discounted price came in.

72
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,220
This is when our price came back to normal.

73
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,980
And this is our volume.

74
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,480
Our volume has settled kind of at a higher level.

75
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,890
Why is it a higher level?

76
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,010
Because some of the people who were persuaded by the lower price to try

77
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,380
liked it enough that they repurchased again at full price.

78
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,530
So one of the keys here is to say don't discount your price out of desperation.

79
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,950
But typically discount it if you need to to get

80
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:20,950
people to try you when you've got something new and interesting to say.

81
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,510
You've got actually a point of difference

82
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,400
that maybe they were unaware of.

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,570
And then you can combine pricing with your positioning, your branding,

84
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,970
and indeed your communication of that differentiation.

85
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,730
So all in all, when we bring this to a close, pricing is complicated.

86
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,120
But like most things we're discussing, we can unpack it.

87
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,090
We can break it down, and we can systematically

88
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,350
design pricing strategies.

89
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,360
And then we can experiment to understand what works for us and what does not.
