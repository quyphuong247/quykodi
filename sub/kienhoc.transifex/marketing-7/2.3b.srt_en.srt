1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,580
PAUL: So now that we've organized our base thinking about why

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,710
we're doing market research and some of the key pitfalls to avoid, let's

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,180
look at how we might frame our approach to the types of market research

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,700
we'll do.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,860
Now, in this particular course, we're not

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,440
going to get into the tactical details of how you actually design and execute,

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,810
but is the thought process about the types.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:40,650
So we're going to come back to a nice two-by-two grid,

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,340
with my squeaky marker.

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,976
And it is going to look something like this.

11
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:47,850
And what we're going to do is, is we're going

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:56,600
to look at the differences between primary and secondary research.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,860
So what do we mean by primary research?

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,360
Primary research means that we are the first gatherers of the data,

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,080
and then analyzers of it.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,050
We commission it.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,690
We pay for it.

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,540
So it tends to be more expensive.

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,900
But it also tends to be more customized to our particular need.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,200
And then, on the secondary side, well, all that means

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
is we are the secondary users.

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,150
Somebody else has paid for the gathering of it and the analysis of it.

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,700
And we may be able to access it for free.

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,910
We may pay for it.

25
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,960
And the fact that it already exists tends

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,740
to make it quicker for us to get to.

27
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,744
But it also is less likely to be customized.

28
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:42,160
Let's look on the other dimension.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,076
What we're going to look at is, is we're going

30
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:51,720
to look at qualitative and quantitative.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,180
And I know they sound very similar.

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,460
But let's just go back to these one at the time.

33
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,050
What do we mean when we're talking about qualitative research?

34
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:07,730
We're talking about things which have, typically, low numbers of responses

35
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,250
or data points.

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,000
And we are dealing with things like opinions, observations.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,410
And so what we're looking for here, then,

38
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,090
is we're looking for things which give us insights, which

39
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,040
are fitting the following criteria.

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,210
They're authentic.

41
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,450
They're rooted in the data.

42
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,650
They're non-obvious.

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,889
They're things that we wouldn't otherwise have known.

44
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:35,805
And they're revealing.

45
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:39,040


46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,670
So when might we do something that involved primary qualitative research?

47
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,750
We might do primary qualitative research when

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:55,740
we are working in fields of innovation-- new products, new services, disruption,

49
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,640
and change.

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,930
So what we're doing there, as I say, is getting insights.

51
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:09,350
Let's move forward on to the quantitative research.

52
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,570
On the quantitative research, what we're looking

53
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,870
for is more solid proof or evidence.

54
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,350
And so remember from our previous section,

55
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,480
we don't have certainty about the future.

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,070
But here, we're looking for more confirmation, more certainty

57
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,090
that things will be as we want them to be.

58
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,870
So we are going to have data.

59
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,850
We're going to have confidence intervals.

60
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,520
So these are the sorts of things where we will do surveys.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,200
We'll be able to do some sort of statistical analysis.

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,770
et cetera.

63
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,590
So very often, if you're running an innovation project,

64
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,790
you may well want to start with primary qualitative,

65
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,726
and then move on to primary quantitative.

66
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:51,850
You're looking for insight.

67
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,460
And then, you're looking for some reduction in risk

68
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,170
that it is, indeed, a good thing to do.

69
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,010
Let's move to the right-hand side of this matrix.

70
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,410
Secondary research.

71
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,010
Somebody else has already done it.

72
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,040
Why would you reinvent the wheel if somebody else has already

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,210
gathered the data you want?

74
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,270
So what you're doing here, again, you need

75
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,470
to look back through the lens, the framework I gave you a little earlier.

76
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,079
Is would going from secondary to primary research increase

77
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,330
the quality of the decision you're going to make?

78
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,840
Would it increase the speed?

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,390
Or would it reduce the cost?

80
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,424
Primary tends to be more expensive, even if you're paying for the secondary.

81
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:32,090
Likely, you'll pay more for the primary.

82
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,370
It'll be slower, because you're starting from scratch.

83
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,470
So these are choices.

84
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,060
In practice, you're likely going to pick from across the menu on any one

85
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,980
project, and use a bit of secondary and a bit of primary.

86
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,230
You'll use quantitative and qualitative.

87
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,650
So on the secondary side over here, what we're going to be doing is

88
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,950
we're going to be going to say is it good enough for our needs?

89
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,010
Or is it too general?

90
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,320


91
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,840
And on the quantitative side, you're likely

92
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
going to use this multiple times, because what you're

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,100
going to be doing is, is you're going to be accessing a lot of data that

94
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,330
will show you trends, patterns, everything from census data

95
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,530
through to market share through to financial ratios

96
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,540
between different companies that are traded, et cetera.

97
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,730
So you'll typically use a lot of this.

98
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:28,320
You'll use some of this.

99
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,450
And then, on the primary side, it will depend

100
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,030
whether you are dealing with information that you

101
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,450
need which doesn't currently exist.

102
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,287
Lots of choices.

103
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,120
The main thing is, is you know what the menu

104
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,490
is that you can choose from so that you make better choices.

105
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,950
Good luck.

106
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:49,030
So we've helped to organize thinking about how to approach market research,

107
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,870
and how to frame the types of research you might do.

108
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,360
Let's now circle back and see how this ties with the story

109
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,210
that Darren told you about Agent Provocateur.

110
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,540
He undertook some research for them.

111
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,900
What were they doing?

112
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,230
They were really commissioning him to do primary research.

113
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,700
And what were they doing?

114
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,460
They were doing intercept interviews.

115
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,380
And so they were-- initially, anyway-- they were qualitative in nature.

116
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,510
But the volume of them built up so that they, then,

117
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,340
had a quantified version of same.

118
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,020
So primary qual and primary quant.

119
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,510
Yes, I'm abbreviating.

120
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,830
That's what you'll find some of your colleagues

121
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,690
who are full-time marketers do.

122
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,460
Don't be put off by abbreviations, just like we've covered a lot of acronyms.

123
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,170
So what was also happening at the same time

124
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,310
as Agent Provocateur, or a similar frame, a couple of years earlier?

125
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,420
Victoria's Secret, one of their competitors that Darren also mentioned,

126
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,420
they were also doing some market research of their own.

127
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,650
And it was primary in nature.

128
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,340
It relates to when they ran their first streaming back in 1999,

129
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,190
their first live streaming of their annual lingerie show.

130
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,590
And famously, it crashed servers through North America on a weekday

131
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,270
in the middle of the day.

132
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,490
People were trying to download on limited download speeds

133
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,010
at their workplace, presumably when they were meant to be doing something else.

134
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,060
Who'd have thought?

135
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,660
And they crashed servers.

136
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,580
So how was this market research?

137
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,980
It wasn't a formal study that was commissioned by Victoria's Secret.

138
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,400
But it was data that was generated.

139
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,090
The data allow them to do some analysis, and get an actionable insight.

140
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,810
The actionable insight was that there was a demand, an appetite for,

141
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,020
this sort of live content, which previously would not

142
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,270
have been available to people.

143
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,170
And so how does this play out in our understanding of marketing?

144
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,690
Think about one of our earlier modules, where Darren talked about real-time

145
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,730
marketing-- the Oreo case-- and look forward

146
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:04,310
to a later module, where we talk about marketing communication decisions,

147
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,260
where you choose to spend your money, and in the context

148
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,490
of social media and online channels.

149
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,590
So you've got choices about how you do things.

150
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,520
Some of the research is going to be formal.

151
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,230
Some of it is going to be information that becomes available to you,

152
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:25,570
and that you are able to then analyze to achieve your marketing objective.

153
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:34,020
