00:00:05,615 --> 00:00:07,490
PAUL: So one of the things that can be really

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,610
helpful to try to understand what's going

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,410
on here-- when you hear about these news stories

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,390
and then you also hear me saying that fundamental principles can help you--

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,070
is to try to understand the difference between some of the constants

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,240
in marketing that are largely unchanging, and then some of the things

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,397
which actually appear to be changing.

8
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:34,230
So what are some of the constants that we're

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,440
going to be covering off as we go through this series of modules?

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,710
Well, we're still going to be dealing with customers.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,050
And we're still going to be dealing with competitors.

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,010
You'll find that we have to understand our external environment

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,890
and we also have to understand our internal environment

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,370
within our organizational capabilities.

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,580
You'll find that we'll deal with segmentation,

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,840
targeting and positioning of the brand.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,930
And then we'll deal with the marketing mix, the controllable elements

18
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,860
that we are able to work with as we design and then implement

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,440
particular tactics.

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,110
So that leads me to what is changing.

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,026
What are some of the things that are changing?

22
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:21,410
The specifics of the tactics are changing.

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,330
Clearly, a number of years ago, one wouldn't

24
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:30,130
have used Twitter to run a real-time conversation with one's consumers.

25
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,420
So there's lots and lots of different tactics

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,080
that we'll talk to that are interesting.

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,790
But to understand them, we want to be able to drill down maybe and inform

28
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,500
them through some of the constants.

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,160
And then some of the other things which are changing, really we'll

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:54,030
find that there is a change in the power between the customer and the company.

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,360
What do I mean by a change in the power?

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,440
Well, customer power is going up.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,120
Why?

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:06,550
Because the information that is available to the customer is faster,

35
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,560
is more transparent.

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,479
It is lower cost.

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,660
And it comes from more sources with greater variety of view and opinion

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,850
and, arguably, objectivity and authenticity.

39
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,170
And so if you can think about some of these as fundamental changes and some

40
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,706
of these as fundamental constants, then it

41
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:31,230
sets you up well for what we're going to do in the rest of this program.

42
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:38,476
