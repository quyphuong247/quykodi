1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,370
DARREN: So the second week, pretty interesting week.

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,380
We talked a lot about some of the fundamental basics

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,379
in marketing-- market research and segmentation.

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,144
And I wanted to start our little debrief talking a bit about segmentation.

5
00:00:21,144 --> 00:00:23,060
Because one thing I've often been asked, Paul,

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,700
is how often should a company or an organization think about segmentation

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,450
or build a system or question their segmentation structure?

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,920
Is that something that happens once a month, once every five years?

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,420
When you give advice to organizations, what

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,250
do you tell them to do when it comes to segmentation?

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,570
PAUL: The short answer to that is it depends.

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,560
Now, of course--

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,009
DARREN: You sound like a marketer.

14
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,300
PAUL: Of course, that's not a very satisfactory answer,

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,710
but let us explore what it depends upon.

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,950
So it depends on a few things.

17
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,670
If you're in a very static industry and you've got customers today

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,060
who are very similar to the ones you had yesterday,

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,020
then you may not need to redo your segmentation very often.

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,110
However, if you're in a very fast changing industry-- cell

21
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,340
phones, video games, and so on-- you may find

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,960
that you want to actually review segmentation more frequently.

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,510
Not monthly, but you certainly might be doing it on an annual type of basis.

24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:32,200
And my experience is that most organizations I talk to they

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,860
make a couple of fundamental mistakes with segmentation.

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,660
First of all, they're too broad in what they do.

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,440
So they haven't gone into enough of the different levels

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,850
and criteria sets that we've talked about when we went through the tools.

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,490
And secondly, they don't review it often enough.

30
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,020
They stay too broad and too static over time,

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,440
and the market has changed around them and then they're playing catch up

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,290
or they're in reactionary mode.

33
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,250
DARREN: That makes a lot of sense.

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,710
Absolutely.

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,910
PAUL: I wanted to play one back to you.

36
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,650
In last week's wrap up, we talked about some

37
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,699
of the similarities and differences between a business

38
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,950
to consumer versus a business to business or industrial setting,

39
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,342
and I wanted to play that out here with regard to segmentation.

40
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:20,920
As we've said a few times, we have tended

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,170
to use quite a lot of consumer facing examples

42
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,430
because they're a lot more accessible for people to be

43
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,700
able to understand and relate to.

44
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,680
But many of the people taking this course,

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,330
they'll be in industrial, business to business settings.

46
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,440
So how do you see segmentation playing out there?

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,560
I mean, there's broad relevance, but can you give us maybe a mini story?

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,572
A mini one that kind of brings this to life?

49
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:45,530
DARREN: Not 10 minutes?

50
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,446
PAUL: Just a mini one.

51
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:47,950
DARREN: Just a mini.

52
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,030
Well, it's a great question and obviously one

53
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,520
that we often do here is how do you think

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,690
about segmentation in a B2B context?

55
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,400
And I know when you were presenting your thoughts on this,

56
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,220
you did talk about one of the bases for segmentation in business

57
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,370
is to think of demographics for business or what I call firmographics.

58
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,920
So how big is the company?

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,800
How many employees?

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,880
What are their revenues?

61
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,280
How many product lines?

62
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,040
And you can use that as part of your segmentation base.

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,310
I would bring up a story that adds another element and that's

64
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,950
a story about a company called Lafarge.

65
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,970
And lafarge is an organization that makes

66
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,480
concrete-- one of the world's leaders, actually,

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,900
in the manufacturing of concrete.

68
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,320
And a really brilliant story talks about how they brought marketing

69
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,720
into the discipline.

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,810
Because for years, Lafarge as some would argue a commodity-type industry

71
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,110
didn't have a VP of marketing.

72
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,440
And about 15 or so years ago, they hired a VP

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,870
of marketing-- an ex-McKinsey fellow.

74
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,460
And when he came into the organization, he

75
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,480
did what most new units would want to do right away

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,380
is show the value of marketing in the organization.

77
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,010
And he looked at the segmentation system that Lafarge had.

78
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,680
And what's interesting is it was very ad hoc in nature.

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,170
And so basically, with each customer, they'd

80
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,510
make a deal according to whoever was in the room

81
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,720
and whatever made sense on that occasion.

82
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,850
And so he was able very quickly to build a segmentation system

83
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,980
that focused both on firmographics and what some people would

84
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,581
call behavioral segmentation.

85
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:24,330
And what I mean by behavioral segmentation

86
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,160
is he looked at the buying behavior of the customers.

87
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,480
In other words, what kind of quantity size did they buy in?

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,150
How often did they buy?

89
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,400
What was their purchasing cycle?

90
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,880
How did they actually go about making an order?

91
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,560
And looking at all of that behavioral information,

92
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,290
he was able to cross the two types of segmentation systems using

93
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,900
both the firmographics-- for example, the size of the organization that

94
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,610
was buying as well as how they were actually

95
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,550
buy-- and create a structure for the organization.

96
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,600
So they could do a good job in terms of pricing and delivery.

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,290
The really great punchline in this story is that after six years,

98
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,110
he was able to point to the fact that it had made the organization

99
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,830
100s of millions of dollars just by a very simple switch to a segmentation

100
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,309
structure that made sense.

101
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:16,100
PAUL: Well, thanks.

102
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,630
I really like that story because it really

103
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,120
plays back to the layering over of different segmentation criteria

104
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,030
that we talked about.

105
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,270
And I'm also pretty impressed that in this week

106
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,940
you've managed to kind of segue from lingerie to fancy cars

107
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,240
through to concrete.

108
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,770
And proves the old adage that a good marketer can work with any category.

109
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,330
So thanks for sharing that one.

110
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,260
DARREN: Absolutely.

111
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,730
I have one last one for today.

112
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,460
And we've talked maybe too much about segmentation in our final little bit

113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,270
here, but I wanted to ask you how does marketing research-- our first topic--

114
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,340
and segmentation actually relate?

115
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,150
Are those completely independent constructs?

116
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,370
Is there something that we can learn when we think about both of them

117
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,930
together?

118
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,280
PAUL: That's a good way for me to start to help everybody see how

119
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,750
we're going about this whole course.

120
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,580
We've been unpacking the marketing discipline into these various topics

121
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,350
so that people can understand the foundational principles.

122
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,400
And then to use them well, we're going to combine them again.

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,730
And segmentation and marketing research are good examples

124
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,690
of where we can start to put two of these individual building blocks

125
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,510
together and get some synergistic effects.

126
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,810
And so when we look at it carefully, segmentation

127
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:45,540
is about being able to separate out from a large group of information and data

128
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,630
and to be able to identify some commonalities, measure it.

129
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,790
And so in that sense, we're using market research

130
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,230
both for gathering the information, and then after the analysis,

131
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,440
we're using it as a form of measurement and reporting.

132
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,730
So they've got a lot in common, and it's a good way

133
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,070
to start to see these things coming back together.

134
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,370
As we go forward through the rest of the program,

135
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,180
you'll start to see how you can take different combinations of two or three

136
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,490
of the building blocks and combine them for greater effect.

137
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,770
DARREN: Excellent.

138
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,280
Well, looking forward to next week.

139
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,830
PAUL: Me too.

140
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:30,165
