PAUL CUBBON: Brands as people-- brands as the basis for intense conversations.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,650
What does a better brand look like?

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:21,310
How do you design a brand that will have really positive, extreme dimensions?

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:28,260
One of the frameworks I like is the construct of Lovemarks,

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,230
created and popularized by Kevin Roberts.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,830
And this is what he had to say-- he basically said,

7
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,240
we take this two-dimensional axis.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:45,160
We're going to label this axis as respect and this axis over here

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,830
as love.

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,170
And what he argued was that, down here, we have products.

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,740
Products, commodities that do not have either high respect nor do they

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,940
have high love.

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,740
And so these commodities tend to trade on price.

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,360
They tend to be everybody's second or third choice at best.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,590
And so, up here, as we get to higher respect, we get brands.

16
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,730
And we've talked a lot about how we differentiate and build out our brands.

17
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,570
But what if we have lots of brands that are similar in here?

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,920
How do we actually differentiate out?

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,020
Well, the argument is that if we have both high respect

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:33,220
and high love, high affiliation, then we are going to have a Lovemark.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,320
And a Lovemark is really a top-notch brand.

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,990
So what this can be also seen as is moving

23
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,260
from being known for something to be known

24
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,000
for something that people care about.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,300
And this is the affiliation and the emotion that

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,850
layers over the rational performance.

27
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,240
And so we may try to be superior, both on a functional side,

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,360
but then also on an emotional side as well.

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,380
