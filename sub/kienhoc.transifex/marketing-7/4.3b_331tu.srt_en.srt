PAUL CUBBON: Now that we've established that customers are having conversations

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,850
about brands, it can be helpful to see how this might break down

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,510
in two overlapping circles laid out so.

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,040
There's the intended or internal view of the brand.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:34,350
This is the brand identity as designed by the company.

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:42,810
And then there's the external or perceived, the perception,

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,370
of the brand on the outside.

8
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:52,010
And this is where we get into the brand image, the reputation.

9
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,040
And this fuels the word of mouth that we talked about earlier.

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,070
Now, when the gap here has a strong overlap,

11
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:06,170
it suggests that the company has a good understanding about how

12
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,490
to design a brand in a way which is credible as a whole experience

13
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,040
for the customer.

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,710
And you might actually see something where there

15
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,740
was almost a large overlap like that.

16
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,170
You can then imagine where there's a disconnect here,

17
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,610
where what the customer perceives, the external view, the external image,

18
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,460
is very different from what the company intended.

19
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,860
So what we are really doing here is underscoring the fact

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,210
that perception of brand based on the experience

21
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,990
and based on the conversation that's been had about it

22
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,790
is key to the management of that brand.

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:54,090
One of the interesting pieces of work in this area that really has informed

24
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:01,170
a lot of the discussions around branding is a piece of work by Ries and Trout.

25
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,680
And it is called Positioning, The Battle for Your Mind.

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:17,450
Now, the whole concept of positioning we covered a couple of sections ago.

27
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,540
And I had said, as we went through it, that actually positioning played

28
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,900
through to product, played through here to the brand,

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,620
and to the marketing communication.

30
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,590
And this is just really underscoring it.

31
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,790
But this really recognizes the perceptual nature

32
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,910
of what we're dealing with with brands and the importance of understanding

33
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,710
how the stimulus that we provide in our brand design

34
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,030
here is perceived on the outside.
