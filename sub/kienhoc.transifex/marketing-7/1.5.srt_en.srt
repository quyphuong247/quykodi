00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:07,720
PAUL CUBBON: So welcome to this module, where

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,740
we're going to talk to you about the dynamic marketing environment.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,740
We're going to cover some interesting and useful practical tools.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,000
We're going to talk about competition, customer, and the company.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,970
We're going to talk about how to use a SWOT framework effectively

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,630
and something interesting called the PEST analysis.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,690
Are you ready for this?

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,240
DARREN DAHL: I think so.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,010
That sounded really complicated to me.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,670
So if it's OK, I think as I like to do, what

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,700
I'd like to do is just kind of push Paul off the stage a little bit

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,020
and tell a story, hopefully, that can set things up for us

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,030
so that when Paul gets to the tools, we can think about what they mean

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,150
and maybe a broader context.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,680
And the story today that I wanted to share with you is about chocolate.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,259
And chocolate is a product that most of us know and most of us love.

18
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,550
I mean, there's some haters out there that don't really

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,930
love the smooth goodness of chocolate and what it provides.

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,860
But I think it's a great case study to talk about when it comes to the tools

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,580
on understanding the environment.

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,157
And I'd like to set up the story right here in America

23
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:17,990
because when we think about chocolate, often

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,781
we think about a bunch of different brands.

25
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:23,240
And if I asked you, what are the big chocolate brands in America,

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,660
you might say, Nestle, or maybe you'll say Cadbury.

27
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,920
And yet frankly, you'd be wrong because in America,

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,980
there's really been two companies over the last 100 years

29
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,400
that have really been dominant.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,970
And those two companies are Hershey and Mars.

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,720
And after I say them, I'm sure you recognize those brands because they

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,000
have very, very strong products in the marketplace that most of us have tried.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,920
But what's interesting about these brands,

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,650
right, is that they have a huge history.

35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,560
In fact, for over 100 years, these companies

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,370
have gone back and forth at each other trying to get market dominance,

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,170
or if you will, to get the highest or the biggest market share

38
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,410
in terms of the products that they sell.

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,639
The story that I want to draw on draws from a book

40
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,060
called The Emperors of Chocolate.

41
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,935
And why it's called The Emperors of Chocolate

42
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:16,270
is it traces the history of these companies through their two leaders.

43
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,360
And these were really interesting guys, right.

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,441
One of them was a fellow named Hershey-- big surprise.

45
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,190
In fact, his full name was Milton Hershey.

46
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,060
And then one was named Mars, and his full name was Forrest Mars.

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,640
And they were actually very different individuals, right.

48
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,840
Milton Hershey-- some could compare him to a Willy Wonka, if you will,

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,970
of chocolate.

50
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,960
He built a whole town around his chocolate factory.

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,000
And we know that as Hershey, Pennsylvania.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,310
And he planned the town.

53
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,060
He built libraries and parks.

54
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,370
He actually even built an orphanage.

55
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,070
And he tried to create a little utopia based around chocolate.

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,560
And today, you can even visit Hershey, Pennsylvania,

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,310
and take a tour of this company.

58
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,360
Now what's cool about Milton is he, in many ways,

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,460
was like a Willy Wonka of chocolate.

60
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,560
And he built a great company that really became powerful through its products.

61
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,760
Now Forrest-- also an amazing leader but kind of different, all right?

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,910
And Forrest actually started working for his father and then had a falling out

63
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,830
and decided to go work for Hershey, went to Hershey, learned a little bit,

64
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,050
then decided to come back to Mars and eventually succeeded his father.

65
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,700
Now he has always run this company.

66
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,220
And now he's passed on.

67
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,940
But he ran for decades with a very strict, very rule-based type

68
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,330
of structure.

69
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,640
He was a very private person.

70
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,550
And in fact, there's very few pictures of him in existence today.

71
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,880
And he ran his ship, if you will, with real tight authority.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,970
And what happened is these two leaders banged and butted heads over the years.

73
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,900
Through the '20s, to the '30s, to the '40s, to the '50s,

74
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,410
these companies went back and forth, right, led by these two individuals.

75
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,110
Now at the start, Hershey had dominant market share, right.

76
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,990
They were number one, and it was really based on one product.

77
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,080
And this product was known as the Hershey bar.

78
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,996
And if I asked you what the Hershey bar is, most of you would be like,

79
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:06,120
oh, it's just a big chunk of chocolate.

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,600
And that was successful.

81
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,617
And it's been successful for decades.

82
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,450
But what's interesting about the Hershey bar

83
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,769
is it started out with one price point-- $0.05.

84
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,370
And the company had a business model that kept the chocolate bar at $0.05

85
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,524
year after year after year after year.

86
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:25,940
And when you think about it, and you think about products,

87
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,575
if you're keeping the price constant, or static, what has to change?

88
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:33,075
Well, you could change how much you spend on your marketing.

89
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:36,920
Or you could change how many people work for the company, sure.

90
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,824
But if you're keeping the price the same over time,

91
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:42,240
you also have to think of what's called cost of goods sold

92
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
and how much that product is costing to make.

93
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,130
And so what happened is according to the price of cocoa

94
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,600
futures, the big ingredient in chocolate,

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,390
the product would actually have to change according to how much of it

96
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,190
they could put in the bar.

97
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,540
And so with the price staying constant, the bar

98
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,340
would move up or down based on the price of cocoa futures.

99
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,790
Now obviously from day to day or month to month or even year to year,

100
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,760
the size of the bar didn't move very much.

101
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,730
But decade after decade, the bar got a bit smaller.

102
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,024
And as the decades went by, right, this created a real opportunity for Mars

103
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:24,190
because when you think about Mars and you think about their products, right,

104
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,320
you think of Mars bar.

105
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,190
You think of Snickers.

106
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,760
These are products that aren't just made of chocolate, right?

107
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,450
And if I asked you to list the ingredients,

108
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,366
you'd probably say, well, Darren, there's peanuts, and there's nougat,

109
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,170
and there's caramel, and there's sugar.

110
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,780
And that's exactly, right, what these products are based on

111
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,550
is a whole bunch of good stuff with a very thin layer of chocolate

112
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,730
around the outside.

113
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,790
Now the most expensive ingredient in a chocolate bar is the chocolate.

114
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,360
And so Mars saw this huge opportunity as we moved into the '50s to market

115
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,540
their bars-- a bigger bar than the smaller Hershey bar--

116
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,670
and price it at much higher level, $0.10.

117
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,400
And what happened is that the consumer became really excited

118
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,370
about these new bigger bars.

119
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,270
And the market share changed.

120
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,690
So instead of Hershey dominating the marketplace, now Mars did.

121
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,980
And if you're Hershey, what do you do, right?

122
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,730
All of a sudden, you were number one.

123
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,750
You were winning the race.

124
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,490
But now Mars has overtaken you, right?

125
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,170
And so what you have to do is either innovate, perhaps, or change

126
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,340
your business model.

127
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,800
Now of course, that's what Hershey's did.

128
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,590
They innovated.

129
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,756
They bought other companies.

130
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:37,350
They brought new products like Hershey's kisses to market, right?

131
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,250
But they also had the Hershey $0.05 bar.

132
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,820
And so it seemed to make the most sense to actually make a bigger bar

133
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,517
to compete head to head with these big Mars bars and price the Hershey bar

134
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:50,150
at $0.10.

135
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,070
Now what do you think the consumer did here, right?

136
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,472
Were they excited?

137
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:56,680
Some of you'd say, of course.

138
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,888
Like now we get a bigger bar.

139
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:59,100
It's awesome.

140
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,090
But no, the market share actually fell even more because consumers were upset.

141
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,140
You took away our $0.05 bar.

142
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,430
That's part of American history.

143
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,420
It's like baseball and Cracker Jacks and apple pie and Coke.

144
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,550
We don't want New Coke.

145
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,170
We don't want this new Hershey bar, right?

146
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,210
And they bought less.

147
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,915
And the market stayed that way, with Mars being the dominant company

148
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:28,290
in America for a number of years.

149
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,530
And it wasn't until the late '70s into the early '80s when

150
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,230
a producer was making a new film that launched in the early '80s, right,

151
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,152
they wanted to use a candy in the film.

152
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:40,610
And they went to the market leader.

153
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,210
They went to Mars, and they said, hey, we're making this new film.

154
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,580
It has an alien in it, right.

155
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,850
And his finger lights up.

156
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,840
And he kind of walks funny, right.

157
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,990
And we're hoping that we could use your M&Ms in the movie because we want

158
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,780
the little alien to love candy.

159
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,360
And of course, Mars said, yes, right?

160
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,130
No.

161
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,977
Mars was like, no, we don't want that in our movie because it's with aliens.

162
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:05,310
And consumers don't like aliens.

163
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,310
That's a terrible idea, this product placement.

164
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,980
It's crazy, right?

165
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,020
And so what the company then decided to do was to back away.

166
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,320
And so the producers of this film said, well, let's go to the second company,

167
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,020
which is Hershey's.

168
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,936
And they said, we would love to put one of your products in our movie.

169
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:23,000
Do you have a product, right?

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,620
And what's interesting is the Hershey Company

171
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,570
had acquired a company called Reese's in the early '60s.

172
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,860
And they had the peanut butter cups, right.

173
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,490
And they said, well, I think we have a new product that we're launching

174
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,600
that we'd love to put in the movie.

175
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,659
And this product is Reese's Pieces.

176
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,270
And what's exciting for Hershey's was that

177
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,670
by putting this product in the movie ET, they

178
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,360
had the most successful product launch for that brand in history, right.

179
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,940
And what it did was it changed the dynamic nature of the competition.

180
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,760
And now again, right, Hershey's was able to succeed

181
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,510
at being the leader in market share here in North America.

182
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,770
Now that's a fun story, specifically if you like chocolate, right?

183
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,930
And it tells us a lot of different things.

184
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,170
But to me, what's interesting about it-- besides we

185
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,780
can learn about leadership and HR and product development--

186
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,780
but about what we're talking today, this story says a lot, right?

187
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,640
It says that the marketplace is dynamic.

188
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,680
It's always changing.

189
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,380
Your competitors are going to do new things.

190
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,850
Consumers are going to want new things.

191
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,220
Consumers are going to want old things.

192
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,260
Your company is going to change.

193
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,760
So how do you manage when there's so much going on in the world around you

194
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,902
that can influence your organization?

195
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:47,360
Now I'm going to pass back to Paul.

196
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,151
I'm going to pass on the baton because he's

197
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:51,000
going to share a couple of tools with you

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,410
today that you can really leverage so that just like this story, right,

199
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,710
you can learn to manage a company-- hopefully-- become a better marketer,

200
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,930
and be successful.

201
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,880
Paul, over to you.

202
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,630
