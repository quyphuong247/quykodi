1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,390
DARREN DAHL: So Paul, in this last week, you talked-- you baited me, actually.

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,160
Because you said at the very end of the session on distribution

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,480
that there's this notion or this thing called channel conflict.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,230
And you kind of indicated that would be a discussion

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,570
or a topic for another time.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,410
Well, I wanted you to tell us a little bit about it.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,900
Because I think it might be interesting to everybody.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,000
So there you go.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,259
I don't want a half an hour.

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,300
But if you could give me just a minute or two on,

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,440
what is this channel conflict?

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,604
PAUL CUBBON: I'm glad you were watching and paying attention.

13
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:40,770
And I'm glad you got baited.

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,180
And hopefully a few other people are waiting to hear a bit about this

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,680
as well.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,660
And it's pretty straightforward.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,100
I'll give two short examples.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,280
The first one is a company that's been selling through an intermediary--

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,630
let's just say a retailer-- for some time.

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,970
And they've been selling something that the consumer spends $10 on.

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,700
And the retailer takes $5.

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,980
As a company, I get $5.

23
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,720
And then I decide I can now sell it online.

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,460
And I think I'm going to go directly.

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,600
And I can now afford to sell it more cheaply

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,170
and still make the same money, or even a bit more money.

27
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,860
And so I put it up online.

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,810
And so the consumer is happy.

29
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,420
They've got choices about channels.

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,490
But the channel conflict becomes my original retail partner,

31
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,760
they turn around to me and they say, hey, you're undermining me.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,750
I'm going to stop selling you unless you actually

33
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,970
make these channels kind of fairer, so that you don't kind of take business

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,550
away from me.

35
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,840
And people might say, well, why does that matter if I can sell online now?

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,190
Because actually, we're likely still very reliant

37
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,540
on the original retailer or collection of retailers for a lot of our business.

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,230
And this actually happened in the first wave of e-commerce with Levi Jeans.

39
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,970
They actually backed off selling their jeans online

40
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,830
because retailers said, hey, we do your business for you.

41
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,000
And you see a number of approaches that are taken then

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,390
to kind of disguise this.

43
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,669
And disguise or lack of transparency and comparability

44
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:15,720
is a key way for companies to run multiple channels with good value

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,320
offerings.

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,820
They reduce the ability to make direct comparisons.

47
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,250
So a really simple way of doing this might be a company making soap,

48
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,230
they might offer Safeway a single bar if soap at a certain price.

49
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,200
But when you go to Costco, people expect things to be cheaper there.

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,680
But they can't buy a single bar.

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,320
They're bundled as a pack of six.

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,129
So it kind of makes the comparison less obvious.

53
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:41,920
And it reduces the conflict in the channel.

54
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,580
Safeway are relatively happy.

55
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,800
Costco is relatively happy.

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,640
If you were selling a single bar just cheaper through Costco,

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,190
then Safeway would start to kind of throw their hands up and complain.

58
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,540
And so this is channel conflict.

59
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,630
And you're trying to get every channel to play on your side,

60
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,460
so that you can increase access to market.

61
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,620
But at the same time, you don't want them getting upset so that one of them

62
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,295
refuses to play with you.

63
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:08,920
Does that help?

64
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,510
DARREN DAHL: It makes a lot of sense, actually.

65
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:10,900
PAUL CUBBON: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

66
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
So it's pretty exciting.

67
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,020
It's almost like a dynamic game of chess.

68
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:21,250
So I want to switch gear and ask you a different sort of question.

69
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,787
I want to get into the marketing communication theme

70
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,120
that we were covering this week.

71
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,330
And we talked about the different media types that we used.

72
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,210
But what we didn't do really is to get into anything

73
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,140
around the different styles of advertising that are used

74
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,500
and different stages of awareness or interest

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,080
or getting right through to decision making, and so on, and action.

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,590
You know, you sometimes see different approaches taken.

77
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,580
And so why would use certain approaches in certain different contexts?

78
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,080
DARREN DAHL: Well, to be honest, that's what

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,430
will make the ad truly effectiveness, is if you marry the context

80
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,250
or what you're selling or how you're trying

81
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,530
to sell to the type of advertising or promotion

82
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,540
that you're trying to invoke-- and often we

83
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,190
think of, if I could use the simple rubric of advertising

84
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,600
a promotion that's based in information or based in some type of emotion,

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,970
like a fear appeal, or based in some type of sexual or humorous content--

86
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,990
and I think as an organization or company,

87
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,100
you want to be sure that whatever type of appeal or tactic you're using,

88
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,450
whether it's a humor appeal, or an informational appeal,

89
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,140
that you are very cognizant or aware that it

90
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,680
needs to match the product that you're selling.

91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,180
So what I mean by this is if you're selling, let's say, automobile parts,

92
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,130
does it make sense to use sex in advertising or sexual appeal

93
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,780
to try to sell tires, for example?

94
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,570
Probably not.

95
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,710
In fact, in most cases, you might actually upset some of the consumers

96
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,300
that you're trying to sell to.

97
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,180
Same with a humor appeal.

98
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,160
You know, that might work in a fast food context.

99
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,940
But it probably wouldn't work potentially

100
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,590
if you're trying to do some social advertising or social marketing

101
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,180
against breast cancer.

102
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,180
And so when you think about advertising, promotion, IMC in general,

103
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,660
it's very important to think about, what is the appeal based in?

104
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,880
And how does that actually marry to what we're

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,600
trying to communicate to the audience?

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,730
And sometimes when you see ads that upset people,

107
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,190
that have to be pulled off the air, for example,

108
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,810
it's largely because they've made a mismatch in terms

109
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,780
of the type of the appeal and what they're actually trying

110
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,357
to sell or communicate to the consumer.

111
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:43,440
PAUL CUBBON: If I can, I've just got a bit of a follow-up for you on this.

112
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,470
Because I think that at the logical level,

113
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,590
people might expect to just see more straightforward information

114
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,140
or communication.

115
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,010
But that's often not the case.

116
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,770
We often see things dressed up in a different sort of style.

117
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,550
So why don't we see more straightforward informational communication?

118
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,610
DARREN DAHL: To be honest, it just gets lost in the clutter, right?

119
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,410
And what I mean by that is if all ads were just strictly informational --

120
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,930
if you look historically, that was often the case

121
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,220
in the '40s, '50s, '60s, the dawn of advertising.

122
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,665
It was really trying to convince consumers through information

123
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:23,100
that this product was the best to buy.

124
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,500
But we know that consumers make decisions not just

125
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,400
on an informational play, but often because something resonates

126
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,570
to them because of an emotion they feel or because of a need based

127
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,380
in something beyond just information.

128
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,090
PAUL CUBBON: So does that give us some insight into why

129
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,900
we're seeing more and more stunt type advertising and installation

130
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,550
advertising?

131
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,950
I mean, you and I, we often chatter about some of these things.

132
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,234
They're kind of topics of conversation.

133
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,900
So what would you make of some of the things that are happening?

134
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,890
DARREN DAHL: Well, I think that goes right to the point, actually.

135
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,270
And it's kind of the evolution of some of these communication campaigns

136
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,580
that we as consumers get exposed to thousands-- some people estimate up

137
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,836
to 6,000 types of brand or marketing-type messaging every day.

138
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:13,210
And so what's going to stick out?

139
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,960
What's going to break through the clutter?

140
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,845
What's going to be new and unique that makes you stop and pause?

141
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,970
It's not going to be that informational ad anymore.

142
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,920
It's going to have to be something that you maybe haven't seen before?

143
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,520
So if you're Greenpeace and you have a provocative message,

144
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,870
you're going to catch people's attention if you hang something, a big sign

145
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,905
perhaps, from a building.

146
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:37,640
PAUL CUBBON: So an event or a stunt-- you

147
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,090
know, I think one of the more famous ones that

148
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,270
captured a lot of people's attention in recent years

149
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,680
was Felix's Red Bull dive from outer space.

150
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,330
And it captivated people both in real time

151
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,760
and then was reused a lot afterwards.

152
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,680
So we should expect to see more of these types of things

153
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,750
that brands are using to communicate.

154
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,750
DARREN DAHL: Absolutely.

155
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,040
I think what we're going to see is more creative approaches to communication,

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,600
leveraging things like social media and things

157
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,974
that we see every day in the environment around us.

158
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:12,640
PAUL CUBBON: Well, that's a super segue.

159
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,630
Because obviously, social media is a part of marketing communication.

160
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,850
And because it's a big topic, we're finishing off this session

161
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,020
on marketing communication generally and looking forward

162
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,120
to seeing you as we go into the next part of the program,

163
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,052
when we're focusing on social media by itself.

164
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,010
DARREN DAHL: All right.

165
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,009
We'll see you next week.

166
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,340
PAUL CUBBON: Great, thanks.

167
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:40,554
