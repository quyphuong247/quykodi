PAUL CUBBON: I want to take us a little further into this concept of brand

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,580
identity.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,170
The famous and most useful model in this respect

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,810
is David Aaker's brand identity model, and it has many facets to it, which

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,550
I recommend to you to follow up on.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,250
However, we're going to stay at the key components of it today.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,590
Aaker deals with four major levels.

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,020
The first two levels are the brand as product

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,780
and the brand as an organization.

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:50,930
And these really inform the elements of a value proposition.

12
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,230
At a product level, you can think about the augmented product

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,730
aspects we covered earlier.

14
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,410
And at an organizational level, this might be the parent company.

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,880
It may be the trust or confidence that comes

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,470
from knowing that there is somebody behind the particular product

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,380
that you are actually buying.

18
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,300
These are our baseline elements of our brand identity system,

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,840
but I want to get down to the other elements here for this section.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,150
The brand as person.

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,080


22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,160
What do we mean when we're talking about the brand as person,

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,820
or the persona of a brand, the brand archetype?

24
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,660
Well, I actually want you to think-- and this

25
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,140
is where we start to have a bit of fun, my stick person drawing--

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:49,960
but what if a car-- yeah, I know-- what if a car was a person?

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,770
That might sound strange.

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,370
But your friends and people will say, yes,

29
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,100
that car, they are young and strong.

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,090
They're trustworthy.

31
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,630
They're unreliable.

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,240
They're like this person I know or that person I know, for better or for worse.

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,280
And so this idea of brands as people really informs the identity

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,810
because it can help to bring to life how people see brands

35
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,330
and whether they see them beyond the basic function.

36
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,450
And so they can help us to understand this concept of brand identity--

37
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,450
what people see at the moment, what we would like them to see.

38
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,710
And it comes back to that element that we covered a little earlier, which

39
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,780
is, what's the connection between our intention for our brands

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,190
and how it is currently perceived and how can we shape that over time?

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,850
The fourth element, then, that we want to talk about is the brand as a symbol.

42
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,590
What does it stand for?

43
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,440
What's its credibility?

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,030
And what's its affiliation?

45
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,310
And this is where we tend to get into badging of brands and the fact

46
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,340
that people will wear these brands to associate,

47
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,000
as I say, affiliate with them and say, I am part of this club.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,920
I am part of this clan or this tribe.
