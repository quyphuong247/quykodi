1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,810
DARREN: So Paul, we're into our third week now,

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,700
and some really good stuff this week, definitely

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,514
found your discussion on positioning interesting,

4
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:18,430
though, I have to say there's a lot of jargon.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,192
So these points of parity, points of difference,

6
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:23,650
you know, how that helps in terms of building a positioning

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,176
statement, a little unclear to me.

8
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:28,800
I'd like you to unpack that a bit more, because sometimes I get

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,600
lost in the fancy marketing words that you use.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,260
PAUL: OK.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,810
And I think this one's pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,250
I think it really comes back to an internal view

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,420
as a company sees things or an external view.

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,380
And when we look at all of the different elements that make up

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,500
a product or a service, and often there can be quite a long list, internally

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,180
within a company, it's easy to kind of emphasize

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,050
that this is slightly different from the competitors.

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,530
But the real benefit of having these two buckets, if you will,

19
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,380
elements which are largely parity with competitors

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,610
and the small number of items, maybe one, which is really differentiated

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,826
is: is it relevant to the targeted customer segment that's

22
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:24,950
trying to get the job done?

23
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,802
Because if it is, then it really becomes that arrowhead for your brand

24
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:31,635
positioning statement and when we look at the structure of the brand

25
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:33,385
positioning statement, we're really trying

26
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:37,450
to say how are we differentiated for a particular customer segment?

27
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,860
So I agree the jargon sometimes people can kind of tune out,

28
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,990
but I've got to say a bit like we did in one of our earlier wrap-ups,

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,630
the two by two grids, the short lists, the acronyms,

30
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,800
they're really ways of simplifying things and allowing people

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,520
to actually not get lost and to sort out what matters from what doesn't matter,

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,000
and here we're really trying to find that one item in which the target

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,020
customers care about.

34
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,890
And if we can do that, then our brand positioning statement

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,070
becomes a lot easier.

36
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,570
DARREN: OK.

37
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,870
Fair enough.

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,020
PAUL: So I wanted to switch around and ask you

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,440
a question, because positioning can often seem quite rigid for people.

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,560
And I wanted to ask you what your views were about changing brand positioning,

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,440
because it seems like if you don't change it,

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,320
people criticize you for being rigid.

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,500
If you change it, people talk about you not having consistency.

44
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,380
So is it a happy balance?

45
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,370
Is there some guidance we can give folks?

46
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,070
DARREN: Sure, I think one thing that's a big danger, in my opinion at least,

47
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,920
is as an organization sometimes frankly you

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,380
get tired of maintaining the same position in the marketplace

49
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,130
or you get tired, if you will, of advertising what that position is,

50
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,080
the message that you communicate.

51
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,340
What we have to be careful of is we often get tired of things a lot quicker

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,600
than our customers do.

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,100
PAUL: Sure.

54
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,780
DARREN: In fact, it's quite a well known fact

55
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,790
that it takes a while for a position in the marketplace to really define

56
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,270
in the minds of the consumer.

57
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,300
And that a consumer can see you, or see some of your advertising,

58
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,556
or see a pop up online, or whatever the case may be,

59
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,430
but it takes a little while for that actually

60
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,030
to formalize in their head space.

61
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,340
And most organizations are too quick actually to try to change a position

62
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,170
or change their messaging to the consumer

63
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,310
and they should maybe just hold on to that position for a little while

64
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,890
longer, because what that will do is it'll strengthen it

65
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,860
and it'll make it more resolute and more defined in the consumer's mind.

66
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,140
One of the worst things you can do as an organization is give lots of messages

67
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,110
that are different, because that just creates confusion

68
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,480
in the marketplace and consumers don't know what you stand for.

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,810
And back to your point on value proposition,

70
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,810
and thinking about what is that unique tip of the arrow.

71
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,150
If you're not pounding that home repetitively,

72
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,650
but instead you're saying lots of different things, people won't get it.

73
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,540
So in my mind you want to be clear, and you

74
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,740
want to be focused, and make sure you're not switching around too often.

75
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,480
PAUL: So it's really a little bit like in interpersonal relationships.

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,090
It can take quite a while to build a reputation and one needs

77
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,370
to put some time into that.

78
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,735
So a couple of things I take out of this is you said, don't change too often,

79
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:33,770
and that means that once you've established it,

80
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,122
you've got to look at it for awhile, but you

81
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,830
need to make sure that what you're working at is the right thing.

82
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,371
DARREN: Yeah.

83
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:45,450
And I think that's a nice point to add is that, if you're positions crappy,

84
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,170
sticking with it isn't going to help you.

85
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,210
But once you find that position in the marketplace that really works,

86
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,480
that's where you should sit for a while and make sure

87
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,990
that the consumer truly gets it and really believes it.

88
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,580
Absolutely.

89
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,970
I wanted to ask you a little bit on the notion of the layers of a product.

90
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,600
I really liked how you brought that to life in the course here.

91
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,560
How does that relate to positioning?

92
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,320
How could you use the notion of a layered product

93
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,770
to make positioning work?

94
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,270
PAUL: Yeah.

95
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:21,260
I think it's an almost like a menu of options available to you to push

96
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,540
at how you might differentiate and find that point of difference

97
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,710
that really is going to drive your positioning statement.

98
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,750
So in newer markets or in less competitive markets,

99
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,680
it may be that you can deal with something

100
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,870
that is almost lower down the hierarchy, lower down the list,

101
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,820
but let's take the Zappos example that you were talking about a little earlier

102
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,930
and shoes are almost commoditized and they're

103
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,800
selling other people's brand's anyway.

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,050
So as a retailer of shoes, the way to stand out was not to say we sell shoes.

105
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,200
They had to go past that level two or three

106
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,050
and they had to go on to the something else.

107
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,930
And you know before they came along, one of the reasons,

108
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,950
I guess it's such a good story is they really went to another dimension using

109
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,730
a framework like this to say the service component

110
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,820
and then the happiness promise that kind of

111
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,680
is embodied in the way they deliver service

112
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,420
was really a dimension of that Zappos brand.

113
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,340
So I think the more competitive or sophisticated your market is,

114
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,090
the more likely it is you're going to have

115
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,250
to go kind of to those outer circles.

116
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,830
And maybe a final point, I'd say is doing it proactively

117
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,500
rather than reactively can be really advantageous,

118
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
because as you go to the outer circles, you

119
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,910
tend to be looking at combination approaches

120
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,560
to positioning or to things which are harder to really understand or imitate,

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,562
compared with some of the more foundational aspects of what makes up

122
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:53,770
your product or your service.

123
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,265
DARREN: Oh, excellent.

124
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,064
Well, thanks, Paul.

125
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,605
PAUL: All right It's been a pleasure.

126
00:06:57,605 --> 00:06:57,720
DARREN: Good work.

127
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,303
PAUL: See you see you again next week.

128
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:01,180
DARREN: I think so.

129
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,990
