PAUL CUBBON: So if there is a conversation being

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,920
had by people about your brand and the category in which you operate,

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,630
how do we understand what's going on?

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,360
How do we access this?

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,231
I want you to consider an iceberg.

6
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:26,730
And if this is the water line here, then much of the iceberg is below the water.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,210
And the iceberg represents the conversation that is occurring.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,557
And what's happening is, is that traditionally, we

9
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:35,890
only see the tip of the iceberg.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,500
We only hear a bit of the conversation, and maybe we hear it later as well.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,690
And what social media allows us to do-- not only

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,640
is there a larger conversation happening in social media,

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,330
but it allows us as marketers to push the water-line down,

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,460
so that we can see and hear more of the conversation.

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,500
So how does that work?

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,540
Well, it works as follows.

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,710
The first stage for a marketer with social media

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,110
is to monitor or listen to the conversation.

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,810
Understand what people are saying first.

20
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,360
This isn't really a change in the rules of the game

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,290
based on how marketers traditionally worked.

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,770
When we looked previously at marketing communication, what we said was is

23
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,180
we said that in a push or outbound sense,

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,570
there was a talking to, at worst a talking at customers.

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,760
And this was paid advertising in its stereotypical format.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,500
The opportunity then here is to deal in a pull or an inbound way, to say,

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,940
let's monitor, as a form of research, what is being said first.

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,590
If we've done this first and foremost, we can then categorize

29
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,460
and we can decide whether something is negative.

30
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,400
And if it is negative, such as the United breaks

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,450
guitars-- negative for United-- then we can at least be alerted

32
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,680
that we have to do something about it.

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,670
The alternative might be that we find some positive word of mouth.

34
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,800
In fact, even in the United breaks guitars example,

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,580
there is a positive opportunity for somebody.

36
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,190
Who?

37
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,910
The guitar that was broken was a particular brand.

38
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,280
It was a Taylor guitar.

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,410
And although it was at a smaller level, the manufacturers of Taylor guitars,

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,790
they were able to put out some videos and other online material to say,

41
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,910
we make them really well.

42
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,660
They're hard to break.

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,980
And we're surprised it got broken, but this is what we do to repair them,

44
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,830
and this is the service we offer.

45
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,940
So they were able, actually to leverage, on behalf

46
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,700
of their brand to make sure that they took advantage of the opportunity.

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,060
So what are we doing in the monitoring phases?

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,320
We're putting our finger on the pulse of the conversation

49
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,860
so that we can actually react to either negative or positive stories.

50
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,840
Now, you can do this at a brand level, but you actually

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,270
want to look at it more broadly.

52
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,790
So let's circle back to the very beginning of this course.

53
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,830
Darren told you about the Oreo dunking in the dark story,

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,510
when the lights went out at the Superbowl.

55
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,920
Now, what did they do?

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,580
They have a positive opportunity in social media,

57
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,200
but not because they were monitoring anything to do with cookies,

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,780
it's because they were looking for opportunities

59
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,420
about what was going on in a big event, in this case the Superbowl,

60
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,490
and themselves.

61
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:44,130
They were able to do something which was on-brand, which was about dunking.

62
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,310
They were able to be humorous and entertaining about it,

63
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,000
because it was playing on the kind of sudden darkness that was going on.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,080
And they were able to be real-time.

65
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,740
And that was important, because the window of opportunity

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,770
was going to run out.

67
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,270
Now how did they do that?

68
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,850
They planned.

69
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,240
They planned because they understood that they

70
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,890
needed to monitor and look for opportunities

71
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,160
for positive word of mouth engagement.

72
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,399
And so this really gets to the second part of our sequence here.

73
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,519
And this is about conversing.

74
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,270
I say conversing rather than talking because we actually

75
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,210
are part of a two-way conversation.

76
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,510
They were responding to an event in this case.

77
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,770
So you either are responding, or selectively you

78
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,170
might initiate something.

79
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,970
But you're initiating knowing that a conversation is what's desired.

80
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:47,190
And then finally, we're dealing with facilitating

81
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,250
the conversation that is happening at a peer-to-peer level,

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,110
beyond the company itself.

83
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,770
We're no longer responding, but we are trusting

84
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,530
that other people within the community will respond in a way which

85
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,260
is useful and meaningful and so on.

86
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,300
So this brings us to a concluding aspect of what

87
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,550
we're going to deal with in social media,

88
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,460
and it's some tips and tricks for you about how you might play.

89
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,230
Apart from the monitor, converse, and facilitate sequence,

90
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,380
you should be considering the fact that speed is important.

91
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:29,080
And if speed of action is important, then you need to prepare.

92
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,390
You should be thinking about the fact that, in this real-time world,

93
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,450
there is transparency.

94
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,923
And with this transparency, there is also then a need for authenticity.

95
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:44,810


96
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:51,450
And in this very busy and noisy world, also then

97
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,680
for relevance to our audience.

98
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,720
So in summary, be prepared so that you can

99
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,830
take advantage of these particular dynamics that are at play

100
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,390
in our social media environment.

101
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:12,736
