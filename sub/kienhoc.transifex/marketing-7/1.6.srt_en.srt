00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:06,510


2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,460
PAUL CUBBON: So that was an exciting story

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,780
that Darren told us about Hershey and Mars.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,070
Good history there.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,050
And one of the things which is nice about hearing a story played out

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,540
over a period of time is you start to see the changing elements.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,510
And when we only look at the snapshot of something that is current,

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,800
then we often lose the context of what came before,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,159
and how this is part of a multistage game.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,930
For those of you that play chess, for example,

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,640
you wouldn't just play one move.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,670
You think about multiple moves.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,360
So what I want you to think about is the fact that business is a dynamic game.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,110
And marketing tends to be one of the key levers

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,240
in being able to influence that game.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,140
So we want to be able to work through and play

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,150
with a couple of different tools here.

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,040
We're going to talk through a couple of simple frameworks-- one of which

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,750
is known as the three Cs, one of which is known as a SWOT analysis,

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,600
and one of which is known as a PEST framework.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,890
You'll see that this looks a little bit like alphabet soup.

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,640
Marketers tend to like acronyms and lists.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,440
Don't worry-- we'll demystify them, and show you

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,990
how they can help us to better understand situations

25
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,610
like the Hershey-Mars battle over many decades,

26
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,790
and how you might apply it to your situation in your industry.

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,220
So let's start to use some of these approaches

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,720
to ask systematic questions that we can reuse regardless

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,820
of the particular story at hand to begin to access and understand what's

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,880
going on.

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,510
The first one of these-- the three Cs.

32
00:01:51,510 --> 00:02:02,676
Simply a checklist for the following terms-- customers, competitors,

33
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:04,110
and the company itself.

34
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,900


35
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,240
So, if we can start to look back at the story

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,600
you just heard around Hershey and Mars, what did we discover?

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,050
Well, we discovered that there are customers

38
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,980
that may have different views.

39
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,520
And we can start to look forward to an upcoming module on segmentation.

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,570
And we can find out how different people prefer different things-- why

41
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,260
did some customers respond well to a larger bar,

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,470
why did some respond better to a particular price point.

43
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,600
The second thing that we will have a look at in terms of competitors

44
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,250
is we will have a look at how competitors might respond

45
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,460
to a particular initiative that you take,

46
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,700
or what they might do to initiate something

47
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,680
that puts you at a disadvantage, that you'd then

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,330
need to be able to deal with yourself.

49
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,030
And finally, with the company itself, we're

50
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,610
going to look at the capabilities of the company-- what are its resources.

51
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,270
We're going to have a look at what its ambition is.

52
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,340
And we could also be looking at what its culture is that might actually

53
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,140
drive the way it behaves.

54
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,610
So, what does this mean when we put it together?

55
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,800
It means that regardless of the situation that we're dealing with,

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,610
we are likely to have choices around customers

57
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:40,060
who have got different types of interests and different motivations

58
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,000
to respond to our offerings.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,240
We've got competitors who will put pressure on us,

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,180
and this will change over time and will cause

61
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,640
us to need to decide how we're going to react,

62
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,470
and how we indeed might initiate particular things.

63
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,630
And it's going to also be framed by some of the company's capabilities

64
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,880
and ambitions, and indeed its culture.

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,030
The next tool we're going to look at here is called a SWOT analysis.

66
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,160
I'm often surprised how many people that I teach in executive education

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,940
courses who are often senior and experienced managers-- I find that they

68
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,820
have heard of a SWOT analysis, but they're not really

69
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,760
using it particularly well.

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,650
So as we are doing with many of the tools here,

71
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,900
we're going to take you through a quick literacy on things which

72
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,960
are conceptually quite simple, and then try and give you some tips

73
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,030
and tricks about how to use these well.

74
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,580
And so literacy, comprehension fairly easy, and then how to apply,

75
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,350
a little bit more challenging.

76
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,560
And this is where connecting the tools to the particular case

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,600
stories you're hearing should really allow

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,660
you to advance your learning quickly.

79
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,940
So what are we looking at here?

80
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,110
Well, we're looking at something fairly straightforward.

81
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,740
It's a two by two grid, and it looks something like this.

82
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,080


83
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,900
We have our strengths and our weaknesses.

84
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,700
The reason we call it a SWOT-- think about your top boxes

85
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
being labeled like this.

86
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,413
So the strengths and weaknesses-- these are internal to the organization.

87
00:05:16,413 --> 00:05:18,990


88
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,350
So what might be a strength?

89
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,580
A strength might be that you have a efficient manufacturing facility.

90
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,610
It may be that you have good access to distribution, et cetera.

91
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,120
A weakness might be that you have high costs of production,

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,100
or that you don't have much access to money to fund marketing budgets,

93
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,150
you don't have the right people, et cetera.

94
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,900
And at the bottom here, what we're going to have is

95
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:50,900
we're going to have our opportunities and our threats.

96
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,970
These are external to the organization, and these

97
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,000
are things such as an opportunity to enter

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,340
a new market, a threat from a new competitor coming in

99
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,210
that maybe we hadn't seen before.

100
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:10,670
And so, in the sense of understanding a dynamic, competitive marketplace

101
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,730
with changing customer interests and tastes,

102
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,510
being able to summarize on one page, on one chart, in a two

103
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,270
by two grid like this what some of the major elements are

104
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,860
is really, really helpful.

105
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,500
Now, when people often do this, they can write it out in a Word document.

106
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,820
They maybe write something that's really, really long.

107
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,350
And we want to be able to distill it into the major factors.

108
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,435
So there may be three to five of the key elements

109
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:41,600
that we want to be able to bring up.

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,010
So one of the tips here is to be able to prioritize and gain focus on the things

111
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,230
that matter most.

112
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,250
The second tip I would give you here is this is not static.

113
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,670
And so we may be looking to see how could an opportunity here be connected

114
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,320
to a strength that we have so that we could advance

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,760
our position in the marketplace.

116
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,830
How could we actually mitigate a weakness

117
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:14,330
so that a threat from a competitor was less likely to impact us negatively.

118
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,060
So what I'd like you to think about here is how, from any research

119
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,310
you're doing-- we'll cover research in detail in a later module--

120
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,950
you would be able to summarize an understanding

121
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,940
of the internal situation, the external situation,

122
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,970
and start to lay it out in a useful, dynamic assessment.

123
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,900
This tool is based around a simple acronym-- PEST.

124
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,720
And PEST is easy to remember.

125
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,320
But what does it stand for?

126
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:54,360
It stands for the political, the economic, the social,

127
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,580
and the technical dynamics in society, really,

128
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,640
that impact our business, our competitors, and the consumers

129
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,870
that we are trying to attract and appeal to.

130
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,570
And so, a lot of the material here will come from secondary research.

131
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,710
Look out for that module coming up in a little bit down the track.

132
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,710
And you are to say, well, what are the things that we would want to look at?

133
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,200
So, for instance, from a political point of view,

134
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,440
we might be looking at regulation.

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,210
What is allowed that will either constrain us

136
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,960
or will provide opportunities for us going forward.

137
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,039
From an economic point of view, we might be saying,

138
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,049
what is people's ability to pay?

139
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,310
Is employment higher or lower?

140
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,990
What's disposable income like?

141
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,040
Et cetera.

142
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,090
From a social point of view, we might be looking at trends in society.

143
00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:00,670
Are people eating more organic or locally produced food?

144
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,310
Are people spending more on experiences rather than on material goods?

145
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,110
Are people recycling more rather than throwing away,

146
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,660
and how does that impact us in terms of both potential threats--

147
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,310
remember that last tool?-- or potential opportunities?

148
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,060
And then finally, what's happening from a technical point of view?

149
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,320
What's driving lower costs around batteries that might

150
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,050
enable electric cars to go mainstream?

151
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:34,030
What's providing near-ubiquity in mobile phones that then, in turn,

152
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,080
enables other possibilities?

153
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,460
And so what we've got here is we tend to have things like lower costs, higher

154
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,480
speed, et cetera.

155
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,650
Enablers of new possibilities.

156
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,150
So.

157
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,030
The PEST acronym-- simply a framework for making sure

158
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,930
that you can be comprehensive and systematic in pulling data-- typically

159
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,400
secondary research-- that is about the past and the present, and using

160
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,600
it to start to build some projections around plans for the future.

161
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,440
So we started this module with Darren telling you

162
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,520
an exciting story about the multi-decade competitive battle between Mars

163
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:25,170
and Hershey as they appealed for the minds, the hearts, and indeed,

164
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,360
the wallets of buyers of chocolate bars.

165
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,050
But beyond that, we are trying to suggest to you

166
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,160
that you can go through a systematic set of questions, whatever

167
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,340
the situation, including in your own company now,

168
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,910
to look back over what's happened to try to understand the present,

169
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,890
and to project possibilities for winning, marketing

170
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,400
programs for the future by going through some simple approaches.

171
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,860
And your starting foundational approaches

172
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,760
can involve some of the following tools that we

173
