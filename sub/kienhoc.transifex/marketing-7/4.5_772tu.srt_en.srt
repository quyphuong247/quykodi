DARREN DAHL: Radiohead was at a crossroads in 2007.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,690
Why?

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,290
Well, they had a regular label that they had been using

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,910
for their previous six albums, EMI.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,520
But they decided to part ways with them in 2003.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,670
This band, a very popular band out of the UK,

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,210
had a new album that they wanted to launch in 2007,

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,920
and this was called In Rainbows.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,670
But they didn't quite know what they were going to do.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,670
Should they go with a regular label, a distributor and make $1.50 an album?

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,850
That had been the norm, and that's what they were used to.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,710
But they thought, here's the opportunity.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,360
We aren't signed with anyone.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,840
Let's experiment with pricing with distribution and see what we can do.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,730
And that's what I want to talk about today.

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,430
I'm going to set Paul up a little bit with this story about Radiohead.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,980
Because you see, pricing is an interesting strategic lever

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,945
in marketing.

20
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:04,209
And in this context, Radiohead really took an interesting gamble.

21
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,100
They tried something new.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,880
You see, at this time, you could download a whole album for $9.99

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,330
or an individual song for $0.99.

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,950
And Radiohead thought, maybe there's something different here, something

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,490
we can experiment with.

26
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,190
And so they launched this album on their website.

27
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,990
And they asked their fan base, and potential customers actually,

28
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,810
if you want to buy the album, and you had to buy the whole album,

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,490
you can buy it, and you can pay whatever you want.

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,550
This is one of the best examples of a pricing

31
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,080
strategy known as name your own price.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,190
The question is, was it successful?

33
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,180
Because Radiohead took a real gamble.

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,440
They had a very loyal fan base.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,260
And the notion of name your own price obviously caught a lot of attention.

36
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,880
It was great PR.

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,540
It was counter culture as well.

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,500
And that's something that Radiohead embraces as a brand.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,550
They're not your regular pop type band in any sense of the word.

40
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,950
And so obviously, this appealed to their fan base

41
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,130
and frankly attracted more people to the Radiohead banner.

42
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,670
So what happened?

43
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,340
Well, two out of five of the people that downloaded the album,

44
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,090
paid something for it.

45
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,690
And the average price paid was $6.

46
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,190
So when you think about all of the downloads that happened,

47
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,405
$2.26 for each download flowed back to the band.

48
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:35,270
That was far greater than the $1.50 that they would have got with the regular

49
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,780
record label.

50
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,050
The overall revenue, huge.

51
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,880
In fact, it's estimated that more money flowed to the band from this one album

52
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,760
release than all of the other albums that they had released before.

53
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,300
This was a very cool story and very exciting obviously

54
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,050
for the band, a wonderful experiment that

55
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,290
showed them that a different type of pricing

56
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,500
could work in the recording industry.

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,670
Has the name your own price model worked in other industries?

58
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,740
Yes and no.

59
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,090
We've seen name your own price in restaurants and hotels,

60
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,520
in retail stores, even for professional sports teams.

61
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,840
And sometimes it is successful.

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,810
Sometimes it's not.

63
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,370
You know what I like about this Radiohead story is

64
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,480
it shows the complexity of pricing, because there's not just one

65
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,950
way to win the game when it comes to pricing strategy.

66
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,510
Sometimes we think pricing is simple.

67
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,600
We think it's just thinking about costs, adding a margin,

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,290
and then taking that price to the market.

69
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,180
But you know what?

70
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,920
It's not that simple.

71
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,370
In fact organizations, companies often have real difficulty

72
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,140
with the pricing question.

73
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,910
It brings to mind a brand named Bugaboo, a company that

74
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,070
makes strollers for little young kids, little babies, right?

75
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,250
How did they price the product?

76
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,310
Well, they started in the 1990s actually in Holland.

77
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,340
And one of the founders was watching-- at the playground-- watching parents

78
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,050
wheeling their kids around in the stroller, in the pram

79
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,350
and having real difficulties.

80
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,270
And seeing this as an opportunity, designed a new stroller.

81
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,370
And this was the first product that Bugaboo brought to market.

82
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,590
But they got stuck when it came to the pricing question.

83
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,300
And their solution was to go to the store

84
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,980
and see what the competitors were offering.

85
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,120
And then use a simple rule that we should just

86
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,070
double the competitor's price.

87
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,500
Now is that the best way to price?

88
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,840
Maybe.

89
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,860
But it's difficult to say.

90
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,320
What I'm hoping Paul can do is bring a little bit of this story

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,990
here and the Radiohead story together, so that we

92
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,650
can understand why these different companies used

93
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,980
such different approaches in their pricing strategy.

94
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,170
Paul, let's talk about it.

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,720
