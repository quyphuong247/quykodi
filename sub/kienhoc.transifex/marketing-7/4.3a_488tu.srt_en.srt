PAUL CUBBON: Mark Hurst of goodexperience.com

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,220
is often quoted as saying, "The brand is what people say about you afterwards."

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,540
After what, you may ask?

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,320
After the experience they've had with your brand,

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,870
they will tell their friends, they will tell their family something.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,345
They will maybe tell them that they had a disappointing experience,

8
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:33,150
a lackluster experience, or they may tell them

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,570
that they had a great time, that it really made their day,

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,800
that it was exciting for them.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:48,760
So what we are doing as we move between our positioning, our product design,

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,730
and understanding how marketing communication happens

13
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:01,500
is we are setting up stories about our brand.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,360
And the stories about our brand, some of them

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,880
are things that you will find when we get to marketing communication,

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,610
we pay for.

17
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,840
This is typically advertising.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,980
And some of them are earned.

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,150
And so this is really foreshadowing this later module

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,260
we will do on marketing communication.

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,540
And earned communication is often talked about as word of mouth,

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,700
sometimes short formed like this.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,550
And the word of mouth, the conversation that people have about this

24
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,100
is stimulated by the product as we position it, as we design it,

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,110
and as it is experienced by our customers.

26
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,990
Now there are multiple touch points that customers might have with our brand,

27
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,960
and this was illustrated well in a business to business context

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,530
by Darren in a story about Teekay Shipping that you just covered.

29
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,450
And we deliberately set up to tell you an industrial organization story

30
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,800
because it's less obvious or less intuitive.

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,360
But if you can imagine this in a business situation, multiple touch

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,150
points, it becomes a lot easier then to work back

33
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,090
to your own personal experiences.

34
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,186
You think about going to Disneyland, and you

35
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:17,060
think about all of the interactions you might

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,155
have with that brand and the organization

37
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:21,890
from before you plan your trip to your time

38
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,650
there, and then when you come home with your memories,

39
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,070
and you tell people about it.

40
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,360
And maybe it was a bad experience in the lineup,

41
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,090
or maybe it was a great experience and a thrill.

42
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,870
And then back to maybe more mundane things nearer to home,

43
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,250
it may be with your mobile phone provider.

44
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,060
And it's everything from going into the store where you're

45
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,570
dealing with third party licensees to sign up

46
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,760
with your particular kind of phone, and then it

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,920
may be with the company itself around billing procedures,

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,940
around the call center, et cetera.

49
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,090
So what we're really trying to do is say that you are designing your product,

50
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,110
you're positioning your product.

51
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,630
This is building out the brand, which allows communication

52
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,060
around an experience, part of which you control

53
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,690
and part of which happens because you've set up the conditions for it to happen.

54
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:17,720
And the conversation is going to occur, and this is what your brand stands for.

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,070
