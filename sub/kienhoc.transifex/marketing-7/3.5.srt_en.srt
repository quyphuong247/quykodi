1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,540
Today, we're going to talk a bit about product.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,280
And to start off with, I wanted to put a question in your mind.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,390
What is a product?

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,330
Because when you think at least the way I think about products,

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,060
I think of the physical good.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,140
When I go out and buy a car, or a toaster, or a blender, or a skateboard

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,120
even, I think the product is that actual physical good.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,470
In parallel, when I buy a service product, a haircut,

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,420
or let's say going to the movies to watch a film,

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,000
I think of just that specific experience.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,420
But is that all the product is?

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,760
Is a product much more than just that tangible physical good

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,472
or that moment in time?

14
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:54,430
And this is something that Paul is going to dig

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,630
into a little bit, a little later in the session today.

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,680
But I wanted to tell you a story about a product, shoes and the company

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,600
that sells them, because I believe that when

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,470
you think about how they sell the product, the physical good,

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:15,390
you'll start to understand that maybe a product can be more than just that one

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,990
item, that one element, that we always think about when we think of the word

21
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,357
product.

22
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:24,190
The company that I want to talk about I think some of you will know.

23
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:30,200
This company is called Zappos and it's a very interesting, big company

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,680
here in the United States.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,420
Now of course, if you're following Zappos

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,750
you know that it really only operates just in the US and part

27
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,040
of that is because of where it came from.

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,670
It started in 1999 and three individuals,

29
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,570
and I'm going to talk about one of them, founded the company

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,040
at that point at time and named it shoesite.com,

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,110
but they decided very quickly that that probably wasn't the best name,

32
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,910
because they hoped that at some point in the history of the company

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,710
they would be able to sell more than just shoes.

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,450
And so they chose a new name after the first year called Zappos.

35
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,879
And it was, to be honest, named after the Spanish word for shoes.

36
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,670
They hoped that they could grow the company

37
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,520
and they set big goals, that within 10 years,

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,170
they would be at a billion dollars in revenue.

39
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,990
Interestingly, they also wanted to set another goal

40
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,030
that they would be a company that people wanted to work for,

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,250
that they would be recognized in America as one of the top 100 employers.

42
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,180
And they started off on this journey quite successfully.

43
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,400
They were doing 20 million dollars in sales every month,

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,490
right out of the gate almost.

45
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,310
And over time, the CEO, one of the founders,

46
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,626
a guy named Tony Hsieh grew to become the face of the organization.

47
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,375
Now why this company's interesting and why

48
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,130
it relates to this notion of product is what

49
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,150
Tony Hsieh and the rest of the organization,

50
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,880
the rest of the leadership team, gives to the customer

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,870
when they buy the product.

52
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,590
And what they give is customer service, because Tony made it the mandate

53
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,190
that this company would be different than other companies.

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,520
He actually wrote a book called Delivering Happiness to describe

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,510
what he believed was the true value proposition, something

56
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,860
we've talked about before, that buying a product from this company would be.

57
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,930
It's interesting, because each of the employees of this organization

58
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,230
are empowered to ensure that the entire experience of buying shoes on Zappos

59
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,820
is going to be amazing.

60
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,820
There's almost no constraints on what employees at Zappos

61
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,340
can do for the customer.

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,840
They're not given a set script when they take calls or take internet messages

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,000
from potential customers.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
They could take hours even.

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,320
The record is over 10 hours on one sales call alone:

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,490
As long as the customer is happy.

67
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,100
This has resulted, obviously, in amazing word of mouth.

68
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,150
The company has grown without advertising, without promotion,

69
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,230
but the product, which encompasses all of this wonderful customer service

70
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,220
has made it a success.

71
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,910
Tony likes to tell a few stories about why customers love their products.

72
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,970
One of the favorite ones that I like refers

73
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,000
to one of the customers asking Tony, you know, what length, what extreme

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,374
would your customer sales people go to helping me?

75
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:30,040
Would they be willing to tell me a joke?

76
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,360
Would they be willing to tell me the weather?

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,860
Yes.

78
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,920
Yes.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,680
But when I called there, would they be willing to tell me

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,590
what I can find pizza late at night?

81
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,380
And Tony says that that happened, that one of the customers

82
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,760
called one of the service reps asking if they could recommend some pizza

83
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,610
places late at night after a long evening of fun.

84
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,880
Well, the Zappos employee called back with five recommendations,

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,330
helping the customer become satisfied.

86
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,220
Perhaps, a more telling story refers to a customer

87
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,450
that was looking to return a pair of boots

88
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,250
that they had purchased from Zappos.

89
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,580
The customer rep doing the usual appropriate call said, of course,

90
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,350
we can take this return, but let me ask why why are you returning?

91
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,810
Do the boots not fit, the wrong color?

92
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,150
And the customer said, to be honest I had bought the boots for my husband,

93
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,080
but he's recently passed away.

94
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,470
He had a car accident and he died.

95
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,020
Tony tells the story that the the customer service rep expressed sympathy

96
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,650
on the call and said, of course, that would take the returns

97
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,360
and then hung up.

98
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,300
The customer was surprised a few days later

99
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,770
when they received a bouquet of flowers from Zappos.

100
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,800
Again, showing the sympathy that the company

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,380
had for this individual, for this customer.

102
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,360
Now of course, this employee didn't have to send flowers,

103
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,360
but knew that they should.

104
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,810
Zappos empowers their employees to do what's

105
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,520
right in terms of making that customer experience when they buy a product,

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,970
when they interact with the organization truly as wonderful as it can be.

107
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,890
I'm going to turn to Paul now, because he's

108
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,400
going to bring to life this notion of what a product truly is.

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,910
Is it something like Zappos that isn't just

110
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,390
about the physical shoes, but is about a bigger, broader experience

111
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,020
that you consume as a customer?

112
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,570
Paul.

113
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:40,126
