00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,790
PAUL: Well, those BMW movie films, they really are impactful.

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,430
And it's easy to want to watch them again and some of you,

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,310
I'm imagining, if you haven't seen them already have gone off

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,540
to look at the whole series.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,800
There are eight in total that were made.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,820
And that's fun, but as Darren told you, there

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,090
was really a lot of marketing thought that

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,620
went behind what was going on in those films.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,720
And a lot of what was really important there was to understand segmentation

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,940
and how segmenting a market allows you to target people differently.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,030
So what I want you to consider is the fact

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,970
that if this is the potential total market,

13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,760
there are lots of ways that we can slice the market

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,730
and we can get into smaller and smaller segments.

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,710
And the mistake that people often make is

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,410
they say, well, I want a large user group.

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,330
I want a large market.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,790
But it's really hard, if not impossible, to be all things to all people.

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,040
And therefore, finding the segment of the market

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,160
that you can connect with your particular product

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,920
or service and the way that you establish your positioning

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,970
and your value proposition.

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,390
That's coming in a later module.

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,020
Look out for that.

25
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,800
What we're trying to do is we're trying to link between segmentation,

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,680
targeting, our choice of segments, and the positioning that we make.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,880
How do we actually fit our position?

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,610
And our value proposition to that segment.

29
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,270
So these next few sessions, they really all flow together.

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,230
And again, we're unbundling things, taking them

31
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,700
down to their constituent parts so that we can better

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,090
understand how to use them and then put them back together again.

33
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,410
So let us take this forward.

34
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,910
How might you go about segmentation?

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,430
So now we understand that segmentation is important.

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,120
What are the criteria we might consider using to go about segmenting?

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,210
Well, first off, let us consider demographics.

38
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,550
Typically the sorts of information that you might get in a census.

39
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,970
So what are we looking at here?

40
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,380
We're looking at age.

41
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,730
We're looking at gender.

42
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,770
We're looking at geography, where do people live.

43
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,630
We're looking at household size, et cetera.

44
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,410
And this is in a business to consumer context, but many of you

45
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,200
will be working in a business to business setting.

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,555
You may not care about age or gender of your customer,

47
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:41,690
but you'll care about location.

48
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,430
You may care about other things that also

49
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,310
are categorizable in this sort of area, such as size of company

50
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,020
and the actual sector that they operate in, et cetera.

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,530
So we can take demographics as a broad categorization

52
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,130
of data in these sorts of areas.

53
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,280
So it's a useful starting point.

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,430
But frankly, if you were to consider it as a filter, then it is a crude filter.

55
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,390
Lots of things will fall between the cracks.

56
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,950
So what I want you to consider is I want you to consider how would you actually

57
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,190
be able to lay over a different sort of filter that may allow you to get

58
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,930
some narrower segmentation going on.

59
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,550
So let's take the next classic approach that marketers use.

60
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,280
It's a rather awkward word, psychographics,

61
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,030
but think about it and as a hybrid word between the graphics

62
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,100
part of demo and psychology.

63
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,870
So the psychological segmentation approach.

64
00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:00,830
And there are lots of different ways of playing with these psychographics.

65
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,790
A nice acronym, kind of initially popularized by a market research firm

66
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,720
SRI, is VALs.

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,270
And the VALs stands for this.

68
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,055
Values, attitudes, and lifestyles.

69
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,579


70
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,329
You'll see that there'll be some follow up

71
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:27,190
reading on psychographics and on some of the sub components of values,

72
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,650
attitudes, and lifestyles.

73
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,660
But you want to be thinking about where do your customer's values come from.

74
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,380
Their culture, their upbringing, their attitudes affected by their peers,

75
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,600
their lifestyle, their chosen activities.

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,020
And how would this cause you to kind of in combination with demographics

77
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,550
choose a different, narrower segment?

78
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,350
So if we play back to the BMW situation, we talked in terms of age,

79
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,060
we talked in terms of some of the attitudes and lifestyles.

80
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,860
And so really we're unpacking that.

81
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,230
We don't need to stop there.

82
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,790
We can keep narrowing further if it is productive to do so.

83
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,380
And so some of the things which obviously flow out from the BMW

84
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,700
situation is pricing segmentation.

85
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,910
There was really a high, medium, and lower relative pricing segmentation.

86
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:25,255
And the recognition there is that some consumers

87
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:30,460
will self screen and self filter based on their ability and willingness

88
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,690
to pay.

89
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,480
And then the last one I want to talk to you about, which is often ignored,

90
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,830
is what we'll term loyalty segmentation.

91
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,720
And with loyalty segmentation, what I want to do

92
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
is I want you to think about whether we're dealing with somebody

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,560
who is brand loyal to our company.

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,610
That is, they are a repeat buyer.

95
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,970
They bought a BMW last time and they're going

96
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,080
to buy another BMW five years later.

97
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,250
Are they a brand switcher, but a favorable brand switcher?

98
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,370
I.e, they buy from us more often than they buy from other people,

99
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,020
but they switch occasionally in the category.

100
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,520
I've bought five cars in the last 20 years.

101
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,526
Three of them were BMWs, but sometimes I bought from another brand.

102
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:20,650
Are they a brand neutral, i.e.

103
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,140
they don't have particular preferences.

104
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:28,525
People who are brand neutrals are often then driven down to lower price.

105
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:34,420
Are they people who are they are unfavorable brand switchers?

106
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,690
That means that they are actually more likely to buy from a competing brand.

107
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,530
And then are they other brand loyals?

108
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,960
They're loyal to somebody else.

109
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,290
We would have to persuade them to switch to us.

110
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,180
They really, really like buying from Audi

111
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,780
and therefore BMW is not something that they want to get.

112
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,030
And then finally, the one that's often ignored,

113
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:02,300
and this is the one that really was a nice focus for the BMW situation,

114
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,810
is new category users.

115
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,890
So I've written up a series of acronyms there

116
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,210
or just kind of short form versions just for efficiency.

117
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,850
But you've heard me say what they each stand for,

118
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,460
and of course you can look at the text transcription to the video

119
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,880
so that you've got back up on these.

120
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,440
Let us try then to sum this up.

121
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,860
There are different ways that we can go about segmentation.

122
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,980
It's not about trying to make it complicated.

123
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,660
It's not that more is better.

124
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,480
You want to try to use a combination of segmentation techniques

125
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,320
that allow you to narrow down on a particular sub

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,190
set of the potential market that you can then serve better than competitors

127
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,990
and therefore have a compelling business case.

128
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:55,150
