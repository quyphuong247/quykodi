PAUL CUBBON: We're going to talk about distribution.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,440
This may surprise you.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,580
Maybe you work in distribution, or supply chain operations,

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,140
or some area of fulfillment or sourcing, and you might say that's my area.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,950
Why are marketing people interested in distribution?

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,970
Well, this is one of the many reasons why

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,760
a course like this, marketing for non marketers, has been designed.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,110
Marketing people, they are at the interface with many other functional

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,920
areas and for the organization to operate well,

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,390
and for marketers to do their job well, they

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,580
need to be able to work closely across those interfaces.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,940
So, for sure, the actual detail of sourcing from suppliers

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,950
or getting products for stores, those are

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,420
the domain of other functional areas.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,600
But why does the marketer care about distribution?

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,465
One key word: access.

17
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:04,989
Access to customers.

18
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,520
So let's step back.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,290
I'm a small start up business, I'm a one person business.

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,750
And I go out and I'm on a street corner or in a market stall

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,690
and I start to sell my products and I find that I'm successful.

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,460
And there's a lot of demand across the country, maybe across the world,

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,580
for my product.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,610
So what do I do?

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,120
Do I drive in a car to all these places and get on planes?

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,730
No.

27
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,250
I don't.

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,950
I need other people to do it.

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,610
And I quickly find there's real expertise required in that role.

30
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,470
And so I can either decide to do it directly within the company,

31
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,540
I can hire people.

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,960
I can have internal costs and additional complexity.

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,840
Or I can do it indirectly, and that means

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,320
that I'm actually going to choose to go through other channels.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,410
And I'm going to go through intermediaries, the partners, that

36
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:06,290
connect me in those channels between my company and my many customers.

37
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,660
And the more complicated and dispersed and varied my customer base may be,

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,060
then the more challenges there are in getting my product and service

39
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,990
to my customers.

40
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:25,429
