1
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:08,470
DARREN DAHL: So, Paul, we've kind of reached the end of the road, here.

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,440
This is our last debrief.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,370
And it's been a fun course.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,130
And definitely a fun week, this week.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,430
Little bit of social media-- a few more case studies.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,670
I wanted to ask you, right out of the gate,

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,760
though-- social media, digital, online.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,570
You've kind of convinced me that perhaps there's something here.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,380
If that's the case, maybe we should just leave the traditional stuff behind.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,560
Like, isn't social media the wave of the future?

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,590
PAUL CUBBON: Well, I never thought I'd hear you say that.

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,080
It's been a long ride, trying to persuade you that there's merit here.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,070
But no.

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580
I mean, I think-- as I tried to lay out in the last of the sessions

15
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,790
that I covered on tools, with my three overlapping

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:59,260
circles-- the paid, owned, and earned combination of media

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,530
typically works best.

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,672
And sure, you may weight things differently.

19
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:06,880
I think there's a lag effect.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,980
I think many marketers are still overspending on

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,940
traditional paid advertising.

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,670
And they can do more with their owned and their

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,920
earned media, and particularly what they do in social.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,170
So I think there's a lag effect, and it varies by industry and by players

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,550
in the industry.

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,790
I think that when we look back to what we talked about in Marketing

27
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:34,880
Communication, in the last session, we were talking about how--

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,640
the rise of stunt advertising.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,540
Why do we suddenly have people talking about a beer fridge which

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,870
is in the middle of nowhere, or a submarine that's

31
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,050
appeared in a city street, and so on?

32
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,420
Those sorts of examples.

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,780
They fuel word of mouth, both offline and online.

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,860
So I think we're going to see more of it.

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,410
But I think there's still a bit of a lag.

36
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,517
And I think that the data is very quickly going to catch up with people.

37
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:02,850
If they're going back and doing some of the things we've

38
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,640
encouraged them to do, like good market research,

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,180
understanding societal trends, they'll see that less and less people

40
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,060
are watching where regular ads were.

41
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,320
They're finding ways to skip past them and to ignore them.

42
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,360
And so social media done well will have a bigger influence.

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,240
But I don't believe it will be a full replacement.

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
DARREN DAHL: OK.

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,800
Fair enough.

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,550
PAUL CUBBON: Yeah.

47
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,940
So, anyway, we'll see what everybody has to say

48
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,850
when they're chattering on the forum.

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,535
And I'm sure we'll see a range of views.

50
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,410
And there'll probably be some people who want

51
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,830
to be 100% social media and some people who are going to explain

52
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,350
why they're not touching it at all.

53
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,170
And I think one of the exciting things about being in our profession

54
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,930
is the variety of opinion and sample situations that we see.

55
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,390
And that kind of leads me to a question I wanted to ask you.

56
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,510
This has been billed as a course that was Marketing Principles

57
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,230
for Non-Marketing Professionals.

58
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,480
And so as we look out there to people who

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,110
are working in non-marketing roles who wanted to know a little bit more

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,070
about this mystery that was marketing, we hope we've demystified it a bit.

61
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,650
We've unpacked it.

62
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,350
But what would you be saying to somebody who's working in finance or accounting

63
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,770
or in operations or in IT who-- you know,

64
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,250
they want to have a bigger role in their organization.

65
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,500
They have a better understanding of the customer-facing roles.

66
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,080
They realize that maybe it's not so fundamentally confusing or difficult.

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,636
We've unpacked it for them.

68
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:35,510
What are the tips and tricks you'd give them?

69
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,218
Or what are the things that you think that might really help them

70
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,711
in moving forward in their careers?

71
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:42,460
DARREN DAHL: A couple things come to mind.

72
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,110
And then, to be honest, I'd probably flip it back to you.

73
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,000
But the first thing I hope that this course has

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,810
done for those that have been enrolled is give them the language

75
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,950
and empower them to be more vocal about marketing in their organizations.

76
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,150
I think one of the difficulties that often marketers have is

77
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,330
they're seen to speak a different language

78
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,700
and to be concerned about things that are sometimes a little

79
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,980
tricky to understand for people that aren't

80
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,560
familiar with the buzzwords and the dialogue.

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,170
And so I think, first off, this course hopefully

82
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:23,260
has empowered those that have taken it to truly put their hand up and ask

83
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,000
questions and challenge, perhaps, the marketing people in the organization

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,320
and get involved in the conversation.

85
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,850
So that would be the first thing I think that I would give as a tip.

86
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,030
The second thing that I would like to briefly mention

87
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,755
is focused on what you said, when you when you said "unpack" marketing.

88
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:44,310
And I think we've done that.

89
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,850
We've had 12 nice sessions where we've given the bits

90
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,400
and the pieces of how marketing works and where it all fits.

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,970
The trick, I think, is to actually then put all of those elements

92
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,580
back together.

93
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,440
And that's something that you talked about in this last lecture.

94
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,470
But I think good marketing doesn't leave a bit or a piece out.

95
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,870
It's like an engine, to me.

96
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,630
And you have to have all the components of the engine working and humming along

97
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,290
to truly get the horsepower that you need in your organization.

98
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,740
So whether it's doing your due diligence on the market research,

99
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,480
or scanning the environment with a PEST analysis,

100
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,930
or if it's understanding what your brand is

101
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,510
and being consistent on your positioning of that specific brand,

102
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,470
or if it's having a good understanding of the tactics.

103
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,370
The four Ps it's often described as.

104
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,270
Is it hitting on all cylinders?

105
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,560
Have you, as a businessperson, given enough

106
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,200
thought to each of those components and bringing them all together

107
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,850
so that they're one complete engine that's really

108
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,132
going to make your organization work?

109
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:48,940
PAUL CUBBON: Hmm.

110
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,440
Interesting.

111
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,780
I don't know.

112
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,830
I'm inclined to agree.

113
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,410


114
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,790
The first point you made, around literacy, I think is a key one.

115
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,320
I mean, in every discipline, not just marketing-- I mean,

116
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,175
if I'm in Finance or IT or Operations-- there

117
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:09,500
are specific words and terminologies and acronyms.

118
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,750
And they're pretty easy to get definitions on.

119
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,640
And so if you find that your marketing colleagues are hiding things from you

120
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,930
behind fancy language, call them on it.

121
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,110
Or say "I know what you're talking about, and this is why I'm interested."

122
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,430
And I think this kind of plays to why I think

123
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,230
this can be a really exciting opportunity for people who are not

124
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,730
marketing professionals to actually take advantage

125
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,230
of having learned a little bit here.

126
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,850
It's really within their organization.

127
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,830
It's breaking down silos.

128
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,660
Good decisions are often team-based.

129
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,610
And if somebody in the team is isolated from an understanding about something

130
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,950
as fundamental as customers and competitors, then

131
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,310
maybe they're not able to contribute to that decision

132
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,680
or to doing their part of the role, whether it's in supply

133
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,700
or whether it's in funding or human relations or whatever it might be.

134
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,660
And so I get very excited when I see non-marketers realize

135
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,420
that they can engage better in the collective decisions,

136
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,690
because every organization I've ever met has got a customer or a stakeholder

137
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,580
group, and they've got competitors in one way or another.

138
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,420
And that's why this is kind of so fundamentally relevant,

139
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,180
I think, to everybody who is working.

140
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,770
DARREN DAHL: Absolutely.

141
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,050
The last thing that I would say, Paul-- and maybe it fits more as a challenge,

142
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,910
moving forward, for the students that have taken this class.

143
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,860
And that's the notion that marketing is changing.

144
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,090
And we gave some case studies, and we talked

145
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,540
about how the tactics of implementing a strategy are always evolving.

146
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,810
And you started, today, in our discussion, talking about social media.

147
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,290
So I would think one of the challenges is

148
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,480
for the people that have taken this course-- to remain current on what's

149
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,920
going on in the marketing world.

150
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,290
And I would challenge you, and each of the students

151
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:06,000
out there, to continue to read and to study

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,620
and to become a true student of the marketing discipline.

153
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,660
To always keep your eye out, as you watch

154
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,300
the news, as you go to the grocery store to buy your grocery products.

155
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,940
To ask, you know, well, what's going on, here, with respect to the world,

156
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,790
to the marketer, to the consumer.

157
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,705
And so that you can continue to understand how marketing is changing.

158
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,330
PAUL CUBBON: Well, now, that's great advice to finish off with.

159
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,289
And I know, for yourself and for myself, often, with students in class,

160
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:44,150
they'll say, a few months or a few years later, in a friendly way,

161
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,462
kind of half-jokingly cursing us, that they can never go shopping again

162
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,170
in the same way, or they can't look at ads again in the same way,

163
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,825
because they're playing at being a mini-marketer or a mini-psychologist

164
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:56,700
at looking at things.

165
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,000
And if we've helped people in this course

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,080
to start to think a little like that, then I think it's a win for everybody.

167
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,175
DARREN DAHL: Absolutely.

168
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:05,620
Thanks, Paul.

169
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,036
PAUL CUBBON: It's been a pleasure.

170
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:08,060
