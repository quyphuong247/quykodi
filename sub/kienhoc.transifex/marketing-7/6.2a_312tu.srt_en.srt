PAUL CUBBON: Social media is one of the most interesting areas

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,190
of modern-day marketing.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,600
It's fast-changing.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,890
It's exciting.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,780
But it can be confusing for marketing practitioners.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,380
And so it's no wonder that non marketers in business

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,780
can have questions about how does it work?

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,950
Is it effective?

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,150
Should we be doing more or less of it?

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,970
What I want to do is to set a context for you for understanding this.

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,530
Please consider three overlapping circles, laid out thus.

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,920


13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,700
They represent paid media-- this is our traditional advertising.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,120
Owned media, which might be a retail storefront,

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,320
or it may be a website that we send people to.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,900
And what we are doing here is we're setting expectations

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,660
from paid to owned.

18
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,230
And there could be good synergy between these: people who have had

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,079
their expectations set appropriately.

20
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,370
Or there could be a disconnect.

21
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,540
So there's clearly an overlap here, and we're

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,560
trying to make sure it's a synergistic and positive overlap.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,830
And then, finally, we're dealing here with earned media.

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,490
And earned media is what people say about this.

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:34,390
This is known as word of mouth, sometimes short formed to WOM.

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,250
And with word of mouth, we could have positive word

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,770
of mouth or negative word of mouth.

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,380
And word of mouth has existed long before social media.

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,620
But social media gives it scale and speed to move along.

30
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,170
And so how might we see these three interplaying?

31
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,960
Well, if we do a good job of owned media,

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,240
then we can leverage it, so that we get positive word of mouth at scale.

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,090
And, in turn, this should mean that we can

34
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,840
spend relatively less on paid media.

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,130
So in this way, we would have more effective marketing communication,

36
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,700
in terms of its impact on consumer behavior.

37
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,080
And equally, we would then have a more cost-effective approach

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,200
to our marketing communications.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,853
