1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,170
DARREN: So you had some homework to do.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,800
And I'm hoping that you did it, because what I want to do today

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,040
is to start right out of the gate and talk a little bit about the BMW Film

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,720
Series.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,090
Because we're going to use that today as part of our framework,

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,020
part of our story, to help bring the concepts of segmentation to life.

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,630
If you haven't watched the film, I think you could maybe get it up

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,360
on another computer right now.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,402
No, I'm just kidding.

10
00:00:33,402 --> 00:00:35,360
I'm hoping that you had a chance to watch them.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,350
Because the first thing I always like people

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,760
to do when they look at the films and talk to me about them

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,570
is give me their basic gut reaction.

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,110
And what's interesting is, though the films are very different, one

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:55,770
Powder Keg, one Star, sometimes the reactions start to overlap.

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,980
Because when you think of Powder Keg, it is a pretty violent little short film.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,770
You watch a fellow get shot, a journalist.

18
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,620
And then they're trying to take him across the border, and he's bleeding,

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,880
and the car get shot up.

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,160
But they make it.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,630
And at the very end it's very sad.

22
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,280
Very different than the movie Star, featuring

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,170
Madonna, kind of poking fun at the superstar diva nature of Madonna

24
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,890
and having bit of fun with it, but also being a little bit over the top,

25
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,270
both in terms of the violence of her being knocked around

26
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,260
in the car, maybe not so good, and also some of the profanity and the attitude

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,910
that you hear.

28
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,120
And so when I ask for people's reactions,

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,750
some people say, I love them, I love them, they're great movies,

30
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,660
I want to see more.

31
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,480
And then other people are like, I'm not sure, that's pretty intense.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,930
So then I ask people, give me some descriptors of these movies.

33
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,220
And people say, well they're raw, they're a bit gritty.

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,420
One is violent.

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,275
They're not Walt Disney, I wouldn't show them to my kids.

36
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:04,272


37
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:07,230
Too-- the language is too-- ooh, it's just too-- Some people can't even

38
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,030
tell me, because they're so upset.

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,970
They hear the F-word, they hear the S-word, all the words that

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,450
have initials that start-- And they say, Darren, it's too much.

41
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,065
So then I like to ask the question, these films

42
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:24,460
are a little provocative, a little gritty,

43
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,480
a little on the edge, what's going on?

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,450
Why did BMW spend $10 million, which is what they spent on these?

45
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,505
They invited a number of avant-garde directors, people like John Woo

46
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:41,990
and Guy Ritchie, that film these very gritty art-house films.

47
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,740
And they asked them to come and to produce this series, The Hire.

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,142
And you might have noticed that Clive Owen was in both of these films.

49
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:51,600
And this was before he was a big superstar, so they got him

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,730
for a pretty good price point.

51
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,370
But what the heck was BMW doing?

52
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,630
What was the plan?

53
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,799
Or was there a plan?

54
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,340
So that's what we want to talk about today, in today's story,

55
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,630
in today's case study, is to think a little bit

56
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,010
about these films that for a lot of people create different reactions.

57
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,730
Some people hate them, some people love them.

58
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,000
But a general recognition is that they're not

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,450
something you would put on the TV for family happy hour,

60
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,630
but rather something that you'd watch when you want

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,970
something a little more provocative.

62
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,640
And to think about it and understand it, I'd

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,430
like to pull you back to the company BMW and think

64
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,630
about their most popular cars, the vehicles that they sell.

65
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,640
And when you think about what is the brand that's known the best,

66
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,760
you think of the series.

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,920
The 3 Series, the 5 Series, and the 7 Series.

68
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,430
And I like to think of them in some ways as a pyramid.

69
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,870
At the bottom, they sell a lot of these 3 Series models.

70
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,070
And then they sell not as many, but a few of these 5 Series.

71
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,790
And then at the top, they sell very few of these 7 Series.

72
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,260
And, as you can imagine, the margins are much better on the 7 Series

73
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,850
than they are on the 3 Series.

74
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,540
But the goal of BMW, is when they start, they

75
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,690
want you to buy those 3 Series vehicles, and then move to 5, and then move to 7.

76
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,170
Kind of work your way up the pyramid.

77
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,960
And when you think about segmentation, our topic today,

78
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,680
you can very quickly see that those cars are targeted.

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,290
And Paul's going to talk a bit more about both of these ideas,

80
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,940
give you some tools on them, like he always does.

81
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,650
But those different products are targeted

82
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,430
towards different types of people.

83
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,380
And so if I asked you, in a stereotype way, to think about North America,

84
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,950
and I said who is that 3 Series driver?

85
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,950
You'd probably say, and you'd be probably correct most the time.

86
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,020
Not all the time, but most of the time, that that 3 Series is probably a male,

87
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,910
probably between around 30 to 40-ish.

88
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,330
Maybe a young professional, just started working in an accounting firm,

89
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,460
or maybe he just made the bar and he's a lawyer, perhaps.

90
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,060
And he probably lives in a downtown area,

91
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,750
doesn't have a family or kids yet, and is pretty cool,

92
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,420
maybe, or thinks he's cool, right?

93
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,770
And so that would be kind of the stereotype of the 3 Series.

94
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,110
If you bump it up to the 5 Series, it's probably

95
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,520
a very different person, in terms of where they are in their life.

96
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,650
Again, probably still male, but no longer single.

97
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,470
Probably has a family, maybe a couple of kids,

98
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,630
doing well at work, maybe manager at the accounting firm,

99
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,110
or maybe doing well in his sales territory.

100
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,530
And now he's moved to the suburbs.

101
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,650
And he's commuting in every day in his 5 Series.

102
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,670
If you go to the top of the pyramid, you get a different look.

103
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,730
Here, of course, you've got someone even older, no longer in their 40s or 50s.

104
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,250
Maybe now in their 60s even.

105
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,600
He is someone that's truly made it.

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,070
The CEO of the company, or maybe retired.

107
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,310
Maybe not even living in the city, maybe living in Hawaii,

108
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,630
or somewhere really nice.

109
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,080
And he's kind of got everything.

110
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,610
The kids have left, I don't even know if he's married anymore.

111
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,620
Or maybe he's been married three times.

112
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,070
But he's clearly someone that's in a very different segment.

113
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,370
So when you think about these three different groups of people, the three

114
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,890
segments that we've had fun with just making a nice characterization of 3

115
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,920
Series, 5 Series, and 7 Series, I could ask you,

116
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,460
what are the films doing with that segmentation?

117
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,370
Who is BMW targeting?

118
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,640
And I want you to pause for a second and think,

119
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,240
are they targeting the 7 Series people?

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,790
Or the 5 Series?

121
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,310
Or they're thinking about the 3 Series with these films?

122
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,430
And what's interesting to me, is most people figure out

123
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,090
pretty quickly that they really aren't targeting the 7 Series.

124
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,180
That those films are pretty graphic.

125
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,480
And I think it could be true to say that the company might

126
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,180
have been a little worried that all these very wealthy established people

127
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,170
would see something so gritty and so cutting edge at the time.

128
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,560
And so that's not who they're targeting, most people will say that.

129
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,720
And then when you get to the 5 Series, the same reaction.

130
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,210
We talked about how these films really aren't made for family hour.

131
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,710
And so that group of people probably wasn't the big target.

132
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,110
And so that leaves the 3 Series.

133
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,960
These young 30 to 40-year-old people, was that the target?

134
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,720
And often when I share this story, people actually argue a bit about that.

135
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,300
And they're not so sure, because while, sure,

136
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,730
maybe those people-- that's the wheelhouse that you want to target.

137
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,830
You know, what some people come to realize

138
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,930
is that even that group wasn't the true true target.

139
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,410
Because the true target from these films was actually

140
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,660
the people underneath the pyramid.

141
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,850
In other words, younger people that haven't bought a BMW.

142
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,790
Those 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.

143
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,670
Young kids at university or college, just starting out maybe,

144
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:18,850
even, that are forming their impressions on the brands, and the cars,

145
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,060
and the various things that they're going to buy a few years.

146
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:30,740
So for the marketer, there's something pretty cool here going on.

147
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,360
BMW released these films close to 15 years ago.

148
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,350
And what happened at that time is the internet

149
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,400
wasn't able to provide very quick download time.

150
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,210
And releasing these over the internet meant

151
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,100
you had to wait one, two hours for these videos to roll out.

152
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,460
They also made the registration process to get these videos very onerous, very

153
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,610
complex, kind of a pain in the butt.

154
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,870
And what they did by doing these types of things,

155
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,150
is it protected the segments for the 7 Series and the 5 Series,

156
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,420
and maybe even for the 3 Series.

157
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,800
Because if you're someone that's senior, or you have a family,

158
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,600
you don't have the time to be in front of the computer downloading.

159
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,179
You may not even have the knowledge on how to do it, back 15 or so years ago.

160
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,470
Who has the knowledge and who's into that type of thing

161
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,800
is that younger segment.

162
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,160
That's how they were accessing media, that's what

163
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
they were interested in at the time.

164
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,750
And so the true segmentation and targeting

165
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,640
here was able to zero in and hit a specific group of people

166
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,560
with these really, at the time, potentially cool films

167
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,470
for those segments, while protecting the people

168
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,180
that they didn't want to see the films.

169
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,970
Now, why would BMW do this?

170
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,930
Well, like most brands in the world today, there's a life cycle.

171
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,960
And we'll talk about this later in the course,

172
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,420
but here BMW wanted to make sure that they seeded the future.

173
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,920
That their brand, very popular, would continue

174
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,750
to be popular as the years went by.

175
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,320
And by exciting the people that were younger,

176
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,590
so that when they got to the age to want to buy a BMW,

177
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,650
they would be able to do so.

178
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,715
Now this is a very kind of fun interpretation

179
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:28,150
of what happened with the BMW films.

180
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,500
And it makes a strong point on this notion of segmentation.

181
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,480
That truly knowing who you're targeting with your marketing efforts,

182
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,020
whether it's your promotion work, or how you're distributing your product,

183
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,920
or the product itself, is important.

184
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,010
And Paul is going to come in now and talk a little bit about how

185
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,900
you can think about segmentation in a more analytic way,

186
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,940
so that you can make great decisions, just like this company.

187
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:03,185
