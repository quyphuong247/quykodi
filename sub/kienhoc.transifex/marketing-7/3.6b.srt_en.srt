PAUL CUBBON: I'd like to introduce you to another model that can really help

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,810
you with managing a product over time.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,180
It's known as the Product Life Cycle.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,550
And the Product Life Cycle model is sometimes short form as PLC.

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,160
And we're going to start with a simple axis, a horizontal axis that

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,190
represents time along the bottom.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,990
And then we're going to have four sections for this model.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,470
The first one is labeled the introductory stage, the second one,

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:45,770
the growth stage, the third one maturity, and then finally, decline.

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,420
And on the vertical axis, we're going to represent, first

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,120
of all, what does revenue look like through these stages.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,210
The revenue likely will start low.

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,010
We expect it to grow.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,660
And then in the maturity phase, it will level off.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,410
And then it will decline.

16
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,260
And we'll also look at what the profit might be like.

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,890
And of course, profit at the beginning is likely to be negative.

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,680
We'll see some growth of it.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,212
And then somewhere in this third phase, it

20
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:19,850
will start to decline, and then go down to a lower level.

21
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,040
So this is the basic construct of the Product Life Cycle.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,300
Why is it important?

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,880
Well, the decisions you make around your marketing mix, around what you

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,510
will do with regard to pricing, distribution channels, your marketing

25
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,429
communication, they're going to vary depending on the stage.

26
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,470
You're going to have to pull some of those levers

27
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,740
differently at the introductory stage or the growth stage

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,630
where you're building awareness, where you're

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,550
starting to get people to try you for the first time

30
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,850
versus at the maturity stage when maybe people know you.

31
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,560
You've got some reuse.

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,030
You've got some positive favorable word of mouth and referral, et cetera.

33
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,820
So we'll come back to some of those particular levers in later modules,

34
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,740
but the key point here is to see that over time, you

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,949
will want to vary what you do with your marketing program.

36
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:14,090
And the product life cycle is a good organizing framework.

37
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,080
Now before we leave this model, I want to point out

38
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
to you some tips and tricks.

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,420
Most models in marketing are fairly simple conceptually.

40
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,890
So they're easy to understand, but people often

41
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,360
don't use them fully to their advantage, because they maybe

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,870
take them over literally.

43
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,310
So just because the time elements here are drawn equally,

44
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,070
that's just a conceptual model.

45
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,110
It doesn't mean that you need to be constricted by that.

46
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,220
You don't have to assume that they'll be the same.

47
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,790
In fact, I would like to shrink time here.

48
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,910
And I would like to extend time to many years or decades

49
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,690
in this maturity phase, because I've got my profit to the higher level.

50
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,640
So you want to see this as a framework for understanding that you can then

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,040
customize for your own purposes.

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,990
And that's about how you play the game of marketing.

53
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,180
Something that can inform us quite nicely

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,030
is the paper from 2005 by an author called

55
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,610
Moon, who talked about breaking free from the product life cycle.

56
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,360
And the breaking free had a number of suggestions.

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,280
But one of them I particularly liked is this idea of before you

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,960
get to maturity to a decline phase, you actually

59
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,580
reinvigorate your product offering and go back into the growth phase.

60
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,540
So this might be an offering of new functionality

61
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,180
or some of the augmented element of the product.

62
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,545
So that's food for thought.

63
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:48,300
We'll provide you with some follow up suggestions and reading

64
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,380
to help you really dig down into that.

65
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:58,376
