Welcome back to the weekly course summaries. We are already at week five. And only one

1
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,930
more week to go. The last two weeks, Darren&#39;s been on deck, doing the wrap up, and it&#39;s

2
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,220
my turn. I&#39;m back to help take you through some of the things that we&#39;ve covered in this

3
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,850
last week. Some of the questions that have come up in the discussion forum, and to try

4
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,099
and give you some tips and tricks going forward.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,780
I got a couple of things I&#39;m going to pull to, the first one was an interesting dialogue

6
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:46,690
that was happening between participant DS, and a response from Carol C, and those are

7
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,989
the handles we have here, and this was a discussion around telling your customers stories as a

8
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:59,710
way of marketing your product. There was a nice dialgoue going on here and at one point

9
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:06,549
that I want to underscore is that if you do have happy customers, then capturing their

10
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:12,049
authentic voice, the authentic voice of the customer and getting some interesting hooks

11
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:17,840
or story in their words, not marketing speak, but really how they see their problems being

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,049
solved, why they appreciate your brand. That can be really powerful for you, and you can

13
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:28,369
use it as testimonials on your websites, you can use it in white papers or tradeshows,

14
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:35,149
or in full out advertising. It&#39;s a choice about the extent in which you use it, and

15
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:41,259
provides real credibility that you&#39;ve got somebody that&#39;s already really happy, and

16
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:46,929
the why and how they are happy with what it is that you have to offer that&#39;s unique. So,

17
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:52,060
nice shoutout there for DS20520, and Carol C.

18
00:01:52,060 --> 00:02:01,189
If I mov eon, there was also a nice discussion about pricing and about discounts, and I think

19
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:10,209
one of the comments made, and again, this was Joe Casbi and DS in discussion. There

20
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:17,219
was some rightful concern being made in the thread about repeated discounts getting an

21
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:23,129
impression that the product is not accepted in the market. I would go further to say,

22
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:30,079
the concern would be then that there are also perseptions of low value and even if I am

23
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:36,239
interested, I can wait for an inevitable discount. You see this happen in a number of categories,

24
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:44,849
and I would say, one category we see this in alot is breakfast cereals. You can go down

25
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:51,189
grocery aisles in anumber of countries and in any one week, there are several brands

26
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:58,359
on discount, and you know, it&#39;s non perishable, in the short term, and without revealing bran

27
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:04,280
dnames, I have a favorite brand that I buy on discount pretty much one week per month.

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,069
And I buy a months worth. I&#39;d actually pay the full price, it&#39;s my favorite cereal, but

29
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:18,219
they discount it by about 30% one week a month. And so, they&#39;ve left that money on the table.

30
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:27,540
And frankly, devalued the brand. So becareful about discounts, be very thoughtful about

31
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:38,540
how and when and indeed, why. The next topic I want to pick up on was raised

32
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:48,349
by June Chen, and this was in the context of the use of marketing or scientific explanations

33
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:54,659
and support for brand positioning, and the concern that might lead to a cult feeling

34
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:02,299
for the brand. And more so than just marketing or scientific knowledge but also, this idea

35
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:09,329
about whether we were dealing with negatives and things like safety or kind of the fact

36
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:18,250
that you don&#39;t have a problem with safety. My main thing here is, sell a positive outcome.

37
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:25,490
In this case, maybe it&#39;s a faster recovery, or benefits of improved eyeshight, and reassure

38
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,800
on the lack of negatives by all means, but don&#39;t make up a sole message or only lead

39
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,520
with that. That&#39;s a basic requirement. So look and try to sell a positive outcome primarily.

40
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:46,139
Skipping ahead, we had a really lively discussion on value propositions and brand positioning

41
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,830
statements around the Zara brand and there are a number of people here who started with

42
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:59,250
Ritchie, and then we had a response from OGK, and then from Pam, and shout out to all those

43
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,840
folks for getting into really good dialgoues. This is where you can really help each other,

44
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,650
and have some great value, and the discussion really was around not using the word &quot;affordable&quot;

45
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:20,030
and how that could cheap an image, and I think that Zara is a very interesting brand. For

46
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:28,550
sure they are talking about fashion trends and being attractive and appealing to a younger

47
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:37,039
buyer, but there is a broader, kind of underlying theme here, they actually rely on a degree

48
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,180
of scarcity for their product. Unlike many fashion brands, they don&#39;t have the same product

49
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:52,050
in store for three or six months, they rely on a freshness approach of creating limited

50
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:59,199
quantities of anything that they make, and then every few weeks if you go into the store,

51
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,289
you&#39;ll see that they have new products, a new inventory, compared to what they had before.

52
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:11,069
So this idea of scarcity, of freshness, at affordable prices is what they do.

53
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:15,440
Now they don&#39;t say &quot;it is affordable&quot; consumers can process that themselves, you know the

54
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,490
whole premise of a value proposition is that consumers are making that calculation. Is

55
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,699
this of good value to me, but what they are leading with is something which is about being

56
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:34,300
slightly edgy, slightly unique as Ritchie said. They do this in part by not allowing

57
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:42,169
the inventory to become old or stale. The inspiration for this was actually the fruit

58
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:47,949
and vegetable stores of the market towns in North Western Spain where the company was

59
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,310
founded. So, very interesting approach and nice discussion.

60
00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:00,319
I think if I just move down, there&#39;s lots and lots of good stuff here. I bring this

61
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,970
weekly session to a bit of a close. There was lots of great dialogue throughout, on

62
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,289
the different topics, and some good comments, and some good questions. And really importantly

63
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:19,810
good dialogue between different learners, and this is how you are testing and understanding

64
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:27,300
your thought process. So please, remember to help each other in this final week.

65
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,080
The last big discussion dialogue that I was reading as we reviewed the week, was on channels

66
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,220
and partners. I think the big thing here is that there are many many threads, is to remember

67
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,220
you have choices about distribution. Check the function being performed and the impact

68
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,419
on your revenue. Does it make sense to involve a greater variety of partners or would it

69
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:57,469
make sense to try to do things more directly. Follow the money and that will help answer

70
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:03,680
a lot of your questions here. We have a really interesting topic raised

71
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,539
by what looks like TodPladin, I think, and we&#39;re talking here about the role that marketing

72
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:19,629
communication. And, you know, there&#39;s some concern here about just using, SEO to push

73
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:26,219
people to the website, this looks like a business to business situation, using some trade shows,

74
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:33,580
that concerns about expense. The real thing I want to focus on here is a concern about

75
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:40,070
are we just raising awareness without generating sales. What I encourage you to do here is

76
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,350
to go back to one of the earlier sessions and think about conversion products. It links

77
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,240
in quite nicely to this coming week around measurements as well actually. What we are

78
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,320
really looking at is the differing role of marketing communications, and know that marketing

79
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,970
and sales functions at different stages of the conversion prospect. Clearly one needs

80
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:09,850
awareness before one can consider an alternative, maybe have some trials, and then make a sale.

81
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:19,300
With something like SEO, its merely an attempt to get some efficiency and reduction in cost

82
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:27,100
in terms of inbound marketing as opposed to the old view of a broader based expense paid

83
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,580
advertising. But once you&#39;ve identified a prospect, particularly in a more complex or

84
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,440
higher cost business to business ventures, you&#39;ve still got to then go thru the specific

85
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,290
steps of converting a prospect who is aware of you, to a sale. And it vary depending on

86
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,020
industry, but likely this is where you&#39;re getting into consultative selling, and it

87
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,500
should be your sales team that then is saying &quot;Fantastic, you&#39;ve got some more leads for

88
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,020
me, let me at them&quot; So, again, don&#39;t expect that any one aspect

89
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,900
of your marketing program, particularly of your marketing communications program, can

90
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,960
do everything you need in one go. So, good luck in the final week. We move on to social

91
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,640
media and to measuring systems. As you can see, I&#39;ve worn a new t-shirt which will inspire

92
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,670
you in this last week, my colorful peacock wishes you luck. Have at it!
