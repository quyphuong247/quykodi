PAUL CUBBON: Now that we've established the fundamentals of distribution

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,160
channels, I want you just to consider the fact

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,450
that it's less static and rigid than people often think.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,060
In fact, distribution channels can be really quite dynamic.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,060
Let's explore how this may work.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,870
We've used the term "intermediary" to reflect

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:37,180
one of the channel partners between a customer and the company.

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,600
And so if this is a channel partner, and if the company wanted

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,840
to go directly to the customer here, if we're going to go direct,

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,870
then the question is, is first of all do we actually consider

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,650
that we might remove the intermediary?

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,880
And this is actually a mouthful of a word

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,550
that people talk about being a dis-intermediary,

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,982
or dis-intermediating.

15
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:06,940
And all they're doing is saying, we're going to take out the middleman.

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,180
Why would we do that?

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,100
Well, an incentive is clear from our last situation.

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,920
There's $6 in every $10 that this customer's paying the could

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,490
come to us if we could get it directly.

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,740
So in many industries, there's been attention at play,

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,080
particularly in the last 15 or so years, between online channels and offline

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,850
channels in this regard.

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,390
So if we look at airlines for example, then

24
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,870
traditionally the intermediary was offline bricks-and-mortar travel

25
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,610
agents.

26
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,870
And a number of airlines really, going about 15, 17, 18 years ago,

27
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,200
they started to sell directly online off their own websites

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,190
to try to capture all of the money that the customer was paying.

29
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,560
But they had some limited success with that.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,470
Why?

31
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,460
Because consumers said, we don't want to go to 5 or 10 airline sites.

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,620
We would actually like to be able to check in one place.

33
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,540
And this actually lead to a re-intermediary,

34
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,570
which was someone like an Expedia coming in as an online travel agent

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,150
to fulfill this role.

36
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,050
And so for the most part, what you now have is something which is more complex

37
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,430
that offers more choices, both for companies and for customers.

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,140
We have multiple channels in play.

39
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,630
And the consumer has choices, and the company

40
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,800
has different revenue flows, and different levels of profitability

41
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,870
from different channels.

42
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,080
So what we end up with is, is we end up with a blended revenue

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,820
stream from different channels.

44
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,060
We also have a potential for conflict between our channels,

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,250
based on how the offerings are laid out.

46
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,390
But that's a topic for another time and for some follow-up reading.

47
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,130
If we pull this all together then, I want

48
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,660
you to kind of come back and consider that distribution and pricing are

49
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,350
significantly interlinked, that you have choices that will likely

50
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,440
get you involved over time in multiple channels

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,970
with different financial attractiveness, and you

52
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,200
will need to make some choices about the pros and cons linked

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,310
to the size of business that you want to have and how the blend of choices

54
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,200
plays out.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,325
