00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:07,690
DARREN DAHL: Well, we've reached the finish line.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,580
This is the 12th session that we're sharing with you.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,350
And Paul and I are both really excited.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,940
It's been a lot of fun.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,960
And we thought in the last lecture that we

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,900
would try to give you a few more case studies, have a little bit more

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,830
of a conversation, and hopefully inspire you to think about marketing

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,770
as you move beyond the course.

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,450
We want you to take the tools, the stories, what we've taught you,

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,200
and obviously use them in your daily life.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,170
But more importantly, we hope we've seeded in you the desire to learn more.

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,660
The case studies that I'm going to share with you-- I'm going to use three--

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,380
are going to draw a little bit on what we've learned before

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,930
and give you something that's happening right now,

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,890
questions in the marketplace today.

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,470
The first one deals with this notion of freemium.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,990
Now you remember back to the beginning, we talked about dynamic pricing.

19
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,990
When we talked about Radiohead, we talked about the name

20
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,040
your own price approach.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,300
Well, freemium is a third type of pricing strategy

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,740
that we've seen only in the last 10 years.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,110
And it's found a real home in the software industry and the gaming

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,070
industry.

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,230
Because in a freemium model, what you do as an organization is you

26
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,200
give the product, the base product, to the consumer for free.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,130
And they can play it.

28
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,140
They can use it.

29
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,250
They can do what they want with it.

30
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,800
But if they want to use the upgrade or use something different in the product,

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,370
they have to pay for it.

32
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,310
And so in a game, for example, you can play the base game,

33
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,980
but if you want to get the special weapon or the extra energy,

34
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,640
you pay money for that.

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,050
Is this going to be successful?

36
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,360
Well, it has been successful in gaming and in computers,

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,160
applications of software specifically.

38
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,570
But we don't know if it has applications in other industries.

39
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,772
We'll find out I'm sure.

40
00:01:54,772 --> 00:01:56,730
The second case that I wanted to share with you

41
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,270
dealt with brands and communication.

42
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,280
And you might remember back to the case study on Dove,

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,780
where we talked about how Dove moved from, in the '50s and '60s

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,280
and '70s, a very functional product to actually making a statement

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,690
towards society.

46
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,320
And that became part of its value proposition, very successful

47
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,860
for the organization.

48
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,510
Since then we've seen other companies do this.

49
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,440
But most recently, we've seen CEOs actually make statements and encourage

50
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,880
their organizations to express a specific point of view,

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,700
to have specific conversations about things that, frankly,

52
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,530
are unrelated to their business.

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,750
A good example is Howard Schultz at Starbucks.

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,250
He recently asked all of the baristas in the company

55
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,840
to talk about race and race relations in North America.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,980
That doesn't have a lot to do with coffee.

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,330
And there was a lot of push back actually

58
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,970
from individuals and organizations on is this the right thing to do.

59
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,200
My final case study deals with distribution.

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,150
And remember back to Amazon and how we talked

61
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,150
about how Amazon was so successful in building a distribution

62
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,710
network and model.

63
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,990
Well, they're at it again.

64
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,140
Who knew distribution could be so exciting?

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,190
But the notion of drones and drone delivery

66
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,680
is something that Amazon has truly embraced.

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,260
They've been testing drones to see if they can actually

68
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,180
deliver between the buildings and between the aircraft, if they

69
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,710
can fly through that zone and deliver products up to five pounds to customers

70
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,910
in a same-day service model.

71
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,660
This has been interesting and actually kind of scary.

72
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,390
The US government has said whoa to the testing.

73
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,470
And now Amazon is looking to test this system in other countries.

74
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,330
Each of these case studies represents something new and something interesting

75
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,290
in marketing.

76
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,620
In all cases, it hasn't quite been resolved how broad, how applicable,

77
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,710
how useful these new trends are going to be.

78
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,680
Paul and I are going to talk a little more now about marketing

79
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,090
and how this will fit with what we've already learned in the course.

80
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,488
