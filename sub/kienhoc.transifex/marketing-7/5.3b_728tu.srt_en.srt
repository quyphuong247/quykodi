PAUL CUBBON: So now we've established that there

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,120
are choices about going directly or indirectly to customers.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,860
I want to come back to a couple of fundamental questions.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,850
Who are the channel partners, the intermediaries?

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,920
What do they do?

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,440
And then why might you make a choice to go with one or more channel partners

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,630
versus going directly yourself?

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,690
So let's break this down.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,160
Who are they?

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,440
Well, you often know channel partners as retailers, a Safeway, a Walmart.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,590
You may know them as an online retailer like an Amazon.

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,130
Or in your own industry, there may be some other sort of middlemen.

13
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,260
So there's lots of different terms for this.

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,390
And you can have a look at the glossary that's

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,820
provided online to see what other synonyms might be used.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,500
So what roles do they undertake?

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,710
Well, the fundamental role is this one of access to customers.

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,600
My customers may be spread out around the town, the country, the world.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,320
And a retailer like a Safeway, they have built stores.

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,950
They've invested in that to distribute products close to where people live

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,420
and to provide people with lots of choices, not just from one company.

22
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,560
So that's the fundamental thing that they do.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,890
But in addition to this, what might they also do?

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,000
They might store products.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,030
And maybe they need to be stored particularly

26
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,630
in warm environments or dry environments or cold environments.

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:44,010
And they may indeed break them down into smaller bundles.

28
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,010
Or they may aggregate them up into a large bundles that consumers want.

29
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,150
And they may also provide training, installation, support with warranties,

30
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,640
returns, et cetera.

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,300
So understanding the what is important.

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,110
And then the next aspect I want to deal with before we

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,169
get to the why on choices is, what are the financial implications?

34
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,650
So we're going to follow the money in the channel.

35
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,300
This is often termed channel economics.

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,880
And channel economics plays out as follows.

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,710
We're going to take a really simple example.

38
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:32,560
What we're going to do is we're going to look at a customer that pays $10.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
This is at the customer end.

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,190
And the customer is paying $10 for an item.

41
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,780
So in the direct channel, which is represented here above the line,

42
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,000
then the customer is buying from the company directly.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,180
And as a result, the company gets all $10.

44
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,940
Fantastic.

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,480
Let's look below the line.

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,400
In the indirect channel, what we are going to do

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,760
is we're going to assume that there is a retailer that the customer is

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,640
buying from, like a Safeway.

49
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,060
And in this instance, the retailer is going to take 50% of the selling price.

50
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,591
The percentage will depend on your industry.

51
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,965
It will depend on your geography.

52
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:18,090
It will depend on you're negotiating power.

53
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,000
But this is not unusual.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,160
We're then actually going to have a second intermediary, a wholesaler.

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,930
And the wholesaler here is going to take 10%.

56
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,880
So that leaves us with 40%.

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,200
Or in this simple calculation, it leaves us with $4.

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,710
If we receive $4, we've got to be really clear when we set our selling

59
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,740
price that the $4 is sufficient to cover our cost of goods,

60
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,960
our selling and general administrative expenses,

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,770
and indeed any profit that we might be planning to have.

62
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,570
So as you can see, distribution choices, they

63
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:59,230
link very, very closely to what we covered earlier on around pricing.

64
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,276
Now, the last question, why?

65
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:08,800
Why would you choose to give up possibly 50%, 60%, or more,

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,010
of what the customer is willing to pay to a partner for distribution?

67
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,490
Well, it's because the partner is good at doing that.

68
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,250
And you're going to focus on what you do well.

69
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,430
So a company like Procter & Gamble, Tide laundry detergent,

70
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,710
they'll tend to sell through retailers and through wholesalers

71
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,120
and other intermediaries.

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,910
And they will work their business plan around this sort of amount of money

73
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,690
relative to the selling price, whereas there are some other companies-- let's

74
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,940
take Zara, the fashion retailer.

75
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,800
And they will tend to sell directly through their own stores.

76
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,170
And they will work on the basis of being able to capture that amount.

77
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,950
So these are choices that you have.

78
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,190
And more often than not, we see that use of channel partners

79
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,930
partially or completely is part of the marketing mix and decision process.

80
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:13,386
