1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,310
DARREN DAHL: So this week, Paul, we talked a bit about branding and a bit

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,330
about pricing.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,830
And I wanted to start off our debrief today by asking you a little bit more

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,490
about branding, mainly because my wife, actually,

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,980
she really loves brands, and some very specific brands.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,500
And frankly, one of her favorites is Starbucks.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,070
I could swear that she has a Starbucks tattoo.

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,040
She has just become consumed by always having her latte in the morning.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,190
And whenever we drive by a Starbucks, I think she makes note of where it is.

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,960
And I've been shocked at how consumed she gets with a brand.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,560
Now, why does that happen? why are brands so powerful for some consumers?

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,910
PAUL CUBBON: Hm, that's an interesting question.

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,367
And I think for many people, there are a handful

14
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,950
of brands that they really care about.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,191
I mean, is she proud to be seen with a Starbucks?

16
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:57,190
DARREN DAHL: I think so.

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:57,940
PAUL CUBBON: Yeah?

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,105
DARREN DAHL: It scares me.

19
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:01,980
PAUL CUBBON: It's a very interesting dynamic.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,780
Because as we know, sometimes if we were to give people

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,110
the same coffee in a plain cup, they may not

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,310
say they think they like it as much, et cetera.

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,680
And so what it plays to a little bit here

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,340
is the difference between that first level

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,570
that we talked about last week of a product, kind

26
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,770
of what the core product itself is, in this case kind

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,480
of a hot caffeinated beverage, and then kind

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,290
of what the overall levels of the brand are.

29
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,400
And so there's something more than the physical product that's at play here.

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,360
And it's playing to the sense of identity.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,310
An association for the individual with that brand

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,900
is really saying I'm part of that club.

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,480
I'm part of that tribe.

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,110
I affiliate with that brand, but not with another brand,

35
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,905
because I think it's cooler, because it's better quality,

36
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:58,280
it's more prestigious, et cetera.

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,940
And so this sense of consumer tribes is very powerful in understanding brands.

38
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,440
And people will tell you I would never be seen with that brand,

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,520
wearing it, drinking it, et cetera.

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,490
And yet at a purely practical point of view,

41
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,479
it may be really hard to differentiate.

42
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,270
DARREN DAHL: Oh, that's really interesting.

43
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,970
PAUL CUBBON: Yeah?

44
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,710
DARREN DAHL: And I think that's very true, actually.

45
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,751
PAUL CUBBON: You see it happen a lot in luxury brands and prestige brands

46
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:26,850
and fashion and so on.

47
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,630
And it's kind of part of people laying out

48
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,042
their social identity and who they are.

49
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:37,000
So there's all that marketers can do with this.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,030
And it's sometimes controversial.

51
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,020
But understanding it allows us at least the opportunity

52
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,130
then to decide how we want to operate as marketers.

53
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,230
DARREN DAHL: Yeah, that makes sense.

54
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,910
PAUL CUBBON: I wanted to switch to the pricing element.

55
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:59,000
And I covered off a number of tools on some of the fundamentals

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,460
about how people could deconstruct and kind of then

57
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,930
go about designing their pricing strategies.

58
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,420
But I've been looking forward to asking you

59
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,960
about this, because I know that you've done some research on pricing body

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,610
heuristics.

61
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,860
And I know that sounds a bit of a mouthful.

62
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,549
But it's a really interesting approach to considering

63
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:21,840
how one might go about pricing.

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
So I was wondering if you can just kind of share

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,640
with people watching a little bit about your research and your understanding

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,310
here.

67
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,990
DARREN DAHL: Sure.

68
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,140
Well, what's interesting about consumers-- people in general,

69
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,930
I guess-- is that we like to live our life often using little heuristics.

70
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,380
And what a heuristic is it's basically a simple rule of thumb.

71
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,890
And so rather than having to think about every decision

72
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,420
you make as you go shopping, for example,

73
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,790
you just follow these very simple rules.

74
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,470
And it becomes an easy task.

75
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,260
And one of the heuristics that's received extensive interest

76
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,550
and attention is this notion of the price-quality heuristic.

77
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,880
And the belief here is that if something is more expensive

78
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,710
or the price is higher than its comparators,

79
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,280
then it's obviously going to be better, that the manufacturer,

80
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,800
the retailer wouldn't price something higher unless there

81
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,370
was some value that was there.

82
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,744
Now, what's interesting is these heuristics, to be honest,

83
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:22,320
can be abused a bit by the manufacturer or by the retailer.

84
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,790
And so research has shown that if you had three products in the aisle,

85
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,800
and one was at $10, one was at $15, and one at $20, a lot of consumers

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,792
would gravitate towards that middle priced one.

87
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,750
Because they didn't want to pick the cheap one,

88
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,458
because it wouldn't be very good quality.

89
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,312
But they don't really need the $20 one, because they

90
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:41,520
don't need that high quality.

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,890
They need middle quality.

92
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,490
And so the $15 would be perfect.

93
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,120
But what's interesting is you can re-price those same products

94
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,710
at $15, $20, and $25, and people would gravitate towards, again,

95
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,550
the middle, that $20.

96
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,990
Because that represents a mid-level of quality.

97
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,480
PAUL CUBBON: So if I'm a company with one brand in a category,

98
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,540
are you saying that if I was to have three brands

99
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,700
and I was the price of one of them lower and one of them higher,

100
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,250
then I would expect to see that I could drive

101
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,130
a lot more volume in that middle category,

102
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,770
and maybe I could manipulate the pricing up?

103
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,120
I mean, what's to stop everybody just pushing pricing up

104
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,810
by having three price points?

105
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,310
DARREN DAHL: That's a great question, because certainly that

106
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,540
does happen a little bit.

107
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,100
But we have to remember that there's two factors that prevent

108
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,140
us seeing that every day, right?

109
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,420
One is competition.

110
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,510
Now, obviously if there's competitors in the marketplace,

111
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,960
and they see you playing this price-quality heuristic game,

112
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,390
that gives them an opportunity.

113
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,490
They can come in at a lower price point.

114
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,960
And you know, it really reinforces stability in the marketplace.

115
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,710
The second issue, which is to me a little bit more interesting,

116
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,040
is the notion of reference prices.

117
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,240
Because as consumers, we typically have a rough feel

118
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,460
for what things should cost.

119
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,740
PAUL CUBBON: That's another heuristic.

120
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,281
DARREN DAHL: It is another heuristic.

121
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:01,830
And you know, you could look at everything from what a can of Coke

122
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,670
should be-- and people would say, oh, it should be $1 to $2--

123
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,830
or what a liter of gas or a gallon of gas should be, right?

124
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,630
And they'd say, oh, it should be $2 to $3.

125
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,940
Or a plane ticket somewhere would be $400 to $500.

126
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,290
And so if things move outside of that reference price or that price zone,

127
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,790
consumers get a bit uncomfortable.

128
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,440
And that, to me, is why we don't see more of these pricing strategies

129
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,080
go to the extreme.

130
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,500
PAUL CUBBON: So that's interesting in a number of ways,

131
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,930
not just for the specifics of the content,

132
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,710
but the fact that we're starting to see the tie-in from some of the earlier

133
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,480
themes we covered.

134
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,880
So it was way back in week one we talked about competition

135
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,470
and the dynamic nature of marketing.

136
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,050
And here we've got the potential to that some marketers might

137
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,500
be trying to explore ways to push pricing

138
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,760
out using a heuristic on the pricing.

139
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,232
And then competitors might also be doing something to reign that in

140
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:03,690
or to constrain what could be done.

141
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,550
So we're bundling these things together quite nicely now.

142
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,550
DARREN DAHL: Absolutely.

143
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,841
PAUL CUBBON: Yeah, right, good.

144
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,630
I have actually a follow-up piece for you on the pricing.

145
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,625
I mean, we've used consumer examples here around heuristics.

146
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:20,260
Do you see use of heuristics in pricing used in a business-to-business setting?

147
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,390
DARREN DAHL: You do, probably not to the same extent,

148
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,060
but certainly even in a B2B context, you'll see heuristics pop up.

149
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,220
Because people that are behind these businesses are still people.

150
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,910
And we're always looking to simplify a negotiation or simplify a situation.

151
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,256
And so moving to simple rules of thumb in negotiations or in setting prices

152
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:43,880
will show up in those contexts as well.

153
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,460
PAUL CUBBON: So the way I've always seen this--

154
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,170
and I think that we're coming to kind of a nice agreement

155
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,760
on this- is that on the one hand, simplification is a human nature thing.

156
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,110
I might know that for this type of consulting,

157
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,260
I might expect to spend $1,000 to $2,000 a day, or whatever it might be.

158
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,150
But on the other hand, a business-to-business purchase

159
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,550
tends to be a bit more rational, a bit more objective.

160
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,380
You're working on behalf of an organization that is employing you.

161
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,727
And so maybe it doesn't get driven quite in the same way emotionally.

162
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:14,560
DARREN DAHL: Yeah, I think that's very true.

163
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,910
PAUL CUBBON: Yeah?

164
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,120
Good, great, thank you.

165
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,670
DARREN DAHL: Yeah.

166
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:24,755
