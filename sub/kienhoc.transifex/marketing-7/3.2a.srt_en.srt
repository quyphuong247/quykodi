00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:07,910
PAUL CUBBON: So Darren, a couple of modules

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,020
back when you were doing your Hershey and Mars story, talking

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,790
about chocolate, I really enjoyed that.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,060
It was a good story, but I was thinking you

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,330
were going to talk about how they used positioning

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,400
to compete against each other, because I know

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,110
you're a big believer in competitive positioning.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,860
DARREN DAHL: Yeah.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,359
I am.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,590
That's absolutely true.

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,714
PAUL CUBBON: So I was just wondering, do you have a story that could really

12
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:31,220
bring positioning to life?

13
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,740
DARREN DAHL: Well, to be honest, Paul, that story on chocolate,

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,600
it very much tells a positioning story.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,350
But I thought today that I'd, frankly, share something a little more

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,650
wild and crazy about positioning, and hopefully have some fun with it

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,560
and set you up so that you can share some good tools on how people

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,400
can both understand positioning better and think about how they can

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,560
use positioning in their workplace or in their companies

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,672
to do a much better job.

21
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:04,630
PAUL CUBBON: Fantastic.

22
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,180
Well, look.

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,490
I'm looking forward to seeing this, because we can then

24
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,624
use this to help layer over the segmentation, the targeting,

25
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:14,040
and the positioning, because they go together as a family.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,640
I'll just leave you with that thought.

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,960
DARREN DAHL: OK.

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,980
So there's always great companies that you

29
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,160
can bring to mind when you come to the topic of positioning.

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,190
So when you think about positioning, there's a million great stories.

31
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,320
In fact, one could argue that to be a successful company you actually

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,590
have to position effectively.

33
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,070
And if you don't, you're not going to exist for a very long.

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,950
One of my favorite stories though, on positioning,

35
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,690
deals with two companies that went back and forth.

36
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,910
Not a chocolate story, but a story actually about erectile dysfunction

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,220
of all things.

38
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,790
And as soon as I say the word erectile dysfunction,

39
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,520
you probably think of a company called Viagra.

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,660
The second company, which also is very effective in the marketplace,

41
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,380
is a company called Cialis.

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,020
And what I'd like to do in the story that I have to share with you,

43
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,590
is teach you a little bit in preparation for Paul

44
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,272
about what positioning is through these two companies.

45
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:18,230
And what I'd hope that you remember, and if you don't remember anything

46
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,650
else today specifically with the story, is

47
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,390
I'd love for you to remember this formula.

48
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:31,140
Positioning equals target segment plus differentiation.

49
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,150
Let me repeat that.

50
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,770
Positioning equals target segment plus differentiation.

51
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,690
In other words, you get a position in the marketplace when

52
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,060
you know who you're talking to, who you're going after,

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,530
who you want to buy your product.

54
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,470
And you show them how you're different, because people,

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,140
when they're buying products or buying services

56
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,660
or when businesses are doing the same, they

57
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,540
want to know that you're talking to them.

58
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,660
And they want to see why they should buy your product over the other product.

59
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,550
Now, when you think about these two companies that I started with,

60
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,980
Viagra and Cialis, what's interesting is Viagra didn't have any competitors.

61
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,220
And when they came to the market, they were the only one.

62
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,411
In 1998 they came to market with a product that they believed,

63
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:21,910
and I think many of us would believe, solved a real problem.

64
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,868
And that's this notion of erectile dysfunction.

65
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:27,860
When men get older, often they lose the ability to be intimate.

66
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,970
And by taking that little blue pill, which Viagra was,

67
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:37,200
they were able to reinvigorate their sex life, which obviously sold.

68
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,530
But what's interesting for Viagra is when they came to market,

69
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,780
they didn't have to beat a competitor.

70
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,570
What they had to beat was the stigma of a socially sensitive product, something

71
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,260
we talked about a couple classes ago, actually, because it's

72
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,302
an uncomfortable topic for many people.

73
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:56,260
When you go home and you're sitting around the table with your friends,

74
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,009
you don't talk about erectile dysfunction.

75
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:01,340
It just doesn't happen because it's sensitive.

76
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,660
And so what they wanted to do is when they came to the market,

77
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,780
they wanted to have a position that would make their products successful.

78
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,680
And so they were very careful in terms of who they chose to go after.

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,640
Obviously, they chose men as their target segment,

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,959
but their point of differentiation was framed around some

81
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,840
of the first spokespeople they chose.

82
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,660
And I'm not sure if you remember, but at the time,

83
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,536
Bob Dole was the person they chose to be their spokesperson when they first

84
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:32,410
launched the product.

85
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,580
And what's interesting about Bob Dole is he's not

86
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,870
the typical, at least in my mind, person I think about when I

87
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,290
think about Viagra because, who is he?

88
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,980
Well, he's obviously an older gentleman.

89
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,470
He was in his '70s, and he had fought in World War II.

90
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,780
And he had run for president a number of years

91
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,360
before becoming a spokesperson for the Republican Party, in fact.

92
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,680
And he's very, very conservative.

93
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,555
And so by choosing him it did a couple of things.

94
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,680
The first thing is it made it a legitimate product.

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,540
Instead of being a joke that you hear around the water cooler,

96
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,730
it actually was something that if Bob Dole was supporting this product,

97
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,400
it must be real.

98
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,030
So it made it legitimate as a product and reduced

99
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,840
some of the sensitivity that existed.

100
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,720
But more importantly, and this led to the subsequent spokespeople,

101
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,757
it established Viagra as a male product that was really about being a hero,

102
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:32,090
because that's who Bob Dole was.

103
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,710
He was a hero from the war.

104
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,250
He was someone that had been reasonably successful in politics,

105
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,660
and he's someone that people would say was a man.

106
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,810
And that's what Viagra wanted to position as, going after men

107
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,590
and returning you to your manhood.

108
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,970
You could be the hero again.

109
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,490
And when you think about that, that describes

110
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,340
the next couple of spokespeople they chose,

111
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,070
people like Mark Martin who was a very successful NASCAR driver.

112
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,600
And when you think of him, younger than Bob Dole, but still very much

113
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,534
a man's man and very much the hero.

114
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:13,575
Now, what's interesting about Viagra is it's obviously hugely successful.

115
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:16,490
It came to the marketplace, total domination

116
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,640
because it was the only product, but made

117
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,670
a lot of money for the company Pfizer that owned the brand.

118
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,110
In fact, the brand became so popular and so powerful

119
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,680
that it became, in essence, the whole product category.

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,990
So just like Kleenex or when you do a Xerox, it owned the category.

121
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,460
Viagra was the category.

122
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,005
And so the later entrants, companies like Cialis,

123
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:47,290
which came to the market four or five years later, what a, what a, whoa.

124
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,450
Imagine if you were running that company, because what you're facing

125
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,360
is the most dominant competitor that you can imagine.

126
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,310
It has 100% market share.

127
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,960
And so for Cialis, this formula that I shared with you, if I go back to it,

128
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,490
this notion of positioning equals target segment plus differentiation

129
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,730
becomes really important.

130
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,790
Why?

131
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,040
Well, they couldn't be the exact same thing as Viagra,

132
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,400
because why would consumers choose Cialis if I could already take Viagra?

133
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
And so they looked at their options.

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,530
And that's often what you do when you think about marketing strategy.

135
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,363
This is something Paul's going to talk about

136
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:24,240
is what you need to do is you think about well, who else

137
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,100
or how else can we think about the customer.

138
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,740
In the case of erectile dysfunction, you can

139
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,610
think about the medical doctor that is often

140
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,360
a gatekeeper to writing the prescriptions.

141
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,980
That could be a customer.

142
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,310
You can think about the men of course, like Viagra did,

143
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,170
but oftentimes there's other people to think about in that equation.

144
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,770
The female.

145
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,140
Or maybe you think about the female and male together as buying this product

146
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,720
and being the customer.

147
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,470
And so those are some of the things that they thought a little bit

148
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,780
about in terms of customer.

149
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,200
But in terms of differentiation, this is where they had to look at the product

150
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,800
and they said, hey, how are we different?

151
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,820
Well, there was some points of differentiation.

152
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,175
One, this medical drug was easier in terms of digestion.

153
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:08,970
It had a little bit better in terms of the health effects,

154
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,280
and perhaps most importantly, it had a longer window of opportunity,

155
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,320
if I can use that word.

156
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,220
Instead of Viagra, which was a four to six hours window, for Cialis

157
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:27,430
it actually was 24 to 30 hours that the product could be effective.

158
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,600
And that's really a big point of differentiation.

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,260
And so when you think about those points of differentiation

160
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,330
and these different choices on target segment,

161
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,030
they gave the brand Cialis a little bit to work with.

162
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,610
And what did they decide to do?

163
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,167
Well, it's kind of interesting because they had a lot of different choices.

164
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,000
And they didn't go with health or digestion.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,740
Instead, they went with that opportunity to have a bigger window of time.

166
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,940
Now, they could have framed that as a position of being super.

167
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,920
We're super Viagra.

168
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,100
We're Cialis.

169
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,600
[GRUNT]

170
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,010
Eight times the power.

171
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:09,630
They didn't, because the differentiation had to map to the target segment.

172
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,340
And when you think about that bigger window of opportunity

173
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,900
and a target segment of a couple, a man and a woman,

174
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,665
the position becomes romance because the point of differentiation

175
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:27,150
is you don't have to run to the bedroom.

176
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,560
You have the opportunity to be romantic and to bring the love back

177
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,260
to the relationship because of this bigger window of opportunity.

178
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,640
This point of differentiation.

179
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,930
And so it was very effective for Cialis to come to market and say, look.

180
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,650
Sure, Viagra.

181
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,150
Man.

182
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,650
Yeah.

183
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,370
[GRUNTS]

184
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,060
That's good.

185
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,430
But our product gives you romance back.

186
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,260
You can be a man over there, but we're going to give you the love back.

187
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,140
We're targeting the couple, and we're different because we give you

188
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,180
that window of romance to occur.

189
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,120
Now, both of these brands, these products, have been very successful

190
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,670
and have held market share.

191
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,950
They've made a ton of money for their shareholders and their host companies,

192
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,630
but only in the last number of years or last few years,

193
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,040
Cialis has gone ahead of Viagra in terms of market share.

194
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,100
And it's largely because they were so effective in terms of their positioning

195
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,630
when they came into the marketplace.

196
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:32,510
Now, obviously it sounds a lot easier in a story than it is in real life.

197
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,890
And so Paul is going to walk us through a couple things

198
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,110
to think about when we think about positioning

199
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,410
and what we need to be mindful of when we develop our own marketing strategy

200
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,815
and build our segmentation and our points of differentiation

201
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,970
so that we truly can effective.

202
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,070
Paul, over to you.

203
00:10:53,070 --> 00:11:00,305
