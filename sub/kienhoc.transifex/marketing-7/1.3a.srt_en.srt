00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,960
PAUL: So Darren's told you some really exciting stories

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,440
about some of the modern developments in marketing today.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,930
They are really fascinating.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,940
And sometimes it can confuse people.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,320
It can make marketing seem complex and hard to understand.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,650
After each set of stories, you're going to join me here in my lab,

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,630
and we're going to try to unpack what's going on.

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,690
And I'm going to take you back to some marketing fundamentals.

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,730
Well, you might say, that doesn't sound so exciting.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,980
That's a bit underwhelming.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,110
Can't I just stay with the new stuff?

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,900
But remember, this course is marketing for non-marketers,

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,390
and we're going to try to demystify some of the superficially changing things

14
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,430
and some of the particular stories by drilling down and getting a foundation.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,140
The foundational elements will allow you to understand

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,710
what's going on so you can then layer over

17
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,110
some of the newer tools, which we'll talk

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,040
about towards the end of each module.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,860
Let me try and persuade you how this works.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,370
One of the stories that Darren told you about was about Oreo's "Dunking

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,790
in the Dark" social media campaign.

22
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,210
And on the surface of it, the Oreo brand team--

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,620
They were commended for being able to do this remarkably fast campaign.

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,800
They reacted within minutes it seems of the lights going out

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,850
at the 2013 Super Bowl.

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,020
But do you really think that within two or three minutes,

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,950
they had done all of this work?

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,680
Were they brilliant and inspired?

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,240
Certainly there was something nice and creative about it,

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,570
but most of what was going on there was based around good planning

31
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,530
and use of good marketing fundamentals.

32
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,670
They understood their customer.

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,640
They understood the context of a live event.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,790
They understood their brand and the brand's positioning.

35
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,750
And they understood that they could pre-prepare a lot of the communication

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,860
to take advantage of possible opportunities

37
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,730
that may come along in real time.

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,139
So 90% of this was planned ahead of time.

39
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,490
And if you listen carefully, and maybe you

40
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,790
can play back this video later as you have

41
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,790
gone through some of the other modules, you'll

42
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,220
see that I've given you some of the titles of four or five

43
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,720
of the other topics we're going to cover in later modules,

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,460
because they play back into understanding

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,730
one of the stories like this.

46
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,930
So the takeaway of this little scenario here

47
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,760
really is to say, of course the exciting elements of marketing today

48
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,400
are things that we want to look at.

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,800
However, make sure to understand them, you look at the fundamentals,

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,650
so you've got a good grounding, and you're not just seduced

51
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,200
by the fast changing tactical plays.

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,728
