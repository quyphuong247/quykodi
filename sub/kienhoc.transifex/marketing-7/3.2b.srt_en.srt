00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:06,690


3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,780
PAUL: So with Darren's story around Cialis and Viagra,

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:17,840
he left us with this statement that positioning

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,780
is made up of two components.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:32,330
It equals a segment that we are deciding to target, and this is the who.

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,243
Plus differentiation.

8
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,110


9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,610
So the focus of what I'm going to do here

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,390
is to try to give you some unpacking, again, of your understanding of how

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,640
we go about building a positioning statement that fulfills these criteria.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,930
So in the last section that I covered, we looked at segmentation,

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,710
and that informed the targeting.

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,060
So now let's look at a differentiation.

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,480
So what are we going to do?

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,890
In the first instance, we ought to say differentiated against who?

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,140
Differentiated against your competitors?

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,030
Those that you see as your competitors, or the substitutes or alternative

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,040
choices that your customers might make to satisfy a similar job to the one

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,700
that you're trying to help them with.

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:32,620
So I want to go back to a couple of different acronyms for you here.

22
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,310
And again, don't worry about them, they will come to life.

23
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,880
And they actually become quite good hooks for you to remember things.

24
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,620
So what I want to do is I've got POP and POD there.

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,850
And what we're doing is, is we're talking about Points

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,600
of Parity and Points of Difference.

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,150
Why are we doing this?

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,100
We're doing this because very often within a company,

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,520
looking at a particular product or service, one of the things

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,490
that people do is they focus on the things that they do.

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,539
So they'll start with features, and they will then

32
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,390
lead these features into benefits, if they are doing a good job.

33
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,980
And the benefits are what customers care about.

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:25,350
The customer says, what's in it for me?

35
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,610
Another acronym, what's in it for me?

36
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,930
And that's the benefit.

37
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:36,500
The feature is the reason to believe the benefit statement.

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,850
Now, the starting point within an organization

39
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,700
is often to take the features and say, look at all the things we do.

40
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,660
We do this, and this, and this, and this.

41
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,290
The trouble with doing that is that when you get into a competitive situation,

42
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,940
we're often dealing with parity.

43
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,870
So what do we do?

44
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,070
How do we solve this?

45
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,780
We solve it as follows.

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,840
We lay out a simple little table like this,

47
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,140
and we lay it out somewhat similar.

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,820
This is us, and this is Competitor One, Competitor Two, et cetera.

49
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:20,090
And then what we do is we say, how do we perform on Criterion One, Criterion

50
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,640
Two, Criterion Three, et cetera, things that people care about,

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,080
that have benefits, that actually drive the choices in the category?

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,490
And what we say, we'll look at is we'll say, well,

53
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,970
although we do this particular function, so does them, and so do they,

54
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,670
and so do they.

55
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,520
And what we're trying to do is we're trying

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,940
to get to: What is the thing that we do differently?

57
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,970
What's our point of difference, versus our competitors?

58
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,050
In the end of the day, your points of parity,

59
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,070
they allow you to play the game.

60
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,300
And your points of difference, they allow

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,760
you to potentially win the game with a particular customer segment.
