well hello learners it&#39;s been a

1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,379
fantastic ride. We are at the end of six weeks and at the end of the course

2
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,990
marketing for non-marketers

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,040
and this is Paul here, talking to you from Vancouver

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,720
on a sunny day and Darren, well,

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,769
Darren is here virtually. Darren is traveling

6
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:28,619
and giving some talks on his research at the moment

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,580
but Darren&#39;s here in spirit and we talk pretty much every day

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,809
online and so know that this is a send-off from both

9
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,650
of us. I&#39;m gonna take him away now for now, bye Darren!

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,250
You&#39;ll see that I&#39;m wearing another fantastic shirt for you

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,199
I like to keep it mixed up and varied and

12
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,000
for those of you who were looking for inspiration

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,890
and maybe the art of shirts can help. So let&#39;s take it forward, we&#39;re at the end of the

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,570
course

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,220
and you&#39;re not going to see any major

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,809
new content or activity

17
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,000
going forward. So you&#39;ve got another week or so

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,100
till August the 4th to wrap up any final

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,460
assignments the you need to complete if you want

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,950
to get your certificate and we really encourage you to do that.

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,450
and we also encourage you to just check back in and make sure that

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,549
if any peers have commented on your

23
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,350
contributions that you are able to benefit from those, have a look at them

24
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,520
and again, if you haven&#39;t yet made your contributions to peers that you&#39;ve

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,990
been asked to do then please do that as soon as you possibly can.

26
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,359
You&#39;ll get benefit and you&#39;ll give benefit and to others

27
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,100
it&#39;s a win-win. So, a few kind of

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,670
points that I just want to bring up, I&#39;m just having a look at the notes

29
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,960
and, from the discussions of the last week

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,850
and so I&#39;m just going to pull up a couple of highlight ones, just to try and

31
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,359
wrap some things up for you. And first of all there is one from Jimteck

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,130
talking about tangible and intangible goods. And

33
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,950
he asks, which do you think would be more difficult to sell,

34
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,190
and why? Well generally, I would say the intangible goods are more difficult to

35
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,540
sell because

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,470
they have to be brought to life, they have to be made

37
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,790
real in people&#39;s minds and so

38
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,970
it&#39;s more of a challenge to the communicator to do that.

39
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,900
The only caveat, I would say is that

40
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,140
tangible goods often can be a

41
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,450
part of, and more commodity like category

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,340
and so you have to be careful that the differentiation, the

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,650
explanation of the story might be more challenging

44
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,850
and one of the things I would put to you is

45
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,100
if you can take the tangible and overlay the intangible

46
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,600
such as a product being wrapped around by a service

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,730
and then you might find that you&#39;ve got

48
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,590
a hybrid which gives you a baseline around which to communicate. That way

49
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,760
you can then stretch the story and differentiate, so nice question, thank you.

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,010
And, there was a nice thread

51
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,320
around brand, image, and culture on

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,420
and it was started by

53
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,430
Clamicus and continued by Gabriella

54
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,950
and Canada101 and a few other people.

55
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,730
Now the issue of culture that was described

56
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,400
there was a description of and a discussion at one point about

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,080
culture

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,690
for employee groups and the internal culture

59
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,270
and that&#39;s clearly important but I, I want to focus a little bit more about

60
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,140
the culture as felt and perceived by the customer. So the question was

61
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,510
what is the relationship between brand, image, and culture?

62
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,780
And Gabriella replied and talked about creating

63
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,340
a way of life and combining these to create a way of life

64
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,660
and about how people associate with the brand

65
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,530
to a status that they either achieve or that they want to achieve.

66
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,310
so this was a very nice response and I wanted to give a shout for that I mean

67
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,120
this idea of

68
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,810
belonging to a tribe or aspiration to belong to a tribe,

69
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,590
is very and much online here.

70
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,270
There was a bit more along the discussion

71
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,980
and I just wanna caution people a little bit because in an attempt

72
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,880
to try and maybe break this down into a

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,169
step-by-step approach, and that&#39;s often

74
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:38,560
something people attempted to do, and there was some language used such as,

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,570
you know brands are about what you tell your customer

76
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,110
images about what customers see, custom, culture is what you actually show the

77
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,720
customer

78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,300
and you know this is a good effort at trying to decode things and,

79
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,500
and unbundle things, but I would just be cautious

80
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,070
you know,we don&#39;t, we try not to tell customers things,

81
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:05,510
we&#39;re more trying to outline a story, to engage people so you know

82
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,320
we are not talking at people, and then,

83
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,590
and you know the idea of what you show the customer being culture. I&#39;d say the culture

84
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,139
is more

85
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,710
about what customers experience,

86
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,300
what they perceive, what they feel, and how they

87
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,060
then would articulate and describe it. And of course we&#39;re trying to set up the

88
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,350
conditions for something that we want to happen

89
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,160
and we&#39;re not, kind of, showing it directly necessarily

90
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,590
Once brands have become quite strong and established, and have a clear identity,

91
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,780
then in advertising and other communication we often see a reflection

92
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,550
of that culture, of the user community

93
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,720
and maybe, like with Harley Davidson for example,

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,400
but thats a slightly different things, not how you build the culture

95
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,060
necessarily.

96
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,479
So, nicely done, good work,

97
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,820
and I really enjoyed that, there were lots of things.

98
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,090
A couple of other examples maybe, I mean, I said we won&#39;t touch

99
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,160
briefly on the idea employee culture

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,530
and you know, companies like Body Shop, or Zappos

101
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,670
would be really good examples of

102
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,730
companies where the employees live and breathe

103
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,800
the culture, and you see it,

104
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,430
the service mentality. Maybe you see it with companies like WestJet as well

105
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,900
for those of you who&#39;ve flown Canadian

106
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,870
airline WestJet, you see the employees living and breathing

107
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,980
this service culture, which is part of this branding experience

108
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,490
and so the inside and the outside of the company have really seemed to be aligned.

109
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,950
And there was a nice

110
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,410
question from sHardman about

111
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,620
pricing, an art, and individually made funky

112
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,400
rubber boot dog sculptures. So if you did not read that

113
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,770
post, think what you were missing, you can jump on in and have a little look

114
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,960
and so on. And the question, and it was quite a thoughtful and longer post

115
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,460
about

116
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,310
exploring the different pricing

117
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,700
options that we had laid out in the

118
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,810
class content. And, kind of,

119
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,690
evaluating their appropriateness and for the rubber boot

120
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,780
dog sculptures. Ad so, very good to go through this and

121
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,020
try and assess what the fit would be. And

122
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,570
you concluded that you still unsure about how to go about the pricing

123
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,810
but you&#39;ve actually given some nice clues in your notes

124
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,710
that I think I can help build upon. First of all, you talked about

125
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,320
looking at other decor style items to get a sense of what was

126
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,060
charged and how it might vary by channel and the context in which they were

127
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,660
placed

128
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,480
and certainly comparison points for substitutes when you get into art

129
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,080
and other sorts of art substitutes would be

130
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,130
and really a good point for you and

131
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,570
one of the things I would consider here is, is given that you are talking about

132
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,650
individually made items, likely you&#39;ve got a

133
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,410
relatively low volume and therefore you can focus really on a tight niche and

134
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,720
willingness to pay, so I think this really is about skimming pricing

135
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,780
and, but what should the level be that you skim at?

136
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,510
Well run some tests, may be in pop-up stores or even in,

137
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,750
in craft markets where in one day you can test out that price

138
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,950
so that would be what I would suggest for you.

139
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,550
Moving on to social media

140
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,100
and there was a questions from Tiatia_eh

141
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,690
and she, I guess she,

142
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,800
this individual asked

143
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,480
is SEO considered as earned media or owned media?

144
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,100
And it&#39;s a good question and it&#39;s good that you are

145
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,530
pausing to think on that. I would say that is actually a hybrid is a

146
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,340
combination

147
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,250
it&#39;s often the earned media leveraging

148
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,570
owned media, and you should

149
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,150
also consider that there&#39;s the option to further accelerate or

150
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,260
make better impact out of all of this by

151
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,110
injecting some paid media there as well. And its,

152
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,470
and SEO could involve paid media, so you could actually be at the intersection of

153
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:09,770
all

154
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,920
three. And

155
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,260
we&#39;ve got a question comment from

156
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,400
and Climacus about how to use social media to get a clearer picture

157
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,690
of potential customer&#39;s needs and wants so that

158
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,970
your marketing story will get more effective and

159
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,290
you know how can you use social media for that. And I direct you back to

160
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,330
stage one of the model I took you through

161
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,580
in our online video, and this is the monitoring or listening phase.

162
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,960
And you&#39;re looking to find patterns and

163
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,130
in part you need to step back maybe and look at the category as a whole

164
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,200
and what are the interests in the language being used in that category

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,000
by potential customers. So the mistake that people sometimes make is they only

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,310
search for their brand name or they only search for the keywords related to their

167
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,420
brand and then they say

168
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,510
I didn&#39;t find anything, I didn&#39;t find anything new. So you have to step back and

169
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,340
look at the community as a whole or the non-customers

170
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,480
if they your potential customers and see what it is that interests them.

171
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,340
And you&#39;re trying to find the influences

172
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,490
and then maybe the unmet needs as well

173
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,440
in the category. There was maybe  a related

174
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,060
question that was asked by

175
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,090
Dykstra, and it was

176
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,000
unless you are Facebook or Twitter what are other examples of

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,160
owned media in the social media sense?

178
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,970
And I would say that this is where you have to look at where you&#39;re creating

179
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,890
content

180
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,840
that then may appear either on your website,

181
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,680
or be shared through other media

182
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,150
whether it&#39;s LinkedIn, whether it is an industry

183
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,540
or online discussion board, or a forum, whether it

184
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,580
is in Twitter and so, this is where again you have this

185
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,590
hybrid or combination affect.

186
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,540
And so its social media in that you are using social media

187
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,290
to share and to gain a reaching to gain credibility

188
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,230
but its owned in the context that you have

189
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,690
actually created it yourself. And often the home that it comes from and leave it

190
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,980
where it&#39;s pointing back to

191
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,810
is indeed something you control. And finally

192
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,220
I&#39;m going to talk about

193
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,850
measurement. And measurement was something which

194
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,060
challenged quite a lot of people I think,

195
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,200
and I understand that, and the,

196
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,530
and the task here really for you is to start

197
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,240
in a maybe, a simpler, or more basic level

198
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,640
in a conversion funnel which is maybe three or four steps and then build out

199
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,650
the detail

200
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,950
overtime. And a lot of people seem to be saying; well I don&#39;t know what the source

201
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,380
of my customer was.

202
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,540
So you&#39;re running to the bottom of the funnel conversion to,

203
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,850
to assail, to a client engagement

204
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,510
and you saying well I don&#39;t know how I got that person. So

205
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,110
in part what you have to do is, is you have to be able to map

206
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,950
your process and, of customer acquisition

207
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,130
and see what it is that you&#39;re measuring or could measure

208
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,960
at different stages and

209
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,220
then where does digital and social

210
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,410
media fit in. And it&#39;s going to fit in certain places

211
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,520
and it may require you also to

212
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,930
engage people in sharing some information with you along the way so

213
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,210
you&#39;ve got some of that data.

214
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,500
So definitely the measurement part is challenging

215
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,380
but I&#39;d encourage you to carry on with that.

216
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,790
Now, I&#39;m just going to see Darren&#39;s normally got plenty to say and he normally wants to

217
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,930
interrupt me, and I&#39;m going to see if he&#39;s not anything to say.

218
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,040
Good job Paul! Thanks Darren, that&#39;s really good of you. Alright,

219
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,070
well thanks, thanks a lot! And we really enjoyed having you alongfor the six

220
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,500
weeks

221
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,390
and the puppet master is signing off.

222
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,150
thanks and good luck with all of your marketing!
