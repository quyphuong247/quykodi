PAUL CUBBON: So I talked about some of the limitations or restrictions

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,820
available to you with pricing choices.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,690
But if you've done a good job of the earlier stages of your marketing

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,850
design, if you've got a higher point of difference,

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:28,940
if you are either re-segmenting a market or creating a new category,

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:36,610
then this gives you more choices around a number of things, including pricing.

8
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,880
So what will happen if you are entering in a new way with something novel,

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,840
then consumers have got less basis for comparing you with something else.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,600
And so you can set expectations around pricing,

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,820
and you can focus on their willingness to pay.

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,530
And what we want to do is we want to be really clear that this

13
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,209
is our focus on pricing and how we set pricing.

14
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:09,690
We don't want to do something known as cost plus.

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,280
What do we mean by cost plus?

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,790
Cost plus means, let's look at our internal costs,

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,850
add a desired profit margin, and then set the pricing like that.

18
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,350
Why wouldn't we do that?

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,270
A few reasons.

20
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,640
First of all, the price that we then might want to charge

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,760
might be far more than the willingness to pay.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,790
So we won't sell anything.

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,320
Or secondly, we might price it at less than the customer's willingness to pay,

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,110
and then we might leave some money on the table.

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,550
We could've charged more if we wanted to.

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,480
We should at least know that before we make some choices.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,240
So as we take this forward, then, assuming

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,530
we have something that's novel, something that's really differentiated,

29
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,630
where there is a higher willingness to pay on behalf of the customer,

30
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,300
how should we go about this?

31
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,400
We have a number of initial choices that we can make.

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,170
We can take what is termed a skimming approach.

33
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,020
Or we can take what is known as a penetration approach.

34
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,520
So let's just go into these in a little bit more detail.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
A skimming approach basically says that if this represents

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,880
here the potential market that we can target,

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,720
then initially we will do some micro-segmentation.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,390
We will skim at the top those people who are

39
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,140
willing to pay more money for our item.

40
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,439
So we often see this when there is something new that

41
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,480
has come into the market.

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,810
When Apple first launched the iPhone a number of years ago now,

43
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,810
it was $800 without contract to buy.

44
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,810
And there were certain people, early adopters,

45
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,030
who would go and pay that amount of money.

46
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,830
Clearly, the price has come down, and the pricing

47
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,480
is also now bundled into a service contract and so on and so on.

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,000
However, at the beginning, this is how they sold it.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,220
So you might do that if you've got some advantage over time.

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,340
You see it quite often-- it happened with prescription drugs,

51
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,150
where there is a patent in place.

52
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,920
And it allows there to be a skimming of the market

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,460
and are keeping the price up.

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,040
If you think that you're going to have competitors

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,860
that will respond very quickly, you don't have patent protection,

56
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,250
you don't have differentiation that you can hold onto really clearly,

57
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,360
then you may well go with penetration pricing.

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,820
What's penetration pricing?

59
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,790
It says of all of the people that we think

60
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,830
might reasonably buy from us over a period of time,

61
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,640
we know that if we price it lower down here,

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,360
then those customers will all buy from us initially.

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,540
And then it means that our competitors will not get that sale.

64
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,600
So if the cycle time on a second purchase in the category

65
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,810
is months or years, you may want to do this to preclude

66
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,420
your competitors from coming in.

67
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,630
And indeed, sometimes you might even signal ahead of the launch

68
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,460
that you are going to go at a pricing like this to put competitors off.

69
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,400
So you need to know what you would be giving up in terms

70
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
of higher pricing for a subsegment.

71
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,120
And you also need to know that you can make things at a low enough cost

72
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,269
that you would still make an acceptable price.

73
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,339
So these are some choices for you about how you might go about pricing.

74
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,450
It's not always about taking the maximum available.

75
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,455
You may want to be able to take a larger overall market

76
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:30,250
and be more successful competitively.

77
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,950
And this would be a strategic rather than tactical approach

78
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,080
to setting your pricing.

79
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,730
