00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:07,920
DARREN DAHL: Today we're going to talk about integrated marketing

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,100
communications or IMC.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,760
And to be honest, this is one of my favorite lectures

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,520
because it deals with what we often think

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,260
about when we think about marketing.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,520
And that's the notion of advertising and promotion and publicity.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,650
Now when you think of communication, you often

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,820
think of the companies that are really good at this.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,800
Companies like Nike.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,950
I often think of companies that you maybe don't think are so good.

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,420
Maybe United Airlines or Citibank.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,370
And so hopefully today what you'll get from this lecture

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,110
is the ability to say, well, that's a good communication campaign,

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,100
and that's maybe more challenged communication campaign.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,560
And Paul's going to share with you some tools so that you

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,500
can think about communication and how can it

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,950
effectively help your organization.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,800
The case study today is Dove.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,410
And this is a brand that many of us know because when we think

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,410
of Dove, right away we think of soap.

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,660
And what's interesting is that's not the way the company, Unilever, initially

22
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,330
marketed this product.

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,100
In fact, this brand started in 1957.

24
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,300
And it wasn't a soap.

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,040
It was actually a beauty bar.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,520
And that's the way the company communicated it to the consumer.

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,110
It wanted to differentiate itself from the other soaps on the market.

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,740
And so it told consumers that this was a different product.

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,910
It had cream in it, and so instead of just cleansing and cleaning you,

30
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,910
it would actually help your beauty.

31
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,050
It would smooth your skin.

32
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,280
In fact, some of the early ads used to say over and over it'll

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,500
smooth, smooth, smooth your skin.

34
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,540
And it even said it that way.

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:47,070
And so Dove really positioned itself differently than other soaps.

36
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,400
And it was successful.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,550
It targeted itself mainly to women.

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:56,670
And for 10, 20, 30, almost 40 years, it used the same communication,

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,610
pushing the functional benefits of the product.

40
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,700
But like most advertising campaigns, over time consumers got a bit tired.

41
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,430
And the value proposition of a cleansing bar that really beautified

42
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,370
started to get a little old.

43
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,060
And so at the turn of the century, the executives

44
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,420
at Unilever that were basically in charge of this brand

45
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,570
said, hey, maybe we need to change.

46
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,670
They had done some market research.

47
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,620
And they had found that women, specifically women in America,

48
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,940
didn't see themselves as beautiful.

49
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,900
That only 2% of women when asked would say, yeah, I am beautiful.

50
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,800
And that became the inspiration for a truly revolutionary shift for Dove.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,850
It decided at that point that rather than

52
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,330
being just a functional benefit brand that it would stand for something more.

53
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,370
It would give a value proposition to consumers that

54
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,350
went beyond just cleansing the skin.

55
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,670
It would stand for beauty and it would help women,

56
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,200
the target, feel better about themselves, feel more beautiful.

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,530
To do this, they did a long campaign.

58
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,250
And we've seen some of these commercials, some of these ads

59
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,380
over the last 10 years.

60
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,790
They started with a campaign that was very simple.

61
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,400
It was just a billboard.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,600
And on it was a picture of a woman, but not a supermodel.

63
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,830
Just a regular person.

64
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,400
And it asked consumers to tick the box.

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,340
And that's what it became known, as a tick box commercial.

66
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,180
And consumers would be able to call in and tick on whether this individual was

67
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,860
outsized or outstanding.

68
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,040
At first the outsized box was called in more,

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,930
but eventually the outstanding box was.

70
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,390
And this was exciting for the brand because it made a statement.

71
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,830
It said, look.

72
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,150
This person that isn't your regular supermodel can be outstanding.

73
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,260
And so the company followed this up with a second campaign, this time

74
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,600
a print ad campaign that featured a number of oversized models

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,980
in their underwear.

76
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,510
And this got a lot of media attention because it was just different.

77
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,350
And consumers at first we're like, is that right?

78
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,870
Is that wrong?

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,650
But it caught attention and communicated what the brand was trying to say.

80
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,990
The third campaign was a 2006 Superbowl commercial

81
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,280
called "Little Girls," where the company again reinforced the message.

82
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,440
And what I'd like you to do now is pause this video and click on the link

83
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,260
and take a look at this ad.

84
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,070
And think about the theme that the company is pursuing here.

85
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,380


86
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,180
Now that you've had a chance to watch that ad, what did you think?

87
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,430
It featured young girls, a bit of a change from the previous campaign.

88
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,270
These girls were only 11 years old.

89
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,550
Many of them were the kids, actually, of the company executives.

90
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,910
And they talked about, as you can see in the ad, how they felt unattractive

91
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,750
already even at that young age.

92
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,980
So here Dove was reinforcing the notion of beauty

93
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,830
and how our society shapes what is beautiful and what is not.

94
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,610
The campaign continued with an ad on the internet.

95
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,460
This one was called Evolution.

96
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,080
And here the company shifted again to a new type of approach.

97
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,630
Again, I want you to pause this video and click on the link

98
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,950
and watch Evolution.

99
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,450
Go ahead.

100
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,810


101
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,060
So in this ad what you saw was how the ad industry actually

102
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,770
manipulates images.

103
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:40,220
A regular photograph taken and then changed through digital techniques

104
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,540
to create something more beautiful, or at least what our society thinks

105
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,910
is more beautiful.

106
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,150
By providing a look behind the curtain, Dove

107
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,390
is showing us how the industry manipulates this notion of beauty.

108
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,270
The next ad I'd like you to look at, if you're still with me on these fun ads,

109
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,750
is called Onslaught.

110
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,830
And this ad was released in the UK.

111
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,210
And it goes back to the theme again of how the beauty

112
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,710
industry is talking to young kids.

113
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,840
So take a look at this one.

114
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,300
Pause the video and then click on the link here.

115
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,309


116
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:14,600
What did you think of that one?

117
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,620
Whew.

118
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,350
That one had a lot of graphic images and it went very fast.

119
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,300
Again, reinforcing the theme.

120
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,960
This ad specifically created a bit of dialogue, a bit of controversy.

121
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,120
Some asked if Dove had gone too far.

122
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,430
What do you think?

123
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,230
The final ad that I want to share with you is called Sketch Artist.

124
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,860
And this one is the most recent of the battery that we've looked at today.

125
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,970
Take a look at this one.

126
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,450
Again, pause the video and click on the link.

127
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,530


128
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,880
Here you can see that Dove has gone back to the theme of beauty

129
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,670
in a real central way, again showing how consumers-- women-- look at themselves

130
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,440
differently than the rest of society.

131
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,000
And this is, in some ways, exactly what Dove

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,980
is trying to say thought all of its communication.

133
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,590
They're trying to qualify what beauty is and challenge

134
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,700
the norms that society, and the cosmetic industry maybe, have created around us.

135
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,390
There's a couple of big takeaways here for us.

136
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,520
First off, of course-- Dove, hugely successful.

137
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,780
$1.2 billion in terms of growth.

138
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,660
Can we attribute that all to these campaigns?

139
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,730
No.

140
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,300
But we know that it has enforced and strengthened the brand.

141
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,445
In terms of the integrated nature of this campaign,

142
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:39,580
Dove used billboards, used print ads, used a Superbowl commercial,

143
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,520
and used viral videos.

144
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,100
Lots of different ways and mechanisms to reach the consumer.

145
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,380
Interestingly, they also used workshops to help build self-esteem

146
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,860
among women throughout the country.

147
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,620
This is true integration, the ability to marry lots of different approaches

148
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,930
in communicating an overall message.

149
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,680
The last big takeaway is that Dove really did something revolutionary.

150
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,450
They took a typical norm and they flipped it on its head.

151
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,630
While beauty up until then had truly been the supermodel

152
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,730
and had been for years-- the Cindy Crawford,

153
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,190
the Elle MacPhersons of the world-- Dove said, wait a second.

154
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,990
We can say something different and make that a value proposition.

155
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,450
Pretty cool.

156
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,030
That's the power of communication.

157
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,040
That's the power of advertising, promotion, publicity.

158
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,230
Now Paul's going to talk a little bit more about some of the things

159
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,650
that we can think about when it comes to communication

160
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,200
and give you some tools, things like the AIDA model

161
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,637
that we can apply and use in our understanding of how

162
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:43,720
to be more effective here.

163
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,070
[MUSIC PLAYING]

164
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,139
