PAUL CUBBON: We're now going to talk about one

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,780
of my favorite parts of marketing.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,570
It's got a bit of a mouthful of a name.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:21,850
It goes by the following long hand of integrated marketing communications.

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:28,510
And integrated marketing communications covers a range of subtopics.

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,040
It's often short formed as IMC.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,930
And there's a very deliberate reason that that longer form is now used.

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,940
Why?

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,390
Because previously it was either known as promotion,

10
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,130
and people therefore misunderstood it as just being sales promotion,

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,640
or sometimes people made the mistake of just thinking

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,370
that we were dealing with advertising.

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,450
And again, integrated marketing communication

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,500
is a lot more than advertising.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,170
So what's involved in marketing communications?

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,880
Marketing communications can include public relations.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,930
It can include, of course, advertising that we've talked about.

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,600
But it might include white papers that support your sales

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,880
team when they are going out on a call.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,730
It might involve the material at a trade show.

21
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:23,980
And it might involve the in-store materials and merchandising, the trial

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,790
support.

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,820
It might include search engine optimization.

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,760
A bit more about that later.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:36,240
Your website, blogs, email, et cetera.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,540
So you can see there's a long list of potential marketing communication tools

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,230
that are at your disposal.

28
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,800
And then this element here, integrated.

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,880
Why so?

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,830
Because if you just design each of these individually,

31
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,924
then you're potentially losing the opportunity for synergy.

32
00:01:57,924 --> 00:01:59,840
Indeed, they could be fighting with each other

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,870
and confusing your potential customer.

34
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,370
And so you want to consider which of these

35
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,990
are appropriate for your particular marketing communication objectives.

36
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,490
And then what combination you will use them in,

37
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,980
how they will work synergistically.

38
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,790
So you can consider this really as a menu of opportunities

39
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:28,200
that you can then combine, weight accordingly, and pull the levers so

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,840
that you achieve your desired outcomes.

41
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,560
So we've laid out a menu of marketing communication choices.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,300
But what I said to you is that the combination you choose

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,070
and how you pull the levers, what effort you put in, time and money into what

44
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:53,151
combination, will depend on what your marketing communication objectives are.

45
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:55,910
Your marketing communication objectives.

46
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,360
And so you might say, well, how am I going to decide on this?

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,280
Well, remember.

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,030
We've worked out who our customer segment is that we're going to target.

49
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,180
We've worked out what the positioning is and the value proposition of our brand

50
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,280
and how we're going to differ from our competitors.

51
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,030
We've already laid out our channel choices and our pricing.

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,890
And so now we're going to pull it together with how we communicate that.

53
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,471
And we're going to get back to some fairly fundamental consumer psychology

54
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:25,970
here.

55
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,610
And there is a well-established model that you may be familiar with.

56
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,570
And it simply goes by the short form of AIDA.

57
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,850
And so what are we dealing with here?

58
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,150
We're dealing with, at the top, awareness.

59
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,960
So is the customer, the potential customer here,

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,640
is the customer aware of our brand?

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,870
They may be already buying in the category.

62
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,660
But are they aware that we exist?

63
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,630
So this is a kind of a yes or no type decision.

64
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,000
And so we have to use marketing communication tools there.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,710
The next is, have we generated within them

66
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,120
an interest for our brand to solve a particular problem

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,970
or need that they have?

68
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,750
Then, have they gone from a general interest to a desire or a preference?

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,890
This is a prepurchase state.

70
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,410
And then finally, have we prompted an action

71
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,720
which typically is trial or purchase?

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,900
And then we'd also be interested in what happens

73
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,680
in their post-purchase behavior.

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,160
Do they retain and re-buy, et cetera, et cetera?

75
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
But we'll stay with these four elements for now

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,640
because the marketing communication objectives

77
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,040
will vary depending on where our customer

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,560
segment is in this particular model.

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,100
And then we will make choices about what combinations of marketing communication

80
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,320
tools that we use.

81
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,100
Now something to overlay on this is whether we are

82
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,140
going to use push or pull approaches.

83
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:14,090
And this is often referred to as outbound and inbound marketing.

84
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,860
So what do we mean when we are going through these terms?

85
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,440
Well, push, or outbound, marketing communication

86
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,510
tends to refer to things which are typified by traditional paid

87
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,380
advertising, like television, print, where

88
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:37,210
we are pushing our message out to a large group of potential customers

89
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,960
and then expecting a reaction.

90
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,290
The inbound, or pull, marketing tends to be

91
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:50,070
more of a stimulated approach, which we will use often,

92
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,950
direct mail, online email lists.

93
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,800
We will be trying to get people to let us know that they're interested.

94
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,300
And we can develop a relationship that way.

95
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,230
So it's not about right or wrong, although one sounds maybe

96
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,370
a little bit more traditional and one a little bit more contemporary.

97
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,700
It's often about using a combination of the two,

98
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,060
depending on the stages that you are at in this framework.

99
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:23,402
