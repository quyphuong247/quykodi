PAUL CUBBON: So that was a really interesting story

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,170
that Darren told us about Zappos.

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,360
But delivering happiness, how do we actually make sense of that?

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,085
What's going on from a marketing point of view with the product, shoes,

5
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:23,240
and Zappos delivering happiness.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,510
Let's try to untangle this here and now.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,420
We're going to use a simple but well established model.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,480
It's a series of concentric circles, five in total.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,089
And what we're really looking at is levels of product.

10
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:41,880
And we're just going to walk through these.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,590
And we'll just label them one through five

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,780
to give us some sense of what we're playing with.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,370
So at the very core, item one, we're dealing

14
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,560
with the fundamentals of what the product is in the context of what job

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,150
the customer needs to get done.

16
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:05,300
So in this sense, with shoes, it's some protection for the feet.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,510
The second level is the generic level.

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,860
Everybody offers the same sort of thing.

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,090
It's really the commodity that is footwear.

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,020
So core and generic, they sometimes seem to merge together.

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,380
We then get into the third level-- the third circle--

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,880
which is the expected offering.

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,820
And in the shoe category what would we have as an expected offering,

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,330
well, we would have style, and color, and comfort, and so on.

25
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,210
I'm then going to come down to my fourth level.

26
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,870
And this is where things start to get interesting

27
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,880
and where you might start to detect the Zappos story coming through.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,080
This is where we start to get things like service, or in other categories,

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,610
warranties, maybe installation, et cetera-- so beyond the physical product

30
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,590
or the base service itself.

31
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,170
So Zappos, in delivering happiness, they would say we're leveraging on shoes

32
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,509
and we're augmenting the offering.

33
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,300
This sets us up nicely for what we're going

34
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,100
to be doing later on when we get into branding.

35
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,320
And then finally, our fifth category, we'll turn the potential product--

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,210
this is how could we further differentiate and add value

37
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,620
for a potential customer by doing new things to the product.

38
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,370
So when we talk about an augmented product, in the context of Zappos,

39
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,260
we're dealing with more than shoes.

40
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,440
And this is how we try to make sense of this proposition delivering happiness.

41
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,250
So the entirety of the product that I now actually want

42
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,050
to switch from product to brand.

43
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,960
It's not a slip.

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,990
It's not an accident.

45
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,960
It's very deliberate.

46
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,070
We start with a product, and it's commodity-like.

47
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,280
We're now going to differentiate it.

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,170
And in differentiating, it starts to stand for something.

49
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,550
It's not just shoes, which you can order online.

50
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,040
It's shoes from Zappos.

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,120
And Zappos stands for something.

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,990
And that differentiated value proposition

53
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,880
comes from understanding how to augment the product.

54
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,270
And this is really the lead and connection

55
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,409
between starting with a product, connecting it to a value proposition.

56
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,200
And then what we're going to be doing later

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,690
on as we get into branding and ultimately into marketing

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,240
communication.

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:40,194
