DARREN DAHL: Today we're going to talk about distribution,

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,160
arguably one of the most important aspects of the marketing mix.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,110
Why?

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,690
Well, it's because distribution is how the products get from the company

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,650
to the actual consumer.

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,990
And if that didn't happen, we wouldn't have marketing.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,370
When you think about distribution, think about yourself.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,150
How do you buy products?

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,840
You may go to the grocery store.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,049
Maybe you go to a department store.

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,610
Maybe you hit up a specialty retailer that's

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,380
carrying your favorite line item.

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,490
Or maybe you go to a garage sale.

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,750
These are all ways that products come to us,

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,170
the way the distribution channel works.

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,470
But perhaps the most revolutionary form of distribution that we now

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,310
use almost every day is the internet.

19
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,880
And that's where I'd like to base my story because the internet has

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,705
been a true disruptor to distribution.

21
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:06,010
And it has changed the way that we think about how products get to consumers.

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,760
The case study that I want to focus on is Amazon.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,160
And this is a brand that most of us know.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,110
Why?

25
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,350
It's huge.

26
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,150
Amazon is in a number of countries around the world.

27
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,420
It's truly changed the way that consumers get products.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,220
And it's not that old.

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,580
It started in 1994 with an idea that Jeff Bezos had, the founder.

30
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,730
He thought, there's something new on the horizon.

31
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,510
This internet thing could be really important

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,910
when it comes to selling products to consumers.

33
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,000
And maybe there's something I can do here

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,390
that would be really cool as a new business model.

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,710
What he did was he made a list of 20 different types of products

36
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,570
that perhaps he could sell on the internet,

37
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,450
use the internet as that distribution mechanism.

38
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,970
He narrowed that list down to five-- computers, computer software, videos,

39
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,750
compact discs, and books.

40
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,810
And it was this last one, books, that he chose.

41
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,550
Why?

42
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,720
He saw an opportunity here.

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,830
Because while most grocery stores or small little retailers

44
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,680
could only stock 20 or 30 titles, on the internet

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,340
he could have a warehouse of thousands of titles

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,360
and then sell to consumers whatever their need.

47
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,210
This might remind you of this idea of the long tail, something

48
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,590
that we talked about in one of the first lectures.

49
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,720
This is what Jeff Bezos saw for Amazon-- the ability

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,600
to warehouse a lot of goods in one location

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,510
and then distribute it around the world as the orders came in.

52
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,200
Now interestingly, Amazon didn't have a fast business model.

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,600
In fact, their idea was that they would take almost five years

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,010
to come to profitability, a very slow approach in an internet era that

55
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,760
was all based on hype and excitement.

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,630
In fact, when the internet bubble crashed in 2000,

57
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,720
Amazon was one of the only organizations that was ready and survived.

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,460
Their business model was very well established.

59
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,250
At the heart of the model is the way that Amazon

60
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,630
gets the products to the consumers.

61
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,700
And they use big distribution centers, huge warehouses, thousands

62
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,880
and thousands and thousands of square feet.

63
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,950
And they locate these distribution centers--

64
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,900
there's 145 now around the world-- in locations that

65
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,560
enable them to basically touch anyone.

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,900
What's interesting to you is that these locations, at least initially,

67
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,080
were not based on geography.

68
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,280
So while it makes sense to put a distribution center in California

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,860
or one close to New York, they actually chose distribution centers

70
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,840
with a different competitive advantage in mind.

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,470
Because initially, retail sales on the internet

72
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,070
were not subject to retail taxation, at least in most states here

73
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,300
in the United States.

74
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,560
And so what they did was they chose distribution center locations

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,660
that avoided that extra cost of tax to the consumer.

76
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,640
And that became a competitive advantage, one that they actually

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,770
leveraged for many years because they were

78
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,290
able to sell their products at a lower price than some

79
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,630
of the retail competitors.

80
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,019
This resulted in great profits and a lot of customer loyalty

81
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,779
to the Amazon brand.

82
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:24,910
Only recently has Amazon changed this approach

83
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,360
because taxation law has started to change.

84
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,730
And the organization has pivoted to trying

85
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:36,210
to build these distribution centers, centers where orders come in,

86
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,530
orders are filled, and then orders are sent out

87
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,620
to much closer to these large consumer populations.

88
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,380
Because now instead of the taxation benefit,

89
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,390
what we're interested in as an organization is finding benefits

90
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,260
to the consumers in terms of the speed with which they receive the product.

91
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,560
In other words, Amazon hopes to move to same day delivery.

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,430
If they can do that, that potentially will be a new competitive advantage

93
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,470
for the organization.

94
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,940
What can we learn from this story about Amazon?

95
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,890
Well, foremost is how distribution is so important to the consumer.

96
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,390
How you get your product, the product that you want, is critical.

97
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,390
Can it be used as a competitive weapon in business?

98
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,550
Amazon shows us that it can with respect to pricing and with respect

99
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,910
to the speed that you, the consumer, gets that product.

100
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,510
I'm gonna let Paul unpack this notion of distribution and distribution strategy

101
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,460
a little more.

102
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,660
Paul, over to you.
