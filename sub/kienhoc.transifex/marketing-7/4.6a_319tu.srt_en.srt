PAUL CUBBON: Today, we're going to talk about pricing.

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,130
And pricing is a really good way to start

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,720
to see how a number of our different topics come together.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,720
People often get confused about how to address the topic of pricing.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,420
The starting point, really, is to look at who our customer is

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,000
and their point of view.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,920
Do they consider us to have a differentiated value proposition?

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,960
Do we have a real point of difference?

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,160
Or are we quite similar to everybody else?

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,510
If we've got a real point of difference, it

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,100
will typically come out in our brand and our extended offering.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,561
And if we don't, then they will see us being quite similar to our competitors.

13
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:57,060
If

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,480
You are entering a crowded marketplace or you

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,090
are a part of a crowded marketplace, where there are many competitors who

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,850
appear to be similar in the mind and judgment of customers,

17
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,340
then it can be really useful for you to do some research

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,260
and look at comparables on pricing.

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,610
I'm not saying that you should set your pricing just

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,270
based on what your competitor is doing.

21
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:29,240
I'm just saying that the customer's tolerance for variance from the norms

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,890
will be lower.

23
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,010
We often talk about this as pricing sensitivity.

24
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,870
And so pricing sensitivity is really suggesting

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,920
that, if you bring your price up a little bit

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,040
and there are lots of comparable offerings in the marketplace,

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,110
then likely what you would see is you would see your volume decline quite

28
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,540
quickly.

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,660
And so that's where there is high pricing sensitivity.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,500
And conversely, if there is low pricing sensitivity,

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,740
you could actually put your pricing up.

32
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,360
But you wouldn't see a decline in volume.

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,120
So this is one of the things that you can test out.

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,890
And testing pricing sensitivity alongside doing some secondary research

35
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,410
can really help you to understand what your degrees of freedom might be.

36
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:27,754
