1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,040
DARREN: So Paul, really enjoyed some of the discussion

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,960
this week that you brought to the table, specifically on the tools, actually.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,220
And I wanted to ask you, to me, these are classic tools.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,140
And we've been teaching them for well over a decade.

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,110
So I wonder how applicable are they to today's businesses, today's business

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:29,910
problems?

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,410
PAUL: I think it's a great question.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,910
People often want to have something new as a tool.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,370
And when I look at a business like Uber, for example, to make sense of it,

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,510
I want to make sure that I don't get carried away

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,610
by the flashy, the new, the fact that it's an online business.

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,600
And so what I really think is that going back to fundamentals

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,990
can really, really help.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,990
I want to actually understand who the customer might be,

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,320
and who the competitors are.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
I want to look at internal and external factors.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,860
So I actually think they're really, really applicable.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,350
It's just that people are often not very disciplined,

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,630
and they get distracted because of the novelty.

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,710
DARREN: I think that's a fair point.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,690
I'd ask you, though, do they apply to all types of businesses?

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,685
Because I think most of the examples that I often give,

23
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:23,850
and I think you do as well, is in the business to consumer market.

24
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,830
Because those are the products and the brands that we know.

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,330
But do these types of tools have application in a B2B world,

26
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,990
or when you're selling business to business?

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,660
PAUL: Yeah, no, obviously context changes things a bit.

28
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,580
But the fundamental starting points-- and I think that's the thing,

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,610
is it's a starting point to be able to have these same frameworks

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,417
and approaches.

31
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:51,750
And then you're going to customize based on the context.

32
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,550
And just like you would in other industries in a consumer market,

33
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,427
but certainly in a business to business market, some of the factors

34
00:01:58,427 --> 00:01:59,260
are going to change.

35
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,450
But the basic tools are a great place to start.

36
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,800
And then you can build out from there.

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,689
DARREN: OK.

38
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:07,480
PAUL: I've actually got a question for you.

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,800
Because I was up drawing out the tools, and trying

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,450
to explain some of these basic tools, and I know a few times people in class

41
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,225
will say to me, you draw a lot of simple diagrams-- two by two grids,

42
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:27,170
or three overlapping circles.

43
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,180
Can't you marketers get any more advanced than that?

44
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,850
And occasionally, I joke I'll do a three by three grid to get really excitable.

45
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,600
DARREN: Get crazy?

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,641
PAUL: Yeah, really crazy.

47
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,770
And so I mean, what's your take on-- why do

48
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,890
you think so many of the tools which have survived the test of time--

49
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,670
why are they so simple on the surface?

50
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,410
DARREN: Well, to be honest-- and again, good question.

51
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,760
And that's one I've heard before as well.

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,960
It's interesting that the simple ones, the two by two's or the three circles

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,570
that overlap, these are the ones that people tend to use.

54
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,220
And my belief is that's for basically two reasons.

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,190
One is, they're simple.

56
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,410
And you know, there's that classic acronym, KISS-- K-I-S-S--

57
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,060
keep it simple, stupid.

58
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,720
That's because most people want a tool that's easily approachable,

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,840
that they can understand, and that they can use in almost any context.

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,710
And that's what these tools provide, is they're just a two by two, four boxes.

61
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,360
You can easily understand what they're trying to do.

62
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,730
And you can work with them.

63
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,560
And for most people, that's comfortable.

64
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,310
The second reason that I think they're very powerful

65
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,860
is they enable the whole issue that you're studying to be visual.

66
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,460
In other words, you put it up on the board,

67
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,730
and people can see very quickly what it is you're talking about,

68
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,200
what the issue is, what you're concerned about, where the company needs to go.

69
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,540
And so, by making them so visual and so easy to understand,

70
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,730
you can convince people.

71
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,880
And you can make your arguments much easier.

72
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,330
And I find that they can be very effective, both when

73
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,660
you're talking to your employees, and also

74
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,910
when you're talking to your senior manager-- that you can move up

75
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,680
or you can move down with these tools.

76
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,180
Because people can understand them.

77
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,120
They can see them.

78
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,702
And frankly, they can get excited about them.

79
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:10,910
PAUL: That makes sense to me.

80
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:17,820
I think the visualization of concepts, kind of de-constructing them like that,

81
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,320
can be really exciting.

82
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,480
So we've kind of come to a point where, although we

83
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,730
seemed to challenge each other a little earlier on in this week's work,

84
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,220
we seem like we've got more in common about our approaches

85
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,057
than maybe was apparent at the beginning.

86
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,890
DARREN: And that's disturbing at some level.

87
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,790
So maybe we'll work on that next week.

88
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,410
PAUL: OK.

89
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,260
DARREN: Thanks, Paul.

90
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:51,851
