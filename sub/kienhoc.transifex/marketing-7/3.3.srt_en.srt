PAUL CUBBON: So now that you understand points

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,520
of parity and points of difference relative to your competitors

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,610
for a particular customer segment, we are now

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,530
able to build a brand positioning statement.

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:24,650
A brand positioning statement is a fundamental planning tool

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,700
for marketers.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,250
And although it sounds like quite a long term,

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,130
it's often short form as a BPS, brand positioning statement.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,630
And so what are we doing with a brand positioning statement?

10
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:44,810
We're saying that for a particular target audience-- customer

11
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:57,811
segment that we're targeting-- who have a particular kind of problem or need,

12
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:17,040
we provide X, Y, Z unlike competitors A, B, and C.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,990
And of course, these are the people that we compared ourselves against

14
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,840
if you recall momentarily ago when we had our little grid where we're

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,700
looking at ourselves as competitors and points of parity

16
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,880
and points of difference.

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,620
So the purpose of what we've been doing here

18
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,140
is to write down the concept into its constituent parts,

19
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,710
allow you to see how to work through them,

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,340
and then to be able to put them back together again.

21
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,450
Now there are variations on this brand positioning statement construct.

22
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,480
And you can find many different versions around.

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,190
This is a simplified version.

24
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,160
And it certainly is helpful for you.

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,500
And what you'll find is that often the brand positioning statement

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,340
is written almost long form to make sure the there is clarity about it

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,660
for internal planning purposes.

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:14,740
And then this often gets shortened into a value proposition, a VP,

29
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:21,790
and used in shorter form communication, including maybe with analysts,

30
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,240
external audiences, et cetera.

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,440
A value proposition is not an advertising tagline,

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,440
but what it is a shortened form of a brand positioning statement.

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,490
Why do I tell you this?

34
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,323
Because you may find as you're talking with colleagues, particularly

35
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,380
marketing specialists, that they use both of these terms.

36
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,990
And the different organizations will treat them slightly differently,

37
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,480
but if you can see the construct that we're building a brand positioning

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,960
statement in this sort of way, and then we're

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,350
going to shorten it for efficiency of communication, then that will help you.

40
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,840
A final tip for you is that trying to write the value proposition by itself--

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,890
this is how we are different from everybody else-- it is hard to do

42
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,600
if you don't follow this process.

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,170
So strong advice, unpack, go through the steps,

44
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,740
and then put back together again.

45
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:20,086
