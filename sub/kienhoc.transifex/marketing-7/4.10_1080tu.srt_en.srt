00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,110
Hey Team, it's great to be with you this week,
I'm on the road this week, actually travelling

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:17,39
out of the country this week, and so, I'm
talking to you here in a hotel lobby. Had

3
00:00:17,39 --> 00:00:21,539
a chance to take a look at the discussion
board this week, and I was pretty impressed,

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,730
pretty excited about a lot of the discussion
on pricing and branding. I think people got

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,660
really involved, and I was happy to see some
responses to the assignments. If you haven't

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,828
got involved yet, you know it's still a great
opportunity to comment on some of the questions,

7
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:43,539
and some of the comments that other people
are posting. It's been an active discussion

8
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:49,670
board and we would love to see more of your
involved. I saw a couple things on the board

9
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,510
that I thought were interesting and would
like to talk a bit about. Three things actually

10
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,50
stuck out to me and I thought I'd comment
on each.

11
00:00:57,50 --> 00:01:02,318
The first one, was a discussion, and I noticed
comments from both, Richie and Carol, that

12
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:08,920
talked a bit about the first to market theory
and whether being first to market always meant

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,920
that you would have an advantage. Both these
individuals had great comments here. What

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,390
I would add is that, the literature indicates
that being first to market can be advantageous

15
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,430
but also being second to market, in some situations,
can be advantageous. Often it comes down to

16
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,90
what the first mover does, if the first mover,
you know, makes mistakes, doesn't have a very

17
00:01:32,90 --> 00:01:37,289
great product, misses the value proposition,
then that creates an opportunity for the second

18
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:42,229
mover. And often, the second mover can learn
from the mistakes, and if they have a better

19
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:48,149
product, or produce a different type of value
proposition that resonates better with consumers,

20
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,579
sometimes they are going to be in a better
situation. So really, you can see evidence

21
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,109
of both, first and second movers, winning
the competitive battle. Now the example of

22
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:03,649
Apple was raised. And Apple is interesting
because, you know, first mover in some ways,

23
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:08,310
but also very much a second mover. The technology
that underlies some of Apple's products, so

24
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,40
for example, iPod and iPad, was actually developed
in products that came to market before Apple.

25
00:02:14,40 --> 00:02:19,260
But what Apple was able to do was, frankly
design the products better. Obviously, a company

26
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:27,130
that's very well known for design, and bring
a product that resonated much stronger. It

27
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,750
was just a better fit, a better value proposition
for consumers. And so, it's just a nice example

28
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,610
of a company that has won at being both first
and second mover.

29
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,360
The second question that I would talk a little
bit about, that I saw and thought was interesting

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,240
was the notion of multilevel marketing. One
of the participants asked about MLM, Multilevel

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,850
marketing and if that was a good distribution
strategy. And obviously, you know MLM, when

32
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:00,290
you think of this type of distribution, you
typically think of companies like Amway, Avon,

33
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:08,130
or Tupperware, have used it. What this does
is it creates a pyramid, where at the top

34
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:14,609
you have one individual, this person recruits
sales people to sell, and those sales people

35
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,590
recruit sales people underneath them, and
then the people underneath them are recruited

36
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,370
as sales people. So what you get is a multilevel
of sales people, and that's why it's called

37
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,890
multilevel marketing. Now the problem, or
a problem, that can exist with these MLM systems

38
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,309
is if they develop into a pyramid scheme,
which is actually illegal. You know, the US,

39
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,910
as one government, has some strong feelings
about MLM, and you can be prosecuted if you

40
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:51,350
develop into a pyramid scheme like this. But,
MLM, per say, is not necessarily illegal how

41
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,519
it's setup and the resulting dollars that
go back to the individuals, that's where there

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:05,80
is an issue. And one of the biggest issues
that you can think about is, are the incentives

43
00:04:05,80 --> 00:04:11,430
for recruiting people to sell, are those actually
bigger than the incentives to actually sell

44
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:18,478
the product. If that is the case, then you
probably got a problematic system. And so,

45
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,400
when you think about MLM, you know there's
a lot of things to be careful about. They

46
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,380
tend to have a bad reputation, and so, if
your product is focusing on building a strong

47
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,520
brand, then perhaps that may not be the best
distribution system for your pursue. The question

48
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,419
was raised on perfume specifically. If you
are trying to build a perfume brand that is

49
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,480
strong and prestigious, the MLM approach might
not be the best fit, but on the other hand,

50
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,690
if you want it to be more of a product like
Avon, or Amway, something like that, this

51
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:59,340
maybe a reasonable fit and something to pursue.
Now the last question dealt with the notion

52
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,469
of brands and how image and culture relate
to brands, and you know, what I would convey

53
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,280
is that, obviously the images associated with
your company are going to build and strengthen

54
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,270
the brand that you have. So if you're a company
like Abercrombie & FItch, and you have images

55
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,990
of attractive male and female models, and
images of the outdoors, for example, people

56
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,260
will see all of these images and start to
link them, and add them to their impression

57
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,900
of what your brand is. So the images that
you see out there, very much become the brand.

58
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,200
And culture can be the same way, if you have
an organizational culture, people that work

59
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,260
at your organization have a very specific
attitude, for example, you know that's going

60
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,70
to start to link to your brand as well. The
brand truly is all the bits and pieces, the

61
00:05:49,70 --> 00:05:53,680
way the consumers come in contact with you,
that's what the brand becomes. And so the

62
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,340
company culture, the images associated, will
become the brand. So those were some of the

63
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,580
things that i thought were quite interesting
this week. So thanks so much for this week,

64
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,560
I look forward to seeing what you bring to
the table next week, week 5. Paul and I will

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,230
be excited to answer any questions that you
might post online, and we hope you enjoy the

66
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,90
content in the fifth week. We look forward
to the home stretch in the course, we have

67
00:06:19,90 --> 00:06:23,299
a couple weeks left, and thank you for your
participation. Look forward to talking to

68
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,749
