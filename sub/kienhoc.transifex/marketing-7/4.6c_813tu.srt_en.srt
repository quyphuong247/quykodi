PAUL CUBBON: I'd like to give you some further insight into some

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,850
of the choices you can make.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,300
Again, at the strategic level around pricing.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,020
We'll get to tactics later.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,860
So here are some of the things I want you to consider.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:25,490
First of all, the idea of setting your pricing in a tiered manner.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,300
What do we mean by that?

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,220
Well, a tiered manner might mean that you're

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,980
doing a high, medium, and low pricing.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,440
What does that actually look like?

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,570
Well, sometimes with that we actually see this term freemium that has been

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,580
popularized.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,870
And what we're doing really here is we're taking the word free and premium,

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,300
and hybridizing it.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,110
And what we're really saying is that we've got a hybridized pricing model.

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,900
And so low may actually be under here, it may be free.

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,040
And if you were to take a company like Hootsuite,

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:09,190
then Hootsuite they clearly offer some of their product for free.

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,560
They have a low monthly subscription fee.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,310
They then have an ability to plug-in to medium pricing with extra add-ons.

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,110
And finally, the high pricing is the custom pricing

23
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,940
for their enterprise clients.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,740
And so this idea of tiered pricing means that you can actually

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,720
segment your offerings, and match the right products and services and pricing

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,330
level, to particular segments that you are deciding to target.

27
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,050
So again we're playing back to some of these earlier themes.

28
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,195
You don't necessarily want to offer one product at one price

29
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:47,550
to all of your different customers.

30
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,510
And so other companies that do this?

31
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,040
We'll think about mobile gaming apps.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,390
You often have something which is free to start with, here.

33
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,830
And then you will have maybe a secondary level uprising here, maybe

34
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,830
with some menus of additional virtual products that you can buy.

35
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,910
And we also see with things like LinkedIn, which many of you

36
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,112
should be familiar with.

37
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:13,570
If you ask yourself, or your colleagues around your office,

38
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,350
you'll find that most people go for the free version.

39
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,440
But there are others that are paying, and then you

40
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,150
have to start looking at other pricing and revenue

41
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,930
streams for different customer types in a category like that.

42
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,370
It gets a little bit more complicated.

43
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,830
So that's tiered pricing, one level that we're going to look at.

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,220
The second one I want you to consider is dynamic pricing.

45
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,880
And dynamic pricing-- if you recall, when

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,870
Darren talked to you about the Coke vending machine

47
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,220
experiment where they change the pricing with the temperature outside-- then

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,310
this was an experiment in changing pricing to changing conditions.

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,380
So the first one, the tiered pricing, was really changing the pricing

50
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,320
based on the product and service changing to match the customer segment.

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,920
Here we've got the same customer, the same product,

52
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,860
but we are actually changing it for another factor.

53
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,940
So that would be something we might do, time of day,

54
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,950
nearer to time of event, et cetera.

55
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,350
And this leads us into our next one, which is something

56
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,530
called pricing discrimination.

57
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,980
Now this doesn't sound very nice, because discrimination

58
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,110
is a loaded word.

59
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,970
But pricing discrimination is indeed, in most categories in most jurisdictions,

60
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,710
legal if done in certain ways.

61
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,030
And what it means is we're discriminating

62
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,330
against certain customers based on their willingness to pay.

63
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,380
And so you might say, well I don't believe that.

64
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,590
Where would that happen.

65
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,260
Think about the last time you flew on a plane, or booked into a hotel,

66
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,590
and what do you find.

67
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,760
The person next to you paid more or less than you.

68
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,240
Not because they got a different seat, but because they

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,750
showed a different willingness to pay at the time of purchase.

70
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,960
So this then leads us into the topics of whether you

71
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,010
are going to be transparent, or whether you are

72
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,000
going to be opaque with your pricing.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,600
So clearly what you have is you move towards discriminatory pricing,

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,700
is you get away from transparency, and towards more opaque offerings.

75
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,930
So what's happening there?

76
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,070
Well the business is trying to make it harder for customers

77
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,500
to compare pricing offerings.

78
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,820
And so they are going to do it by giving you limited access to information

79
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,470
and data where they're able to.

80
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,970
And we sometimes see this kind of played out in bundled pricing.

81
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,630
And that is where people bundle different products, or products

82
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,900
and services together.

83
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,790
And so the unbundling of them would be needed

84
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,680
to make direct comparisons with what other competitors are offering,

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,160
or what indeed we are offering to other customers.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,680
So we generally dealt here with transactional pricing,

87
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,580
which is a simpler level of pricing then when we get into long term,

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,700
or recurring, contracts.

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,980
We haven't dealt with pricing directly in multi-sided markets,

90
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,260
but for an introductory level these themes

91
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,410
will help you advance your understanding a long way.

92
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,760
MUSIC PLAYING

93
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,703
