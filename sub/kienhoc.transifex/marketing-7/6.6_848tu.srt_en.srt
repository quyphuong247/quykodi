PAUL CUBBON: So it's time to bring everything together.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,250
You can see that marketing is fast-changing.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,730
Its full of interesting examples.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,990
And as we've gone through the various topics,

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,570
we've gone through everything from market research and competition,

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,210
to segmentation, targeting, positioning, product branding and value

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,270
proposition, pricing, distribution, marketing communication, social media.

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,330
You might say interesting, but what do I do with it all?

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,510
You've had that as topics.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,470
You've had a series of stories.

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,250
And then you've also had a series of tools that connect to those stories

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,940
to try to explain them.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,800
What I want to do here is I want you to just is consider the following.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,300
I want you to consider, first of all, starting here,

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,500
what are your marketing objectives?

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,540


19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,500
Are you trying to launch a new product?

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,800
Are you trying to enter a new country?

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,550
Are you trying to win over customers from a competitor

22
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,960
and get them to switch to yourself?

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,890
Are you trying to get existing customers to spend more with you?

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,410
This is your starting point.

25
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,980
And this is where you will do your strategic analysis.

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,980
And many of the tools that we've taken you through would help you better

27
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,850
understand the landscape, where you exist at the moment.

28
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,150
And as non- marketers, you ought to feel comfortable to ask questions

29
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,090
in this context of your colleagues in marketing about why things as they

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,760
are, what their intentions are, et cetera.

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,680
If you don't understand the marketing objectives at play,

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,220
then it's very difficult to engage in the rest of the conversation.

33
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,880
And so from this we can then actually go through, and having done our analysis,

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,050
we can then start to work out what our marketing strategies are going to be.

35
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,450
And our marketing strategies are going to play out

36
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,530
through choices around which customer segment we're going to target,

37
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,770
how we're going to position ourselves.

38
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,030
These are not unchanging.

39
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,500
But they shouldn't be changing on a frequent and radical basis.

40
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,820
We're setting them out.

41
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:23,200
And then we are going to go through to implementation or tactics that

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,830
allow our strategies to actually unfold and have impact.

43
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,350
And so we talked in a number of the different topics,

44
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,750
pricing would be a good example.

45
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,220
We talked about the difference between the strategy

46
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,950
that we set and then the tactics that let it play out.

47
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,760
But the thing we haven't talked about yet,

48
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,370
and which really brings this into kind of completion as a circle, is metrics.

49
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,660
How do we assess whether we're achieving our objectives?

50
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,940
Do our strategies and the tactics which inform them, do we actually

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,600
achieve that?

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,860
And so going into marketing metrics, it's another whole course in itself.

53
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,630
But let's give you kind of a taster and some initial feel for it.

54
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,440
So first of all, on the financial side, clearly we

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,620
could deal with things like revenue.

56
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,510
We could deal with things like the margins that we make at various levels.

57
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,380
We can also look at things-- and I'm going

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,590
to go through some acronyms for you here.

59
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,740
We'll expand upon them in the glossary to the side.

60
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,520
But cost of customer acquisition, how much

61
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,710
does it cost you to acquire a customer?

62
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,560
What's the customer lifetime value?

63
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,400
From here, what's our retention or churn rate on a customer?

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,520
These are all the types of things that you

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,360
might want to understand in your industry

66
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,900
and ask of your marketing department so you can better

67
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,690
understand the strategies at play.

68
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,750
And so we go down some of the financial elements.

69
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,680
And maybe on more of a attitudinal level, we might look at

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,410
are people aware that we exist?

71
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,100
Do they have a liking or a preference for us?

72
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,630
And you might find out if your organization actually

73
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,770
subscribes and uses something like a net promoter score.

74
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,850
NPS is predicated on a question, which is would you recommend

75
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,890
this brand to your friends or family?

76
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,520
And it's on a 11-point scale.

77
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,495
And again, we'll provide some follow up reading for you on that

78
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:26,370
if you're interested.

79
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,850
So we've got financial and quantitative data over here.

80
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,520
And then we can play out more with attitudinal data, which can also

81
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,570
be quantified in parallel to it.

82
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,350
So to pull this all together, what you might do

83
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,080
is you might come back to something like this,

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,810
that looks like a conversion funnel.

85
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,780
And some of you may be aware of things like this

86
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,050
if you're using things like Google Analytics.

87
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,070
And what we're doing really is is we're going

88
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,770
from the top, an awareness of the brand, right

89
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,530
through to a conversion and sales.

90
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,090
And then here, this is actually our feedback loop.

91
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,300
And it's a positive feedback loop over here on repurchase and positive word

92
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,350
of mouth or a negative feedback here, whereby again,

93
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,890
a negative word of mouth.

94
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,220
So this ties together our measurements from an overall point of view

95
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,400
and also shows you how the feedback loop works both at an individual customer

96
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,780
level and how they influence others.
