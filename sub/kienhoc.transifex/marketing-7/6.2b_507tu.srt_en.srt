PAUL CUBBON: So far, Darren has had a lot of fun telling you

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,820
stories that bring marketing to life.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,290
Now, it's my turn.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,460
I want to tell you a story about Dave Carroll, a professional musician, who

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,710
was flying from Halifax, Nova Scotia, in Canada, to Omaha, Nebraska.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,560
And he changed planes in Chicago.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,280
And as he changed planes, he got onto a United Airlines plane,

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:36,330
and he saw the baggage handlers throwing his guitar around on the runway.

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,320
And it got damaged.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,940
And so when he arrived, he complained.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,890
And he asked for some recompense.

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,780
And he wasn't treated well by the staff.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,390
He, basically, was not given good service.

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,850
Now, this was in 2008.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,950
It was the early days of social media.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,490
He wasn't trying to harness social media to complain,

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,780
but the following year, 2009-- really just out

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,940
of frustration-- he decided to make a video to explain his frustration.

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,460
And this video, called United Breaks Guitars,

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,960
to everyone's surprise-- including his own--

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,810
garnered five million views in the first month.

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,090
At the same time, United's share price dropped dramatically.

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,660
So I want you to consider the following.

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,190
At the time when United was spending lots of money on paid media

25
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,480
through its advertising, saying, We're a great airline,

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,200
you should come fly with us.

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:46,320
Meanwhile, in the earned space here, the word of mouth was extremely negative.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,740
It impacted the share price.

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,710
It impacted people's perceptions of the company.

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,030
And it was bad for business.

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,350
There was a negative connection between these elements of the marketing

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,100
communication mix.

33
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,150
United Airlines didn't think that they had earned this.

34
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,699
They didn't set out to do it, but the experience they provided for a customer

35
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,960
stimulated it.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,710
So what it tells you is there is a conversation, word of mouth,

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,410
that is happening about your brand and the category

38
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,120
in which that brand fits for consumers.

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,120
And that conversation is happening, whether you're aware of it or not.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,810
But social media-- as we said a little earlier-- it has allowed it to speed up

41
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,740
and to scale rapidly in size.

42
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,590
So not only did this cause a problem for United,

43
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,440
but in this early stage of the social media's evolution, way back in 2009,

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,980
we have a situation where this became a lightning rod for dissent

45
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,580
over negative consumer experiences in the airline industry.

46
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,420
So you would see, in online discussions, people saying,

47
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,900
I've never flown with United and I don't have a guitar,

48
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,400
but I bet my airline would break it if they did, and they wouldn't apologize.

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,060
And so they realized that there was this negative opinion and sentiment

50
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,490
about the airline industry, as a whole.

51
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,410
And what it caused, first of all, in airlines--

52
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,810
but more broadly in the marketing industry--

53
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,470
it caused an understanding of both the power of social media,

54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,740
but also the fact that, really, this was a word of mouth that

55
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,140
was happening anyway.

56
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,370
And that just previously, it was harder for anybody, including the marketers,

57
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,070
to hear.

58
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:36,384
