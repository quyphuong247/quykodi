DARREN: So one of the latest buzz words in marketing-

5
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:14,090
and if you know marketing, you know marketing's always good about having

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,219
its own "language"-- its own "buzz words"--

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,520
but one of the latest things that we've heard over the last few years is this

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,360
notion of "real time marketing."

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,150
And that could mean a lot of different things.

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,790
Right?

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,910
But I would frame this notion of real time marketing

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,660
in one of the classic TV programs that we've

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,220
seen from AMC in the last few years, and that's obviously Mad Men.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,930
And Mad Men has been very effective because it's really

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,440
provided some glamour to the advertising and the communications industry,

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,760
and one fun part about the show is it's kind of pulled back the curtain.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,720
So at least in some sense, we got an idea of how ads and communication

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,790
campaigns were built in the '60s.

19
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,290
Right?

20
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,640
On Madison Avenue.

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,130
And if you watch the show-- and maybe you haven't.

22
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,140
Maybe you have.

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,010
One of the fun parts is you see all the executives sitting around the table,

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,200
and they're brainstorming.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,230
And Don Draper becomes creative-- one of the executives in the show--

26
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,160
and they come up with a great idea.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,120
And then the big machine starts to work, and the campaign unfolds.

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,860
And the process takes months.

29
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,420
Right?

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,020
And that's, to be honest, historically, the way

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,130
that advertising communication happens-- is

32
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,330
it's a nice long period of time where something

33
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,310
really thoughtful and creative is brought to the market

34
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,130
to help sell a product or do something of the sort.

35
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,670
Right?

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,370
But real time marketing is the idea that, instead of having this long time

37
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,710
span-- right-- instead, you can take advantage of events or incidents

38
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,360
or things that happen in the world around us

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,850
and you can use those events in your marketing campaign, your communication

40
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,680
campaign immediately.

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,890
So in other words, instead of doing this long drawn out process of building

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,240
your communication campaign, you do it-

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,410
And some of the funnest examples we've seen in the last couple of years

46
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,220
of this idea are things like the incident

47
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,250

When it actually bended a bit when you put in your back pocket.

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
Well, a number of other brands-- one of my favorite was Kit Kat,

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,950
the chocolate bar-- took advantage of that and did an ad displayed very

52
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,930
quickly online that said, "It's OK if ours bend"--

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,010
poking fun at the notion of iPhones's product not working,

54
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,160
but in a Kit Kat world, that's all good.

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,920
Right?

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,380
Perhaps one the most famous examples of real time marketing

57
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,770
was in the Superbowl-- a couple of years back.

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,400

The power went out.

61
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,600
And actually, what happened was people were sitting in the seats,

62
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,860
people at home watching it realize that you can't really

63
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,230

66
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,910
of dunking the cookie even though it's dark.

00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:26,390
I'll talk about a company called "Threadless."

Right?

77
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,150
Threadless is a t-shirt company.

78
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,320
And you say, "Well, Darren, I know a lot of t-shirt companies.

79
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,270
I know the Gap.

80
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,610
I know Abercrombie & Fitch.

81
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,070
I know a lot of places that sell t-shirts.

82
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,480
Why are you going to tell us a story about Threadless?"

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,522
Well, Threadless uses a business model that is

84
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,105
based in what we call "crowdsourcing."

85
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:48,740
And crowdsourcing was an idea that came to being in about 2006

86
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,420
in Wired Magazine.

87
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,720
And in that magazine, it talked about the notion-- right--

88
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,260
that you can draw from the crowd ideas and input to help you in your business.

89
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,750
And so what Threadless did was they made that

90
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,540
the engine of their design and product development for their shirts.

91
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,540
And what they did is they put out the call for designs to the crowd

92
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,240
to consumers all around the world, and consumers

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,840
would upload designs for t-shirts.

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,730
And then instead of choosing them themselves,

95
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,240
what the organization does is put those out to the crowd

96
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,110
to say-- which ones should we produce?

97
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,060
What limited runs should we make of these specific t-shirts?

98
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,960
Great idea.

99
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,560
What do you have to pay-- right-- the crowd to do this creative activity?

100
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,880
Well, what's interesting-- right-- is, in all of these crowdsourcing sites,

101
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,550
often the compensation is not significant.

102
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,930
Sometimes, it's a very small monetary amount.

103
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,520
In the case of Threadless, for example, putting in the back of the shirt

104
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,550
the label and the name of the person that

105
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,080
designed it is the main way that you get reimbursed

106
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,070
or compensated for your creativity.

107
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,230
Interesting way to develop a new product.

108
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,160
My third example-- third little case study--

109
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,580
comes from the idea of the long tail.

110
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,550
And there's been a very famous book that was written on the long tail,

111
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,610
but the notion of the long tail is simply this-- right--

112
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,560
that, for many years, companies that would sell things

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,790
like books or records-- remember, way back in the day, records, tapes, DVDs?

114
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,485
Right?

115
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:25,410
They would always have to stock the most popular items.

116
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,810
If you think of a distribution of items that you sold in your store,

117
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,300
it would kind of go like this.

118
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,860
Right?

119
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,400
And so you would always want to sell the most popular.

120
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,060
If you were selling music, the top 100 songs.

121
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,960
Right?

122
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,060
Because that's what most of the people wanted to buy,

123
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,010
and you wouldn't carry things in the tail of the product distribution

124
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,500
because nobody would buy them.

125
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,230
Right?

126
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,495
And so the idea of the long tail is, because technology and distribution--

127
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:54,970
and the keyword being "distribution"-- has changed,

128
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,290
that we can send products around the world pretty easy,

129
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,630
that now there's a market for those items that are not the most popular top

130
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,730
100, that you can actually have a business based from the tail.

131
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:15,620
You can choose the rare or more exotic "recordings" or "films" or books,

132
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,520
and you can build a big consumer base because the whole world-- rather than

133
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,530
just the people in your town or city-- are your consumers.

134
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,190
The last case that I wanted to share with you today

135
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,990
is based on the notion of dynamic pricing.

136
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,550
And dynamic pricing, what does that mean?

137
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,450
Well, it essentially just means that prices can change in real time.

138
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,700
Much like that real time communication idea,

139
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,460
the price that you're paying for a product can change in the immediate.

140
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,350
And a great example of this is an experiment

141
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,135
tried by the Coca-Cola Company.

142
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:55,490
And the Coca-Cola built a vending machine-- right--

143
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,080
that would take the temperature of the outside atmosphere.

144
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,730
Right?

145
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,950
What kind of day is it?

146
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,370
And what it would do is it would change the price of the can of Coke

147
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,870
so that, on a really hot day-- right-- that can of Coke would cost--

148
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,180
I don't know-- 2, 3, $4 because you really want it.

149
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,890
But on a really cold day-- right-- that can a Coke, the price of it,

150
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,020
would fall to 0.25, 0.30, 0.40 maybe.

151
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,970
That's the notion of dynamic pricing-- that, as conditions

152
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,380
outside, in the case of Coke, change, perhaps the demand

153
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,560
function for your product also changes.

154
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,900
And you can take advantage of that with pricing.

155
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,197
Now, again, that's been facilitated by technology.

156
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:39,280
What happened in that case is kind of interesting.

157
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,591
Did consumers like it, or did consumers hate it?

158
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:42,340
What's your guess?

159
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,860


160
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,690
If you said that consumers didn't like it, you're right.

161
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,860
They actually were upset.

162
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,316
How can you mess with the price of Coke?

163
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:52,839
Right?

164
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,880
Consumers have what we call a "reference price"--

165
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,790
something that we'll learn about later in the course--

166
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:03,720
where they feel like a can of Coke should be about 2 bucks.

167
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,739
And to charge more than that or less than that isn't right-- even though,

168
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,780
sometimes, when we ride in an airplane, if you ask the person next to you

169
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,850
how much they paid for the ticket, it's going

170
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,230
to be really different person-to-person.

171
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,540
So it's interesting that dynamic pricing is

172
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,480
more acceptable in some markets and some types of product markets

173
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,810
than it is in others.

174
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,470
And these are some of the things that we'll talk about in this course.

175
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:36,010
Now, I've given you four examples here-- right-- of how the world is changing.

176
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,059
And that's one of the things that I hear often

177
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,604
is that marketing is always changing.

178
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:40,229
Oh, my god.

179
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,020
We have to change the textbooks.

180
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,610
Right?

181
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,590
Because marketing is a living science, and it is.

182
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,380
Right?

183
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,180
And what I've shared with you is a story on real time marketing,

184
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,270
the communication part of marketing.

185
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,017
I've talked a bit about dynamic pricing, the pricing component of marketing.

186
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:57,850
I've talked about product and product design

187
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,660
with crowdsourcing, the product part of marketing.

188
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,590
And finally, in terms of distribution, the notion of the long tail.

189
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,380
And these are the tactics that are often used in marketing.
