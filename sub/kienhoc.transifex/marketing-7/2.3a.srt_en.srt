PAUL: So Darren just told you a really interesting story

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,390
about how he did some market research for Agent Provocateur

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,330
to help them make a better decision about their marketing program.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,000
Fundamentally, marketing research is necessary for a large part

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,730
of what any marketer will do.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,700
And yet, it's often misunderstood and poorly executed.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,320
I want to start off by telling you a couple of things

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,700
which I believe will help you organize your thought process around market

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,670
research.

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,720
Not yet specific tools, but how to think about what

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,360
you're trying to achieve when you set out to do market research.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,280
So the first one is as follows.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,380
We're drowning in data.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,770
We've got a relatively large amount of information.

15
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,800


16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,710
But what I care about, that we have a really small amount at play for us

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,230
is actionable insights.

18
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,430
I'm going to say that again-- actionable insights.

19
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,660
The actionable insight is what we use to inform the decision we

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,790
make around our marketing plan.

21
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,990
So with market research, we've got some choices about gathering new information

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,400
or using existing information.

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,180
But what we analyze and what we do with it is what's going to be key.

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,920
The second thing that I want to put to you

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,610
as you think about how you're going to approach market research is as follows.

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:58,950
Market research that we do involves data from the past and maybe the present.

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,230
But the decision that we need to make is a decision about the future.

28
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,050
So I want you to consider the following--

29
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:16,120
the research that you're going to do, is it going to lead to a better decision?

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,970
There is a trade-off in speed and cost versus quality.

31
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,370
So are you going to make a similar quality of decision

32
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,500
with the research insights that you have currently?

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,590
Or if you delay by another week, month, three months,

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,685
spend more money-- will you make a substantially better or lower risk

35
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:43,185
decision?

36
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:46,120
I'm going to put risk here as well.

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,150
So it will vary depending on your context,

38
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,350
but the cautionary note here is to be aware.

39
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,520
Analysis paralysis-- delaying a decision because you

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,260
are seeking the impossible, which is perfect information

41
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,240
or certainty about the future.

42
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,910
So market research-- we want to be able to go from large amounts of data

43
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,190
to actionable insights.

44
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,400
And those actionable insights about the future-- decisions that we will make.

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,635
They're judgments, they're managerial and marketing management decisions.

46
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:24,103
