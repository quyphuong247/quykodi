DARREN DAHL: I was really excited when Paul

2
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:10,270
said that we were going to be talking about brands

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,630
today and the notion of branding in marketing and why it's so important.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,350
Because as soon as you say brand, if you're like me,

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,140
I think of all the cool brands that I see in the consumer marketplace.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,470
I think of brands like Nike, Apple, Google, even McDonald's.

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,180
And often, these brands mean a lot to consumers.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,619
They mean so much that they actually have value.

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,930
I know that each summer, Business Week, a magazine in the US

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,260
publishes the top 100 brands in the world.

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,440
And this is done by a company called Interbrand.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,140
And what they do is they look at each of the brands that exist,

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,010
and they try to put a monetary value on how valuable just that brand name is.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,020
And so, of course, the usual suspects, the Apple, the Google of the world

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,470
are the ones that are at the top.

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,240
What's interesting is they're often valued at billions and billions

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,260
of dollars, 60, $70 billion, in fact.

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,720
Now, obviously, consumer brands are important.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,920
Why?

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,060
Well, they give value to the consumers in so many ways.

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,040
One of the biggest ways is they become a symbol.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,030
In other words, if you drive a specific type of car,

23
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,370
let's say you're driving a Lexus or a Porsche,

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,190
or a Toyota, what you drive probably says something about you.

25
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,610
In a similar way, what you wear, whether you're

26
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,010
wearing jeans that are designer that have a fancy label,

27
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,450
or something just more casual maybe a Levi brand,

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,970
the brand that you're wearing says something about you.

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,200
You see brands for consumers are symbols.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,190
They give meaning and identity.

31
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,890
And that's why people will pay more for these types of branded products.

32
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,400
I had thought that consumer brands, real end consumer brands

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,600
were really where branding was important.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,710
And I used to teach in class, I remember very vividly teaching

35
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,990
in a class a number of years ago, talking

36
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,400
to the students about how for some products

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,660
maybe branding wasn't so important.

38
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,780
And I was specifically thinking about business to business situations,

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,310
because in those situations, the business

40
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,710
is selling to another business.

41
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,350
The symbolism of brands that I've been talking about

42
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,480
probably doesn't really apply.

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,580
And I was using an example I remember in class of nails,

44
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,720
and talking about how when builders would go into hardware stores

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
and they buy nails, they go back to the big bin

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
and then they'd get a bunch of nails, take them to the front,

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,810
and they'd buy them.

48
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,920
And I remember saying for nails, does it really matter if they're branded?

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,159
Does it add any value?

50
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,950
And I was shocked when one of the students in the back of the class

51
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,825
put up their hand in the air and said, you know what, Professor Dahl?

52
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:49,490
I disagree.

53
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:55,110
Because I work for a company called Tree Island industries, and we make nails.

54
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,300
And one of the most important things that we do is we brand our nails.

55
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,500
And I was like, shut up, really?

56
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,870
He's like yes.

57
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,240
Because we can put them in boxes, we can put them in tubs,

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,630
and we can sell them at a premium.

59
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,490
I was shocked.

60
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,490
It wasn't until a few years later that I came upon another example of this.

61
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,620
I was doing a consulting job for a shipping company called Teekay.

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,840
And interesting brand, Teekay, but it's a big, big shipper

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,990
of oil and oil products.

64
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,360
Over 10% of the world's oil is actually shipped by this company.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,500
They have huge Afromax tankers, liquid natural gas ships,

66
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,270
and they move product for customers.

67
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,630
Who are their customers?

68
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,630
Well, Shell, British Petroleum, Mobile, big oil companies.

69
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,140
And you would think, again, why would they need to brand their product?

70
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,270
Part of my consulting job though was to talk to one of these customers,

71
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,300
a company called Statoil which is based in Norway.

72
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,080
This company obviously drills oil in the North Sea,

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,490
and they use Teekay to ship the oil that they produce.

74
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,040
I went to Norway and I asked the company,

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,190
you know, what do you think of Teekay?

76
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,340
And I was surprised that they told me that the company, the logo

77
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,380
of the company, when they see come into port on the smokestacks of the ship

78
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,149
that it actually gives them a feeling of comfort and safety, a feeling of trust.

79
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,490
And I was thinking as I was hearing this that this actually

80
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,240
did apply to the company.

81
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,810
Because Teekay has a number of values, integrity, teamwork, responsibility,

82
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,810
safety, that clearly are coming through in their brand.

83
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,130
So this leaves me with a bit of a puzzle, to be honest.

84
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:44,030
Because you've got these business models that I don't think really

85
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,450
need brands, especially when I compare them

86
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,640
to consumer products, which really need brands to survive in the marketplace.

87
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm going to pose this one to Paul.

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,990
Do all companies need branding?

89
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,770
And if so, why?

90
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,630
Paul, what can you do for me here?

91
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:07,850
