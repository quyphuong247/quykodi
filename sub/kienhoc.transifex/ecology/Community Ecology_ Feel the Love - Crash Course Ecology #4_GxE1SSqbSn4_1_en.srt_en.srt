1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,209
I wouldn't be much of a teacher if I didn't tell you that life is tough and that everyone's looking out for themselves in this world.

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:06,480
That's just the way it is, people.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,169
You know how I always say that biology is
ultimately about sex and not dying?

4
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,798
Well both of those things are more difficult
than we'd like them to be, because of competition.

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,298
There's a finite amount of resources on this
planet, so evolution drives us to compete for them

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,219
so that we can survive long enough to spread
our genes all over the place

7
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:28,419
And naturally, competition is a really important part of how different species interact when their habitats overlap.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,260
These interactions between species are what
define ecological communities.

9
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:39,039
So it makes sense that community ecology studies
these interactions anywhere they take place,

10
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:43,750
from a tide pool to the whole ocean,
from a rotting log to an entire forest.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,588
But just because inter-species interaction
is mostly competitive doesn't necessarily

12
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:53,899
mean that community ecology is all about big, bloody, tooth-and-claw scenes like from cable-TV nature shows.

13
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:57,088
Actually, a lot of it is, but we're not going
to get there until next week.

14
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,479
For now, let's just note that competition,
while prevalent and important,

15
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,678
is also pretty dangerous, kind of a hassle,
and can, like, really hurt.

16
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,180
So a lot of inter-species interaction is actually
about sidestepping direct competition

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,900
and instead finding ways to divvy up resources,
or otherwise let species just get along.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,620
Can you feel the love?

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:26,840
[Theme Music]

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,219
Careful guys! Because right now we're surrounded potentially lethal interspecific competition going on all over the place.

21
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:36,560
Since we're animals, we usually think of competition
as going on between animals,

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,359
but really it happens between almost all members
of the four kingdoms of life.

23
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,399
Whenever species compete, they're going after
the same resources that they need for their

24
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,718
survival and continued population growth.

25
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,500
In this garden, the weeds are competing with the sunflower, the corn and the dill for nutrients and water in the soil.

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,640
So these resources, because they're finite in this area, are the limiting factors that we've talked about.

27
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,269
The population can only get as big as these
factors will allow.

28
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:02,289
Now, a particularly nasty weed could, over
time, eliminate the veggies entirely.

29
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,780
Such elimination is known as competitive exclusion,

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,259
and it's one of the most fundamental properties
in community ecology, and also, like, life.

31
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,920
Because the fact is, when two species are
competing for the same resources,

32
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,969
one of them is eventually going to be more
successful and eliminate the other.

33
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:20,080
This bitter truth is known as the Competitive
Exclusion Principle,

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,340
and it was first identified in 1934 by Russian
ecologist G. F. Gause

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,560
in a study of two closely-related species
of microscopic protists.

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,550
When he was only 22 years old, Gause made
a name for himself by conducting experiments

37
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,370
that pitted one species of protist, Paramecium
aurelia, against another, Paramecium caudatum.

38
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,270
First, Gause grew each species separately
with the exact same resources,

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,790
and found that each developed rapidly and
established stable populations.

40
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:50,239
But, when he grew them in the same container, P. caudatum was soon driven to extinction by P. aurelia.

41
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,460
Paramecium aurelia gained a competitive advantage because its population grew slightly faster than P. caudatum's.

42
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,700
So Gause's experiment showed that, in the
absence of another disturbance,

43
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:05,750
two species that require the same resources
cannot live indefinitely in the same habitat.

44
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,860
The inferior competitor will be eliminated.

45
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,690
Makes sense, but if competitive exclusion
is the natural law of the land,

46
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,780
then why isn't all of earth just a crazy crap-circus
of constant competition, predation, and ultimately,

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,300
extinction of all those losers?

48
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,760
Well, for a couple of reasons:
first, not all resources are limiting.

49
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,879
Two species of sharks may compete for water
in the ocean, but the ocean is, you know, gigantic.

50
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,909
So that's not what limits their population
growth.

51
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,009
Rather, the amount of food, like a specific
fish that they both eat, could be limiting,

52
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,819
while other resources are plentiful.

53
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,259
Second, as the overwhelming diversity of life in almost any community shows us, most species --

54
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:45,319
even ones that are almost identical to each
other -- are adaptable enough to find a way

55
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,259
to survive in the face of competition.

56
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:52,759
They do this by finding an ecological niche,
the sum of all resources, both biotic and

57
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,679
abiotic, that a species uses in its environment.

58
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,020
You can think of an organism's niche as its job in the community that provides it with a certain lifestyle.

59
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,289
We tend to keep jobs that we can do better
than anyone else in our community,

60
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:07,019
and if we're desperate, we do a job that nobody
else wants to do.

61
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,480
But no matter what job we have, what it pays
in terms of resources dictates our lifestyle.

62
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,000
So finding a nice, comfy niche that you have
pretty much to yourself not only provides

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,288
a steady income of food and other stuff,

64
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:23,788
it also allows a species to avoid competitive
exclusion, and this, in turn, helps create

65
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:25,908
a more stable ecological community.

66
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:29,939
It's and elegant and peaceful solution, I wish that we humans could figure out something as good,

67
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:34,019
but as with anything in life, this relative
security and stability comes at a price.

68
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:37,769
The bummer is that it prevents some species
from living the lifestyle that they could

69
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,908
have if nobody else competed with them at
all.

70
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:44,610
This ideal situation is called a fundamental
niche, and it's just that, an ideal.

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,408
Few, if any species ever get to live that
way.

72
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:50,680
Instead, because of the need to avoid competitive
exclusion in order to survive,

73
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,300
many species end up with a different job,
and hence lifestyle.

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,300
It's not necessarily the job that they studied
for in college, but it makes a decent living,

75
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,240
and that's called a realized niche.

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,468
This, my friends, is how nature does conflict
management.

77
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:05,939
But it sounds kind of unnatural, doesn't it?

78
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,540
I mean, Gause taught us that competition, and winning the competition, was the natural order of things.

79
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,480
So how could it be that part of the natural order actually involves letting everyone compete and win just a little bit?

80
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,660
And how did we ever come to discover that
things actually worked this way?

81
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,560
Well, it took a special kind of person, and to to tell you about him, I'm going to need a special kind of chair.

82
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,498
Canadian born ecologist Robert MacArthur was
in his late 20s when he made a discovery

83
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,319
that made him one of the most influential
ecologists of the 20th century.

84
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,959
While researching his doctoral thesis at Yale
University in 1958,

85
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:47,748
he was studying five species of warblers that live in coniferous forests in the northeastern United States.

86
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:53,080
At the time, because there were so many different species of warblers that lived, fed, and mated in such close quarters,

87
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,039
many ornithologists thought that the birds
occupied the exact same niche

88
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,889
and thus were an exception to Gause's competitive
exclusion principle.

89
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,879
But MacArthur was not convinced.

90
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:08,189
A mathematician by training, he set out to
measure exactly how and where each kind of

91
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,640
warbler did its foraging, nesting, and mating.

92
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:17,248
In order to do this, he studied each tree the birds lived in, dividing them into zones, 16 zones to be exact,

93
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:22,080
from bare lichen at the base of the trunk, to new needles and buds at the tips of the branches.

94
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,159
After many seasons of observing many birds
in many trees,

95
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:31,399
he found that each species of warbler divided its time differently among the various parts of the tree.

96
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,359
One warbler, called the Cape May, for example, spent most of its time toward the outside of the tree at the top.

97
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,979
Meanwhile, the Bay Breasted fed mostly around
the middle interior.

98
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:43,778
MacArthur also found that each of the warblers
had different hunting and foraging habits

99
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:49,058
and even bred at slightly different times of the year, so that their highest food requirements didn't overlap.

100
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,000
These differences illustrated how the warblers
partitioned their limiting resources,

101
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:58,270
each finding its realized niche that allowed
it to escape the fate of competitive exclusion.

102
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,969
The phenomenon he observed is now known as
resource partitioning,

103
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,639
when similar species settle into separate
niches that let them coexist.

104
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,550
Thanks in part to this discovery, MacArthur
became known as a pioneer of modern ecology,

105
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,250
encouraging curiosity and hypothesis driven research, championing the use of genetics in ecological study,

106
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,389
and collaborating with biologists like E.
O. Wilson and Jared Diamond.

107
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,669
Sadly, he died of renal caner at the age of
42,

108
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:29,819
but his study of northern warblers remains a classic example of community ecology that is still taught today.

109
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,819
So, if organisms can do this, if they can
behave in ways that help minimize competition

110
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,939
while increasing their odds for survival,

111
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,259
it follows that traits associated with this
behavior would start being selected favorably.

112
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:46,180
After all, that's what natural selection is for. When this happens, it's known as character displacement.

113
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,050
To demonstrate, let's go back to some other
famous ecologists,

114
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,668
our favorite couple of evolutionary biologists
and love birds, Peter and Rosemary Grant.

115
00:07:54,668 --> 00:08:00,108
I told you before about how they observed the process of speciation among Darwin's famous Galapagos finches.

116
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:05,120
Well on the same island, Daphne Major, in 2006, they witnessed character displacement in action.

117
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,340
For a long time, a small population of finches
had the island to themselves,

118
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,318
where they ate a variety of seeds, including
seeds of the feverplant,

119
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,580
which were bigger and more nutritious than
the smaller seeds that were available but

120
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,769
were harder for the little finches to open.

121
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:23,808
Then in 1982, a group of much bigger finches
showed up on the island,

122
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:28,229
and they began to commandeer the island's
abundant supply of feverplant seeds.

123
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:32,759
Within just 20 years, the Grants found that
the small finches' beaks shrunk to allow them

124
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:36,210
to specialize in eating only the smaller,
less nutritious seeds.

125
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,070
But now the little finches had those seeds
all to themselves.

126
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,940
The traits of the two populations had actually diverged to help facilitate the partitioning of resources.

127
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,240
See? Competition can be hard on us, but it
also can make us better people,

128
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,830
or you know, finches or warblers or kangaroo
mice.

129
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:56,180
But there are also kinds of interspecies interaction in which species actually join forces in the fights for survival.

130
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:58,399
This is the ultimate in conflict-avoidance.

131
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:02,789
In these cases species in a community actually
manage to avoid competition altogether

132
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:07,719
by forming downright tight relationships that
benefit one, if not both, of the parties involved.

133
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,820
You may have heard of both of these cases:
First, mutualism, where both species benefit,

134
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,020
and commensalism, where one species benefits
and the other is kind of like, "Whatever."

135
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,779
Mutualism abounds in nature, and for those
who've been paying attention to Crash Course,

136
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,879
you've heard me talk about it many, many times
before.

137
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,059
A prime example [of mutualism] are mychorrhizae, the fungal root that we talked about a few weeks ago,

138
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:32,379
where fungi and plant roots get tangled and essentially rub each other's backs for nutritious favors.

139
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:36,659
Others you may have heard about include flowering
plants that produce nectars to attract pollinators,

140
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,839
and that bear fruit to attract animals to
help spread the seeds inside.

141
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,399
Oftentimes these relationships become rather
needy, like in the case of termites --

142
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:47,289
they can't break down the cellulose in the
wood they eat without the enzymes produced

143
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:50,029
by the microorganisms that live inside their
digestive systems.

144
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,569
Without the little critters, the bigger critters
would die.

145
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,580
Such a needy relationship is called obligate
mutualism.

146
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,960
By contrast, commensalism is where one species definitely benefits and the other isn't really hurt or helped.

147
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,300
Such neutrality, of course, is difficult to prove because even a seemingly benign interaction probably has some effect.

148
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,639
Barnacles, for example, hitchhike on gray
whales, getting a free ride through swaths

149
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,809
of plankton-rich water for feeding.

150
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:18,339
While clearly a benefit to the barnacles,
the relationship is often considered commensal

151
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,490
because the whales probably don't really care
whether the barnacles are there or not.

152
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,029
Or do they? The barnacles might slow down
the whale as it swims through the water,

153
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,610
but on the other hand, they might also serve as a type of camouflage from predators like orcas,

154
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,399
in which case they confer an advantage.

155
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:34,649
So it probably comes down to "meh" for the
whale.

156
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,120
And when you consider all the other possibilities out there when species interact, "meh" isn't such a bad option.

157
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,720
Especially considering that next week, we're
going for the throat,

158
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,720
by which I mean we'll be investigating the
kill-or-be-killed world of animal predation

159
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,100
and all of the fantastic evolutionary changes it can trigger that lead to even greater diversity in ecological communities.

160
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,220
There probably is going to be a lot of blood
though, so you might want to bring your poncho.

161
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,440
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course: Ecology.
