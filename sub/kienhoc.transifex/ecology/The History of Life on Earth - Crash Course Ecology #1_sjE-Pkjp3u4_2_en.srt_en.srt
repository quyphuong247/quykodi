1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,179
In the past 40 wonderful weeks together, we've
explored all of the fundamentals of biology,

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:11,339
from the tiny little machines that make us
work to the systems that power the most awe-inspiring

3
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,160
and most complex organisms on earth.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,550
Now, I want to take our learning to the next
level, simply by broadening our perspective.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,519
With a solid understanding of biology at the small scale under our belts, it's time for the long view.

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,140
For the next 12 weeks we'll be learning how
the living things that we've study interact

7
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:29,039
with and influence each other and their environments.

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,480
It's the science of ecology.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,399
The idea of an organism interacting with its
environment may sound simple,

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,579
but it is actually pretty marvellously complicated.

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:43,960
Nothing escapes the long arm of ecology, life
influences the chemical make-up of the atmosphere,

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,370
the geology of the planet, the climate.

13
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:50,399
And nothing impacts life on earth today more
than humanity does.

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,058
And so we're going to be exploring that relationship, between mankind and our environment in a lot of detail in the coming weeks.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,560
Life is powerful, and in order to understand how
living systems work, you first have to understand

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,700
how they originated, and developed and diversified over the past 4.5 billion years of Earth's history.

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,719
The principles that you hear about here today will form the framework of our next 12 weeks together.

18
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:19,550
Get ready for the epic drama that is the history
of life on Earth.

19
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:29,349
[Theme Music]

20
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:34,479
Earth is like a cheap rental house in a college
town, there's always somebody living there,

21
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:38,399
but tenants are always moving in and out,
and new tenants moving into old one's rooms,

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,520
and sometimes the electricity gets turned
off because nobody paid the power bill.

23
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,259
It's pretty much just chaos.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,160
And like a rental house the Earth isn't invincible;

25
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,459
I mean, a good semester of back-to-back frat
parties could tear a house up pretty fast,

26
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:53,759
and then you know then everybody gets evicted
and some new tenants move in.

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,600
Which gives you a little bit of perspective on humanity's position as the current dominant species on the planet.

28
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,419
There have been others before us and there
will probably be others when we're gone.

29
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,000
That's just how the planet rolls.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,459
But it's taken eons for the Earth to get the
way that it is today.

31
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:10,099
Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago,

32
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:13,659
and for a while it was just a junk of rock
circling the Sun suffering collisions with

33
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:16,718
other junks of rock, generating unreal amounts
of heat.

34
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,519
Eventually the constant smashing slowed down
a little bit and the outer layer of the Earth cooled,

35
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,438
but the core of the planet remained hot.
Like really hot, as hot as the surface of the sun.

36
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:30,879
It gives you some idea of how much energy
and radiation contributed to the Earth's formation

37
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:37,368
when you consider that 4.5 billion years later there's still molten stuff in the middle of our planet.

38
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,248
And it's that inner heat that makes the Earth's
surface so dynamic.

39
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:43,729
The planet's insides that continually bubbling
up, destroying what's there,

40
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:49,289
renovating and rearranging furniture. It's this constant renewal, that's part of what makes life here possible.

41
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:53,789
And in the scheme of things it didn't actually take life very long to show up on that hot rock.

42
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,378
About 4.4 billion years ago the planet was
still getting pelted with giant chunks of

43
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,498
rock and ice left over from the formation
of the solar system.

44
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:05,618
There was no oxygen in the atmosphere and
volcanoes were firing off all over the place,

45
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,099
but it was finally cool enough for some of the water in the atmosphere to turn from vapor into liquid.

46
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,578
The first seas formed and in them and in the
atmosphere, a soup of chemicals:

47
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,549
nitrogen, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide,
methane, ammonia, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide.

48
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,329
All those things that with the help of heat
and lightning and who knows what else,

49
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,879
eventually created small organic molecules.
In some way, some how, life happened.

50
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:33,139
We don't know how it happened.
I wish we did, but we don't.

51
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,819
The first life on earth probably wasn't even
life as we think of it, it was just a collection

52
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:38,628
of chemicals surrounded by a membrane,

53
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:43,870
because phospholipids, as you may remember,
spontaneously form bi-layer membranes in water.

54
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,039
Over time, some of the chemicals inside these
membranes developed into amino acids,

55
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,840
and eventually RNA, the nucleic acid that
was probably the first genetic material.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,340
These collections of chemicals trapped within
membranes, called protobionts,

57
00:03:56,348 --> 00:04:00,979
most likely began to grow and split and replicate
themselves until some crazy copying error

58
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,128
gave way to DNA nucleotides,

59
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:07,709
which is a way more stable repository for
genetic information because it's double-stranded,

60
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,300
not single-stranded like RNA.

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,579
And once these little guys had DNA, they were
on their way.

62
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:16,598
They might have only been one cell, and they were probably living in the equivalent of a hydrothermal vent,

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
but they were making the most of it.

64
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,738
So the first living things were prokaryotes,
single-celled organisms with no nuclei

65
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:26,000
that were probably pretty similar to the archaea
that we find living today in hydrothermal

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,180
vents, sulfur hot-springs, and oil wells.

67
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,180
And I apologize for pronouncing archaea wrong
for the entire biology series. My bad.

68
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,740
These prokaryotes probably made their grand
entrance between 3.9 and 3.5 billion years

69
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,590
ago during what is known as the Archaean Eon.

70
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:45,799
This is the first of what scientists would
identify as three eons in Earth history:

71
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,970
the Archaean, the Proterozoic, and the Phanerozoic.

72
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,930
The Phanerozoic being what we've been experiencing
for the last half billion years or so.

73
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,918
An eon, as you might expect, takes freaking
forever.

74
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:58,490
The first one went on for 2.5 billion years.

75
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,019
So we break up the eons into eras, periods,
and epochs,

76
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,299
which are organized by the big deal events
that we can see in the fossil record.

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,980
So from 3.5 billion years ago until about 2.1 billion years ago, these prokaryotes were all alone on Earth.

78
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,840
But then, something weird happened; the amount
of oxygen in the atmosphere suddenly shot up,

79
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,859
basically from none to 10%, in a very short
period of time, geologically speaking.

80
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,530
This oxygen was most likely produced by a
brand new prokaryote, called cyanobacteria,

81
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,978
which had figured out how to make its own
food through photosynthesis.

82
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:37,098
The more cyanobacteria were out there, the higher the atmospheric concentration of oxygen became.

83
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,319
This "oxygen revolution," as it's called,
probably spelled D-double-O-M for a lot of

84
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,299
prokaryotes out there that had evolved without oxygen.

85
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,610
And this was also one of the first real game
changers for life on Earth,

86
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,788
because it was the first major instance of living things bringing massive change to their own environment.

87
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:57,348
In fact, it may be the earliest example of
ecology at work.

88
00:05:57,348 --> 00:06:01,538
Cyanobacteria changed the atmosphere, judo-chopped
the competition,

89
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:06,579
and made way for the evolution of living things
to take a new, specific direction.

90
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:11,620
Then, about 2.1 billion years ago, a new kind
of organism made its big debut: eukaryotes.

91
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,439
These, as you know, are a big deal because
they include all plants and animals.

92
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,740
Eukaryotes probably evolved by a process called
endosymbiosis,

93
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,319
where one prokaryote parasitized another prokaryote,
or maybe just ate it but forgot to digest it.

94
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,159
And the result was actually really awesome for both the host and the parasite/undigested prey.

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,120
It formed a single-celled organism with organelles,

96
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:39,309
specifically mitochondria and plastids, which probably evolved from those eaten or parasitic prokaryotes.

97
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:45,220
This allowed for much more complexity and
by 1.5 billion years ago we start seeing multi-cellular

98
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,380
eukaryotic organisms in the fossil record.

99
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,379
The very first of them probably being algae,

100
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:55,030
but it wasn't until around 535 million years
ago that the eukaryotes went berzerk.

101
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:00,029
And that's known as the Cambrian Explosion,
a super-major biological golden age when the

102
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:03,309
diversity of all animal life on Earth exploded.

103
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,800
Nobody's entirely sure what started it, but suddenly life created innovations that the planet had never seen.

104
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,500
Creatures used minerals and seawater to build
skeletons and shells,

105
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,379
some acquired weapons like claws, while others
developed defensive plates.

106
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,658
The evolutionary arms race between predators
and prey was underway.

107
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,680
This heralded the dawn of the Phanerozoic
Eon, the one that we're in right now.

108
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,658
That's right, the Earth spent the better part of two eons under the rule of a bunch of archaea, and bacteria,

109
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:35,319
and some, like, soft-bodied worms, until the Cambrian exploded and we started to see a lot of animal phyla

110
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,180
that we actually are hanging out with today.

111
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,509
After the Cambrian, the party got so hot in
the oceans that by the Ordovician Period,

112
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:42,919
about 500 million years ago,

113
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:48,899
plants, animals, and fungi started colonizing land, probably as a strategy for escaping predation.

114
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:53,589
Now there were whole new ecosystems to explore
and adapt to and create!

115
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:56,029
During the Devonian Period, about 365 million
years ago,

116
00:07:56,029 --> 00:08:00,968
tetrapods, four-legged vertebrates that probably evolved from lobe-finned fishes, showed up on land,

117
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,939
and so did arthropods like insects and spiders.

118
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,389
From here we begin to see ecological systems
that we recognize today,

119
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:13,800
because organisms were changing their environments by consuming oxygen in the atmosphere and releasing carbon dioxide.

120
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,598
And you know who likes carbon dioxide: the
plants.

121
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,360
The Carboniferous Period that extended from
359 to 299 million years ago was when the

122
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,120
plants entirely went nuts.

123
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,908
The forests were so dense and so widespread
that they made all our fossil fuels.

124
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:36,000
All the coal and oil that we now use to power all the things with were made over the course of about 60 million years.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,799
This time, it was the plants that had changed
both the climate and the geology of Earth.

126
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:47,039
These forests cranked out so much oxygen that the atmosphere contained around 35% oxygen rather than today's, like, 21%.

127
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,919
All this oxygen started cooling the planet,
because there wasn't enough carbon dioxide

128
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,099
to maintain the balmy temperatures that the
vast carboniferous jungles needed to survive.

129
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,680
So, the whole system crashed, and all the
carbon from these forests sunk into swamps

130
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,629
and eventually got locked in rocks.

131
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,289
Of course, now we're releasing all that carbon
by burning fossil fuels, which is certainly

132
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:10,958
helping to keep the planet toasty now.
That right there, some good ecology!

133
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,738
In the Permian Period, 299 to 251 million
years ago,

134
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,560
all the land masses of the world joined to
form one giant continent that we call Pangaea,

135
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,299
altering global climate and ocean currents,
and animals and plants evolved in response.

136
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:29,099
We started seeing gymnosperms, the first plants
with seeds like modern pines and spruces and firs,

137
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,720
and archosaurs, the grand-daddys of dinosaurs
and modern birds showed up.

138
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,840
But you probably picked up enough of the pattern
here to predict that this party didn't last forever.

139
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,500
About 252 million years ago, something happened, or maybe a lot of things happened in quick succession.

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,879
But whatever they were
-- movie executives, take note --

141
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,939
the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event would make the most awesome disaster film of all time,

142
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:57,270
because up to 96% of all marine species and 76% of terrestrial vertebrate species bought the farm.

143
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,049
And it's the only known mass extinction of
insects.

144
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:05,859
About 57% of all taxonomic families and 83%
of all genera became extinct.

145
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,009
It was the most significant extinction event
on the planet, ever.

146
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,338
It's been hard to pinpoint the reason for
this extinction event because most of the

147
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:14,079
evidence has been wiped out, of course.

148
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,509
It may have been kicked off by an asteroid
that released the energy-equivalent of the

149
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:20,720
detonation of a few million nuclear weapons
all at once.

150
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,920
And then insult added to injury, when a whole
bunch of volcanoes erupted,

151
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,179
methane was released from the sea floor, there were probably some gas explosions in what's now Siberia,

152
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:33,819
and then a whole bunch of climate changes, sea level changes, and changes in ocean salinity probably occurred.

153
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,199
Nobody's sure exactly what happened, but we do know that it took a long time for life on Earth to make a comeback.

154
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:42,938
But look on the bright side, as a result of
the Permian-Triassic event we got dinosaurs!

155
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,260
They were able to evolve during the Triassic because there wasn't much competition for resources.

156
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:51,100
So they evolved to fill an available niche,

157
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,320
that is, a combination of living and non-living
resources that they could use to survive.

158
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:58,870
Remember that word, because a lot of ecology
comes down to who's exploiting or leaving

159
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,629
or getting kicked out of or altering their
niches.

160
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:06,588
And during the Triassic period, there were
tons of niches, the sky was the limit,

161
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,470
because hey! there weren't very many animals
or plants to compete with.

162
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,790
So by the Jurassic Period, about 199 to 145
million years ago, huge herbivorous dinosaurs

163
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:21,740
were roaming the Earth; smaller, mean-as-crap carnivorous dinos were stalking the herbivores;

164
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,769
the oceans were full of giant squid and
ichthyosaurs and long-necked plesiosaurs;

165
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,409
the air was full of pterosaurs and the first
birds.

166
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:34,958
And there were mammals! Small ones, but they were all over the place, it just wasn't our time to shine.

167
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,229
The Jurassic was dino time, and the dinos
lived it up.

168
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,209
They partied down until about 65 million years
ago when they all went extinct,

169
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:46,250
as I'm sure you're aware, except for their
surviving descendants, the birds.

170
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,578
It was probably an asteroid that hit the Yucatan
peninsula in Mexico that did them in,

171
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:53,979
but other theories suggest it could've been
climate change due to increased volcanic activity,

172
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,860
and the possibility that they just couldn't adapt
to changes in other living things around them.

173
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:04,278
For instance, about 100 million years ago, angiosperms, or flowering plants, first appeared, and they did really well.

174
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:09,318
Especially since flying insects evolved with
them, providing a great vehicle for reproduction.

175
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,660
This is a great example of another ecological
principle, co-evolution.

176
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:17,229
But dinosaurs liked to eat the old-fashioned gymnosperms -- we know that from studying their fossilized poop.

177
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,879
So maybe their pickiness made them go extinct,
who knows?

178
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,439
And with the dinos out of the picture, mammals
and birds were free to take over.

179
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,459
And this is where the flora and fauna on Planet
Earth start looking a lot more like they do today.

180
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,659
Since then, there have been climate fluctuations
and extinction events

181
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:34,819
and the evolution of many animals and plants,
including humans.

182
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,280
And on a geological scale, oddly enough, that
kind of brings us up to today.

183
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,079
Ecology is all about action and reaction: an asteroid hits and a bunch of stuff happens because of it;

184
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,060
plants take over and different stuff happens
because of that.

185
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,778
Humans start releasing all the carbon dioxide locked in 300 million year old rocks and the planet heats up,

186
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:57,269
and, you know, we don't know what happens.
But ecology is providing us our best guesses.

187
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,149
Over the next three months, we're going to explore these relationships in more and more detail,

188
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:05,568
as well as, like, how humans relate to the
whole thing and how we're affecting all of this.
