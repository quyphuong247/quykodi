1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,379
In our series on biology, we spent many weeks together talking about the physiology of animals and plants

2
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:07,849
and how cells work together to make tissues
to make organs to make organ systems

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,969
to make us the hunks of meat and vegetables
that we are.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,379
In understanding the whole organism, it's important to know what's going on at all those levels.

5
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:21,798
And the same is true for ecology, only instead of zooming in and out on different levels within a living thing,

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,039
we can zoom in and out on the Earth.

7
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,419
Depending on the power of the magnification, we can understand a whole range of things about our planet.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,500
For instance, we can look at groups within a species and how they live together in one geographic area --

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,460
that's population ecology.
There's also community ecology,

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,700
where you look at groups of different organisms living together and figure out how they influence each other.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,230
And then the most zoomed out we get is ecosystem
ecology,

12
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:49,390
the study of how all living and non-living
things interact within an entire ecosystem.

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,719
So let's start by zooming in with population
ecology,

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,238
the study of groups within a species that
interact mostly with each other,

15
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,598
to understand why these populations are different
in one time and place than they are in another.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,260
"How?" you may be asking yourself, "is that
in any way useful to anyone ever?"

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,900
Well, it's actually super useful to everybody
always.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:14,240
Let's look, for instance, at the outbreak of West Nile virus that struck Dallas, Texas in the summer of 2012.

19
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,739
In Dallas County, 12 people died from the
virus as of the filming of this,

20
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,859
and nearly 300 people have been infected.

21
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:25,959
But in 2011, the whole state of Texas reported
only 27 cases of West Nile, and only two deaths.

22
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,079
That seems kind of significant, so what's
up?

23
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,228
Turns out, this is a population ecology problem.

24
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:35,049
West Nile is mosquito-borne illness, and the
population of mosquitoes in Dallas in 2012

25
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:38,530
busted through brick walls like the Kool-Aid
man, spreading West Nile like crazy.

26
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,489
So why did this outbreak happen in 2012 and
not the year before?

27
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:47,810
And why did it happen in Texas and not in
New Jersey? The answer, is population ecology.

28
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:57,430
[Theme Music]

29
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,840
Before we start solving any disease outbreak mysteries, we've got to understand the fundamentals of population ecology.

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,879
For starters, a population is just a group of individuals of one species who interact regularly.

31
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,340
How often organisms interact has a lot to
do with geography.;

32
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:16,119
you're going to have a lot more facetime with the folks you live near than those who live farther away.

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,759
As a result, individuals who are closer to
you will be the ones that you compete with

34
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:22,329
for food and living space, mates, all that
stuff.

35
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,919
But in order to understand why populations
are different from time to time and place to place,

36
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,400
a population ecologist needs to know a few
things about a population, like its density.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,640
In this instance, how many mosquitoes there are in the greater Dallas area that might come into contact with each other.

38
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,840
A population's density changes due to a number
of factors, all of which are pretty intuitive.

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,379
It increases when new individuals are either
born or immigrate, that is move in,

40
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:48,889
and it decreases because of deaths or emigration,
or individuals moving out.

41
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:53,620
Simple enough, but as a population ecologist
you also need to know about the geographic

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,599
arrangement of the individuals within the
population.

43
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,840
This is their dispersion.
Like, are the mosquitoes all clumped together?

44
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:03,378
Are they evenly spaced across the county?
Is there some kind of random spacing?

45
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:07,798
The answer to these questions gives scientists
a snapshot of a population at any given moment.

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,439
And to figure out a puzzle like the West Nile
outbreak,

47
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:13,379
which involves studying how a population is
changed over time,

48
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:18,638
you have to investigate one of population
ecology's central principles, population growth.

49
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,730
There are all kinds of factors that drive
population growth, and they can vary radically

50
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,448
from one organism to the next.

51
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:26,989
Things like fecundity, how many offspring
an individual can have in a lifetime,

52
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,558
make a huge difference in the size of a population.

53
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:33,778
So for instance, why do mosquito populations
seem to grow so quickly,

54
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:37,748
while the endangered black rhino may never
recover from a single act of poaching?

55
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:42,269
For starters, mosquitoes can have 2,000 offspring
in their two-week lifetime,

56
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,180
while the rhino can have, like, five in forty
years.

57
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,040
Still, a population doesn't usually, or even ever, grow to its full potential and it can't keep growing indefinitely.

58
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,799
To understand how fast or slow and high or
low a population actually grows,

59
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,229
you need to focus on what's keeping growth
in check.

60
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,609
These factors are appropriately called limiting
factors.

61
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,109
Say you're a mosquito in Dallas in 2011, the
year before the outbreak.

62
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:10,689
Back then, the growth rate wasn't what it was in 2012, so something was keeping you down.

63
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:14,588
To figure out what your limiting factors were,
you first have to narrow down what you need

64
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,920
as a mosquito to live and reproduce successfully.

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,759
First, you've got to find your food.
Now, you mosquitoes, you eat all kinds of things,

66
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,719
but in order to reproduce, assuming you're
a female, you need a blood meal.

67
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,760
So you have to find a vertebrate and suck
some of its blood out.

68
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,800
Presumably there's no shortage of vertebrates walking around Dallas for you to suck blood out of;

69
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,459
I have good friends who are vertebrates in Dallas, you might even be able to suck some of their blood.

70
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:41,519
Next, temperature, because you mosquitoes are ectothermic, it has to be warm in order for you to be active.

71
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,109
Now Texas is pretty warm, and the winter of
2011-2012 was especially balmy.

72
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,580
In fact, the summer of 2012 was exceptionally hot, which helps speed up the mosquito life cycle,

73
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:54,979
so that's one limiting factor that's been
removed for Dallas-area mosquitoes.

74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,720
Moving on to mates. If you're a female mosquito,
you need to find a nice male mosquito,

75
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,580
with a job and preferably his own car, because
you know Dallas is a pretty big city, to mate with.

76
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:06,389
This isn't actually all that hard because
of the way mosquitoes do it;

77
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,419
males just gather into a mosquito cloud at
dusk every night during mating season

78
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:16,420
and all the female has to do is find her local dude-cloud and fly into it in order to get mated with. Easy cheese!

79
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,620
Finally, space, and aha! Because here we have
another important clue.

80
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,220
Mosquitoes need to lay their eggs in stagnant water, and if there's anything mosquito larvae hate,

81
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,020
it's a rainstorm flushing out the little puddle
of water they've been living in.

82
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:30,909
And since Dallas saw a pretty severe drought
in the summer of 2012,

83
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,810
there were lots of pockets of stagnant, nasty,
mosquito water sitting around,

84
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,550
acting as nurseries for many, many West Nile-infected
mosquitoes.

85
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,139
So, when we look at this evidence, we find
at least two limiting factors for Dallas's

86
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:48,219
mosquito population growth that were removed in 2011: the constraints of temperature and space.

87
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,780
It was plenty hot, and there were lots of egg-laying locations, so the bugs were free to go nuts.

88
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:57,739
Population ecologists group limiting factors
like these into two different categories:

89
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,139
density-dependent and density-independent.

90
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,120
They do it this way because we need to know
whether a population's growth rate is being

91
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:06,529
controlled by how many individuals are in it, or whether it's being controlled by something else.

92
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,459
And the reason these limitations matter is
because they affect what's known as the carrying

93
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,719
capacity of the mosquitoes' habitat.

94
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,940
That's the number of individuals that a habitat can sustain with the resources that it has available.

95
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:21,300
So, density-dependent limitations are factors
that inhibit growth because of the environmental

96
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,670
stress caused by a population size.

97
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,000
For example, there may simply not be enough
food, water, and space to accommodate everyone.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,430
Or maybe because there are so many individuals,
a nearby predator population explodes,

99
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,660
which helps keep the population in check.

100
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,470
Things like disease can also be a density-dependent
limitation;

101
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,800
lots of individuals living in close quarters
can make infections spread like crazy.

102
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,460
Now, I don't think that the Dallas mosquitoes are going to run out of vertebrates to dine on any time soon,

103
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:49,739
but let's say hypothetically that the explosion
of local mosquito populations caused a similar

104
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,689
explosion in the number of Mexican free-tailed bats, the official flying mammal of the state of Texas.

105
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:59,600
And they eat mosquitoes -- that would be a
limiting factor that was density-dependent.

106
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,900
More mosquitoes leads to more bats, which
leads to fewer mosquitoes.

107
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:07,799
It's pretty simple. When density-dependent limitations start to kick in, and start to limit the population's growth,

108
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,389
that means that the habitat's carrying capacity
has been reached.

109
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,280
But the other type of limiting factor, the
density-independent ones,

110
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,429
have nothing to do with how many individuals
there are or how dense the population is.

111
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,470
A lot of times these limitations are described
in terms of some catastrophe:

112
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,160
a volcanic eruption, a monsoon, a Chernobyl.

113
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,920
In any case, some crucial aspect of the population's lifestyle changes enough that it makes it harder to get by.

114
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,020
But these factors don't have to be super dramatic.

115
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,620
Going back to mosquitoes, say in 2013 there's
a huge thunderstorm,

116
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:37,930
a real gully-washer, in Dallas every day for
three months.

117
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,480
That's going to disturb the clutches of mosquito
eggs hanging out in the stagnant waters,

118
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,129
so the number born that year would be substantially
smaller.

119
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,579
By the same token, if the temperature swung
the other way, and it was unseasonably cold

120
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,560
all summer, the bugs' growth rate would drop.

121
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,509
Now the truth is, there are a billion and
a half situations, both big and small,

122
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:59,230
that could lead to a population either reaching its carrying capacity or collapsing because of external factors.

123
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:05,230
It's a population ecologist's job to figure out what those factors are. And that is what math is for.

124
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,669
Our friend math says that any population of
anything -- ANYTHING --

125
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:12,348
will grow exponentially unless there's some
reason that it can't.

126
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:17,420
Exponential growth means that the population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population.

127
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,100
So here at the beginning of 2012, we might
have only had a thousand mosquitoes in Dallas,

128
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,490
but then, after say one month, we got 3,000.

129
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,040
Now with 3x as many reproducing mosquitoes, the population grew 3x as fast as when there were 1,000,

130
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,899
so then there are 9,000, at which point it's growing 3x as fast as when there were 3,000, and on and on into infinity.

131
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:40,958
And in this scenario, the mosquitoes are all "Carrying capacity my chitin-covered butt! There's no stoppin' us!"

132
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,360
But you know what doesn't really happen?
I mean, it can happen for a while --

133
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,080
humans have been on an exponential growth curve since the Industrial Revolution, for example.

134
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,059
But eventually, something always knocks the
population size back down.

135
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:56,919
That thing might be a density-dependent factor
like food scarcity or an epidemic

136
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,779
or a density-independent one like an asteroid
that takes out the whole continent.

137
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,639
Regardless, this exponential growth curve
can't go up forever.

138
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,899
And when those factors come into play, a population
experiences only logistic growth.

139
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,578
This means that the population is limited
to the carrying capacity of its habitat,

140
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:15,359
which, when you think about it, ain't too
much to ask.

141
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,339
See how this graph flattens up at the top?

142
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:22,100
The factor that creates that plateau is almost
always a density-dependent limitation.

143
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,980
As you add mosquitoes, eventually the rate
of population growth is going to slow down

144
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,139
because they run out of food or space.
And when we get to where that number levels off,

145
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,389
that number is the carrying capacity of the
mosquito population in that particular habitat.

146
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:38,580
Now, let's apply all of these ideas using
a simple equation that will allow us to calculate

147
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,490
the population growth of anything we feel
like.

148
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,879
I know, it's math, but wake up because this is important
-- the city of Dallas is depending on you!

149
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,960
So, let's calculate the growth of Dallas's
mosquito population over a span of two weeks.

150
00:09:51,960 --> 00:10:02,920
All we have to do to get the rate of growth, that's r, is take the number of births minus the number of deaths,

151
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:08,719
and then divide that all by the initial population
size

152
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,000
(which we generally just call N).

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,240
So let's say with start with an initial population
of a hundred mosquitoes,

154
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,860
and each of those mosquitoes lives and average of 2 weeks so our deaths, over a span of 2 weeks, will be 100.

155
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,509
Half of these mosquitoes are going to be female,
so 50 of them,

156
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:30,539
and they can produce about 2,000 babies in
their lifetime, so that's times 2,000.

157
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:39,679
So 50 mommy mosquitoes times 2,000 babies per mommy and you get births equaling 100,000 little baby mosquitoes.

158
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:42,909
Once we plug in all the numbers into this
equation, even though this is totally a hypothetical,

159
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,850
we will see the true scope of Dallas's mosquito
problem.

160
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,930
So blink!, in two weeks the population had
100,000 babies and only 100 of them died,

161
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:55,838
so this is a population growth rate, if you
do the math, of 999.

162
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,059
This means that for every mosquito out there
at the beginning of 2 weeks, there will be

163
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,278
999 more at the end of 2 weeks.

164
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,399
That is a 99,800% increase, by THOR'S HAMMER!

165
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,699
Again, these are hypothetical numbers, but
it gives you a sense of how a population can

166
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,349
just go out of control when all the factors
that we talk about go in its favor.

167
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,550
And you guys haven't even seen trouble until
you've seen what the graph of human population

168
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,458
looks like over the last couple millennia.

169
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,688
But to find out more about that, you going
to have to join us next week.

170
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:28,509
Until then, thank you for watching this episode
of Crash Course: Ecology,

171
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:29,970
and thanks to everyone who helped put it together.

172
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,129
The table of contents is over there if you
want to go rewatch anything,

173
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:37,740
and if you have any questions for us we're on Facebook, and Twitter, and of course, in the comments below.

174
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,159
See you next time.
