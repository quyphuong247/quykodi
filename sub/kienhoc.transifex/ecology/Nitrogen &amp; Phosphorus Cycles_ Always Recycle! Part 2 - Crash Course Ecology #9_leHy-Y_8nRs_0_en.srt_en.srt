1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
There's nothing quite so terrible as needing something that's sitting right in front of you but not being able to get it.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,349
Like say you're on a lifeboat in the ocean
and you're super thirsty,

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:13,359
and there's 300,000,000 cubic miles of water sitting right in front of you, but you can't drink any of it.

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,960
Or having to sit next to Megan Kale every
day in math class,

5
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:19,660
but knowing she's really dramatically out
of your league.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,969
A lot of organisms on earth find themselves
in this situation, pretty much constantly,

7
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:28,079
except that the thing that's everywhere that
they can't have isn't water or physical closeness;

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,500
it's nutrients,
specifically, nitrogen and phosphorus.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,210
Of course, there are tons of elements that
cycle around the earth

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,370
hanging out in one place or form for a while
before moving on to the next,

11
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:40,049
and as you know, living things need a bunch
of stuff.

12
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,879
Animals, for instance, need oxygen and carbon
and hydrogen.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,859
These elements basically cover the water cycle and the carbon cycle that I talked about last time,

14
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:50,879
but we're also about 3% nitrogen and 1% phosphorus.

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,989
Those numbers might not sound super significant,

16
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:55,529
but even though we've just got teensy bits
of the stuff in our bodies,

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,759
we need nitrogen to make like, amino acids,
which make proteins,

18
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,390
which make our whole bodies up, and DNA and
RNA, too.

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,609
DNA and RNA also require phosphorus, not to
mention that phosphorus is the P in ATP,

20
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,849
and the Phosphorus in phospholipid bi-layer.

21
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,909
So we might not need a ton of the stuff, but
it is important, and it's hanging out everywhere;

22
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:18,310
the air we breathe is mostly nitrogen, and the water and rocks all around us are jam-packed full of phosphorus.

23
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,650
But like I said, they're rarely in a form
that's biologically available.

24
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,750
And as per usual, the organisms that solve
this problem are the plants.

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,060
Anything else that needs these nutrients are
just gonna have to eat some plants

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,600
or eat something that ate some plants.

27
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,599
But how do plants solve this problem? And
why is it a problem in the first place?

28
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,879
Well, give me a few minutes, I'll explain.

29
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:46,399
[Theme Music]

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,478
So let's talk about the nitrogen cycle first,
since nitrogen really is actually all around us,

31
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,200
like I can feel it right now, there it is
in the air.

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,969
So why is it so hard to get this stuff that's
constantly surrounding us in the air

33
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,789
into our actual bodies to be useful for us?

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,799
Because even though nitrogen gas makes up
about 78% of the atmosphere,

35
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,879
you'll notice here that nitrogen gas is made up of two nitrogen atoms stuck together with a triple bond.

36
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,919
And it's one thing to break apart a single
covalent bond, but three?

37
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,119
So as you can imagine, those two nitrogen
atoms are a total pain to pry apart.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,840
But that molecule has to be split in order
for a plant to get at the pieces.

39
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:25,188
In fact, plants can assimilate a bunch of different forms of nitrogen, nitrates, nitrites to a lesser extent,

40
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:28,229
and even ammonium, which is what you get when
you mix ammonia with water.

41
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:32,509
But all that darn nitrogen gas in the atmosphere
is beyond their powers of assimilation.

42
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:36,620
So plants need help taking advantage of this
ocean of nitrogen that we're all swimming in,

43
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,819
which is why they need to have that nitrogen
fixed, so that they can use it.

44
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,479
Even though plants aren't wily enough to wrangle
those two nitrogen atoms apart,

45
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,060
certain nitrogen fixing bacteria are.

46
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:51,419
These bacteria hang out in soil or water or
even form symbiotic relationships with the

47
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,879
root nodules of some plants,
most of which are legumes.

48
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,680
That's a pretty big family of plants:
soybeans, clover, peanuts, kudzu, all legumes.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,409
So these bacteria just sit around converting
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia,

50
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:07,329
which then becomes ammonium when it's mixed
with water, which can be used by plants.

51
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,800
They do this with a special enzyme called
nitrogenase,

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,000
which is the only biological enzyme that can
break that crazy triple bond.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Ammonia can also be made by decomposers, fungi,
protists,

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,250
other kinds of bacteria that munch on your
proteins and DNA after you die,

55
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,209
but they're not picky, they like poop and
urine, too.

56
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,939
Then once this has happened, other bacteria known as nitrifying bacteria can take this ammonia

57
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:34,239
and convert it into nitrates, three oxygen atoms attached to a single nitrogen atom, and nitrites,

58
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,830
two oxygen atoms attached to a nitrogen,

59
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,930
and those are even easier than ammonium for
plants to assimilate.

60
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,969
So the take home here is that if it wasn't
for these bacteria,

61
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:45,769
there'd be a whole lot less of biologically
available nitrogen hanging around,

62
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,200
and as a result, there'd be a lot fewer living
things on the planet.

63
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,518
So as usual, thanks bacteria -- we owe you
one!

64
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,489
But I should mention that it's not just bacteria
who can wrangle those two nitrogen atoms apart.

65
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,120
Lightning, of all things, has enough energy
to break the bonds between nitrogens,

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,400
which is obviously awesome, and therefore
worth mentioning, and in the 20th century,

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,980
smartypants humans also figured out various ways to synthetically fix a ton of nitrogen all at once,

68
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:13,359
which is why we have synthetic fertilizers now and so much food growing all over the place.

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,759
Once the atmospheric nitrogen is converted into a form that plants can use to make DNA and RNA and amino acids,

70
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,240
organic nitrogen takes off up the food chain
and animals eat the plants and use all that sweet,

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,439
sweet bio-available nitrogen to make our own
amino acids,

72
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,879
and then we pee or poop it out or die and
the decomposers go to town on it,

73
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,418
breaking it down to ammonia and it all keeps
going...until!

74
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:39,848
One day, that organic nitrogen finds itself
in denitrifying bacteria,

75
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:42,259
whose job it is to metabolize the nitrogen
oxides,

76
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:47,348
turn them back into nitrogen gas using a special
enzyme called nitrate reductase.

77
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:51,418
These guys do their business and then release
the N2 back into the atmosphere.

78
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:53,878
And that, my friends, is the nitrogen cycle.

79
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,979
If you remember nothing else, remember that:

80
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:00,308
a) you owe bacteria a solid because they were
smart enough to make an enzyme that can bust

81
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:02,330
open the triple bonds of nitrogen gas,

82
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:07,158
b) you owe plants a solid for wrestling nitrogen
into their bodies so that you can just eat

83
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:09,269
a carrot and not have to think about it,

84
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:15,659
and c) nitrogen is awesome and everywhere and yet, also elusive and deserving of your respect.

85
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,900
So, moving on, to the phosphorus cycle.

86
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:21,998
The interesting thing about phosphorus is
that it's the only element that we're going

87
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:25,139
to talk about that doesn't involve the atmosphere.

88
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,699
Phosphorus wants nothing to do with your air.

89
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,759
However, the lithosphere, fancy word for the
earth's crust, is amply supplied with phosphorus.

90
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,938
Rocks contain inorganic phosphates, especially sedimentary rocks that originated in old ocean floors

91
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,710
and lake beds where living things died and
sank to the bottom

92
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:45,250
where their phosphorus rich bodies piled up
and made phosphorus rich rocks over time.

93
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,418
Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of rock-eating
organisms on earth, just a couple bacteria,

94
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,778
which are called lithotrophs, by the way.

95
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:54,918
However, when these rocks are re-exposed and
water erodes them,

96
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:57,008
some of the phosphates are dissolved into
the water.

97
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:01,460
These dissolved phosphates are immediately
available to and assimilated by plants,

98
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,659
which are then eaten by animals.

99
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,600
From here, the same thing goes for the decomposers
as with the nitrogen cycle,

100
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,158
when a leaf drops or something poops or dies,

101
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:14,069
the decomposers break it down and release
the phosphates back into the soil or water.

102
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,809
And phosphates get about as much downtime
in the soil as a $20 bill on the sidewalk.

103
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:23,119
Decomposed phosphate is immediately reassimilated
back into plants and this little cycle just

104
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,460
keeps going and going.

105
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,938
Plants to the animal to the decomposers to
the soil and back into a plant

106
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:32,629
— that is, until that atom of phosphorus
makes its way into some kind of body of water.

107
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:36,289
Because aquatic and marine ecosystems need
phosphorus like crazy.

108
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:40,868
Once a phosphorus atom makes its way into a deep lake or ocean, it cycles around among the organisms there —

109
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:44,889
algae, plankton, fish, and this cycling can
go on for a long time.

110
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:48,809
I mean, not as long as a phosphorus atom trapped
in a rock, that can be millions of years,

111
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:53,569
but by some estimates, a single phosphorus
atom can be caught in a biological cycle for

112
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:55,369
a 100,000 years.

113
00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:00,700
Eventually, it's in something that dies and falls into a hole so deep that decomposers can't survive there.

114
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,779
Then sedimentation builds up and turns into
rock, which are eventually uplifted into mountains

115
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,628
and exposed and the phosphates are weathered
back out and it's a cycle!

116
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,809
So yeah, that's the deal with nitrogen and
phosphorus, living things need them,

117
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,840
but even though they're all over the place,

118
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,179
they're at a premium in biological systems because they're hard to get at,

119
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,720
either because they have to be converted
into a form that organisms can use,

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,379
or they're locked away underground.

121
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,699
But you know who the smartest monkeys are?
Us.

122
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,439
And yeah, you can bet your face that we've
figured out how to unleash all kinds of

123
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,269
nitrogen and phosphorus into this big green
planet.

124
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:35,699
Mostly, in an effort to help feed our children
and each other.

125
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:38,788
We usually mean well, but we can be a bit
overbearing sometimes.

126
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:43,088
It's just the human way, to see something
in nature that seems to be lacking or imperfect

127
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,759
and try to make it the best thing ever.

128
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,819
So with the phosphorus and nitrogen cycles, we have introduced fertilizers, lots and lots of fertilizers,

129
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:53,878
the main ingredients of which are, you guessed
it, nitrogen and phosphorus.

130
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,439
The story of how we learned to synthesize
nitrogen into ammonia for fertilizers

131
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,729
and chemical weapons is a very, very interesting
one involving an evil lunatic,

132
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:05,359
and I suggest as soon as this is over, you
watch this video on Fritz Haber,

133
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,980
the guy who made all this happen during World
War I.

134
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,960
You've heard of too much of a good thing,
right?

135
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,738
Well, through the miracle of synthetic fertilizers,

136
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:16,128
we're able to grow much, much more food than
we ever have before, and as a result,

137
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,240
ecosystems all over the world are being bombarded by these incredible amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus.

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,639
This takes us into the next chapter in our exploration of ecology, the human impacts on the biosphere.

139
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,069
Sometimes, out of our desire to make nature
better,

140
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,778
sometimes out of stupid human selfishness,
and most often both,

141
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:39,129
we've ended up really messing up the environment
in more ways than we can count.

142
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:41,908
And that's what we're going to be talking
about next week — be sure to wear your gas

143
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,218
mask and HazMat gloves,
