1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
There's a lot of ideas that we just assume that we know a lot about because we hear about them all the time.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,500
For instance, I know what pop music is, but
if you were to corner me at a party and say,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,160
"Hank, what is pop music?",

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,359
I'd be like, "It's, uh...it's like, uh...the
music that plays on the pop station?"

5
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,189
Just because we're familiar with a concept
does not mean that we actually understand it.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,540
Ecology's kind of the same way, even though
it's a common,

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,630
everyday concept and "ecosystem" is a word
that we hear a lot,

8
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:27,408
I think most of us would be a little stumped if somebody actually asked us what an ecosystem is,

9
00:00:27,408 --> 00:00:30,019
or how one works, or why they're important,
etc.

10
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,259
I find it helps to think of an ecosystem

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,159
-- a collection of living and nonliving things interacting in a specific place --

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,698
as one of those Magic Eye posters, for those
of you who were sentient back in 1994.

13
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:43,420
An ecosystem is just a jumble of organisms,
and weather patterns, and geology,

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,120
and other stuff that don't make a lot of sense
together until you stare at 'em long enough,

15
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,699
from far enough away and then suddenly a picture
emerges.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,600
And just like with Magic Eye posters, it helps if you're listening to Jamiroquai while you're doing it.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,160
So the discipline of ecosystem ecology, just like other types of ecology we've been exploring lately,

18
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,479
looks at a particular level of biological
interaction on Earth.

19
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,799
But unlike population ecology, which looks at interactions between individuals of one species,

20
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,070
or community ecology, which looks at how bunches
of living things interact with each other,

21
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:16,329
ecosystem ecology looks at how energy and
materials come into an ecosystem,

22
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,519
move around in it, and then get spat back
out.

23
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,069
In the end, ecosystem ecology is mostly about
eating --

24
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:25,839
who's eating whom and how energy, nutrients, and other materials are getting shuffled around within the system.

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,140
So today, we're setting the record straight: no more not understanding how an ecosystem works, starting now!

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:41,659
[Theme Music]

27
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,938
So ecosystems may be a lot like Magic Eye
posters,

28
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:48,318
but the way that they're not like a Magic Eye poster is in the way that posters have edges.

29
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,059
Ecosystems, I'll just come out and say it:

30
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,500
NO EDGE, only fuzzy, ill-defined gradients
that bleed into the ecosystems next-door.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,719
So actually defining an ecosystem can be kind of hard; mostly it depends on what you want to study.

32
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,859
Say you're looking at a stream in the mountains.

33
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:07,700
The stream gets very little sunlight because it's so small that the trees on its banks totally cover it with shade.

34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,400
As a result, very few plants or algae live in it, and if there's one thing that we know about Planet Earth,

35
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:16,090
it's that plants are king -- without plants,
there are no animals.

36
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,490
But somehow, there's a whole community of animals living in and around this mountain stream,

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,340
even though there are few plants in it.

38
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,939
So what are the animals doing there, and how
are they making their living?

39
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,000
From the land, of course --
from the ecosystems around it.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,860
Because no stream is an island, it isn't there all by itself.

41
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,680
All kinds of food, and nutrient,s and other
materials drop into the stream from the trees,

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
or are washed into it when it rains.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,760
Leaves and bugs, you name it, flow down from
neighboring terrestrial ecosystems.

44
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,969
And that stuff gets eaten by bigger bugs,
which get eaten by fish,

45
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,739
which in turn are eaten by raccoons and birds
and bears.

46
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,378
So even though this stream's got its own thing
going on, without the rest of the watershed,

47
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:53,079
the animals there wouldn't survive.

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,580
And without the stream, plants would be thirsty and terrestrial animals wouldn't have as many fish to eat.

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,040
So, where does the ecosystem of the stream
start and where does it end?

50
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,719
This is a perennial problem for ecologists
because the way it works:

51
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,269
energy and nutrients are imported in from
some place,

52
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,719
they're absorbed by the residents of an ecosystem and then passed around within it for a little while,

53
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,019
and then finally passed out, sometimes into
another ecosystem.

54
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,900
This is most obvious in aquatic systems where
little streams eventually join bigger and

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,420
bigger waterways until they finally reach
the ocean.

56
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,729
This flow is a fundamental property of ecosystems.

57
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:26,709
So at the end of the day, how you define an
ecosystem just depends on what you want to know.

58
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,840
If you want to know how energy and materials
come in, move through,

59
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:35,399
and are pooped out of a knot in a tree that has a very specific community of insects and protists living in it,

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,039
you can call that an ecosystem.

61
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,900
If you want to know how energy and materials
are introduced to, used,

62
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,080
and expelled by the North Pacific Gyre, you
can call that an ecosystem.

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,180
And if you want to know how energy and materials
move around a cardboard box

64
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,659
that has a rabbit and a piece of lettuce in
it, you can call that an ecosystem.

65
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:53,090
I might tell you that your ecosystem is stupid,
but go ahead, do whatever you want.

66
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,039
The picture you see in an ecosystem's Magic Eye is actually dictated by the organisms that live there,

67
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,019
and how they use what comes into it.

68
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,489
An ecosystem can be measured through figuring
out things like its biomass,

69
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,150
that is, the total weight of living things
in the ecosystem, and its productivity --

70
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,939
how much stuff is produced and how quickly stuff grows back, how good the ecosystem is at retaining stuff.

71
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,740
And of course, all these parameters matter
to neighboring ecosystems as well

72
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,449
because if one ecosystem is really productive,
the ones next-door are going to benefit.

73
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:23,000
So, first things first, where do the energy
and materials come from?

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,459
And to be clear, when I talk about materials, I'm talking about water or nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen,

75
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,859
or even toxins like mercury or DDT.

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,580
Let's start out by talking about energy because
nothing lives without energy

77
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:37,039
and where organisms get their energy tells
the story of an ecosystem.

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,420
You remember physics, right?

79
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,490
The laws of conservation state that energy
and matter can neither be destroyed or created;

80
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,920
they can only get transferred from place to
place to place.

81
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,439
The same is true of an ecosystem.

82
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,339
Organisms in an ecosystem organize themselves
into a trophic structure,

83
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,839
with each organism situating itself in a certain
place in the food chain.

84
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,379
All of the energy in an ecosystem moves around
within this structure,

85
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,159
because when I say energy, of course I mean
food.

86
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,180
For most ecosystems, the primary source of
energy is the sun,

87
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,699
and the organisms that do most of the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy -- you know this one.

88
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,279
Who rules the world?
The plants rule the world.

89
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,319
Autotrophs like plants are able to gather
up the sun's energy,

90
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:20,819
and through photosynthesis, make something awesome out of it: little stored packets of chemical energy.

91
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,139
So whether it's plants, bacteria, or protists
that use photosynthesis,

92
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,399
autotrophs are always the lynchpin of every
ecosystem --

93
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,620
the foundation upon which all other organisms
in the system get their energy and nutrients.

94
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,199
For this reason, ecologists refer to plants
as primary producers.

95
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,019
Now obviously, the way that energy gets transferred from plant to animals is by the animal eating the plant.

96
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,680
For this reason, herbivores are known as primary
consumers,

97
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,139
the first heterotrophs to get their grubby
paws on that sweet, sweet energy.

98
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,639
After this stage of the trophic structure,

99
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,319
the only way to wrestle the solar energy that was in the plants that the herbivore ate is to -- you guessed it --

100
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,199
eat the herbivore, which carnivores, known as
secondary consumers, are very happy to do.

101
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,060
And assuming that the ecosystem is big enough
and productive enough,

102
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:06,839
there might even be a higher level of carnivore that eats other carnivores, like an owl that eats hawks,

103
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,929
and these guys are called tertiary consumers.

104
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,019
And then there are the -vores that decompose
all the dead animal and plant matter, as well

105
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,799
as the animal poop: detritivores.

106
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,160
These include earthworms and sea stars and
fiddler crabs and dung beetles and fungi

107
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,480
and anything else that eats the stuff that none of the rest of us would touch with a three-meter pole.

108
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,460
So that's a nice hierarchical look at who's getting energy from what or whom within an ecosystem,

109
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:32,719
but of course organisms within an ecosystem
don't usually abide by these rules very closely,

110
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,740
which is why these days we usually talk about
food webs rather than food chains.

111
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,860
A food web takes into consideration that sometimes a fungus is going to be eating nutrients from a dead squirrel,

112
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,879
and other times squirrels are going to be
eating the fungi.

113
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,019
Sometimes a bear likes to munch on primary
producers, blueberry bushes,

114
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:50,810
and other times it's going to be snacking
on a secondary consumer, like a salmon.

115
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,120
And even at the tippy-tippy top, predators
get eaten by stuff like bacteria in the end,

116
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,019
which might or might not be the same bacteria that eat the top predator's poopies. Circle of life!

117
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:04,319
It's also worth noting that the size and scope of the food web in an ecosystem has a lot to do with things

118
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:08,990
like water and temperature, because water
and temperature are what plants like, right?

119
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,480
And without plants, there isn't going to be
a whole lot of trophic action going on.

120
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,090
Take for example the Sonoran desert, which
we've talked about before.

121
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:17,750
There aren't many plants there, compared to
say, the Amazon rainforest,

122
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,689
so the primary producers are limited by the
lack of water,

123
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,490
which means that primary consumers are limited
by lack of primary producers.

124
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,710
And that leaves precious few secondary consumers:
a few snakes and coyotes and hawks.

125
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:33,039
All this adds up to the Sonoran not being a terribly productive place, compared to the Amazon at least,

126
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,900
so you might only get to the level of tertiary
consumer occasionally.

127
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:40,919
Now all this conversation about productivity leads me to another point, about ecosystem efficiency.

128
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,720
When I talk about energy getting passed along
from one place to another within an ecosystem,

129
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,460
I mean that in a general sense organisms are sustaining each other, but not in a particularly efficient way.

130
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,299
In fact, when energy transfers from one place to another, from a plant to a bunny or from a bunny or a snake,

131
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,870
the vast majority of that energy is lost along
the way.

132
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,939
So let's take a cricket. That cricket has
about one calorie of energy in it.

133
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:06,100
And in order to get that one calorie of energy,
it had to eat about 10 calories of lettuce.

134
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,920
Where did the other nine calories go?
It is not turned into cricket flesh.

135
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,720
Most of it is used just to live, like to power its muscles or run the sodium-potassium pumps in its neurons.

136
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,940
It's just used up.

137
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:21,899
So only the one calorie of the original 10 calories of food is left over as actual cricket stuff.

138
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:25,859
And then right after his last meal, the cricket jumps into a spider web and is eaten by a spider,

139
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,720
who converts only 10% of the cricket's energy
into actual spider stuff.

140
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,759
And don't get me started on the bird that eats the spider; this is not an efficient world that we live in.

141
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,750
But do you want to know what's scary efficient?
The accumulation of toxins in an ecosystem.

142
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,190
Elements like mercury, which are puffed out
of the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants,

143
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,140
end up getting absorbed in the ocean by green
algae and marine plants.

144
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:50,199
While the tiny animal that eats the algae only stores 10% of the energy it got, it keeps 100% of the mercury.

145
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,480
So as we move up the chain, each trophic level
consumes ten times more mercury than the last.

146
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,600
And that's what we call bioaccumulation.

147
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,159
Concentrations get much higher at each trophic
level

148
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:03,529
until a human gets ahold of that giant tuna
that's at the top of the marine food chain,

149
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,209
and none of that mercury has been lost.

150
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,420
It's all right there in that delicious tuna
flesh.

151
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:11,269
Because organisms only hold on to 10% of the
energy they ingest,

152
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,299
each trophic level has to eat about ten times
its biomass to sustain itself.

153
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:18,799
And because 100% of that mercury moves up
the food chain,

154
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,459
that means that it becomes ten times more
concentrated with each trophic level it enters.

155
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,920
That's why we need to take the seafood advisory
seriously.

156
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,479
As somebody who could eat anything you wanted, it's probably safest to eat lower on the food chain:

157
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,720
primary producers or primary consumers.

158
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,350
The older, bigger, higher-in-the-food-chain,
the more toxic it's going to be.

159
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,750
And that's not just my opinion, that's ecosystem
ecology.

160
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,799
