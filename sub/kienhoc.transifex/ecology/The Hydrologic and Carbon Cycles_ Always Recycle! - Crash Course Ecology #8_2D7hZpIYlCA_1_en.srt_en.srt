1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
Adorable story alert!

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,810
So I was hanging out with my 2-year-old second
cousin in the ocean in Florida

3
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:08,949
and we're jumping up and down with the waves and it's fun but then the water got all calm and I said,

4
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:13,799
"Oh, no more waves!," because, like, that's the top tier of communication I'm going for with a 2-year-old,

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,500
but then he said "Don't worry, there'll be
more!"

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,390
And I was like, "How do you know?"

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,278
And he was like, "It's a cycle!"

8
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,390
Yes! It is a cycle!
The Earth is filled with cycles!

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,550
And if my 2-year-old second cousin knows it
you should know it too!

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,589
The universe is the great recycler.

11
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:33,170
All of the stuff we have on Earth, every last
particle of matter or calorie of energy has

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,480
been around since the Big Bang.

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,828
It just keeps getting repurposed over and
over again.

14
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,280
And when it comes to matter, at least, the
Earth is essentially a closed system.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,920
All the matter gets passed around in continuous
biogeochemical cycles,

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,570
which are pathways for molecules like water
or elements like carbon and nitrogen and phosphorous

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,929
to move through all of the Earth's various
ecological and geological compartments.

18
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:57,390
Now of course we couldn't possibly talk about how all matter gets cycled around Earth in one video,

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,268
'cause the Earth is pretty big,

20
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:03,289
but consider this as an introduction to biogeochemical
cycles starring my two personal favorites:

21
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:04,799
carbon and water.

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:14,459
[Theme Music]

23
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:17,539
Now I'm sure you already know about at least
one type of planet-wide recycling because

24
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,250
it's the most obvious to us:

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,200
the hydrologic cycle which describes how water moves on, above, and below the surface of the Earth

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,040
driven by the energy supplied by the Sun and
the wind.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,390
In talking about the hydrologic cycle it's
most useful to think about all of the water

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,109
on Earth being held in a series of reservoirs.

29
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:37,430
The ocean, for instance, or the atmosphere
in the form of clouds or in polar ice caps.

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,200
So not only does water cycle through different
places,

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,890
it also takes different forms in different
places in the cycle: liquid, solid, or gas.

32
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,750
And since it's a cycle there is no beginning and no end, so where we start our discussion is arbitrary,

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,780
but we're going to start it off with precipitation.

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,079
Rain, hail, snow, sleet, graupel, all of that
stuff is precipitation.

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,209
It happens when water that's being held in
the atmosphere condenses,

36
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,739
or turns from a gas into a liquid and then occasionally freezes into a solid, right up in the air.

37
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,419
The opposite of condensation, of course, it
evaporation, the conversion of a liquid into a gas

38
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,719
and when a substance converts straight from
a solid to a gas that's sublimation

39
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,229
and when it's from a gas to a solid that's
deposition.

40
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:14,000
And now you know.
But back to condensation.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,340
It is responsible for the formation of clouds,

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,640
which happens when air containing water vapor rises and cools,

43
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,279
or is compressed to the point that it can no longer be a gas.

44
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,250
At this point, the vapor forms droplets.

45
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,819
This is the same thing you see happening on
your glass of ice tea on a humid day.

46
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,539
The water in the air around the glass gets
cold, and turns from gas into liquid.

47
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:37,500
So a cloud is just a big pile of condensed water droplets, in a sense, it's a gigantic floating reservoir.

48
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,900
Clouds are a handy feature of the hydrologic
cycle,

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,140
because as they drift over the landscape they
move water around the globe.

50
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:46,459
So water that evaporates over the ocean can
be deposited somewhere else.

51
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,219
Otherwise, if water always got deposited right
where it evaporated,

52
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,000
the precipitation would be almost always right
over the ocean,

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,639
because that's where most of the evaporation
on Earth takes place.

54
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,399
So wind moves clouds, and as water keeps condensing
clouds get heavier and heavier

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,849
until our old friend gravity takes over and
pulls the condensed droplets to the ground

56
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,370
in the form of rain or in the form of snow
or hail or sleet or graupel.

57
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,879
So now the water's on the ground,

58
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,919
but gravity continues to work on it pulling it towards its resting place wherever that might be.

59
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,500
It either pulls the water across the surface of the land to the lowest point in a process called runoff,

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,939
or it pulls it underground.

61
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:21,500
Water can be trapped or stored for a little
while in places like lakes and ponds and wetlands,

62
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:25,129
but most of the water that falls as precipitation
gets pulled lower and lower and lower

63
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:28,469
as runoff through the creeks and streams and
rivers until it reaches the ocean.

64
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:34,830
In really cold places, water of course freezes and hangs around as ice in places for thousands of years at a time,

65
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,660
like at the poles and glaciers and on mountaintops, but when it melts, most of it too runs off into the ocean.

66
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,379
So you see where this is going.

67
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:44,789
Oceans are a big deal -- they're pretty much
the biggest deal.

68
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,400
They're the reason that we have the hydrologic
cycle in the first place.

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,030
They're also the reason that we have awesome
stuff like weather, and life, on Earth.

70
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,330
The weird thing about oceans though is that
they're salty.

71
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,800
And there is a reason for this!

72
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,820
As water runs to the ocean it erodes minerals like salt from soil and carries it to the ocean.

73
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,180
Now water heading to the ocean may not taste
salty but the salt's in there.

74
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:08,109
But here's the thing: when the water evaporates again, the salt doesn't evaporate with it, it gets left behind.

75
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,470
You keep this up for a few billion years with
the pure water evaporating from the ocean

76
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:16,379
and returning with tiny amounts of salt and that's your recipe for a billion cubic kilometers of brine.

77
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:20,959
And all of this shows us that the world's oceans are literally the last stop for all the liquid water on Earth.

78
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,370
The only way to get out of there is through
evaporation and that leaves all your minerals behind.

79
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,769
Now living things also have their role to
play in the hydrologic cycle,

80
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:33,620
and both plants and animals that break down carbohydrates to produce energy produces water as a waste product.

81
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,800
So we lose water through evaporation from our skin and exhale water vapor and of course we pee it out.

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,579
Indeed most organisms on Earth are made mostly
of water,

83
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,789
although that water cycles in and out of us
pretty quickly.

84
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,830
In plants, water is sucked up through the
roots and moves up to the leaves

85
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,839
(the gas exchange organs) where it evaporates
quickly.

86
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,299
This process is called evapotranspiration. And since there are so many plants here on Earth

87
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,379
it's responsible for a good amount of the
water that enters the atmosphere.

88
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,980
This process is essentially the opposite of condensation in that it turns liquid water into gas.

89
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,460
The energy of the sun drives evaporation whether it's the surface of the ocean or from treetops and leaves,

90
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:11,060
and then once all of that water evaporates into the atmosphere we're right back where we started.

91
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,060
It's a cycle!

92
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,019
So now that you know a little bit about the
hydrologic cycle,

93
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:17,449
it's a little easier to understand how the
carbon cycle works.

94
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:22,259
Carbon is one of the most abundant elements in the universe and here on Earth it's always on the move,

95
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,240
just like water, jumping from one reservoir
to the next.

96
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,918
And that's a good thing because

97
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,079
A) all living things require carbon for their
structure and to fuel their bodies

98
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,899
and B) it's a big component in a bunch of
non-living things as well.

99
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,259
It's in rocks, in the ocean, trapped in ice.

100
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,009
Plus, it's in the atmosphere, where it helps
regulate the temperature.

101
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,639
Without carbon dioxide Earth would basically
be a frozen wasteland,

102
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,210
so lucky for us, there's a whole pants-load
of carbon out there, 'cause we need it!

103
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,979
Let's start off with the carbon in living
things.

104
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,569
If you were to take all of the water out of
your body,

105
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,060
carbon would constitute about half of what remained in the little pile of dust that used to be you.

106
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,740
And the first biological carbon reservoir
is plants.

107
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,759
They absorb a bunch of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere because they need it to photosynthesize.

108
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,699
But CO2 is also one of the by-products of respiration, the process by which they use that energy.

109
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,910
So plants take in carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere during photosynthesis

110
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,370
and then release CO2 back out into the atmosphere
during their respiration process to make ATP

111
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,840
for all their cellular functions.

112
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,219
And right now, you're like,

113
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,630
"Wait-wait-wait-no isn't it the deal that
plants get to take in all the carbon dioxide

114
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,569
and animals get to breathe it out?"

115
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,469
Well, yes and no; it's just that plants take
in more CO2 from the atmosphere than they

116
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,260
give off though respiration.

117
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:33,959
The rest is like their profit; it's what becomes
the body of the plant.

118
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,519
That's right, that big-ol' massive tree, all
that mass, came from gas. Pretty cool.

119
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,939
So carbon absorbed by plants has three possible
fates.

120
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,819
It can be respired back into the atmosphere,
it can be eaten by an animal,

121
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:48,109
or it can be present when the plant dies.

122
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,919
And if a tree falls in the right kind of forest,

123
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,840
and it's not allowed to decompose normally because a bunch of other plants all fell right on top of it,

124
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,819
and they die and they get buried and squished
together and form rocks like coal.

125
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,139
We call these carbon-rich geological deposits
fossil fuels.

126
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,899
Lately one of humanity's very favorite pastimes
is digging up all of this carbon

127
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,449
in the form of carbon and natural gas, and
burning it to fuel our, pretty much everythings.

128
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,629
But I'll get to that later.

129
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,529
Another extremely important carbon reservoir
is the ocean.

130
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:16,879
Now carbon dioxide dissolves really easily
in water,

131
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,180
and once it's in there all of it's used by
phytoplankton

132
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,139
(tiny plant-like organisms that form the base
for the marine food chain).

133
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,720
They use it to do photosynthesis and they
also use it to form calcium carbonate shells.

134
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,710
And when these guys die, their shells settle
to the bottom of the ocean, pile up,

135
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,060
become compressed and over time, make rocks
like limestone.

136
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,870
Now limestone, obviously doesn't burn super
well, so it's not considered a fossil fuel,

137
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,840
but as limestone deposits are eroded by water, the calcium carbonate is broken down to eventually form,

138
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,788
among other things, carbon dioxide and carbonic
acid.

139
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:50,408
We make lime and cement by heating limestone, which produces a pretty good amount of carbon dioxide.

140
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,150
And when we do burn fossil fuels such as coal
and petroleum products and natural gases

141
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:58,038
it also releases carbon in the form of carbon
dioxide that's been stored for hundreds of

142
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,178
millions of years in the geosphere,

143
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,780
which is just a fancy science-y word for Earth-rocks.

144
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:08,019
This process is what started the atmosphere carbon dioxide rising like crazy in the past couple of hundred years.

145
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:11,609
And the excess of the carbon in the atmosphere
causes global climate change,

146
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,199
because CO2 in the atmosphere causes some of the sun's energy from re-radiating back out into space.

147
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,099
So yeah, our planet has been getting warmer
because we've been burning through this reservoir

148
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,759
of carbon that we had locked underground.

149
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
This is causing all kinds of problems that
we can see already,

150
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,379
and it's very likely to keep causing bigger
and bigger problems with time.

151
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:31,110
And the situation could be helped a lot if
we could just stop unlocking all of that carbon

152
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,719
and spitting it into the atmosphere,

153
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,499
but in some respects we don't even have control
over the situation any more, because of ice.

154
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,999
Remember how I said that carbon is often trapped
in ice?

155
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:44,099
Well, in places like Siberia, and northern Canada and Alaska, cold places that also have plants,

156
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,879
they contain huge carbon reserves that are trapped in permafrost (ground that's frozen year-round).

157
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:54,399
These places are basically frozen wetlands that add another layer of dead plant matter each year.

158
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,389
But as permafrost melts, these dead plants
decompose,

159
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:01,009
and huge amounts of carbon dioxide and methane
are released into the atmosphere,

160
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,579
creating a positive feedback loop.

161
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:06,109
Our carbon burning lifestyle is releasing
this other huge carbon reservoir,

162
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,068
which keep the whole greenhouse effect going
with or without us. Just sayin'

163
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:12,009
Sorry to end on such a frightening and depressing
note,

164
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,688
but the stability of the global climate is
not as stable as we would like it to be,

165
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,480
and the fact that we're throwing it out of
whack is one of the most important reasons

166
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,569
to study ecology in the first place.

167
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:24,979
This episode of Crash Course was written by
myself, Jesslyn Shields, and Blake de Pastino.

168
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,440
Our technical director is Nick Jenkins who is also our editor and is also standing behind the camera right now.
