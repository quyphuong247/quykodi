00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,459
For the past 12 weeks, we've been investigating
our living planet together,

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:08,320
and learning how it works on many levels;
how populations of organisms interact,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,769
how communities thrive and ecosystems change,

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,609
and how humans are wrecking the nice, perfectly
functioning systems

5
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:17,030
Earth has been using for hundreds of thousands
of years.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,519
And now it's graduation day!

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,699
This here is like the commencement speech, where I talk to you about the future and our role in it,

8
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,119
and how what we're doing to the planet is
totally awful,

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,640
but we're taking steps to undo some of the
damage that we've done.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,410
So what better way to wrap up our series on
ecology than by taking a look at

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,630
the growing fields of conservation biology
and restoration ecology.

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,920
These disciplines use all the kung fu moves
that we've learned about in the past 11 weeks

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,280
and apply them to protecting ecosystems and cleaning up the messes that we've already made.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,600
And one of the main things they teach us is
that doing these things is difficult,

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,658
like, in the way that uncooking bacon is difficult.

16
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:55,679
So let's look at what we're doing, and try to uncook this unbelievably large pile of bacon we've made!

17
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:05,039
[Theme Music]

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,800
Just outside of Missoula, Montana, where I live, we've got a Superfund site. Not Superfun... Superfund.

19
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,899
A hazardous waste site that the government
is in charge of cleaning up.

20
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,439
The mess here was made more than a hundred
years ago,

21
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,879
when there was a dam in the Clark Fork River
behind me called the Milltown Dam.

22
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,619
This part of Montana has a long history of
copper mining, and back in 1908,

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,780
there was a humongous flood that washed about
4.5 million cubic meters of mine tailings

24
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,200
chock full of arsenic and toxic heavy metals
into the Clark Fork River.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,730
And most of it washed into the reservoir created
by the Milltown dam.

26
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,200
I mean, actually it was lucky that the dam
was there.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,850
It had only been completed six months before,
or the whole river system,

28
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:47,449
all the way to the Pacific Ocean, would have
been a toxic mess.

29
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,920
As it happened, though, only about 160 kilometers
of the river was all toxic-messed-up.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,299
A lot of it recuperated over time, but all that nasty hazardous waste was still sitting behind Milltown Dam,

31
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:04,359
and some of it leached into the groundwater
that started polluting nearby resident's wells.

32
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,719
So scientists spent decades studying the extent
of the damage caused by the waste

33
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,169
and coming up with ways to fix it.

34
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:18,030
And from 2006 to 2010, engineers carefully removed all the toxic sediment as well as the dam itself.

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,620
Now, this stretch of the Clark Fork River runs unimpeded for the first time in over a century,

36
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,700
and the restored area where the dam used to
be is being turned into a state park.

37
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,500
Efforts like this show us conservation biology
and restoration ecology in action.

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,659
Conservation biology involves measuring the biodiversity of an ecosystem and determining how to protect it.

39
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,359
In this case, it was used to size up the health
of fish populations in the Clark Fork River,

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,360
which were severely affected by the waste
behind the dam,

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,540
and the dam blocking their access to spawning
grounds upstream,

42
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,579
and figuring out how to protect them during
the dam's removal.

43
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,780
Restoration ecology, meanwhile, is the science
of restoring broken ecosystems,

44
00:02:55,789 --> 00:03:00,759
like taking an interrupted, polluted river and turning it into what you see taking shape here.

45
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,159
These do-gooder, fix-it-up sciences are practical
rather than theoretical.

46
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:07,348
By which I mean, in order to fix something
that's broken,

47
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:10,389
you've got to have a good idea of what's making
it work to begin with.

48
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,669
If something was wrong with the expansion
of the Universe,

49
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:17,009
we wouldn't be able to fix it because we have
no idea, at all, what's making all that happen.

50
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,780
So in order to fix a failing ecosystem, you have to figure out what was holding it together in the first place.

51
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,759
And the glue that holds every ecosystem together
is biodiversity.

52
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,120
But then of course, biodiversity can mean
many different things.

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,960
So far we've generally used it to mean species diversity, or the variety of species in an ecosystem.

54
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,620
But there are also other ways of thinking about biodiversity that help conservation biologists

55
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:41,689
and restoration ecologists figure out how
to save species and repair ecosystems.

56
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,789
In addition to the diversity of species,

57
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:48,569
ecologists look at genetic diversity within
a species as a whole and between populations.

58
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,739
Genetic diversity is important because it
makes evolution possible

59
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,620
by allowing a species to adapt to new situations
like disease and climate change.

60
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,080
And then another level of biodiversity has
to do with ecosystem diversity,

61
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,440
or the variety of different ecosystems within
an area.

62
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,378
A big ol' forest, for example, can host several kinds of ecosystems, like wetland, alpine, and aquatic ones.

63
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:08,530
Just like we talked about when we covered
ecological succession,

64
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,909
the more little pockets you've got performing different functions, the more resilient the region will be as a whole.

65
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:18,560
So, yeah, understanding all of this is really important to figuring out how to repair an ecosystem that is in shambles.

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,500
But how do conservation biologists take the information about what makes an ecosystem tick

67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,060
and use it to save the place from going under?

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,399
Well, there's more than one way to approach
this problem.

69
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,459
One way is called small-population conservation.

70
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:35,959
This approach focuses on identifying species
and populations that are really small,

71
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,660
and tries to help boost their numbers and
genetic diversity.

72
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,430
Low population and low genetic diversity are
kind of the death knell for a species.

73
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,840
They actually feed off each other, one problem
making the other problem worse,

74
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,349
ultimately causing a species to spiral into
extinction.

75
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,770
See, when a tiny little population suffers
from inbreeding or genetic drift,

76
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:56,109
that is, a shift in its overall genetic makeup,
this leads to even less diversity,

77
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,840
which in turn causes lower reproduction rates
and higher mortality rates,

78
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,689
which makes the population smaller still.

79
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:05,709
This terrible little dynamic is known by the
awesome term extinction vortex.

80
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:09,819
The next step is to figure out how small a
population is too small.

81
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:14,009
Ecologists do this by calculating what's called
the minimum viable population,

82
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,759
which is the smallest size at which a population
can survive and sustain itself.

83
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,810
To get at this number, you have to know the
real breeding population of,

84
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,709
say, grizzly bears in Yellowstone National
Park.

85
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,959
And then you figure out everything you can
about a grizzly's life history:

86
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,079
how long they live, who gets to breed the most, how often they can have babies, that kind of thing.

87
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,769
After all that information is collected, ecologists
can run the numbers

88
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,990
and figure out that for the grizzlies in Yellowstone,

89
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,430
a population of, say hypothetically, 90 bears would have about a 95% chance of surviving for 100 years.

90
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,519
But if there were a population of 100 bears, the population would likely be able to survive for 200 years.

91
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,579
Something to note: ecology involves a lot of math so if you're interested in this, that's just the way it is.

92
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,500
So, that's the small-population approach to
conservation.

93
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,540
Another way of preserving biodiversity focuses
on populations whose numbers are in decline,

94
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,110
no matter how large the original population
was.

95
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,680
This is known as declining population conservation, and it involves answering a series of related questions

96
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,980
that get at the root of what's causing an
organism's numbers to nosedive.

97
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,000
First, you have to determine whether the population's
actually declining.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,939
Then, you have to figure out how big the population historically was and what its requirements were.

99
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:21,240
And finally, you have to get at what's causing the decline and figure out how to address it.

100
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,900
Milltown Dam actually gives us a good example
of this process.

101
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:29,699
In the winter of 1996, authorities had to release some of the water behind the dam as an emergency measure,

102
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,019
because of a big ice flow in the river that
was threatening to break the dam.

103
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,879
But when they released the water, a bunch
of toxic sediment went with it,

104
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,139
which raised the copper concentrations downriver
to almost 43 times what state standards allowed.

105
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:48,680
As a result, it's estimated about half of the fish downstream died. Half of the fish! Dead!

106
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,978
And researchers have been monitoring the decline
in populations ever since.

107
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,158
This information was really helpful in determining
what to do with the dam,

108
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,020
because we knew what the fish population was
like before and after the release of the sediment.

109
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:06,359
It was decided that it would be best to get the dam out as soon as possible, rather than risk another 1996 scenario.

110
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,740
Which brings me to the place where conservation
biology and restoration ecology intersect.

111
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,660
Restoration ecology is kind of where the rubber
meets the road in conservation biology.

112
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,550
It comes up with possible solutions for ecological
problems.

113
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,250
Now, short of a time machine, which I'm working
on,

114
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,100
you can't really get a natural environment
exactly the way that it used to be.

115
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,800
But you can at least get rid of whatever is
causing the problem

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,699
and help re-create some of the elements that
the ecosystem needs to function properly.

117
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,740
All of this involves a whole suite of strategies.

118
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,829
For instance, what's happening in Milltown
is an example of structural restoration,

119
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,849
basically the removal and cleanup of whatever
human impact was causing the problem.

120
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,710
In this case, the dam and the toxic sediments
behind it.

121
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,859
And then the rebuilding of the historical
natural structure, here the meanders of the

122
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,850
river channel and the vegetation.

123
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:54,389
Another strategy is bioremediation, which recruits organisms temporarily to help remove toxins,

124
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,530
like bacteria that eat wastes or plants that
leach out metals from tainted soils.

125
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,719
Some kinds of fungi and bacteria are even
being explored as ways to bio-remediate oil spills.

126
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,000
Yet another, somewhat more invasive restoration
method is biological augmentation.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,980
Rather than removing harmful substances, this
involves adding organisms to the ecosystem

128
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,980
to restore materials that are gone.

129
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,420
Plants that help fix nitrogen like beans,
acacia trees, and lupine

130
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,410
are often used to replenish nitrogen in soils that have been damaged by things like mining or overfarming.

131
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,770
And ecologists sometimes add mycorrhizal fungi to help new plantings like native grass take hold.

132
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:32,169
But of course, we're just humans, and we're
not as smart as millions of years of evolution.

133
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,860
Sometimes we get things wrong.

134
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,419
For example, when you bring an invasive species into a place to eradicate another invasive species,

135
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,860
sometimes you just end up with two invasive
species on your hands,

136
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,080
which collapses the ecosystem even more rapidly.

137
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,720
The introduction of cane toads to Australia in the 1930s to control beetles is a particularly infamous example.

138
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,740
Not only are they everywhere now but because
they're toxic,

139
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,459
they're poisoning native species like dingos
that try to eat them. Nice.

140
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,609
So you know what?
I have an idea.

141
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,550
After spending the past couple of weeks talking
about ecological problems,

142
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:07,659
I've come to the conclusion that it's just easier to protect ecosystems rather than trying to fix them.

143
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:10,419
Because we know a lot about what makes ecosystems
tick,

144
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:14,599
so if we spend more time trying to save them
from us and our stuff,

145
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,759
we'll spend less time cleaning up after ourselves
and running the risks of getting it wrong.

146
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:24,299
Because as we all know, the sad fact is: uncooking
bacon is impossible. But we can eat it.

147
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,179
Thank you for joining me on this quick three-month
jaunt through the natural world.

148
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,810
I hope it made you smarter not just in terms
of passing your exams,

149
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:36,079
but also in terms of being a Homo sapien that
inhabits this planet more wisely.

150
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,160
And thank you to everyone who helped us put
these episodes together:
