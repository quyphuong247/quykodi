1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,899
Of all the ways that species interact on this planet, maybe the one that fascinates us the most is predation, and why not?

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:11,038
It's hard not to be captivated by, say, an Alaska Brown Bear, one of North America's apex predators,

3
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,418
even though they get much of their nutrition
from nuts and bugs and berries.

4
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:17,629
But you can also tell that it's a pretty big
fan of crushing the bones of other animals

5
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:21,669
because of this amazingly pronounced sagittal
crest, which is where its jaw muscles connect.

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,279
And maybe part of why we're so fascinated
by predation is because we are,

7
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,670
in many ways, the planet's top predator, at
least for now.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,370
That's how most of these guys got here,

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,929
but for hundreds of thousands of years,
we were preyed upon as well,

10
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:36,670
not just by bears and wolves, but by viruses
and bacteria and parasites.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,940
Because predation isn't just animal eats animal.

12
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:45,000
This musk-ox or this big-horned sheep can also be considered predators, even though they only eat plants.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,509
But perhaps what's most important to understand
about predation is the evolutionary pressures

14
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:51,719
that come with hunting and being hunted for
thousands of years.

15
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,959
Because of these pressures, predation has driven all sorts of truly amazing adaptations that we see all around us.

16
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,329
From the grizzlies enormous claws and teeth,
to the wolves' habit of hunting in packs,

17
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,789
as well as defensive adaptations, like the speed of the pronghorn, the fastest animal in North America.

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,480
In the end, the effect of predator-prey is
an evolutionary arms race that results in

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,120
the mind boggling amount of diversity we see
in any ecosystem from the Northern Rockies

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,910
all the way to the African Savanna.

21
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,500
This arms race is known as co-evolution, the
process by which the interactions between

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,200
two species affect the evolutionary development
of both.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,680
It's been going on since the Cambrian explosion
more than half a billion years ago

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,520
and it will continue spawning new bursts of diversity long after we humans have eaten ourselves into extinction,

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,329
and maybe, we'll end up in a place like this.

26
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:43,719
[Theme Music]

27
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,939
We tend to think of predation in terms of
animals

28
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,439
-- lions hunting zebras, wolves killing sheep,
hawks eating mice --

29
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,879
but predation is much more than just carnivores
doing their thing,

30
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,040
it applies to any number of interactions where one type of organism kills another for its energy.

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,800
That's an important thing to note, because a lot of ecology comes down to the flow of energy through nature,

32
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,900
and every living thing needs energy to meet its twin evolutionary goals of staying alive and making lots of babies.

33
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,900
Predators kill because they're hungry, but they're hungry because they need energy to survive and reproduce.

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,700
For prey, these interactions are especially
high-stakes, obviously,

35
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,159
because nothing quite quashes your reproductive
chances like being dead.

36
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,639
But almost all energy on earth starts with
plants, so consider bison eating grass,

37
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,839
that's a type of predation called herbivory, where an organism eats plants or algae to capture their energy.

38
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,349
It may not really seem like predation to you,
but bison eating grass, manatees eating seaweed,

39
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,519
and sea urchins munching on algae are all
examples of organisms eating other organisms

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,250
to ingest the energy of the sun.

41
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,669
There's also parasitism, another form of predation
in which organisms derive energy from the

42
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,869
host usually harming it and sometimes killing
it in the process.

43
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,460
Hair worms, for example, devour the insides of grasshoppers and then brainwash them to make suicidal leaps into water.

44
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,599
How exactly the waterborne worm finds its
way to a grasshopper is a mystery,

45
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,250
though larva carried by mosquitoes is a likely
route.

46
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,280
Once inside the grasshopper, the worm eats
everything non-essential to its host as it

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,750
grows several times the length of its host's
body.

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,849
When only the grasshopper's head and legs
remain, the hairworm is ready to reproduce,

49
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:15,780
and that's when the brainwashing begins.

50
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,318
See, hair worms breed in water, but grasshoppers
can't swim,

51
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:25,418
so hair worms pump their hosts full of chemicals that prompt an inescapable urge to leap into a body of water.

52
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,959
Once the grasshopper makes the leap, the hairworm is free to burrow out of the host and find a mate.

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,159
Ew. Yeah, chasing and eating a gazelle is one thing, but turning your prey into, like, a suicidal zombie,

54
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,060
that my friends, is predation.

55
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:43,429
So clearly, predator and prey both have millions of years of tricks up their sleeves or stored in their DNA

56
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,610
because everyone's ultimately playing by the
same set of evolutionary rules.

57
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,230
Whether lion or zebra, grasshopper or hairworm,
bison or grass,

58
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,439
gaining energy while not being eaten is a
prerequisite to reproductive success.

59
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,859
So, the need to survive constantly forces
predator and prey to adapt weapons and defense

60
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,230
in a never-ending evolutionary arms-race.

61
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,318
On the predator side, hunting and feeding
adaptations are obvious and familiar:

62
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:14,538
a wolf's keen sense of smell and flesh ripping teeth, and an eagle's sharp eyes and prey-gripping talons.

63
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:18,959
Other creatures like rattlesnakes use heat-sensing
organs to seek out small rodents and toxic

64
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,439
venom to strike them dead,

65
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:26,199
but this is where co-evolution takes the stage to give the prey a stake in the evolutionary arms-race, too.

66
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:29,769
Since being caught by a predator is kind of terrible for anything that hopes to spread its genes,

67
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,899
species have adapted to all sorts of ways
to avoid getting killed.

68
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:37,219
These can be broken up by what kinds of predatory behavior these adaptations are designed to avoid,

69
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,080
namely, detection, capture, and handling.

70
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,859
To avoid detection, some prey adapt cryptic
coloration, which we better know as camouflage,

71
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,750
to help a species blend into the background.

72
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,060
Stick insects that have adapted to look like
sticks, leaf insects that look like leaves,

73
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,930
snowshoe hares that turn white in the winter
to blend in with the snow

74
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,600
and brown in the summer to blend in with the
grasses are all good examples.

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,260
Avoiding capture is, at times, pretty straightforward.

76
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,219
Antelope, for example, flee predators with
great leaping speed.

77
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,400
Others find safety in numbers, such as bison forming a giant herds or herring grouping in schools.

78
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,459
This kind of grouping certainly doesn't keep
the prey from being detected,

79
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,750
but it greatly reduces chances that any individual
will get picked off by a predator,

80
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,300
especially fit members of the group in the
middle of the pack.

81
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,300
And finally, some of the coolest and most familiar adaptations are those that prevent handling.

82
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,699
Plants are experts at these, think of a rose's
thorns; or tree sap that traps insects;

83
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:32,999
or the branches of an African acacia tree -- they're most thorny within the range of tree-munching giraffes,

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,120
but above where the long-necks reach, there
aren't as many thorns.

85
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,939
Other plants also produce chemical weapons,
such as the tobacco plants nicotine

86
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,449
and the tannins produced by many plants like
grapevines to fend off foragers.

87
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:47,400
But things get really weird when you see what
animals do with this bag of chemical tricks,

88
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,089
because often these critters not only have
wicked toxic cocktails to defend themselves,

89
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:55,119
many have also evolved aposematic, or warning
coloration.

90
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,860
The bright contrasting colors such as yellow
and black splotches on the fire salamander

91
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,520
or the red, yellow, and black bands of the
coral snake

92
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,000
make it clear to predators that eating them
would be a serious mistake.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,478
And when you think of it, nature is full of species that are black and yellow in color, or red and black;

94
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:16,168
we tend to avoid them at all costs. We're
smart that way, and so are most other predators.

95
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:20,629
This, of course, is no coincidence, as German
naturalist Fritz Muller noted in the 1870s,

96
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,550
unpalatable species such as Cocobees, Yellowjackets --

97
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,430
actually, almost every kind of bee and wasp resemble each other using similar colors and patterns.

98
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,439
He figured out that the more unpalatable prey
there are that use the same color patterns,

99
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,060
the more likely predators are to avoid all
prey with that appearance in general.

100
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,259
This defense technique is today known as Mullerian
mimicry.

101
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:42,680
But it turns out, unsurprisingly, some critters
that look dangerous are getting the last laugh

102
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:45,899
because many of them would actually be quite
tasty to any predator;

103
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,639
they just trick everyone by copying the looks
of the truly dangerous species.

104
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,500
This technique is called Batesian mimicry, and to explain it to you, I'm going to need to sit down.

105
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,859
I'll give you one guess to figure out who
first described Batesian mimicry.

106
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:11,259
That's right, it was Bates. More specifically, it was Henry Walter Bates, a 19th century British naturalist and explorer.

107
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,739
Bates was born in 1825 to a middle-class family
that paid the bills by making hosiery.

108
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,620
He spent most of his spare time reading often
about bugs,

109
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:23,939
and by the young age of 18 he was a budding entomologist with a publication on beetles already to his credit.

110
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,759
It was a few years later that he met the famed
entomologist Alfred Russell Wallace.

111
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:33,329
The two hit it off, and Wallace in 1847 proposed to take a trip to South America to collect insects.

112
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:38,609
They would finance their travels by sending collected specimens back to England for sale  to museums and private collectors.

113
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,870
The pair set sail the following year, and after four years in the field Wallace moved on,

114
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,500
but Bates, apparently not wanting to get into
the hosiery business, stayed behind,

115
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,980
spending the next eleven years in the jungle.

116
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,900
All told, he collected nearly 15,000 species,
about 8,000 of them new to science.

117
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:03,019
Just a few months after Bates arrived home in 1859, Darwin published his On The Origin Of Species.

118
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:06,879
Bates read it and figured he could contribute
evidence to support the new theory of natural

119
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,490
selection from his insect collection.

120
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,639
Two years later, he presented a paper that
showed how different species of butterfly

121
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,679
developed nearly identical color patterns
on their wings.

122
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,139
For example, butterflies called Heliconiinae, which were slow-moving and abundant -- but toxic --

123
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,579
were nearly identical to Pieridae, which were
more rare, but harmless.

124
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:29,740
Bates concluded that natural selection had
driven the harmless butterflies to mimic the

125
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,818
patterns on the harmful butterflies for their
individual bids to survive predation by birds.

126
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:38,019
The discovery helped launch Bates's career
and reputation,

127
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:42,000
and he went on to recount his adventures and other discoveries in a book,

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,990
The Naturalist on the River Amazon,

129
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,210
and later took a job as secretary to the Royal
Geographic Society.

130
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:53,019
Though Bates died in 1892, the concept of Batesian mimicry continues to fascinate scientists today.

131
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:58,199
Why, for example, are so many mimics not perfect
imitations of their dangerous counterparts?

132
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,578
Is it because perfect imitation isn't necessary
to do the job,

133
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:06,208
or because mimics lack the genes necessary
to perfectly resemble their poisonous counterparts.

134
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:11,868
Perhaps budding entomologists armed with 21st-century tools will finally unlock the answers.

135
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:14,600
But don't think that prey are the only crafty
mimics out there --

136
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,399
in the arms-race, some predators have learned
how to win food through imitation as well.

137
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,578
You've heard me talk about snapping turtles with tongues that resemble wiggling worms to lure fish,

138
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,620
and don't get me started about anglerfish!

139
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,759
If predation teaches us anything, it's that nothing lasts forever, not just for prey, but for every living thing,

140
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,410
because the interaction between predator and
prey keeps driving evolutionary change.

141
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,519
But the communities themselves that we've
been talking about for the last two weeks

142
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,860
don't stay the same either, of course.

143
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,720
New tenants are always moving into a habitat and every now and again, a new landlord takes over.

144
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,700
That's part of what makes the living world such a dynamic and beautiful and exciting place --

145
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,720
and it's what we'll be exploring next week.

146
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,920
