My name is Stanley, hi.

1
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,370
In this video, I&#39;m going to show you an example of

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,970
conducting micro usability tests for a website for buying cars.

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,430
The goal of this micro usability task

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,150
is to find out how effectively users can perform different tasks on a website.

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,520
It is also to get feedback on what works and what doesn&#39;t work.

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,340
In this test, I&#39;ll be focusing on three tasks.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,880
Exploring cars, figuring out a budget and comparing cars.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,720
I have recruited a person who have never use the site before

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,040
to participate in the test.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,530
I&#39;ve also written a script where you can find the cost of materials,

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,860
if you would like to follow alone.

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,640
Hi, my name is Stanley, nice to meet you.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,080
Thank you so much for coming, how are you today?

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,000
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m good.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,160
&gt;&gt; Okay, great, today I would like you to help us understand how

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,330
well this car finder website help people explore and find cars.

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,590
We&#39;d like you to do a couple of tasks, using this site.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,510
And we want to collect the feedback.

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,420
Specifically, we&#39;d like to know how you think about the site and

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,460
which part of site works or not.

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,090
Work for you, okay?

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,620
&gt;&gt; Okay.

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,060
&gt;&gt; And, before we start, here are several things we&#39;d like you to know.

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,450
First of all, we&#39;re testing the site, but not you, okay?

25
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,250
There&#39;s nothing you can do wrong.

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,250
Don&#39;t worry about making any mistakes.

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,060
And if you cannot get something to work, don&#39;t worry about it.

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,260
Or if you think there&#39;s anything broken anywhere.

29
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,080
Or confusing, it is not your fault but the systems fault.

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,930
All right.

31
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,940
And please let us know exactly what you think about the site.

32
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,680
You can be honest and don&#39;t be shy.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,550
Because this is why we&#39;re being here today,

34
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,430
to let us know which part of the site doesn&#39;t do well.

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,060
And I will tell you what tasks to do.

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,540
And after you start, please try to focus on the task.

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,730
And I may ask you a couple of question during the test.

38
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,840
And you can also ask me question, but I may not be able to answer all of them.

39
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,660
Because we try to observe what people would do without anyone sitting next to

40
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,610
them, right?

41
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,060
But if you still have questions at the end,

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,880
I think I&#39;m able to answer those questions.

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,950
And as we go along,

44
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,350
I&#39;m going to ask you to think a loud, this is very important part of the test, and

45
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,850
which means that you speak all over to us, kinda like play by play.

46
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,312
For example while looking at, when trying to do what you are doing,

47
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:52,166
what you&#39;re thinking and why you are thinking and doing that way, right?

48
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:57,690
And if you cannot find a way to complete a task, and you think you&#39;re stuck.

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,790
Just let me know, and we can move on to the next one.

50
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,260
For each task you are asked to do.

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,340
Tell me, I&#39;m done, when you think you are done.

52
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,002
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay?

53
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:11,810
Do you have any comments or questions before we begin?

54
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,590
&gt;&gt; Nope, I&#39;m ready. &gt;&gt; Alright, thank you.

55
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,350
I&#39;m going to ask you a couple of pretest questions.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,090
First of all, what&#39;s your occupation?

57
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,070
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a student.

58
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,410
&gt;&gt; You&#39;re a student.

59
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,390
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then, roughly how many hours do you

60
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,591
think you spend on the Internet including emails, messaging?

61
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:34,660
&gt;&gt; Every week or every day?

62
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,230
&gt;&gt; Per day or per week, yeah.

63
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,310
&gt;&gt; Probably, I&#39;m at school or

64
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,425
at work, probably at least seven, eight hours a day.

65
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,890
&gt;&gt; Okay, and how often do you shop online?

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,025
&gt;&gt; Maybe once a week.

67
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,620
&gt;&gt; Once a week?

68
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,080
And what types of product do you often shop online?

69
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,990
&gt;&gt; Home products, clothes, stuff like that.

70
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,890
&gt;&gt; Okay, and do you have any favorite websites that you often go to?

71
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,882
&gt;&gt; Usually on Amazon.

72
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:07,210
&gt;&gt; Amazon, all right.

73
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,780
Now I&#39;m going to ask your experience on purchasing vehicles.

74
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,620
How many cars have you ever owned?

75
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,880
&gt;&gt; None.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,440
&gt;&gt; None.

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,750
Okay so, how many times have you researched cars online?

78
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,241
&gt;&gt; Probably a few, like two or three.

79
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,970
&gt;&gt; A few, okay.

80
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,460
What factors do you think you really value when you purchase vehicle?

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,281
&gt;&gt; Probably safety, the price of the car, maybe the mileage on the car.

82
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,527
&gt;&gt; Mileage of car.

83
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,120
And which factor do you think most important to you?

84
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,309
&gt;&gt; Probably mileage.

85
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:47,188
&gt;&gt; Mileage.

86
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:47,688
&gt;&gt; Okay.

87
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,760
&gt;&gt; The last question is,

88
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,660
how far do you think you are willing to travel to buy a car?

89
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,070
&gt;&gt; Maybe 30 miles.

90
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,160
&gt;&gt; 30 miles. &gt;&gt; Yes.

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:08,319
Alright, okay so now I&#39;m going to ask you to do some specific tasks.

92
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:16,600
I&#39;m going to read each one out loud, and here is a printed copy for reference.

93
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,590
&gt;&gt; Okay, and again, you&#39;ll be much, much helpful if you can think aloud.

94
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,370
Okay. All right, so this is the first task.

95
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,310
A family member of yours, asks if you can find a car for her.

96
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,130
You see this website.

97
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,060
Because she has been very, very busy and she doesn&#39;t have time, for that.

98
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,770
She wants to buy a used car, that is now older than three years old.

99
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,905
Uses automatic transmission.

100
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:51,800
It&#39;s under 20,000 U.S. dollars, it&#39;s either gray, white, or black.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,060
Okay? She also doesn&#39;t want to travel too far

102
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,470
away from her home, and she wants the car to be as cheap as possible.

103
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,920
Okay? So find two cars based on her preference.

104
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,650
Now you may start.

105
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

106
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,480
So I&#39;m looking at the website.

107
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,170
I see that there&#39;s search options right here.

108
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:19,320
This says, search all used and new cars for sale.

109
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,220
She didn&#39;t mention what kind of car she wanted.

110
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,040
No, she said she wanted, so I am going to put in a make.

111
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,519
Don&#39;t really know that much about different car makes, so

112
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,110
I&#39;m gonna pick one that I&#39;ve heard before.

113
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,514
She said less than $20,000.

114
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,230
I don&#39;t think she said anything about miles.

115
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,070
But she wants to be close.

116
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,807
So I&#39;m gonna put in my zip code.

117
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,438
Okay, and I&#39;m gonna search.

118
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:15,325
I see the things I searched for here, as I scroll down I see a couple of options,

119
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:22,671
They fit what I&#39;m looking for but they&#39;re at the top of price range,

120
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:27,290
so I&#39;m trying to see if I can find one that&#39;s cheaper.

121
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,180
But they&#39;re not coming up at the top.

122
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,250
I&#39;m going to see if I can have an option to change the price or

123
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,472
the way I&#39;m looking at the price.

124
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:48,661
So I&#39;m going to keep those the same, but maybe change this.

125
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:50,479
Deals, that sounds good.

126
00:07:57,817 --> 00:07:58,700
Okay.

127
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,380
These are a little bit cheaper.

128
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:11,771
Okay, so there&#39;s some other things she wanted, like automatic transmission.

129
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,040
So I&#39;m trying to see where I can find cars like that.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Okay.

131
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,002
So I apply that one, and then I&#39;m gonna do the same thing for the colors she wanted.

132
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:42,606
Okay, and gray,

133
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:47,801
black and white.

134
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:48,530
Okay.

135
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:04,032
So now I just have, I limited the search which is good.

136
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:09,205
This first one looks pretty good.

137
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:20,462
But it&#39;s really far away.

138
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:23,097
It&#39;s in San Diego.

139
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:26,230
&gt;&gt; So what are we looking at right now?

140
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,640
&gt;&gt; So I was looking at the first couple of things that popped up and

141
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,470
there&#39;s a picture.

142
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,950
But this is saying that it&#39;s in San Diego,

143
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,300
which is weird cuz I thought I put in my zip code for the search.

144
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,673
So I&#39;m gonna go back.

145
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,568
And yeah, these are all really far away.

146
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,419
Okay, I&#39;ll look here.

147
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,549
Okay, that should be better.

148
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:00,911
Yep, this one&#39;s really close.

149
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:06,817
Okay, cool.

150
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:13,243
This one looks good and it&#39;s pretty close by.

151
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:18,063
I&#39;m gonna pick that one

152
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:23,802
and, It&#39;s fine, one more.

153
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:32,715
Yeah, this one looks nice too and it&#39;s really close by.

154
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:40,785
So I think I&#39;m just gonna give her the first two options on here.

155
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:42,034
&gt;&gt; Alright.

156
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:45,468
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think I&#39;m done.

157
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:46,249
&gt;&gt; Okay.

158
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:51,330
Now this is the second task.

159
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,150
So you are in the market for a new car?

160
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,760
Okay? And you have saved $4,000 for

161
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,480
down payment and you have determined that you can afford monthly payment

162
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,840
of at most, $400, toward a five-year car plan, a car loan.

163
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,870
So figure out the maximum price you can afford for a new car for yourself?

164
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,350
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.

165
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,619
So I&#39;m gonna go here, find cars for sale.

166
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:29,207
And I know I could pick, just to see new cars.

167
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,369
Okay, so new cars.

168
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:49,180
So I&#39;m not sure how to look for a price.

169
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,970
Like how much I&#39;m gonna put for a down payment and how much I should pay monthly.

170
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,450
Let me see, maybe if I click on a car it will let me look into that.

171
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:17,989
Okay, estimate payments, maybe that will help.

172
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,678
See if I can put things in here.

173
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:22,383
Okay.

174
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:31,720
Is that five months?

175
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,730
Is that five years?

176
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,296
I think so.

177
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:39,415
[LAUGH] Okay, so this one would be in my price range, I think.

178
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:42,200
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

179
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,060
&gt;&gt; But I&#39;m not sure if I can search for

180
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,530
everything that applies for that kind of thing.

181
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,970
So I&#39;m just gonna look at all the cars and

182
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,310
pick one that I would like and then see if I can afford it.

183
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,470
&gt;&gt; Okay.

184
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,240
&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m gonna again put in locations, that&#39;s close to me.

185
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:09,562
And it already has new cars as the search thing.

186
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:13,251
I think I would like to see if there&#39;s more options.

187
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:27,040
&gt;&gt; So what are you looking at right now?

188
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,340
&gt;&gt; So, I&#39;m looking throughout these results, but

189
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,120
I&#39;m not really sure how to refine the results more for what I want.

190
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,567
Like I want to see if I can sort by mileage or

191
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:47,268
something like that.

192
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,810
I don&#39;t see an option like that.

193
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,030
Maybe here.

194
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:01,717
No, I don&#39;t see an option like that.

195
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:06,778
So it just seems like a lot of results and I don&#39;t know how to pick one.

196
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:13,484
[LAUGH] Okay,

197
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:18,600
I think for now I&#39;m gonna pick this one.

198
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,174
Let&#39;s see if I can afford it.

199
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:28,350
Okay, so it looks like it&#39;s still in my price range.

200
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,980
So I think I&#39;m gonna pick this one.

201
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,183
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what will be the maximum price you think you can afford?

202
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:39,927
&gt;&gt; What do you mean?

203
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,556
&gt;&gt; So.

204
00:14:42,556 --> 00:14:45,818
&gt;&gt; So it would be around $20,000, maybe a little bit more.

205
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,860
&gt;&gt; All right.

206
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,430
Okay, so this is the final task I&#39;d like you to do.

207
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:59,130
So you want to buy a new car using the website and that fits into your budget.

208
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,480
Now, you have your own criteria, such as price, appearance, engine,

209
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,775
whatever matters to you.

210
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:08,680
Right, so we go back to the home page and

211
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,060
you use your own criteria to find at least two cars that you&#39;re interested in and

212
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,130
put them into a list so that you can compare them there.

213
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,080
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay?

214
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,580
&gt;&gt; Cool.

215
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,490
So I still want a new car.

216
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,577
I&#39;m gonna do all makes, I want it close to me,

217
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:30,281
and I have that same price point as before.

218
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:36,004
So let&#39;s see.

219
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,630
I want a car that&#39;s pretty recent.

220
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,230
So I want a new car, right?

221
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,823
Yep. And then.

222
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,733
Some of the other things.

223
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,900
I would want a small car and then,

224
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:08,800
I think maybe this color.

225
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,355
So it&#39;s not that many options.

226
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,831
So I&#39;m going to look through all of the options.

227
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:19,991
So this one looks really nice and it&#39;s pretty close.

228
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:28,163
I&#39;m gonna click into this one,

229
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:34,202
to see if there&#39;s more info.

230
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:46,785
So I&#39;m just reading all the details.

231
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:48,710
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; It looks really good.

232
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,060
So I&#39;m gonna see if there&#39;s a way I can save it on the site.

233
00:16:58,173 --> 00:17:01,214
Okay it says it&#39;s saved.

234
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:05,474
I&#39;m gonna go back to the search results.

235
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:15,096
And look into this one.

236
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:21,910
I&#39;m just reading this stuff again.

237
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,489
Okay, it&#39;s pretty similar to the other one.

238
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:30,575
&gt;&gt; So what details are you looking for?

239
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:33,960
It&#39;s there a specific feature?

240
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,860
&gt;&gt; I guess reading through all of them cuz there was something that jumped out at me.

241
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,180
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But they all look pretty good.

242
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,800
And I think it&#39;s pretty similar to the one I liked before too, so

243
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,060
I think we&#39;re all good.

244
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,420
So I&#39;m gonna try to save this one again.

245
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,945
And I think if I click here it will have both of them.

246
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,040
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

247
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,840
&gt;&gt; Yes.

248
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,720
Okay so I think I&#39;m done.

249
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,820
&gt;&gt; All right.

250
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,620
So that was great.

251
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:05,370
Thank you for your feedback and we have learned a lot from what you just did.

252
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,575
So I&#39;m going to wrap up with a couple quick questions.

253
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:09,100
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

254
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,390
&gt;&gt; So what&#39;s your overall impression of this site?

255
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,610
&gt;&gt; It was pretty useful.

256
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,940
I had a good experience I think.

257
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,900
&gt;&gt; Okay.

258
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,130
And then more specifically which part of the site do you find difficult or

259
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,880
easy to use for performing the tasks?

260
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,700
&gt;&gt; I had some problems on the search page.

261
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,250
Because I feel like I couldn&#39;t find everything I wanted, and

262
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,130
I don&#39;t know if this is like sorted in a way that was real easy for me to use, and

263
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,475
I had to click, keep clicking on more options.

264
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:41,120
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

265
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,600
&gt;&gt; A lot, I felt like.

266
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:49,265
So I think that was probably my biggest problem area with the site.

267
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:50,160
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

268
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,340
&gt;&gt; And then was there a second part to your question?

269
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,628
Or is that it?

270
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:58,753
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, and is there any specific feature on the site

271
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:03,786
that you find confusing to you or you don&#39;t understand.

272
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:09,318
&gt;&gt; Let me think.

273
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:15,890
Nothing, I don&#39;t think so.

274
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,250
I think I&#39;ve figured everything out.

275
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:18,980
&gt;&gt; Okay.

276
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:25,460
And notice that you never try to click on the top navigation bar.

277
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:32,708
So is there any specific reason that you didn&#39;t try that navigation bar?

278
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:36,650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I felt like there&#39;s nothing here that really pertain to what I was doing.

279
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,240
&gt;&gt; Okay.

280
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,730
&gt;&gt; Maybe the Buy one, but I think if I just click here, it will just take me back

281
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,870
to the homepage where I could look at all the buying options anyway.

282
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,450
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I felt like those aren&#39;t

283
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,350
really useful for me.

284
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,766
&gt;&gt; Okay, do you wanna try clicking the Buy option?

285
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,507
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

286
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:54,950
&gt;&gt; Okay, and what do you expect to see.

287
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,006
The amenities table.

288
00:19:58,006 --> 00:20:02,050
&gt;&gt; I think there&#39;s different

289
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,720
ways to buy the car like if you&#39;re buying a used car, new car.

290
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,970
But this is giving me a lot of different options that I wasn&#39;t expecting to find,

291
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,666
like I didn&#39;t see this one before.

292
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,160
[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Okay, all right.

293
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,054
So do you have any other comments or

294
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:23,306
questions regarding the task or the website?

295
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,387
&gt;&gt; Nope.

296
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:29,120
&gt;&gt; Okay, so thank you so much again for your time and your participation.

297
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,780
And you have any other questions or ideas coming up while during on your way home,

298
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,480
just contact me and let me know, okay?

299
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,030
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

300
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,530
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

301
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,960
&gt;&gt; Now you have watched a micro usability task.

302
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,560
Did observe any usability problems?

303
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,240
You can pause the video and think about your list.

304
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,870
I will give you my list later.

305
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,110
Okay.

306
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,640
In general the user finished all of the tasks without much trouble.

307
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,420
But there were still some usability problems the website can fix,

308
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,410
to make the site more effective for users.

309
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,680
I&#39;m going to give you a couple of examples.

310
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,670
First, the connections between buy and

311
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,490
estimating payments is not obvious to the user.

312
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,280
&gt;From the video you can see our user had no intention to try the buy button.

313
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,530
And she was surprised to see the Estimating Your Payment.

314
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,260
When I asked her to click on the button after the task.

315
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,500
So we think this site should make their Estimating Your Payment

316
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,940
option visible on the interface.

317
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,500
Instead of hiding it in a buy button.

318
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,440
Since the users may have trouble associating the two.

319
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,130
Second, although the user did not realize that you chose all miles

320
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,340
once you put the zip code, which therefore does not filter cars by location.

321
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,702
The site should still show users, the cars that are more relevant to them.

322
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:58,170
Which is in this case, are the cars closer to them.

323
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,110
This is especially important, because she has put the zip code.

324
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,633
Meaning that, she doesn&#39;t want to see cars that are too far away from the area.

325
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:12,180
And this is one result the user saw.

326
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:17,170
You can see the user was pretty surprised in the video when

327
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:23,300
she saw a car in California while she put the zip code in Michigan.

328
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,040
So this would take the user extra step to change the sorting.

329
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,010
To sort by distance here.

330
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,430
In addition, the user saw a long list of cars and

331
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,690
she didn&#39;t seem to be able to refine and sort the cars as she wanted.

332
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,250
And she also mentioned in the post task debrief.

333
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,250
The fact that you kept trying this more

334
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,480
option button is a great evidence that she was looking for something else,

335
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,640
that was unavailable or a list not appearing on the interface.

336
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,806
And the last example I wanna mention is the pop-up message that comes to user to

337
00:23:04,806 --> 00:23:07,069
sign up after the user saves the car.

338
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:10,740
So can try one here.

339
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,610
The pop-up message interrupts the flow of the task and

340
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:21,650
shouldn&#39;t be shown again after user has chosen to close it in the first place,

341
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,850
because that means the user simply doesn&#39;t want to sign up, at least for now.

342
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,720
Okay, I&#39;m going to stop here.

343
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,430
But I&#39;m sure you have more on your list.

344
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:35,260
The purpose of this video is to show you how you should test

345
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,130
even a micro usability task can allow you to quickly get user&#39;s feedback and

346
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,047
find a couple [INAUDIBLE] issues.

347
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,780
There will be a lot more going on in your more formal usability test.
