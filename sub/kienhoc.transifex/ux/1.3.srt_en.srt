We all know what a good user experience looks like and feels like, but

1
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:16,490
it can be challenging to design product that deliver

2
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,711
that good user experience to the people that use it.

3
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,000
Fortunately, we know a few things that we can do to make it a lot easier

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,870
on designers to ensure

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,320
the product that comes out the end delivers a good user experience.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,598
First, we follow an iterative prototyping process where we design multiple

7
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:40,166
versions of the product, each time getting better and better.

8
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,377
We apply a user-centered research and

9
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:46,129
design approach to make sure that we&#39;re keeping users&#39; needs and

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,280
users&#39; capabilities in focus throughout the process.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,390
We need to understand a bit about human behavior to make sure that we&#39;re designing

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,430
things that are likely to work and avoiding things that are likely to fail.

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,634
And we make sure that we use a process that allows us to apply our common sense

14
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:05,060
to ensure that the product is moving in the right direction.

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,910
The reason that we iterate is because we know that we&#39;re not gonna get it

16
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,510
right the first time.

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,432
We wanna fail as fast as we can, get it wrong as quickly and as often as possible,

18
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:21,709
so that we can learn from our mistakes and get it less wrong each time.

19
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,475
So that as we&#39;re moving through their process,

20
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:28,184
we&#39;re designing a product that&#39;s getting better and better and

21
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:31,430
doing a better job of delivering a good user experience.

22
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,140
The iterative design process that we apply in user experience can be

23
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,800
thought of in this way.

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,376
We think of it as three phases involving assessment, design, and building.

25
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:48,674
So in the assessment phase, initially, what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re assessing what

26
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:51,337
users are currently doing and what their needs are so

27
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:55,392
that we can understand the design space and the problems that they&#39;re facing so

28
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:58,450
that we can design products that will address those needs.

29
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,160
In the design phase, we take what we&#39;ve learned in the initial assessment and

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,310
come up with ideas, lots of ideas, for how we might

31
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,370
deliver a product that solves the problem that we&#39;ve identified in the assessment.

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,330
In the build phase, we take those design ideas or

33
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,580
a subset of those design ideas, and we build them into prototypes or

34
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,430
some kind of representation that we can use to communicate a particular idea.

35
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,020
So that we can then use it to get feedback on whether that

36
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,900
idea is headed in the right direction or in the wrong direction.

37
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,830
And we can then apply assessment methods, like user testing or

38
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,390
formal inspection methods, to see if that prototype

39
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,560
is leading towards a good user experience or a bad user experience.

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,372
And then we take what we learn from that, and we repeat it all again.

41
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:48,537
We go back to the drawing board.

42
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,332
We design new ideas.

43
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:51,527
We build new prototypes.

44
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,370
We perform new assessments.

45
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,060
And we continue this until we&#39;re satisfied that the product is ready to go.

46
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,150
Another way to visualize this process

47
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,240
that helps to show how the process could be iterative but

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,050
still progress towards an ultimate endpoint is to view it as a spiral.

49
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,860
Where we start on the outside with the assessment phase, and we traverse

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,680
around the spiral through the design, build, and assessment phase multiple times

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,100
until we ultimately reach the center, which is the endpoint, the final design.

52
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,700
The other thing that&#39;s nice about this visualization,

53
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,170
is it kinda gives you a sense of you&#39;re zeroing in on a target.

54
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,370
And you&#39;re getting closer and closer as you progress, and the design is getting

55
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,230
more and more finalized and hopefully better as time goes on.

56
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,890
So we can see from this that an iterative design process

57
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,440
includes both user experience research as well as user experience design.

58
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,260
And it&#39;s critical that both research and

59
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,540
design are used in a balanced way to iterate towards a successful solution.

60
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,449
So for UX research, there&#39;s a set of methods,

61
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,672
well-known methods that can be applied to understand user needs and

62
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:07,899
evaluate prototypes as they&#39;re being developed.

63
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:11,517
So for example, we often conduct interviews to understand more

64
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:15,480
about users&#39; needs and how they currently do things.

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,980
We conduct observations to actually watch what people do and

66
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,090
how they do it to understand things that they might not be able to tell us

67
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,640
very effectively through interviews.

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,013
Sometimes we conduct surveys, especially when we&#39;re wanting to reach a very large

69
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:33,773
audience, and we need to understand characteristics and behaviors and

70
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,637
attitudes of that large audience.

71
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:38,412
And we&#39;re not able to reach out to every member of that audience,

72
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,140
because there&#39;s just too many of them.

73
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,250
We use user testing to take a prototype or

74
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,190
a system that we&#39;ve developed and figure out whether or

75
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,310
not people are able to accomplish what they need with that prototype or system.

76
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,010
We also apply a range of inspection methods where we can use best practices

77
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,730
and knowledge about what works and what doesn&#39;t to take a close look at

78
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,730
a prototype or representation of a system to determine whether itâ€™s on track for

79
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,700
delivering a good user experience or not.

80
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,170
We also apply a set of design methods throughout the UX process.

81
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,400
So for example, developing personas and scenarios and

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,510
user stories to represent the types of people that need to use the system and

83
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,060
the types of things that they need to be able to accomplish with the system.

84
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,440
We also use sketching and

85
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,520
ideation to generate lots of different possible solutions so that we know that we

86
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,730
have a lot that we can choose from so that we can get the best ideas out there.

87
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,285
We use storyboarding to think through what the interaction with a system might be.

88
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:43,965
So we can see whether it makes sense and

89
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:47,495
whether that&#39;s gonna be something that results in a good user experience.

90
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:52,235
We use mapping and navigation design to map out all the different things that

91
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,075
you can do with the system and make sure that they all make sense together.

92
00:05:56,715 --> 00:06:00,785
We conduct a comparative research where we go out and look at the competition or

93
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:04,979
other examples of products that are trying to accomplish similar things to try to

94
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,693
understand what are the best practices out there and

95
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:10,120
what are the things that we might wanna avoid.

96
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,044
And we build multiple different types of prototypes from low to middle

97
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:20,052
to high fidelity prototypes throughout the process to put those design

98
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:24,724
ideas into a form that we can use for getting effective feedback and

99
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:27,740
using for assessments like user testing.

100
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,730
And as I said, it&#39;s important to understand a little bit about how people

101
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,550
work so that when we&#39;re going through that design and prototyping process,

102
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,840
we&#39;re creating stuff that&#39;s more likely to be effective in the end.

103
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,554
So understanding things like, well, what can people perceive?

104
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:47,036
How does the human visual system work, for example?

105
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:51,000
So how do people extract information from visual stimuli?

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,060
How can you design a screen or a web page so

107
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,560
that people can actually understand what&#39;s on it?

108
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,790
How do people do things?

109
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,163
How do people act in the world?

110
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:04,411
How do they decide how to act in the world?

111
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:07,964
And how do they process information about the results of their action?

112
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:10,990
How do they know if they&#39;re going in the right direction or

113
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,200
if they need to take a different path?

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,210
So that we can design systems that guide people

115
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,480
in the direction that they need to go.

116
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,360
And how does emotion play a role, or how, when, and why does emotion affect

117
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,270
decision making, and what role does emotion play in user experience?

118
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:34,869
So the we can design systems that produce satisfying positive emotions in our users.

119
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,190
And finally, we wanna set ourselves up so

120
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,070
that we can use our common sense to design systems that will work.

121
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,298
In a process that puts you in touch with user needs and practices and

122
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:51,151
user responses to possible designs through user testing and

123
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:55,327
other methods will allow you to see what works and what doesn&#39;t.

124
00:07:55,327 --> 00:08:00,225
So that&#39;s how we make user experience easy, we make it easy on ourselves as

125
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:05,537
designers of systems to produce products that deliver a great user experience.

126
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:08,730
We followed an iterative prototyping process.

127
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,770
We apply user-centered research and design methods throughout the process.

128
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,910
We understand a bit about human behavior, so

129
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,455
that we can stir the process in a positive direction.

130
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,388
And we set ourselves up to be able to apply common sense, so

131
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:26,206
that we are constantly moving towards a product that will, in the end,

132
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,560
deliver a great user experience.
