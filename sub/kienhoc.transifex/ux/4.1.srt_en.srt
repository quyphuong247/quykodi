So what do we mean when we talk about designed in UX?

1
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,090
Well, I&#39;d like to start by thinking about how the term design is used in common,

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,650
everyday ways.

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,410
And I&#39;d like to do that by looking at what happens when we do a search on Google

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,860
images for design.

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,460
Well, what we see are a lot of

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,820
visual images that are essentially decorations of some kind.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,443
If we scroll down we can see lot&#39;s of graphical images and

8
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:43,000
some tools that are used for producing graphic images.

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,640
And so commonly when people talk about design they talk about

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,300
how something looks.

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,710
Maybe what decorations it has, what form it has.

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,890
However, this is a very narrow and specific use of design.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,600
Steve Jobs once said,

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,230
most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like.

15
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,210
People think it&#39;s this veneer, that the designers are handed this box and

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,680
told make it look good.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,560
But that&#39;s not what we think design is.

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,160
It&#39;s not just what it looks like and feels like.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,767
Design is how it works.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,806
Charles Eames, a well known mid-century furniture designer,

21
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:25,679
said, design is a plan for

22
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:31,890
arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose.

23
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,470
So from these two quotes we start to get a picture of design as being first a plan.

24
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,680
So a design is not the final product, tt&#39;s not the outcome, but

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,200
it&#39;s a plan for producing that product or that outcome.

26
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,460
And it&#39;s a plan for arranging elements and

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,670
those elements will depend on the type of product that it is.

28
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:59,910
So the elements could be, gears and pulleys or it could be wood and leather.

29
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,010
It could be lines and swatches of color on a page.

30
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,720
Or in the case of UX, it could be things like text and

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,750
icons and buttons and images.

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,650
A design is a plan for arranging elements to accomplish a purpose.

33
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,100
So, there is a purpose that this design is supposed to accomplish and

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,120
it&#39;s supposed to help the users, or the consumers of the design to accomplish.

35
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,110
And ultimately, a design is mostly about how it works and

36
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,540
the functionality, and not just about how it looks.

37
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,650
Of course, it also includes what it looks like and what it feels like.

38
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,280
The well known designer and architect Buckminster Fuller said,

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,360
when I&#39;m working on a problem, I never think about beauty.

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,948
I only think about how to solve the problem.

41
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:51,270
But when I&#39;ve finished, if the solution isn&#39;t beautiful, I know it&#39;s wrong.

42
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,220
So here, we see an echo of Steve Jobs point, that a design is not strictly

43
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,300
about beauty, but we see an emphasis on design being about solving problems.

44
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,440
So this brings us to our first major point that design is about solving problems.

45
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,410
So what do we mean by solving problems and

46
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,110
what are the kinds of problems that design can solve?

47
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,869
Well let&#39;s look at an example, this is Zappos, which is

48
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:26,940
e-commerce site that primarily focuses on selling shoes.

49
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,950
They sell lots of other clothes now, but they started out selling shoes.

50
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,160
And so what is the problem that a product like this is trying to solve?

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,910
Well, it&#39;s trying to solve the problem that some people need shoes.

52
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,870
Well that&#39;s simple, because it so happens that the creators of Zappos

53
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,680
want to sell shoes, so this should work out perfectly.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,590
However, the problem is a little bit more sophisticated then that because there&#39;s

55
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,680
lots of ways that people can get shoes.

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,700
They can go to a shoe store,

57
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,370
they can go to lots of other websites to get their shoes.

58
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,570
So maybe we need to understand the problem a little bit better.

59
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,910
Well, so maybe it turns out that what consumers need is shoes

60
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,380
that they can acquire conveniently, without having to go out and

61
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,350
go shopping and spend the time that it takes to do that.

62
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,040
They want to receive them fast,

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,812
they want to be able to get them within a day or two.

64
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:25,690
They wanna be able to find shoes that are in their style that they actually like.

65
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,501
And I need it to be reliable, they need to be sure that when they invest

66
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:33,930
the time in going onto Zappos that they&#39;re going to have a successful outcome.

67
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,814
Maybe it turns out also that people don&#39;t know exactly what they want and

68
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:41,150
they need inspiration.

69
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,400
They need to be able to be led to the choices that are going to be

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,940
satisfying for them.

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,880
And by the way, there are a lot of different consumers who have different

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,860
tastes and we&#39;re all different.

73
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,590
So this can lead to a more precise articulation of what the solution to

74
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,100
this problem of delivering shoes to consumers might consist of.

75
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,898
So now as the creator of this product,

76
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:08,751
I might be able to articulate what I&#39;m trying to do.

77
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:13,450
As I want to be able to sell shoes faster, more conveniently, with more selection,

78
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,770
in a way that&#39;s more personalized than the alternatives.

79
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,850
I wanna do it in a way that&#39;s fun and inspiring for people.

80
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,080
So if they have a positive experience and

81
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,502
that they end up finding shoes that they enjoy and that delight them.

82
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:31,660
And I want to do this across many demographics and styles.

83
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,340
So what we&#39;ve seen here is we&#39;ve gone from a very simple

84
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,300
high level problem statement, and we&#39;ve really unpacked it

85
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,140
to understand more specifically what this product needs to accomplish.

86
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,640
So we&#39;ve not only understood the problem better, but

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,020
we&#39;ve understood better what the form of a solution needs to be.

88
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,350
The design researcher Bryan Lawson,

89
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,600
who studied how designers work across many domains, across many years.

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,780
Has said that design is as much a matter of finding problems as it is solving them.

91
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,650
And I would add, it&#39;s about articulating problems in such a way that you can

92
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,320
understand what the form and the criteria of a solution ought to be.

93
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,090
So we can look at a very simplified version of the process that we follow

94
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,040
when we&#39;re designing.

95
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,360
The first step is understanding the problem, and

96
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,940
as we said making sure that you understand the problem

97
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,630
well enough that you can envision what a solution would look like.

98
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,320
What would the solution have to have, in order to actually solve that problem.

99
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,750
At that point, you can generate possible solutions.

100
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,357
You can start thinking about different possible ways to solve that problem.

101
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:45,794
And the goal here is actually to produce lots of different solutions,

102
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:48,310
that could be candidates for solving the problem.

103
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,584
Given those possible solutions,

104
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:56,520
the next step is to analyze systematically the solutions against the criteria that

105
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,423
you established for what a solution ought have.

106
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:04,214
And select the ones that are the most promising, that can be elaborated and

107
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:06,610
brought forward to the next phases.

108
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,180
The next step is to embody those solution which means to build

109
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,020
some kind of a prototype that can be used for

110
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,930
really understanding how this solution would work.

111
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,880
And that can also be used for assessing whether or

112
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,680
not we&#39;re moving along the right track.

113
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,070
At the assessment phase, what you wanna do is,

114
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,490
you wanna find new problems, one&#39;s that you missed the first time around.

115
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,060
Maybe you missed important requirements, or you missed important constraints, and

116
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,600
now you&#39;re going to go back to the beginning, understand those problems,

117
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,170
generate possible solutions, and so on and so forth.

118
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,230
So, to look at an example of how this all works,

119
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,540
I&#39;d like to show you a pretty cool project that I just came across recently.

120
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,120
It&#39;s called 50 Problems in 50 Days, and

121
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,370
it&#39;s this British designer named Pete Smart who travelled all over Europe.

122
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,310
And set as a goal for himself to do 50 designs in 50 days starting with

123
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,270
understanding a problem in the morning.

124
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,450
Working through solutions and

125
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:10,120
coming up with prototype of a solution by the evening.

126
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,022
So one that I like is day 29, [BLANK AUDIO] and

127
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:19,870
he was staying at a hostel in Amsterdam.

128
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,684
And he observed that at his hostel,

129
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:25,924
the staff sometimes have guests who can&#39;t speak a language that they understand.

130
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:29,796
So there&#39;s this communication problem between the staff at the hostel and

131
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:31,060
the guests.

132
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,300
So today&#39;s challenge, he said,

133
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,619
was work with the hostel staff to develop a system to assist communication.

134
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,318
So he started out by sitting down with the staff and

135
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:46,269
asking them to think of questions they are often asked by guests.

136
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,592
And have them write them down on post it notes, and created just a huge number

137
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:54,935
of the types of questions that they often have to answer on a day to day basis.

138
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,630
So this was part of understanding the problem and understanding

139
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,950
at a more specific way, going from the general problem of communication to say,

140
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,630
what are the specific types of communication we need to address?

141
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,753
He went forward from there to organize those into different categories of

142
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:12,561
questions.

143
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:16,736
Say well are there themes or are there patterns that we can leverage when trying

144
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:18,580
to come up with design solutions?

145
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,716
And from that, was able to organize a communication architecture to summarize

146
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:26,905
the flow of interactions with guests.

147
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:31,121
So how do they go about figuring out what the question is and

148
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:34,410
what type of answer the guest is looking for?

149
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,564
And further, went through to categorize these into key themes, and

150
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:43,090
actually asked the hostel staff to work with him to draw some of the key themes

151
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,990
such as luggage check out, train station, breakfast and so forth.

152
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,000
And look at how those could be communicated

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,610
through pictures since the problem is that

154
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,450
people don&#39;t have a shared language that they can use to talk about these things.

155
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,260
He then engaged in rapid prototyping.

156
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,370
So basically sketching out and trying out different ideas that could be used

157
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,670
to facilitate this kind of communication.

158
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,630
And then ultimately iterated through those to come up with this particular prototype.

159
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,820
Which was a book that could be used to facilitate communication.

160
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,290
And the way it works is, a guest could take the book,

161
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,330
they could point to whether they had a question or a statement.

162
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,760
What was the type of question that they were trying to ask.

163
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,161
Was it about when something happens, why something happens, where it is or

164
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:34,770
about the hostel staff themselves?

165
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,550
And then from there could go on and

166
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,210
ask more specific questions using these pictorial representations.

167
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,910
So in that simple example, just a one day very short example,

168
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,680
we saw all of these steps, except for maybe the last one taking place.

169
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,790
Understanding the problem, generating possible solutions, analyzing and

170
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,950
selecting from those possible solutions, and embodying those solutions.

171
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,410
in a way that could help both the designer, the hostel staff, and

172
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,390
potentially other people assess whether or not it actually solves the problem.

173
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,340
&gt;From there, you would ordinarily go on and iterate and try to refine and

174
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,280
come up with better solutions based on what you learned from that.

175
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,350
In some of the other lectures,

176
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,720
we&#39;ve talked about the iterative design process that we use in UX research and

177
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,030
design, to come up with products that deliver a great user experience.

178
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,310
And I just wanna point out that this design process that I&#39;ve just described,

179
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,950
is aligned with the process that we&#39;ve been talking about.

180
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,610
So when we talk about understanding the problem,

181
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,140
that&#39;s aligned with what we&#39;ve been calling the assessment phase.

182
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,030
Where we understand initially what it is that people are doing.

183
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,060
What works and what doesn&#39;t for them.

184
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,080
And then, using that to understand

185
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,260
what problems we&#39;re going to solve in the design phase.

186
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,670
Generating possible solutions is what we do during that initial design phase,

187
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,060
to try to explore the space of possible solutions.

188
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,610
And towards the end of that design phase,

189
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,640
we analyze and select the most promising solutions.

190
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:11,213
In the build phase, we embody those potential solutions in the form of

191
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:15,182
prototypes that we can then use with UX research methods.

192
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:16,059
To assess and

193
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:20,780
find new problems that we can use in the next phase of design and build.

194
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,640
So what I&#39;ve described here is actually a general design process.

195
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,510
It can be used for

196
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:33,220
designing anything from a tube of toothpaste to an aircraft carrier.

197
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,060
So what is it that&#39;s special about UX design?

198
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,690
Well a couple of things,

199
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,506
one is that the experiences in the systems that we&#39;re building are interactive.

200
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:47,690
Which means that they&#39;re time based, they occur across time.

201
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,688
They&#39;re based around action response rules and getting those rules, what hjappens

202
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,182
when a user does x is one of the critical things that we&#39;re focusing on, and

203
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,090
what it is that we&#39;re trying to design.

204
00:12:58,872 --> 00:13:02,360
So to break that down more, thinking about designing action,

205
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,710
that&#39;s about designing the command options, or the things that users can do.

206
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,170
And when their thinking about the response part of that equation,

207
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,060
it&#39;s about what information is presented.

208
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,640
And what new commands are available when a particular command is invoked.

209
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,640
And as a result, in UX design where we&#39;re dealing with interactive systems,

210
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,850
we&#39;re often contending with complex system behavior.

211
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,610
Which drives us towards this focus on usability.

212
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,320
How can we make sure that people can navigate these complex systems,

213
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,660
in order to be able to accomplish the things that they need to do?

214
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,700
In UX design context is critical,

215
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,610
so understanding how and when and why people are using and

216
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,900
interacting with our systems, is critical to getting the design right.

217
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,820
So we need to understand the other interactions that people are having

218
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,800
with other systems, with other devices, with other people, and the other things

219
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,210
that they&#39;re doing, when they&#39;re trying to interact with our systems.

220
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,890
What other activities are they engaged in at the same time?

221
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,655
And what other people are involved?

222
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:12,310
Solooking at this design process that I introduced a few slides ago.

223
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,070
In mapping it onto the UX design process, we can see that understanding

224
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,810
the problem becomes very much about studying users and the tasks that they&#39;re

225
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,530
trying to accomplish in the context in which they&#39;re trying to accomplish them.

226
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,750
Generating possible solutions, takes the form of sketching different design ideas,

227
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,400
storyboarding to show how an interaction unfolds over time

228
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,090
wire framing specific screens, and so on and so forth.

229
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,980
Analyzing and selecting among the design solutions,

230
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,190
becomes not just about applying the criteria of

231
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,300
the design problem as we&#39;ve understood it, but also applying UX criteria.

232
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,220
What is it that we know about what delivers a good user experience, and

233
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,150
what drives us away from that?

234
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,920
Embodying the solutions is gonna be about building prototypes.

235
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,690
And we&#39;ll talk more about the different types of prototypes that you might build.

236
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,890
And assessing and finding new problems with those prototypes

237
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,610
is gonna be based around applying specific UX research methods,

238
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,510
like user testing, to be able to understand what those problems might be.

239
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,277
So to sum up, the design process, and we&#39;ll be talking about this more in other

240
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:21,990
lectures, is about understanding the problem,

241
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,640
generating possible solutions, analyzing and

242
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,112
selecting from among those possible solutions, embodying them in a prototype.

243
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:32,188
And then assessing them to see whether we&#39;re on track or not,

244
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:35,340
in finding new problems that we need to solve in the next phase.
