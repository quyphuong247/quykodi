UX designers do a lot of sketching throughout the design process.

1
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,200
What do we mean when we talk about a sketch?

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,970
A sketch is a cheap rapidly constructed representation of an idea.

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,470
And it can take many different forms as you can see here.

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,100
The qualities of a sketch that are important for

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,430
the design process is that they&#39;re quick to create, they&#39;re timely.

6
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,620
They can be inserted into the design process in multiple difference ways.

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,900
They&#39;re inexpensive, they&#39;re disposable, you don&#39;t make a commitment to them,

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,679
you can get rid of them if they don&#39;t work.

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,450
They&#39;re plentiful, you can create lots of them, and often that is what you wanna do.

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,850
They involve minimal detail.

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,840
So you don&#39;t spend a lot of time working on details that are not important to what

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,130
you&#39;re trying to think through, or

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,560
what you&#39;re trying to communicate at a particular stage.

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,520
And they allow for ambiguity.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,200
So they facilitate conversation about other design possibilities without

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,820
locking people into thinking about particular solutions.

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,530
Bill Buxton has talked a lot about sketching and

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,080
its roll in the UX design process.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,460
And he says sketching in the broad sense is an activity,

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,280
not just a byproduct of design.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,820
It is central to design thinking and learning.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,870
And sketches are a byproduct of sketching.

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,552
They are part of what both enables and results from the sketching process.

24
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:32,700
But there&#39;s more to the activity of sketching than making sketches.

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,660
And I think what&#39;s really critical here is thinking about the process and

26
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,750
the goals of sketching as being different from the output, which are the sketches.

27
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,810
So why sketch?

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,890
Why engage in this activity of sketching?

29
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,210
Well one reason is it allows us to reflect by putting our ideas out there

30
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,440
in a quick and inexpensive way.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,900
We can reflect on how they work, and whether they actually make sense.

32
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,980
They allow us to explore rapidly a whole set of different

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,930
ideas that might be very different or might be similar.

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,720
And we can very quickly explore an entire design space.

35
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:12,610
And sketches allow us to communicate quickly and

36
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,320
in a way that&#39;s appropriate to the stage of the design process.

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,810
Especially when we&#39;re exploring ideas

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,360
trying to get feedback on what the right way is to go.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,710
How should you go about sketching?

40
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,385
Well first, you wanna use pencil and paper, or maybe a whiteboard.

41
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:31,710
Computer-based tools are gonna force you to

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,880
deal with all of these details like colors, and font, and

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,930
precise layout, that aren&#39;t really appropriate for the sketching activity.

44
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,770
You wanna be able to go fast and

45
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,960
you wanna not focus on perfecting the individual sketches.

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,975
Rather you wanna focus on making lots of sketches,

47
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:51,180
sketching lots of different ideas.

48
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,020
It&#39;s also important to realize that you don&#39;t have to be good at drawing to

49
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,999
produce sketches that are effective for reflection and communication.

50
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,750
When we sketch an UX design there are several different things that we might

51
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,600
think about sketching.

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,685
One is sketching the problem,

53
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:11,360
trying to better understand the problem that you&#39;re trying to solve.

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,642
So how would someone experience this problem?

55
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:17,111
And you might do this through showing storyboards that depict somebody

56
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,490
experiencing the problem.

57
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,940
You might also sketch the solution.

58
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,890
What would it look like for the problem to be solved?

59
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,330
And you often are gonna be sketching the system that would be needed to help solve

60
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,150
that problem.

61
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,530
And all three of these will help you understand the design space,

62
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,030
understand what the solution ought to be able to accomplish.

63
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,680
And what a system would have to look like in order to solve that problem.

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,930
A closely related idea, in the UX design process, is the notion of a prototype.

65
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,280
And this can be confusing sometimes, because a sketch can be a prototype.

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,540
A prototype is often defined as a representation

67
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,700
of a design before the final design is produced.

68
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,630
And sketches often accomplish that.

69
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,820
And also, a prototype can be a sketch.

70
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,630
Meaning that they can be produced on pen and paper in a very rapid fashion, and

71
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,930
low fidelity prototypes are in fact just that.

72
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,210
But the thinking that goes into sketching and prototyping is a bit different.

73
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,660
And you can think of it as kind of a spectrum.

74
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,970
Bill Buxton has talked about sketches as being evocative

75
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,720
where prototypes are didactic and try to explain.

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,640
Sketches suggest possibilities and opportunities,

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,380
where prototypes describe a particular idea that you&#39;re trying to get across.

78
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,770
Sketches explore while prototypes refine those initial explorations.

79
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,330
Sketches might help raise questions whereas prototypes

80
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,400
try to answer those questions.

81
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,270
Sketches propose ideas where prototypes can be used to test those ideas and

82
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,790
assessments.

83
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,270
Sketches might provoke whereas prototypes resolves.

84
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,430
Sketches are tentative, prototypes are specific.

85
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,630
Sketches are noncommittal where prototypes are about

86
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,319
committing to a particular idea and seeing if it works.

87
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,670
So you can see sketches and

88
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,210
prototypes as playing different roles in the design process.

89
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,310
And each of them being connected to different processes

90
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,640
that unfold within the broader design process.

91
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,250
So we have on the one hand the process of generation, creating alternatives and

92
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,950
elaboration of ideas.

93
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,870
And on the other we have convergence, which is the reduction of alternatives and

94
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,540
selection of contenders that are worth investing further in.

95
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,920
And we go through these stages of convergence and

96
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,560
generation multiple times during the design process.

97
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,862
And typically sketching is going to be associated with those generation phases,

98
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:38,710
where we&#39;re trying to expand the design space.

99
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,640
And prototyping is gonna be associated with those phases of convergence.

100
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,410
Where we&#39;re trying to narrow down the design space and

101
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,290
make decisions about which direction to go.

102
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,620
So in the generation phase you&#39;re gonna be focused on sketching.

103
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,510
You&#39;re gonna be focused on quantity over quality,

104
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,780
producing lots of different ideas.

105
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,060
And you&#39;re gonna be focusing on building the set of design ideas.

106
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,500
And not necessarily critiquing them or selecting which ones are viable,

107
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,010
which ones make the most sense.

108
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,370
You&#39;re just gonna be trying to create a lot of different ideas so

109
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,450
you have a lot to choose from.

110
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,900
And you&#39;re gonna apply lateral thinking techniques,

111
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,680
which we&#39;ll talk a little bit more about in a minute.

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,480
To help get you to think more broadly and

113
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,190
to get out of your own way to generate lots of different ideas.

114
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,010
Especially when you get stuck in particular ways of thinking.

115
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,850
In the phases of convergence you&#39;re gonna be focused differently.

116
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,500
You&#39;re gonna be thinking about how to synthesize those different ideas into

117
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,350
something that&#39;s coherent.

118
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,430
You&#39;re gonna be thinking about applying criteria that you&#39;ve established

119
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,200
through your understanding of user needs and your requirements.

120
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,720
To decide which of those design ideas that you&#39;ve sketched

121
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,120
are gonna be the ones that actually satisfy the design goals going forward.

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,800
You&#39;re gonna be focused more on critiquing,

123
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,740
finding out what are the flaws and what are the strengths of each idea.

124
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,290
So that you can pick the ones that are gonna work the best going forward.

125
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,930
You&#39;re gonna be focused on eliminating certain ideas and

126
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,039
promoting other ideas to take forward in the design process.

127
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,350
One thing to keep in mind when you&#39;re sketching is that you will get stuck,

128
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,340
everybody does.

129
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,015
You get to a point where you&#39;ve run out of ideas,

130
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:23,910
you&#39;ve put all your best ideas down there and you think you&#39;ve got nothing left.

131
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,680
Well it&#39;s important to push through that point, and

132
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,050
there are techniques that you can use to help you get through that.

133
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,070
So techniques that you can apply include things like brainstorming,

134
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,570
which is typically a collaborative process with multiple people.

135
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,760
And there are specific techniques that can be used

136
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,950
to generate the best ideas from a group and capture them.

137
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,130
There are other techniques that you can apply on your own.

138
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,890
For example, matrix techniques where you lay out different design ideas, and

139
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,660
different criteria for how to develop them.

140
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,700
And force yourself to fill in that whole table with different design ideas, and

141
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,360
kind of make yourself explore a whole space.

142
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,110
One particular form of this is called morphological analysis,

143
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,910
which I&#39;m not gonna talk about in anymore detail right now.

144
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,490
Another idea that I really like is a technique called the worst idea.

145
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,070
So when you&#39;re stuck and

146
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,340
you&#39;re trying to think of good ideas that will solve your design problem.

147
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,230
Switch to think about the worst idea you possibly can for solving the problem.

148
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,920
So here&#39;s an example of really bad ideas for

149
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,550
improving the photo sharing website, flickr.

150
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,800
So, maybe you could take people&#39;s photos and just smear them all together.

151
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,690
Maybe you could take inspiration from failed products like New Coke and Edsel.

152
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,440
Maybe you could make the navigation really, really bad so

153
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,380
that people cannot figure out how to get anywhere.

154
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,260
Or maybe you could just make it look totally random.

155
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,770
And sometimes by doing this, you can use them for inspiration.

156
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,930
You can think about what it is that makes those ideas so bad and

157
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,370
focus on how you can fix them.

158
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,270
And every once in a while, something comes out of this that will actually

159
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,331
point you in a direction that you wouldn&#39;t have gone otherwise.

160
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,330
So go and sketch, the most important thing to get out of this is that sketching

161
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,190
is an important part of the process.

162
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,370
And when you&#39;re sketching you need to think about doing quick sketches that

163
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,790
are imperfect, rather than trying to perfect each idea.

164
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,820
You&#39;re trying to generate quantity over quality.

165
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,510
Because what you&#39;re focusing on is generating ideas rather than selecting

166
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,590
ideas and converging to the one great idea.

167
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,130
And you can use lateral thinking techniques when you get stuck as a way to
