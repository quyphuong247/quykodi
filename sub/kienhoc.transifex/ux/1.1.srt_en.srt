Hello and welcome to Introduction to User Experience.

1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,530
I&#39;m Mark Newman.

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,230
I&#39;m an Associate Professor in the School of Information here at

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,750
the University of Michigan.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,850
And I&#39;m very excited to be offering this course and serving as your instructor.

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,130
User experience is an exciting and growing field in which experts apply research and

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,010
design methods to create products that people love.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,860
In this course, I&#39;ll be introducing you to what user experience is and what it&#39;s all

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,140
about and showing you a process that you can use to ensure that products

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,600
that you are creating or trying to improve will deliver a great user experience.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,850
In this course, you will also dive into UX research and

11
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,500
design methods that you can use right away.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,910
And I&#39;ll also give you an idea of what it is like to work in this field.

13
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,910
Once again, welcome to the course.

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,395
I think you&#39;ll have a great time and

15
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,080
learn a lot and I look forward to seeing what you can accomplish.
