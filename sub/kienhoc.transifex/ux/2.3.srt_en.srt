00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:12,657
https://youtu.be/l9TF0RPO8AE
So we&#39;ve just talked about how to choose your tasks and

1
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:15,574
how to put tasks together for user tasks.

2
00:00:15,574 --> 00:00:18,857
But there&#39;s another important aspects of designing your tasks

3
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:20,140
that can be a bit tricky.

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,800
And I&#39;m gonna go through some pitfalls,

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,280
and give you some ideas about how to avoid them.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,490
And these are pitfalls around the wording of the tasks themselves.

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,020
So how do you explain to your participants what it is that you want them to do?

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,720
Well one of the things you need to be careful about Is not leading the witness.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,500
And what I mean by that is, not giving away information in the wording of

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,620
the task that you present, that will give clues about how to accomplish the task.

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,890
Here&#39;s an example.

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,920
If we were looking at Amazon, and you were to give the task

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,290
put 3 books in your shopping cart, then purchase them using Standard Shipping.

14
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,750
This would actually give your participant some clues about what it is you wanted

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,520
them to do, and how you wanted them to do it.

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,820
So by using terms like shopping cart and standard shipping,

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,340
you&#39;re actually using terms that are used in the interface.

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,250
In fact they&#39;re visible on the screen at certain points.

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,900
And it makes it very easy for

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,620
your participant to just look at the instructions that you gave them.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,170
Look at the screen, do a one do one mapping, and accomplish the task in

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,320
a way it might be easier that it would be for them naturally, if they came

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,710
with a different task in mind, or a different way of thinking about it.

24
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,800
So what you wanna do instead is you wanna try to use relatively neutral terms,

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,840
that don&#39;t use the terms that appear in the interface.

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,800
So you might for example say, choose three books and

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,690
buy them, making sure they can get here by next Wednesday.

28
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,970
And so here we haven&#39;t said anything about the shopping cart.

29
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,500
We haven&#39;t said anything about the shipping option.

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,110
But we&#39;ve given a task that is probably more realistic for

31
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,930
somebody who&#39;s coming with a goal, that I need to buy certain books, and

32
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,650
buy them by this particular time.

33
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,000
Another thing you wanna be careful about is avoid ambiguity

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,810
in the task instructions.

35
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,990
So here&#39;s another example.

36
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,780
Use a list to find a gift for your ten year old nephew.

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,950
And what you might have had in mind is to use

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,370
one of the list functions that Amazon has.

39
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,950
So they provide gift registries, and

40
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,120
they provide favorites lists and various other kinds of things.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,480
And by wording it this way, you haven&#39;t really

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,160
guided the user towards using the function or the feature that you&#39;re trying to test.

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,620
But You&#39;ve left it open to interpretation and it&#39;s very reasonable, for

44
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,850
example, for a user to think that the list of terms that they get back from a search

45
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,790
is a list.

46
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,230
And maybe that&#39;s what you meant.

47
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,710
And they might not actually be going through the process that you&#39;d expected.

48
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,280
So how might we fix this.

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,320
Well, we might give instructions like this, a friend told you that Amazon has

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,310
helpful helpful gift idea list for different age groups.

51
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,644
Find a list that would be useful for finding a gift for

52
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,000
your 10-year old nephew&#39;s birthday party, and select a gift for him.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,079
So here, we haven&#39;t necessarily led them right to the feature that&#39;s on Amazon.

54
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,503
But we&#39;ve given them a plausible back story for

55
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,878
how they might have heard about this feature.

56
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:20,709
Why they might be looking for it.

57
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:27,830
And a goal that would lead them to use that feature to accomplish that goal.

58
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,300
Another thing that you often will need to do, is provide some context and

59
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,660
motivation.

60
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,650
Because as we talked about earlier, not all people are necessarily going to

61
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,350
have a clear idea about why this task will be accomplished,

62
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,380
or what would constitute success.

63
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,070
So an example of a task that lacks context and motivation would be buy a book,

64
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,710
and have it shipped by Monday.

65
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,490
Well what book and why do I need it by Monday?

66
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,370
It&#39;s hard for me to know how to be successful at this task.

67
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,420
I could probably figure it out.

68
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,040
I could probably do something.

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,970
But I might not put as much into it, or

70
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,890
you might not really see how I think about the process.

71
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,600
Because I&#39;ve had to fill in too many gaps in the instructions.

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,412
So what might we do instead?

73
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:18,060
Well here be an example of a highly contextualized and motivated task.

74
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,120
Where we would ask the participant.

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,050
It&#39;s Friday, and you&#39;ve just realized that you need a book on Japanese business

76
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,630
etiquette by Monday, so that you have time to brush up before your meeting with

77
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,970
colleagues from Japan on Wednesday.

78
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,700
Find and purchase an appropriate book, making sure it arrives in time.

79
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,850
So here you&#39;ve given a whole story about why it might be

80
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,140
really important that they get that book by a particular time.

81
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,290
And now they have to go in and figure out how to accomplish that task.

82
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,240
Again, we haven&#39;t led them to a particular feature,

83
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,210
or function, or way of doing it in the system.

84
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,910
But we&#39;ve given them some very clear constraints that would be interesting

85
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,839
to see how they deal with.

86
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,510
And one last thing that&#39;s important.

87
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,250
And we could go on.

88
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,980
There&#39;s lots of sort of art to crafting these tasks.

89
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,450
But one other thing that&#39;s important, is that it&#39;s often important

90
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,740
to provide information to the participant about.

91
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,770
How to indicate, when they are done with the task.

92
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,310
Because sometimes, it can be ambiguous.

93
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,860
And one thing you don&#39;t want to be in the position of doing,

94
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,370
is telling them that they&#39;ve satisfactorily.

95
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,880
They&#39;ve satisfied the task constraints.

96
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,220
So, we might to the task, from the previous slide.

97
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,970
Its Friday, you&#39;ve got to get this book on Japanese business etiquette.

98
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,330
You might add to all of your tasks, something like,

99
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,250
when you feel you have completed the task, please say I&#39;m done.

100
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,730
So that you&#39;re not telling them when they&#39;re done,

101
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,720
they&#39;re telling you when they&#39;re done.

102
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
This is quite a bit to remember.

103
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,840
And as I said, there&#39;s even other issues that can come up with

104
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,390
how you word your tasks, how you design your tasks.

105
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,650
And one of the things that&#39;s very important to do,

106
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,950
whenever you&#39;re designing and preparing for user tasks, is pilot test.

107
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,500
We do this because it&#39;s very hard to get right on the first try.

108
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,590
It&#39;s very hard to get the wording of the tasks,

109
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,600
the ordering of the tasks, all of the details right on the first try.

110
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,050
And what we mean by Pilot test, is try the tasks out first yourself.

111
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,590
Make sure it&#39;s possible to accomplish these tasks.

112
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,180
Make sure that there&#39;s not ambiguity, or

113
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,170
leading information that you can detect by just going through it.

114
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,210
But again, you design these tasks.

115
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,540
You might have designed the system, or you might be very familiar with system.

116
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,760
It might be hard to get out of your own way, so you might recruit a friend or two,

117
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,200
or colleagues.

118
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,670
And have them try out the tasks, and all of the other things that

119
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,830
you need them to do, before you go and try them with real participants.

120
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,530
The participants whose feedback and data you&#39;re really interested in capturing.

121
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,480
Another critical aspect of user testing

122
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,660
is a process that we call the Think Aloud protocol.

123
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,860
And the Think Aloud protocol, is basically asking your participants to say out loud,

124
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,280
what they&#39;re thinking, as they&#39;re going through and accomplishing the tasks.

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,160
And what we mean by thinking, and the kinds of things that you get them to talk

126
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
about are, when they&#39;re looking for something, what are they looking for?

127
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,300
What are they hoping to find on the screen?

128
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,030
What are they reading?

129
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,350
Even having them read aloud so you know what they&#39;re looking at.

130
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,170
Hypothesizing about how the system might work.

131
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,370
Are they going through different ideas about how they might accomplish

132
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,280
their tasks using the system.

133
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,210
Interpreting system options, how are they making sense of the information

134
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,490
presented to them on the screen?

135
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,250
What do I think is gonna happen if I click that button.

136
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,690
Or what do I think is going to happen if I enter text in this field right here?

137
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,140
Interpreting system feedback.

138
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,540
When the system provides feedback to them, how do they interpret it?

139
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,880
Did going to this other page, or

140
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,850
going to this other screen appear to be the right thing?

141
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,760
Or does it indicate to them that they are going in the wrong direction.

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,420
So, by thinking aloud, you can hear how they&#39;re interpreting it.

143
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,980
You know, this seems like I made a mistake.

144
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,000
You can get them to explain their decisions.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,610
Why did they choose to do it this way as opposed to that way?

146
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,610
Especially if they&#39;re going in a way that you didn&#39;t expect.

147
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,090
It&#39;s helpful to know why, what information led them there In that direction.

148
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,400
And how are they feeling?

149
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,520
Are the feeling frustrated?

150
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,600
Are they feeling happy?

151
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,150
Are they surprised in a pleasant way by the system?

152
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,190
Or are the getting angry and stressed out by using it?

153
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,313
So I&#39;m going to give a quick example how think aloud might work for

154
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:38,080
somebody that was accomplishing a task using Amazon.

155
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,550
Now let&#39;s use the example of finding a gift list that would useful for

156
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,764
buying a present for my 10 year-old nephew.

157
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:48,550
Okay.

158
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,850
So I am looking at the Amazon home page.

159
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,957
I am looking at the links across the top departments.

160
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:57,130
Your Amazon.com, today&#39;s deals Gift cards and registry.

161
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,210
Well I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right, but I&#39;m going to check.

162
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,120
No I don&#39;t want to get a gift card for him, so I&#39;m gonna go back.

163
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,570
Gift Card sale none of those seem right.

164
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,390
I don&#39;t see anything down here that would be useful.

165
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,100
Your account.

166
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,080
Okay I&#39;m not signed in.

167
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,500
I don&#39;t think I would need to do that.

168
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,800
Try to print out list, here we go lists,

169
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,340
okay so I&#39;m going to find a list, find a gift.

170
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,860
Okay that might be useful.

171
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,190
Who am I shopping for?

172
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,510
I&#39;m shopping for kids.

173
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,110
Okay that was pretty easy.

174
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,930
He definitely doesn&#39;t want clothes, maybe electronic toys.

175
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,170
Okay, and now I feel like I&#39;m in the right place, and

176
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,890
I can go on then to find a particular thing and so on and so forth.

177
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,010
But what you&#39;ve seen in this example is how a Think Aloud ought to work.

178
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,320
You saw me thinking through the process, evaluating the different options, and

179
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,750
just narrating what was going on in my head.

180
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,530
One thing to note about this,

181
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:06,760
is when you&#39;re conducting a user test, this is not natural for a lot of people.

182
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,120
And sometimes your participants will get quiet,

183
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,260
they&#39;ll get absorbed in what they are doing.

184
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,280
And at that point it&#39;s okay to just gently remind them to say hey,

185
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,680
could you let me know what you&#39;re doing, what you&#39;re thinking?

186
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,710
Make sure you keep telling me what&#39;s going on, so

187
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,109
that I can understand how you&#39;re going about this process.

188
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,720
The advantages to using Think Aloud in a user task,

189
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,970
is that you can hear how the user thinks about the task.

190
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,580
Because again they may think about it differently

191
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,310
than you did when you were designing it, or whoever designed it.

192
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,060
And they may think about it differently from what you expect.

193
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,370
You learn what the user actually sees or notices.

194
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,970
Are they failing to accomplish the task because they saw the right option but

195
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,940
they interpreted it the wrong way, or did they just never see it in the first place?

196
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,210
Did they get distracted by something else and go off in a different direction?

197
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,920
Or did they not notice it.

198
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,650
And you can hear how the user interprets options and feedback and so

199
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,370
it may be very clear to you what the right choice is or

200
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,550
what this feedback means but it might be different for the users.

201
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,920
And so understanding how the interpret it can be helpful for

202
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,700
diagnosing problems that you observe.

203
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,460
There are some disadvantages to using think aloud, however.

204
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,660
So, one disadvantage is that the timing will not be realistic.

205
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,860
It&#39;ll often slow people down to have to talk

206
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,430
through everything that they&#39;re thinking.

207
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,685
Attention to detail will also maybe to be not be quite realistic.

208
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:38,675
People might do things a little bit differently than they would if they&#39;re not

209
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:39,475
talking through things.

210
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:42,605
They might actually be more diligent about reading

211
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:45,725
through all of the options on the page before making a choice.

212
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:48,855
When that might not really be what they would do in the real world.

213
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:55,415
And it also forces you to have to determine some rules of engagement for

214
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,815
the conversation that happened.

215
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:04,610
It&#39;s very unnatural actually for somebody to be talking, and even asking questions.

216
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,050
And to have somebody who&#39;s standing right next to them, which in this case would be

217
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,790
you, who&#39;s observing the test, not answer those questions.

218
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,800
Did anybody say what is this supposed to do or why did it do that?

219
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,360
And you really don&#39;t want to answer those questions in the context of the test.

220
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,510
You want to see how they deal with it if you hadn&#39;t been there.

221
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,750
So if you&#39;re using the Think Aloud method, and you&#39;re not gonna sort of behave

222
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,680
like a normal person when they&#39;re trying to have a conversation with you.

223
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,810
You need to make that clear and

224
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,330
set expectations up front by saying, I want you to try to do this task.

225
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,320
I&#39;m here if you get stuck, and you really need help, but

226
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,250
I&#39;m gonna really try to let you go through this to the best of your ability.

227
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,130
And we&#39;ll talk about questions or problems that you had afterwards.

228
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,700
Given those advantages and disadvantages, as I said earlier, when you&#39;re conducting.

229
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,540
A user task for the purpose of finding problems.

230
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,940
And there are other reasons that we do user testing,

231
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,260
some of which we will talk about later in other courses.

232
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,340
The advantages for Think Aloud clearly outweigh

233
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,020
the disadvantages when the purpose is finding problems.

234
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,710
So the takeaway is, for what we&#39;re gonna be doing in this course, and

235
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,780
in the assignments that are coming up, we will use Think Aloud.

236
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,590
And it&#39;s the best thing for what we&#39;re trying to accomplish.

237
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,140
So those are some of the issues that you need to think about when writing

238
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,280
your task instructions.

239
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,942
In the next video, I&#39;ll talk about how to interact with your participants while

240
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:34,500
they&#39;re conducting the tasks.

241
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,520
And how to interact with them right after the task, so

242
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,060
you can get more information right after their experience.
