I hoped you&#39;ve enjoyed this introduction to user experience, and

1
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,660
I hope that you found it valuable.

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,540
I look forward to your comments in the course feedback, about the things that you

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,960
liked, and the things that we could do better in the future.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,260
What we talked about in this course is, first of all,

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,210
the importance of user experience.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,820
Why it&#39;s important to get it right, both from the user&#39;s perspective but

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,270
also from the perspective of the producer of the system or product.

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,100
We also talked about the fact that user experience doesn&#39;t come

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,570
easily or naturally.

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,890
You have to follow a certain process and

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,720
you have to keep certain things in mind to make sure it comes out well.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,570
But the good news is, we do know how to make it easier.

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,280
We know certain things that we can do to help

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,740
steer the product design process towards a positive outcome for users.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,110
And in particular we talked about following an iterative prototyping process

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,600
so that we can fail fast and learn from our mistakes.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,258
Apply user-centered research and design methods to make sure that we

18
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:15,980
keep users&#39; needs and users&#39; desires in focus throughout the entire process.

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,480
We also talked about the importance of understanding a bit about human behavior,

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,480
so that we can avoid obvious pitfalls and

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,420
move towards designs that will work better for people.

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,830
And we also talked about how an iterative process allows us to apply common sense

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,550
to steer towards a product design that will deliver a good user experience.

24
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,690
In this course, we&#39;ve also given you a little taste of

25
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,710
the kinds of things that we do in user experience research and design.

26
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,370
So you&#39;ve had the opportunity to conduct a micro-usability test,

27
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:53,520
to give you a little bit of a sense of how we evaluate systems with users.

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,180
And you&#39;ve gotten some experience with sketching and ideation,

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:02,180
going through the generate, converge, and generate process to start the process of

30
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,640
designing solutions to problems that you identify through user experience research.

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,750
So what next?

32
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,450
Where do you go from here?

33
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,017
Well, one way to go is to get deeper into UX Research.

34
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:18,977
So you can learn techniques and methods for better understanding user needs so

35
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:21,620
that you can design products that meet those needs.

36
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,890
You could learn techniques for doing formal user testing,

37
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,580
going beyond the micro-usability testing that we performed in this class.

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,470
You can learn about inspection methods or techniques you can use without users to

39
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,370
closely look at a prototype or a design, and compare it against best practices

40
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,060
that we know work for designing good user experiences and ones that don&#39;t work.

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,360
You can learn about large-scale user experience research methods like

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,400
web analytics and surveys and AB testing and distributed usability testing.

43
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,986
And these are useful when you&#39;re designing products that are intended to reach large

44
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:02,843
numbers of people.

45
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,517
You can also get deeper into user experience design and

46
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:11,364
gain more experience with building different types of prototypes,

47
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:14,890
from low fidelity to high fidelity prototypes.

48
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,410
You can learn techniques for representing users and

49
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,080
their tasks to help keep design teams focused on users and

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,180
their needs, and what it is that they&#39;re trying to accomplish.

51
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,150
You can learn about standard techniques for specifying system behavior.

52
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,070
So these are things like wireframes and flow maps that help translate

53
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,890
a design into something that a developer can take and build into a working system.

54
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,880
And you can gain experience with putting it all together.

55
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,140
So combining UX research and UX design in a single product and

56
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,490
going through that iterative process that we&#39;ve been talking about

57
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,100
several times to iterate towards a final design.

58
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,945
And this deeper dive is what we&#39;ve designed the MicroMasters in

59
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:06,670
User Experience Research and Design to accomplish.

60
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,220
So you&#39;re at the end now of the first class in the MicroMaster series.

61
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,720
The introduction to user experience.

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,260
After this, we offer a class called understanding user needs,

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,900
where you will look at methods for uncovering

64
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,190
what users&#39; needs are and how they currently try to satisfy those needs.

65
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,020
You can understand what works and what doesn&#39;t, and lay the groundwork for

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,880
a better design that could do a better job.

67
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,610
Principles of designing for humans looks at what we know about how people work,

68
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,830
how they perceive information, how they act in the world and

69
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,300
how they behave when interacting with systems.

70
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,890
So that we can design systems that work well with those capabilities and

71
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,880
those patterns of interaction that people naturally gravitate towards.

72
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,660
In the course evaluating designs with users,

73
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,360
we take a deeper dive into usability testing and other forms of interactions

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,490
with users, using a system or a prototype to gain insight into what works and

75
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,539
what doesn&#39;t when people try to accomplish tasks using those systems.

76
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,730
Next we offer a two-part series in UX design, where we first

77
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,730
take design from the basic initial concept to the stage of wireframes,

78
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,637
and then take the wireframe to an interactive prototype.

79
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:35,598
In UX research surveys, we look specifically at the survey method,

80
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:39,356
which is very important especially in large-scale UX efforts,

81
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:44,276
where we can collect information from huge numbers of people about their attitudes,

82
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,420
behaviors, and characteristics.

83
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,720
And following that we look at other scalable research methods like

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,240
web analytics and online experiments

85
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,570
where we can understand how people are using systems on a large scale.

86
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,350
And perform usability testing using hundreds or

87
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,809
even thousands of remote participants.

88
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,741
And finally, the MicroMasters in UX Research &amp; Design wraps up

89
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:14,715
with a capstone where you&#39;ll have the opportunity to take a project

90
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:19,689
all the way from an initial problem to a final design that you believe

91
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:24,426
will satisfy that problem and deliver a great user experience.

92
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,593
I hope that you will join me on this journey and

93
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:28,890
I look forward to seeing you in future classes.
