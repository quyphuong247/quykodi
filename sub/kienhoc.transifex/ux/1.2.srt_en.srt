We&#39;ve all had good and

1
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:14,580
bad experiences with products that we use in our daily lives.

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,172
So let&#39;s think for a minute about what makes an experience good and

3
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:21,802
what makes an experience not so good.

4
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:23,684
When we think about a good experience,

5
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:26,203
what are some words that we might use to describe it.

6
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:28,711
We might say that a product is useful, and

7
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:32,165
that it helps us accomplish something that we need to do.

8
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,310
We might say that it&#39;s easy to learn.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,448
Itâ€™s easy to figure out how to get things done with it.

10
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:38,571
It might be helpful.

11
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,241
It helps us accomplish something that&#39;s important to us.

12
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:43,270
It&#39;s accessible.

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,342
We can access it on the devices and in the places that we need,

14
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:54,621
and using the motor perceptual capabilities that we have available to us.

15
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,032
Perhaps it&#39;s attractive.

16
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:59,273
Perhaps its pleasant to look at, pleasant to interact with.

17
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:03,244
It might even be, in some cases, fun to interact with.

18
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:07,580
It might help us to feel more connected to other people or to the organization or

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,880
the company that&#39;s providing the service or the product.

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,732
There we dream that a product could be delightful and that the experience

21
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:20,619
could leave us feeling better than we did when we started using it.

22
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:25,402
And in the end, a good user experience is satisfying.

23
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:28,305
What about a bad user experience?

24
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:32,693
Well, we might think of a bad user experience as being one that&#39;s stressful.

25
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:36,653
One that perhaps we don&#39;t really know how to use the system to do what we

26
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:38,147
need to do.

27
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:39,917
Perhaps that&#39;s because it&#39;s confusing.

28
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,397
We&#39;re not sure which way to go, or

29
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:43,817
how to use the different features that are available.

30
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:45,624
Maybe it&#39;s ugly.

31
00:01:45,624 --> 00:01:50,307
Maybe it works okay, but it&#39;s just kind of unpleasant to look at, or is inelegant.

32
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:53,251
It&#39;s not enjoyable.

33
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:54,867
Perhaps it&#39;s distracting.

34
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:59,950
Perhaps it forces us to do thing or engage with, Features of the system that are not

35
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,202
part of what we&#39;re trying to accomplish, and therefore maybe it&#39;s inefficient.

36
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:08,653
It takes too long to do things and maybe it&#39;s tedious.

37
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:13,702
It forces us to re-enter information that we&#39;ve already given it or

38
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:15,887
that is should already know.

39
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:18,710
Some systems can even be condescending.

40
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:24,070
They force us to do things in ways that don&#39;t take advantage of our knowledge and

41
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,990
our skills and our abilities.

42
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,180
Some systems can feel inconsiderate.

43
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,280
They don&#39;t allow us to do things the way that we want to do them.

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,021
They force us to do it the way that their designers have decided things should work.

45
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:42,539
And, in the end, a bad user experience is often frustrating.

46
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,289
We leave the experience feeling worse than we did when we started.

47
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:48,351
Well why does it matter?

48
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:52,030
Of course, we&#39;d all like to have good user experiences, and

49
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,301
as designers of products, we would like to deliver good experiences.

50
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,880
Well, there&#39;s more to it than that.

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,920
When you&#39;re designing a system you&#39;re trying to solve a problem

52
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,910
that your users have.

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,280
But at the same time, you&#39;re trying to accomplish goals

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,820
that drove you to design the system in the first place.

55
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,800
Which might be getting people to visit your website or buy your product or

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,600
use your service to buy other products.

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,613
And it&#39;s important that your users experience success so

58
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:28,740
that you can meet the product goals.

59
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,087
Additionally, if your users experience success,

60
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,594
they&#39;re much more likely to come back and do it again.

61
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:40,418
And they&#39;re also much more likely to recommend your product to others to create

62
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:42,074
a kind of virtuless cycle.

63
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:45,462
Where not only are they coming back and using the system and

64
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:48,297
doing whatever it is that you want them to do, but

65
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:52,464
they&#39;re getting other people to try it out and do those things as well.

66
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,177
Let&#39;s go through a couple of examples here.

67
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:59,541
So let&#39;s take the example of Amazon.

68
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:05,705
Huge online retailer that sells pretty much everything under the sun.

69
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:09,553
Why is it important to Amazon that users have a good experience when

70
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:10,591
they come there?

71
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:13,425
Well the answer, initially, is pretty obvious.

72
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:16,451
Their goal is to get you to buy stuff through Amazon and

73
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:21,239
if you&#39;re not successful at buying stuff, they won&#39;t be successful as a company.

74
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,050
They also want you to enjoy the stuff that you get.

75
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,220
They want you to have a successful experience.

76
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,378
Not just in the process of buying it, but

77
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:30,993
with actually using whatever it is that you get.

78
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:34,780
So they wanna make sure that you have enough information to get the right thing.

79
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,459
And they do this through recommendations and reviews and product information and

80
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,233
all kinds of things like that.

81
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:44,110
If you enjoy the experience of using the system and

82
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,947
the experience of using the products that you buy through Amazon,

83
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:52,351
you&#39;re much more likely to come back again and buy more stuff in the future.

84
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:57,846
And you&#39;re also more likely to recommend Amazon to others when they need things for

85
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:59,031
their own lives.

86
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:01,073
Let&#39;s take a really different example.

87
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:05,260
This is the website of the city of Ann Arbor, which is the city where I live and

88
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,283
the city where the University of Michigan is located.

89
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:09,664
What are they trying to accomplish?

90
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:11,509
Why is it important for

91
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:16,865
a municipal website like this to deliver a good user experience?

92
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:21,664
Well, they built the website for a reason and of the primary reasons they built it

93
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:25,700
is to help citizens find information about how the city works.

94
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,680
Let&#39;s say I need to figure out how to pay my parking ticket or

95
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,500
report a pot hole or broke in street light or find out what

96
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,440
construction is gonna be happening that might affect my community to work.

97
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,700
By effectively delivering information,

98
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,910
the city website can help the residents of the city understand how the services work.

99
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,760
They can understand when their trash pickup day is, and how to report

100
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,570
problems when they arise, and how to use city services more efficiently.

101
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,240
Because at the end of the day, the goal that the city would have for a site like

102
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,560
this is to streamline the services that they offer to make it more efficient.

103
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,920
So that fewer people have to pick up the phone and call somebody or

104
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,570
come into a city office and use more time consuming ways of getting things done.

105
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,790
And like with any other good user experience,

106
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,190
if one user has a positive experience,

107
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,380
they&#39;re much more likely to recommend it to others when they have similar needs.

108
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,070
So let&#39;s look at one more example and

109
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,270
this one is quite different than the last two we looked at.

110
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,160
This is a digital glucometer which is a device that&#39;s used by people that have

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,650
diabetes to measure they&#39;re blood glucose level which is very important for

112
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,850
maintaining their health, for determining what is safe for them to eat, whether they

113
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,210
have to take an insulin dose to balance their blood sugar and so on and so forth.

114
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,390
So why is it important for

115
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,810
the manufacturers of this device to insure that users have a good user experience?

116
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,794
Well, a critical goal, with a device like this, is to improve its user&#39;s health.

117
00:06:55,794 --> 00:07:01,607
To make sure that users are successful at finding out what their health status so

118
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:05,611
that they can make the right decisions in their lives.

119
00:07:05,611 --> 00:07:10,572
Of course its very important with a product like this to make sure that they

120
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:11,570
do no harm.

121
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,066
So err on the side of safety where other design

122
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:19,215
considerations might be in tension with each other.

123
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:23,782
It&#39;s also important not just to convince users that this is a product that will

124
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:28,556
give them a positive user experience but also to convince the health providers and

125
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:30,711
insurers that this is a safe device.

126
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:35,231
But also a device that will result in a better health outcome for

127
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:37,455
the people that need to use it.

128
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:40,475
And again, like with other types of products,

129
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:44,315
if the users are successful at having a positive user experience,

130
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:47,555
they&#39;re much more likely to recommend it to others who have a similar need.

131
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:53,540
When we talk about the user experience, we&#39;re talking about, really,

132
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,550
the experience people have when they interact with your product

133
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,340
across the board.

134
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,462
That means, of course, using the product, but it also means other things like,

135
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:06,780
choosing the product from among the myriad of other products that might be out there.

136
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,635
Whether it&#39;s other websites, or other apps that are on the App Store.

137
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:14,503
Acquiring the product, how do they actually go from selecting the product to

138
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:17,428
getting it in their hands so that they can actually use it.

139
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:20,318
Whether it&#39;s access it via a web browser or

140
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:23,460
downloading it or purchasing it in the store.

141
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,922
It also includes the experience of learning to use the product.

142
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:31,630
So getting from that point of acquiring it in the first place to

143
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,286
actually being productive and experience success with it.

144
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:37,722
User experience also includes fixing the product.

145
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,906
Not everything works out of the box.

146
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:42,875
Perhaps it&#39;s because of a problem that somebody&#39;s having,

147
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,309
understanding how to use the product, or maybe the product is broken.

148
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,362
It needs to be fixed.

149
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:50,849
So how do they go about getting help when they&#39;re stuck, or

150
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:52,400
when they have a problem.

151
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,379
User experience also includes upgrading the product, or

152
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,571
purchasing the next product, or starting to use the next version of the product,

153
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,864
and so on, and so forth.

154
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:02,951
And, it includes many other things as well.

155
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:05,420
And these are just a few examples.

156
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,524
So why is user experience hard?

157
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:11,356
And we know what a good user experience should look like.

158
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:13,092
We know what we want to avoid.

159
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:16,420
But why is it not always easy to do this?

160
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,581
Well, one of the reasons that it&#39;s hard is that you as the designer are not the user.

161
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:25,428
Even if you are a potential user of this product,

162
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,585
you don&#39;t represent all the users.

163
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:31,667
And it&#39;s very important to go out and understand who the users are,

164
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:36,186
what they need, how they work so that you can design effectively for them.

165
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:41,098
Another reason that UX is hard is because most of the time in UX we&#39;re dealing with

166
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:41,832
software.

167
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,191
We&#39;re dealing with computer-based interactive systems.

168
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:48,924
And computers think differently than people do.

169
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:54,098
So translating what works and what&#39;s easy to do for computer programmers and

170
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:57,918
what&#39;s easy for computers to do into what makes sense for

171
00:09:57,918 --> 00:10:00,399
users is a big part of what we do in UX.

172
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,370
And it&#39;s challenging.

173
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,834
We often get it wrong the first time and

174
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,992
we have to go through many cycles to get it right.

175
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:10,719
And the products that we&#39;re designing are usually quite complex because

176
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:14,698
of the fact that they&#39;re software based and it&#39;s so easy to add new features.

177
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,050
And so helping keep a focus on the user experience and

178
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,078
what users really need is a critical part and it can often be very challenging,

179
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:27,062
especially when designing larger and more complex systems.

180
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:31,708
Fortunately in user experience, we have techniques

181
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:36,256
that we know work to help make user experience easy.

182
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:40,356
First, we follow an iterative prototyping process.

183
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:45,084
As I said just a minute ago, we usually get it wrong the first time.

184
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:49,688
So rather than trying to get everything perfect right out of the gate,

185
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:54,852
we try to use techniques that allow us to fail fast and learn from our mistakes.

186
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:58,728
We do that by applying user centered research and design methods and

187
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:03,148
we have a whole set of these that we know will work to keep the design on track and

188
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:06,754
make sure that we&#39;re designing something that&#39;s going to end

189
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:09,565
up delivering a good user experience in the end.

190
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:12,746
It helps to understand a bit about human behavior.

191
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:16,606
You don&#39;t need to have a degree in psychology in order to design good user

192
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:20,617
experiences, but it is helpful to know a little bit about how people work.

193
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:25,305
And what we know will help them accomplish what they need to accomplish.

194
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:30,872
And ultimately, we do all of these sayings to allow us to apply common sense.

195
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:35,278
By following an iterative prototyping process that user-centered research and

196
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,276
design methods and knowing a bit about human behavior,

197
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:42,612
we&#39;re in a much better position to use our own common sense to make good decisions

198
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:44,050
when designing systems.
