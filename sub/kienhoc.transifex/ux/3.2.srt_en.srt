Hello, I&#39;m here today with Lija Hogan,

1
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:17,414
who is currently the Director of Enterprise Research Strategy,

2
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:22,760
with User Testing, which is a new role for you if I&#39;m not mistaken.

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,715
And I&#39;m gonna chat with Lija about her experience in the world of UX research,

4
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:29,980
kinda what she&#39;s up to and

5
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,150
what she&#39;s been up to, and what it looks like to work in this field.

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,075
So welcome. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

7
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:36,865
&gt;&gt; And thank you for being here today.

8
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:38,610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,050
&gt;&gt; So yeah tell me a little bit about what you&#39;re up to now and

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,160
what kinds of things have gotten you to where you&#39;re at?

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,950
&gt;&gt; So right now what I do is work with

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,440
user testing customers to basically get the most out of the platform.

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,030
And to back up a little bit and just explain what user testing is, it is

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,340
essentially a large panel, plus a software platform that enables video and

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,300
audio recordings of what&#39;s happening on screens,

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,810
whether it&#39;s a desktop or a mobile device and then a microphone.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,290
To let different organizations whether they&#39;re business,

18
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,100
government, entertainment, gaming

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,280
get an understanding of how it is people are experiencing their digital products.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,290
&gt;&gt; So it lets you basically, it lets a UX researcher run,

21
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,850
user test with people who are remote, who are far away.

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,926
&gt;&gt; Yeah, remote, far away.

23
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:39,030
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; And asynchronously.

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,774
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

25
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:43,020
&gt;&gt; So we can also do moderated usability tests as well.

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,913
We do, do those as well.

27
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:44,678
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

28
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:49,457
&gt;&gt; But it&#39;s a really great thing for our customers because it gets

29
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:54,708
around some of the constraints that doing in-lab testing imposes.

30
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,666
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

31
00:01:55,666 --> 00:02:00,525
&gt;&gt; So you get a natural setting cuz it&#39;s people using their own devices.

32
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:04,700
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; You get people who can represent

33
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,180
a broad range.

34
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,157
So the panel is very large, they can get anybody from stay at home parents,

35
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:15,167
with you know three kids to college student.

36
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,091
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

37
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:17,930
&gt;&gt; To somebody who is older.

38
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,394
And so it&#39;s very hard to get access to panelists.

39
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:22,884
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

40
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:28,040
&gt;&gt; People spend a lot of time trying to do that in their work, so It&#39;s a bonus.

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,093
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

42
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,210
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Very cool, and so

43
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,596
what kinds of things are you focusing on?

44
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:38,730
&gt;&gt; So I focus on really actually helping people to understand

45
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,090
both at high a conceptual level what sorts of research they should be doing.

46
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,510
So what types of questions they can be asking and and

47
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,630
then what methods they can use to answer those questions?

48
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,900
And just kind of evangelizing around how it is that you share that information with

49
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,820
your internal clients, your internal customers as a researcher.

50
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,167
So that they can really understand what needs to happen based on that feedback.

51
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,310
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

52
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,810
And so, as I mentioned, based on our earlier conversations,

53
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,040
this is a relatively new role for you, and so it&#39;s a more strategic role.

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,250
You&#39;re really kind of looking at how to apply these tools.

55
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,800
But I know that earlier in your career, you have been and

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,910
were more directly involved in some of the UX research

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,020
methods and actually conducting the methods and the studies yourself.

58
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,240
And so I wonder if it would be possible for you to think of maybe

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,240
a project that might be, I know there&#39;s really no such thing as a typical

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,850
UX research project, but one that might be a good example

61
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,290
to help us understand what it looks like to go through one of these projects.

62
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,570
&gt;&gt; So, earlier on in my career, and this was probably about, I don&#39;t know,

63
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,825
15 years ago or so, I worked on a project for Siemens,

64
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:09,900
their power transmission and distribution arm which essentially is

65
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,990
the group that&#39;s responsible for building and maintaining nuclear power plants.

66
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,820
&gt;&gt; Sounds important.

67
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,822
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

68
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:17,410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

69
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,270
&gt;&gt; So I was actually doing this research in Europe, primarily in Germany,

70
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:27,010
working with a system that they had internally built to maintain content,

71
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,010
both on the website, as well as in their paper resources.

72
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,410
And so what they were really focused on was optimizing the backend

73
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,590
experience to enable people who are not nuclear engineers to maintain

74
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,590
information about replacement parts for nuclear power plants.

75
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,570
&gt;&gt; Okay, mm-hm.

76
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,627
&gt;&gt; And so as part of that I did interviews,

77
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:54,519
really was kind of trying to answer the question,

78
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:00,914
how do we get non-engineers to be able to understand enough about the information

79
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:06,035
that they&#39;re inputting so that they&#39;re doing it the right way?

80
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:06,981
&gt;&gt; Okay.

81
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:13,350
&gt;&gt; So I did interviews with nuclear engineers and non nuclear engineers.

82
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,220
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In Germany, Denmark, and

83
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,655
Spain, because it&#39;s an international.

84
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:18,410
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

85
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,640
&gt;&gt; Business.

86
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,940
And I also took to those interviews, essentially

87
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,010
prototypes of a different approach to actually entering that information.

88
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,055
They actually built it, and I was coming in to help them to refine it.

89
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,380
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

90
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,640
&gt;&gt; And so basically the deliverable out of that project was

91
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,760
a recommendation on both what the changes to the tool might

92
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,530
be in order to make it easier to use as well as process recommendations around.

93
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,220
&gt;&gt; Okay.

94
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,215
&gt;&gt; How would they be able to manage that information.

95
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:55,510
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; In a better way.

96
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,506
And so it was a little bit of both research, as well as design work and

97
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:04,023
I think that happens a lot actually, because.

98
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:05,082
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; You&#39;re asked to be

99
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:07,825
able to answer both types of questions sometimes.

100
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,325
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

101
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,162
&gt;&gt; And so in this case, there was an existing tool, but it wasn&#39;t so

102
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:18,335
much about testing whether that tool was the right tool.

103
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,329
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

104
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,560
&gt;&gt; Or whether it was usable and things like that.

105
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,988
&gt;&gt; It was to a certain extent,

106
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:27,466
we assumed that it wasn&#39;t as usable as it should be because people weren&#39;t using it.

107
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:28,532
&gt;&gt; Okay.

108
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:29,908
&gt;&gt; The way that they should be.

109
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:31,068
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

110
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:34,697
&gt;&gt; And so it was really saying, okay, starting from the premise we need to

111
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:37,498
improve this experience, what do we do to enhance it?

112
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,423
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, excellent.

113
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:40,804
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

114
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:44,528
&gt;&gt; So that&#39;s a good example, a great example of a UX research project,

115
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,774
where you have a problem and in this case,

116
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:50,943
maybe a tool that is not performing as well as it should be and the question is,

117
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,919
why isn&#39;t it performing and how can we make it better?

118
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,365
What else?

119
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:58,385
[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What other sorts of things?

120
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,990
&gt;&gt; What else is there, right?

121
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,480
&gt;&gt; There&#39;s a lot I mean obviously, so some organizations

122
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,680
have a built out system that they&#39;re really trying to optimizer over time.

123
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,892
And so in my previous role at Foresee a lot of what we did was basically

124
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:20,923
help people understand what their customers&#39; perceptions were

125
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:25,968
of the site using what&#39;s really called attitudinal analytics.

126
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:27,175
So surveys.

127
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,320
&gt;&gt; Okay.

128
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,520
&gt;&gt; And, you know, match that up with behavioral analytics.

129
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,720
So click stream data and as well heuristic evaluation saying let&#39;s bring

130
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,180
an understanding of user experience best practices to the equation and

131
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,660
say we know that people are saying they have a problem here,

132
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,440
experiencing a bottleneck there, based on the clickstream analytics.

133
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,210
Let&#39;s bring to bear those principles that we know work and

134
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,315
see what we can do in terms of helping you to optimize that experience.

135
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,930
Giving you recommendations and

136
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,800
very specific ones on how to fix that experience.

137
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,728
&gt;&gt; So these would be examples of sites, probably mostly websites but

138
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:18,008
could be potentially other products that are already out, deployed,

139
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:23,215
have lots of users and the question is How are people responding to it?

140
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:24,764
And if it&#39;s not working or

141
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:29,450
if there&#39;s some signal that&#39;s telling us that&#39;s something is not optimal.

142
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,585
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; What is that and how can we go.

143
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:32,919
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And fix it using multiple methods.

144
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,293
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

145
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:36,120
&gt;&gt; Surveys, the clickstream analytics and

146
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,474
also heuristic evaluation to try to pinpoint what those problems might be.

147
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:42,105
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that you can fix them.

148
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:46,044
&gt;&gt; Primarily yes but we also did work with prototypes too.

149
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:47,109
&gt;&gt; Okay. So let&#39;s say,

150
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,728
we want to add a new feature or function, we don&#39;t have all that data.

151
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:52,420
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

152
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,230
&gt;&gt; So it really is,

153
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,875
how can we optimize this experience based on those principles, those heuristics?

154
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,790
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

155
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,706
&gt;&gt; And the same ones that we would apply to an experience that already exists?

156
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:09,730
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; So I find that

157
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,810
there are a number of heuristic systems that are out there because humans

158
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,190
experienced the world in a very consistent way.

159
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,977
I mean, our bodies work a certain way, touch works a certain way,

160
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:29,460
your eyes are structured a certain way, as you process information that way.

161
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:36,826
And so relying on that knowledge of how you know people kinda work.

162
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,732
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

163
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:41,255
&gt;&gt; You can usually get to a lot of the right answers.

164
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:45,370
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; Even ahead of testing a prototype.

165
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,542
&gt;&gt; Just by knowing the principles of how people work.

166
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:49,368
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

167
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:52,892
&gt;&gt; And how that translates into what designs are likely to work and

168
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,030
not likely to work.

169
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,765
&gt;&gt; Yeah so that&#39;s, I think, a lot of fun.

170
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:03,760
I think some of the other really fun stuff that I worked on,

171
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,427
I really find that it&#39;s kinda bring in different methods to

172
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:16,860
bear is probably going to help you get to the answer more effectively than just one.

173
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,580
&gt;&gt; Okay, can you say more about that?

174
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,116
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

175
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:24,810
I think when you have a user experience

176
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,580
problem or issue or question that you&#39;re coming up against.

177
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,772
There&#39;s usually more than one way to answer it and

178
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:37,573
sometimes you have to answer it using more than one method.

179
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:38,120
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

180
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,590
&gt;&gt; Some of it is getting people to directly like experience the product,

181
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,337
so just putting it in front of them and saying, use it.

182
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:49,748
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

183
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,901
&gt;&gt; The products evolve over time and so

184
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:56,208
the questions that you ask when you are just trying to concept something

185
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:00,300
lik,e let&#39;s say you wanna build a new mobile app.

186
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,920
Well, you know, we don&#39;t have actually a whole set

187
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,060
of design patterns from mobile apps right now.

188
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,000
We have some evolving best practices around on how to do it.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,155
But it really is almost an open playing field right now.

190
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:15,880
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

191
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,920
&gt;&gt; So you can go out there and innovate and say, you know what,

192
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,664
wouldn&#39;t it be cool if you tried doing this.

193
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:22,580
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

194
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,898
&gt;&gt; And putting that in front of someone.

195
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:24,819
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; On paper.

196
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:31,860
&gt;&gt; I think there&#39;s a lot of excitement in emerging areas like the Internet of Things

197
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,332
and wearables where really there are very few patterns or established practices.

198
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah &gt;&gt; That can guide you.

199
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,920
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it&#39;s also a challenge actually doing

200
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,756
testing those environments because we haven&#39;t even created

201
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:52,455
like a set of tools to really test creatively wearables for example.

202
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:53,138
&gt;&gt; Mm.hm.

203
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:54,260
&gt;&gt; You know?

204
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,990
&gt;&gt; Right, user testing is not on your watch yet.

205
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,886
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s yeah. &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

206
00:11:57,886 --> 00:12:00,812
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s not on your watch yet at all.

207
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:01,410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

208
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,092
And I mean, and not only that, but

209
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:06,184
even trying to capture that in the lab setting is challenging.

210
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,350
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

211
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,523
&gt;&gt; Because you might ask someone to actually take it off of their arm so

212
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,142
that you can have a camera directed at it.

213
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:15,260
&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; For example.

214
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,140
&gt;&gt; Right.

215
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,289
&gt;&gt; So I think we&#39;ve got some evolving to do.

216
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:20,319
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

217
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:23,260
&gt;&gt; Around how it is that we test out those types of experiences.

218
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,959
&gt;&gt; But as you were saying in some other areas like the web and

219
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,613
in desktop software, we have decades of experience.

220
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:29,690
&gt;&gt; We do have.

221
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,334
&gt;&gt; And we have some good patterns for how things.

222
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:31,960
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

223
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
&gt;&gt; Ought to work. Not to say that there aren&#39;t innovative

224
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,405
things that we can do.

225
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:37,550
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

226
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,155
&gt;&gt; But we have more knowledge about what works and what doesn&#39;t.

227
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:41,257
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

228
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:44,203
&gt;&gt; And how people&#39;s capabilities interact with those platforms.

229
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:46,200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s very true.

230
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

231
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,250
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

232
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,720
&gt;&gt; So, I guess, just one last topic I&#39;d like to explore with you.

233
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,970
For folks that are just getting started in UX and

234
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,840
maybe thinking about directing their career in this direction or

235
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,640
incorporating it in some way, what advice might you have for these folks?

236
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,545
&gt;&gt; So the first thing that I would say is, and

237
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:12,793
I say this to people everywhere, there are not enough of us.

238
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,912
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, if you decide to get into

239
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:21,449
the field, there are a lot of opportunities out there.

240
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:25,170
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; Because a lot of people are innovating

241
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,060
and building new things.

242
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,991
And even when they&#39;re not innovating and building new things,

243
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:32,007
they are trying to make what we have better.

244
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:33,400
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

245
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,616
&gt;&gt; And there&#39;s a recognition in industry especially in education,

246
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:43,501
in government that designing systems and

247
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:48,174
products for people makes them more successful.

248
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:48,990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

249
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,853
&gt;&gt; And bringing people into the equation that come from then perspective of

250
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:58,635
understanding what the principals are to make successful products and

251
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:02,709
services is going to help you to make things said are better.

252
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,400
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

253
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,630
&gt;&gt; So I think there are few things, one is there are a lot of people who

254
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,580
come into the profession,

255
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,440
having had some experience In some other fields.

256
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,628
So whether it&#39;s graphic design, whether it&#39;s being a developer

257
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:27,981
that kind of background is actually very useful because

258
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:32,627
it gives you an understanding of what the constraints are.

259
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:33,683
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

260
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:38,765
&gt;&gt; In those areas as well and I should say constraints as well as opportunities.

261
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:43,410
Mm-hm, what I&#39;ll just add to that having you know taught at the School of

262
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,910
Information for a number of years, people are coming from a huge variety.

263
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,000
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Of different backgrounds.

264
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,090
Music, history, you know I mean literally every

265
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:59,880
corner of the academic universe people are coming to this and professional universe.

266
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so I&#39;d say,

267
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,470
don&#39;t think of your background as being something that&#39;s gonna hold you back.

268
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,260
It will really only complement the work that you do moving forward.

269
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,065
And most people tend to combine something of their backgrounds along with

270
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:17,485
this interest in human centered design a research.

271
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:18,200
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

272
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,103
&gt;&gt; I think that it&#39;s really important to stay curious.

273
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:22,790
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

274
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,210
&gt;&gt; So in addition and

275
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,210
I really do think it&#39;s important actually to get some formal training in some way.

276
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,030
And that is because there are these principles that you should be

277
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,180
aware of that are grounded in Psychology and Ethnography and

278
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,800
you should be aware of that.

279
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,874
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; And a lot of organizations are actually

280
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,898
looking for that type of experience and

281
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:48,950
background when they are looking for people to join their teams.

282
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,870
&gt;&gt; Now let me just follow up on that and talk about the growing need for

283
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,664
UX which I absolutely agree is something that is just becoming

284
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:06,090
ever more clear that we need more people doing this kind of work.

285
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,920
I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts a little bit on how the industry or the industries

286
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,960
are evolving and where that knowledge of UX is coming from and how that&#39;s shaping

287
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,490
up, and how it&#39;s sort of differing across different organizations.

288
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,658
I know you&#39;ve had a lot of experience working with different companies.

289
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:25,240
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

290
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,510
&gt;&gt; And you&#39;ve seen different ways that you UX is being incorporated.

291
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,590
&gt;&gt; I think a couple of things,

292
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:36,570
one is that some of the respected resource organizations that are out

293
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,820
there are basically saying, people are winning, the bottom line.

294
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,290
And I say this in the business context,

295
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,020
the winners are those who actually have a superior customer experience,

296
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,100
which is really grounded in a superior user experience.

297
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,540
So we&#39;re talking about the Amazon&#39;s and

298
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,790
the Apple&#39;s and the Facebook&#39;s of the world.

299
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,681
They have very significant resources that are all about

300
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:05,813
making the user experience great.

301
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:09,760
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; So they have big design teams,

302
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,670
they have big research teams, and you know they

303
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,570
are focused on trying to make their products usable by a lot of people.

304
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,440
Because if they&#39;re not usable, they fail and

305
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,200
if they fail then they don&#39;t make money.

306
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,225
So it really is it&#39;s a focus on the bottom line for a lot of businesses right now.

307
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:34,155
And they understand that they are competing on the basis of

308
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:35,325
customer experience.

309
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:37,094
You know, Forrester,

310
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:42,585
just last month released their most recent customer experience survey.

311
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:44,755
And just even looking at that list and

312
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:47,815
knowing at the back of your mind what those companies are,

313
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,975
you can tell the good ones from the ones that are struggling a little bit more.

314
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:55,908
&gt;&gt; This has been great.

315
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,481
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for

316
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:01,329
taking some time to sit down and chat about UX research and

317
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,185
various other topics and.

318
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:04,570
&gt;&gt; Great.

319
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,500
&gt;&gt; Appreciate it very much.

320
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,100
&gt;&gt; You&#39;re welcome.
