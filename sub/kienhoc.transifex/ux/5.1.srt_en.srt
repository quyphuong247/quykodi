Hi, I&#39;m here today with Matt Martin, experienced architect at Ithaka.

1
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:19,465
And we&#39;re gonna talk about user experience and the user experience field,

2
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:22,135
with a focus on user experience design, and

3
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:26,205
what designers contribute to the field of user experience.

4
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:28,555
So, welcome, and thank you very much for being here.

5
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:29,345
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

6
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:32,945
&gt;&gt; So, tell me a little bit about what you&#39;re doing at Ithaca right now.

7
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:33,890
&gt;&gt; Okay.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,140
So, I work on a team with software engineers, quality insurance engineers,

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,000
a product manager, and a visual designer, and then myself.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,810
And what I try to do is I setup enough strategy, enough design work

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,410
collaboratively with my team, to kinda get that work ready for development.

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,040
So, I would say I spent half of my days in meetings, and

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,750
half of my days doing design, and it&#39;s very collaborative.

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,458
So, there is gonna be some times where I&#39;m heads down work doing some designs, or

15
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,492
doing some research.

16
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:08,093
But then there&#39;ll be a lot of times where I&#39;m brainstorming strategy with

17
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:10,721
my product manager, or working with a user

18
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:15,630
researcher to make sure that we&#39;re gonna set up the right type of user testing.

19
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,650
And then my visual designer, who I collaborate a lot with, is in New York.

20
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,540
So, we&#39;ll sometimes do some screen sharing,

21
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,270
where we&#39;ll collaborate on a design.

22
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,010
Or I&#39;ll just start sketching on a whiteboard, and I&#39;ll take pictures of it,

23
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,600
and send it to her.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,290
And say okay, I just created this really quickly.

25
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,960
Can you bring back something to me?

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,470
And then we&#39;ll kind of collaborate that way.

27
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,730
So, it&#39;s like, we have these pods of teams that, like I said, are blinded.

28
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,280
And then some other times, I&#39;ll meet with whole UX department.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,530
The other designers, to find out, hey, what are you working on?

30
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,570
And how is it going to influence what I&#39;m doing?

31
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,040
Sometimes I&#39;m doing parts of the site.

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,240
Or some of our products that do touch each other.

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,300
And sometimes, I&#39;m kinda on my own.

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,160
Or it&#39;s a product that&#39;s not touching other things.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,895
So.

36
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:09,760
&gt;&gt; Could you give us an example of maybe a project that you&#39;ve worked on,

37
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,260
and try and take us through how it started, and how it progressed through

38
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,940
the different stages until it became however it ended up?

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,988
&gt;&gt; Okay.

40
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:25,900
So, we needed to do a redesign of the strategy in research, arm of ethical.

41
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,900
So, they had a website that was aging but

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,898
not only that, their business model and some of the programs are changed.

43
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:36,960
So, we needed to do a refresh on the website to kind represent

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,060
that new program that they were trying to focus on, and also,

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,210
to do a better job of having that website reflect their business objectives.

46
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,150
So. &gt;&gt; Could you maybe just say real

47
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,150
quick what the strategy and research?

48
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,150
&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The strategy and research.

49
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,548
Well, who are the users, and what are they trying to do with this website?

50
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:01,670
&gt;&gt; So primarily, what the strategy and

51
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,190
research arm does is they work with libraries and higher education,

52
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,770
and they deal with the administrators and librarians to basically get

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,460
technology and libraries kinda ready for the future.

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,470
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; How does technology influence that?

55
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,450
And one of their programs that they started to promote, and

56
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,660
that started new just last year is called Educational Transformation, which is how

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,560
about how is education being transformed, and how can institutions go along with it?

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
So they do a lot of consulting.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,530
&gt;&gt; Okay.

60
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,150
&gt;&gt; They write a lot of papers, case studies, reports, issue briefs.

61
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,420
And librarians try to get all of that research, cuz they give it away for free.

62
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,440
&gt;&gt; Okay.

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,010
In the hopes to sell some of their products, they do survey,

64
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,580
they do site consulting and stuff like that.

65
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,160
&gt;&gt; I see.

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,550
&gt;&gt; So, what was happening was is the website was, had a lot of information

67
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,340
there, and have all reports, but wasn&#39;t as easy to go from one report to another, and

68
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,390
there wasn&#39;t really a way for the products and the reports to kinda intermingle.

69
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,300
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And so,

70
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,590
it was our goal to figure out, okay, where is the business going?

71
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,990
How is the site working and not working?

72
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,100
And how can we make it work better?

73
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,280
So, what I did was is I interviewed all the directors, and

74
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,040
all the program directors, and the marketing directing there at the S+R,

75
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,640
was what it was called- &gt;&gt; Okay.

76
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
&gt;&gt; Ithaka S+R.

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

78
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,130
&gt;&gt; Strategy and research, and

79
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,271
I did that with the user researcher, our product manager, and an engineer.

80
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,250
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

81
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,410
&gt;&gt; So, while we were doing that, we were taking notes.

82
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,810
And trying to figure out, okay, so this is how they look at their business.

83
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,140
This is how they look at their user.

84
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,170
So, we had a pretty good idea of what to do next.

85
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,580
And next was, let&#39;s find out what we&#39;re dealing with, and

86
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,159
did the content inventory of the whole site.

87
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,665
We started to look at the analytics of the site to find out how traffic was getting

88
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:54,773
there, and what was happening, why they were there, and

89
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:56,081
they where the users were leaving.

90
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,212
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

91
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:59,220
&gt;&gt; Next.

92
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,930
I did a comparative analysis, so I&#39;m looking at all the different

93
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,885
competition that they have throughout the landscape.

94
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,190
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; Inside their industry and

95
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,860
outside their industry, just to see how it happens,

96
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,550
how the branding happens, how the interaction design works.

97
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,420
So, what people are gonna expect when they go to the site.

98
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,250
So that we&#39;re not doing anything that&#39;s too different, or something that we

99
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,070
can make sure falls in people&#39;s expectations when visiting the site.

100
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,060
So once we did all that, in kind of concurrently,

101
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,860
we had the developers starting working on a framework.

102
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,880
So, me and the designer can start thinking ahead, and

103
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,610
we knew that we&#39;re gonna have to feed the developers the real full site.

104
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,410
But in the meantime, we wanted to have them just develop a slice of the site.

105
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,040
So, a working version of every single section, but

106
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,950
it didn&#39;t go deep with just one kind of like layer.

107
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,820
&gt;&gt; So this would be software, and you are thinking of just having the different

108
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,910
components kinda of in place, so that as you&#39;re doing the design, you

109
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,170
could actually have framework to sort of testing out and seeing how it will work.

110
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,840
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

111
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,422
That way there was a foundation there, we can see if things were working,

112
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:10,600
and we could find out early on that hey, this really doesn&#39;t work.

113
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,980
But what we did is, once we started developing,

114
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,290
we could see that it could scale too.

115
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,660
So, while the developers were doing that, I went back to the stakeholders and

116
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,390
said okay, you have a lot of categories here.

117
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,240
You don&#39;t have much consistency on topics in the way you organize your research.

118
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,270
So, I set up a workshop to really work on their vocabulary in taxonomy,

119
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,980
just the raw materials of the research.

120
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,310
So that we could develop a good information architecture of the site and

121
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,780
do positive search.

122
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,035
That made sense not only to them, but to the people that they&#39;re reaching out to.

123
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,810
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

124
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,360
&gt;&gt; Once we did that taxonomy exercise,

125
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,255
we didn&#39;t put it in the site until we did a card sorting task with actual users.

126
00:06:58,255 --> 00:06:58,940
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

127
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,550
&gt;&gt; So, what that is we put it online, all these different topics and

128
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,460
categories, and had actual librarians come to this program or

129
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,880
site to organize how they saw those topics and categories.

130
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,940
Once we had that data back, then we can tell developers okay, now we figured out

131
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,565
how this is supposed to be chugged and categorize so they can start building it.

132
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:28,210
In that way, it was scalable and we were able to make sure that

133
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,860
throughout the the whole process, we&#39;re getting some input from our users.

134
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,655
So, once we had that slice,

135
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:41,661
we were able to start filling in the rest of the site.

136
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:46,366
And we, one of the things, not only did we wanna get librarians and

137
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:52,080
other visitors to download their reports, but we also wanted people to sign up so

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,230
that they would get news of hey, the new report is coming out.

139
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,750
So, we experimented with different placement of where that sign up would be,

140
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,570
and once we found the best place for it.

141
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,230
Based on a smaller set, then it&#39;s been released.

142
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,970
Now we&#39;ve gotten I think, they&#39;re,

143
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,170
it&#39;s gone up at least 20% as far as the last time I checked.

144
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:14,730
Because that was.

145
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,160
&gt;&gt; The number of sign ups has gone up by 20% since the previous version.

146
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,970
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

147
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,230
Yep. So it has been a success, and

148
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:25,090
it really shows just by moving something on a page can really have a huge affect on

149
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,460
the design.

150
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,010
And the sign up rate was amazing.

151
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,840
&gt;&gt; Well let me ask you a couple more question about that.

152
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,498
So, there were a lot of different activities happening at the same time.

153
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:39,730
&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You had Software development happening.

154
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,070
A number of different research activities.

155
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,380
What kind of things were going on with trying to figure out.

156
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,980
You know what the site was gonna look like, how things were gonna be laid out,

157
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,960
what was connected to.

158
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,950
What kind of things were you doing,

159
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,990
in parallel to kind of work out the design of this Cybertough.

160
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,900
&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m trying to break down the navigation in it to two different.

161
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,610
I guess categories, one was the persistent navigation which is what

162
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,260
you usually see at the top of every page.

163
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,790
It&#39;s the global navigation, the big buckets.

164
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,020
But what I spent a lot of time on with the stakeholders,

165
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,080
was the contextual navigation.

166
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,260
How is each object related to one another?

167
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,260
So an object could be an article,

168
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,050
another object could be an event that they&#39;re hosting.

169
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,544
And another object could be,

170
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:33,544
the person that&#39;s either writing the paper, or putting on the event.

171
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:36,821
So that way, I had all these modules that could be interrelated so

172
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,619
that when you&#39;re on a page, and you&#39;re on an article,

173
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:42,560
you know who wrote it, and if there&#39;s an event coming up.

174
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,566
And they also can point to this article relates to this product that they had,

175
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:51,260
or this kind of consulting practice that they do.

176
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,886
So that way, no matter when you&#39;re on the site,

177
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:58,255
you&#39;re always going to another related event or even another related article.

178
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:02,110
So you&#39;re kinda, instead of just going there, grabbing a paper and leaving,

179
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,670
I set it up so you could explore.

180
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,370
So you don&#39;t have to go up to the main navigation as an escape hatch, or

181
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,030
to do the exploration.

182
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,800
It&#39;s more in context exploration if you will.

183
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,654
So I spent a lot of time doing that, to make sure that people were staying on

184
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:18,151
the site, and learning as much as they can and.

185
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,050
Satisfying the user&#39;s needs of getting those papers.

186
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,592
But also, trying to help the business objective of,

187
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:26,820
hey let&#39;s get these people working with us and partnering with us.

188
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,940
Does that make sense?

189
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,780
&gt;&gt; It makes sense and so were you doing this through?

190
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,710
I&#39;m just trying to envision like how this happens, right?

191
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,300
So are you sketching?

192
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,930
Are you making mark ups and a graphics program,

193
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,880
are you building interactive versions of it, and how are you working through this?

194
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,508
Right, It&#39;s a complicated thing you&#39;re trying to do here,

195
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:54,030
with this contextual navigation.

196
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,165
So how do you kinda go from,

197
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:59,850
I think this will be a cool idea to this is the right way to do it.

198
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,640
&gt;&gt; Well, I got a big piece of foam core.

199
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,950
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And I got a bunch of sticky notes.

200
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,051
And what I did was, and the reason I put it on foam core is, I wanted to work

201
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:15,045
collaboratively with one of the developers to say, okay, this is what I&#39;m thinking.

202
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:18,621
And then I also wanted to work with a stakeholder that was living in,

203
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:22,660
she was either in New York at the time or the Carolinas at the time.

204
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,450
So what we did is we put one computer on the board, and

205
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,760
we moved sticky notes around.

206
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,710
Like I kind of seeded it and say, hey this is how I&#39;m envisioning it.

207
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,550
But since she&#39;s the marketing director, she&#39;s responsible for

208
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,630
a lot of the content, a lot of the editorial work flow.

209
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,140
All the research goes through her, and then gets populated on the site.

210
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,296
So she really had,

211
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:47,152
she was a subject matter expert on what&#39;s happening in the organization, so.

212
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:50,417
And then I&#39;ve got the developer there just watching and seeing this,

213
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:54,420
because he&#39;s starting to estimate how much is this development time it&#39;s gonna be.

214
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,589
The platform we&#39;re putting it on, I think we started with a WordPress site,

215
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,040
wanted to make sure that was feasible.

216
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,560
So that way, because it was sticky notes, it was never set in stone, and

217
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,470
no one thought, it&#39;s in a spreadsheet, it&#39;s locked in no, it&#39;s not locked in.

218
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,270
Let&#39;s do a collaborative exercise where we&#39;re moving sticky notes around.

219
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,050
That was mobile, so I could move it to a different office,

220
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,590
I could take a picture of it and send it to other people to kinda get.

221
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,070
&gt;&gt; Mobile, because you could just take the foam core and.

222
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,260
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly.

223
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,260
I can move it around and then, once I had those modules and

224
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,825
objects kind of figured out.

225
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:27,230
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

226
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,154
&gt;&gt; I then went into a wire framing vector based OmniGraffle.

227
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:32,724
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And

228
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:36,040
started laying out how these things would look on a page.

229
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,835
But also how they would interact, and how they were sewn together.

230
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,270
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

231
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,860
&gt;&gt; And once I had that, I made it a clickable prototype.

232
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,620
Not for users.

233
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,402
I mean, that would&#39;ve been great if we had that kind of resource and timing.

234
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,250
But we felt we did a good enough job in the strategy phase.

235
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,159
We felt this was good, was really just to show the stakeholders hey,

236
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,640
this is how we&#39;re now envisioning your site.

237
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,735
So they kinda had a preview, before we got into look and feel.

238
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:05,873
Cuz at the same time, our visual designer was,

239
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:10,990
hired a photographer to get some shots so that it wasn&#39;t stock photography.

240
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,400
It was something that was more in line with their brand.

241
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,340
Cuz she also wanted to kinda re-invision the brand.

242
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,920
So she was trying to, she was thinking about different concepts of color and

243
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,940
how that color would work on the site without taking.

244
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,980
Taking too attention away from the articles.

245
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,341
So kind of like, i&#39;m doing the interaction design,

246
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:33,651
while she&#39;s kinda doing the visual and emotional design at the same time.

247
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:36,566
And so, and we&#39;re collaborating to say okay this is what i&#39;m thinking here, and

248
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,610
she&#39;s saying &quot;okay this is what i&#39;m thinking here.&quot;.

249
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,615
And then we&#39;re presenting that you know, what was really great is In previous

250
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,660
engagements, when I wasn&#39;t inside and I was at agencies.

251
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,236
It was, like, we saw the client every once in a while.

252
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:51,500
And we&#39;d have these big deliverable dates.

253
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,622
Where here, we said we want to meet with you at least every other week.

254
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:57,380
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; To show you our progress.

255
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,450
We&#39;re never going to be.

256
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,740
These are never done states.

257
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,852
We&#39;re not having you sign off on it.

258
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:01,652
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We just

259
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:03,445
want to show you what we&#39;re working on.

260
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:05,345
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; And have you collaborate with us.

261
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,130
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

262
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,450
And I felt that was a really successful way to do it but not,

263
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,890
I think that&#39;s a best case scenario.

264
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,274
You don&#39;t always have these high level directors of

265
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:15,013
companies &gt;&gt; Right.

266
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:17,060
&gt;&gt; that you can talk to twice a week.

267
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,800
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

268
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,130
&gt;&gt; Or I&#39;m sorry, every other week.

269
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,580
&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.

270
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,760
So, but that&#39;s very interesting.

271
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,919
So you&#39;re thinking very much about creating these artifacts that will,

272
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:30,753
facilitate certain types of communication, right?

273
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:32,521
&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Communication was a subject matter

274
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,650
expert, trying to make sure that you get it right.

275
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,728
Communication with the stakeholder to show progress, and

276
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:41,061
also thinking about what kind of communication you wanna have.

277
00:14:41,061 --> 00:14:44,988
So it tells like you separate out conversations about the interaction

278
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:49,444
design, from conversations about the look and feel, and the typography, and

279
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:52,790
the specific images, and the colors and things like that.

280
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,130
So that you can have these, kind of focused conversations.

281
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,995
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s exactly right.

282
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:02,983
I&#39;d try to make sure that I wasn&#39;t painting us in any kind of corner,

283
00:15:02,983 --> 00:15:06,625
and allowing the stakeholders to have their say.

284
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,162
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. But at the same time,

285
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:10,552
not having people get hung up on, you know,

286
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:14,520
I don&#39;t really like the font or the colors that are happening here.

287
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,200
And they&#39;re not paying attention to the interaction design or

288
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,950
some of the content strategy.

289
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,698
So we really did have to divorce certain things, and present certain kinda,

290
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:29,272
slowly reveal things to people so we could get the right conversation, or

291
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:30,675
the right kind of feedback.

292
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:31,325
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

293
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:36,510
So, and sometimes a sticky note, and some crude drawings are just enough.

294
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,510
Just to set the direction.

295
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,260
&gt;&gt; To keep it focused on that particular topic right there.

296
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,310
and not get distracted by these other things.

297
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,560
So it sounds like this story has a happy ending.

298
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,810
You talked about the product that sounds like was released.

299
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,160
You have some data that it&#39;s been successful in some ways,

300
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,680
and so congratulations on that.

301
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,310
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

302
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,280
Yes.

303
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,180
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

304
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,680
So I know that before joining Ithaca, how long have you been at Ithaca?

305
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,520
&gt;&gt; Three and a half years.

306
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,890
&gt;&gt; About three and a half years.

307
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,010
But I know from talking to you previously that

308
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,570
You&#39;ve done a bunch of other things as well.

309
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,720
So I think it would be great to just hear about

310
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,930
what your career has been like and how you got where you are right now.

311
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,770
&gt;&gt; Okay, well I guess we can go back just before I went to graduate school.

312
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:29,790
I was a photographer and I was in a research hospital.

313
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,890
And we had a lab that was half chemical processes and

314
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,560
half digital processes cuz this was the 1900s.

315
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,570
So 1990s we were still doing a lot with film and chemicals.

316
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,572
But I saw that the digital mediums and computers and especially with

317
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:50,465
the beginning of the internet or the web photography was changing really fast.

318
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:52,120
And it was becoming more digital.

319
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,880
That&#39;s when I decided to go to graduate school for

320
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,200
human computer interaction at the School for Information.

321
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,590
So while I was there during the summer I got

322
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:06,380
an internship at an agency actually doing what they called usability engineering,

323
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,980
which was user research and doing design work.

324
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,727
And I worked with visual designers and frontend developers.

325
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,550
This was the year 2000.

326
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,490
So during that time the dot com bubble burst.

327
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,650
So the internship that I was hoping was gonna lead into full time employment

328
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,480
was gone.

329
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,420
So once I graduated from the School of Information I

330
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,110
went to Wayne State University to become a digital librarian.

331
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,780
So at my time at Wayne State it was a wonderful time.

332
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,550
Because we had a grant called the 21st Century Librarian.

333
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:46,920
So we had money to do special projects and fund graduate students to do the work.

334
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,630
And some of that work was working with the Detroit News Photo Morgue.

335
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:57,180
So we had images going back from the 1800s up until about 1980 for

336
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,900
digitizing all of those images and associating metadata with those and

337
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,049
then bringing them online for access.

338
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,150
The other fun project was working for the Detroit Historical Museum and

339
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,355
looking at their toy collection, primarily toys from the early 1900s that were

340
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:16,740
wind-up toys and putting those online just to show people how they work.

341
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,620
We actually got a lot of traffic from industrial designers that saw that and

342
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,280
kinda used that as inspiration for their work.

343
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,780
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

344
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,190
&gt;&gt; While I was a digital librarian I wasn&#39;t really doing too much UX work.

345
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,860
I was mainly working with professors or different libraries or

346
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,170
different archives and my graduate students, which was a blast.

347
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,430
But I also really liked to do design, user experienced design.

348
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,770
So I did some freelance for some agencies.

349
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,693
And then one day one of the agencies that I did work for

350
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,636
offered me fulltime employment.

351
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:49,360
So I started to go down that road.

352
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,610
It was a very large agency.

353
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,600
So it was cool because it was a print agency that was trying to figure out how

354
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,590
to do digital.

355
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,000
So I felt it was a cool kinda time of flux.

356
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,170
But as things progressed I realized that I don&#39;t wanna be at a huge agency,

357
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,480
especially an old-school agency.

358
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,660
I wanna be at more of a startup feel.

359
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,960
&gt;&gt; And an agency just to be clear is a company that does projects for

360
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,015
external clients.

361
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:20,850
So you might have a retailer one day and

362
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,960
a manufacturer the next day and a taxi company the other day.

363
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,780
And you&#39;re doing different, I&#39;m making this up.

364
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,030
But you&#39;re getting to do a lot of different types

365
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,100
of projects and design work.

366
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,270
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and that&#39;s what was so

367
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,030
fun is I usually had two concurrent projects happening.

368
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,550
One would be for a wireless cell phone company and

369
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,295
trying to figure out how they&#39;re gonna sell those products.

370
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:47,150
And then the other thing might be doing a pitch for some kind of weird branding

371
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,770
thing that we&#39;re gonna do like in the physical space and

372
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:55,250
how does that physical space relate to something that&#39;s gonna be on the web.

373
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,040
So it was always one thing was inspiring the other.

374
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,085
And it was always really fast design work.

375
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:01,850
Worked with a lot of cool people.

376
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,362
But I&#39;m not gonna say it wasn&#39;t stressful.

377
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,750
It was a lot of work all the time.

378
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,170
Especially at a big agency you always have these huge clients, the government.

379
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:19,490
We&#39;ve got the Navy, the United States Postal Service and then healthcare.

380
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,385
We worked in a lot of different verticals.

381
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:23,727
So financial services, healthcare, e-commerce.

382
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:26,780
So you never know where you&#39;re gonna be.

383
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,240
But you learn a ton all at once.

384
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,410
But like I said I wanted to into some smaller agency that was more of a startup

385
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,280
and found one where it was they really understood digital.

386
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,262
They actually just were only digital.

387
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:41,050
They had never done print or anything like that.

388
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,130
But while I was there that&#39;s where I really got my e-commerce chops.

389
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:53,025
Because we had a user research team and a user experience design team.

390
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:58,200
So what would happen is we had our own usability lab in house.

391
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,486
So when people were going through the e-commerce experience, shopping and then

392
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:06,597
going through the shopping cart we were able to optimize every step of the way.

393
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:12,130
And while we were studying and testing that we could between participants,

394
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,230
between users, we could actually change the interface and tweak it so

395
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,416
that we could really start dialing it in and get some of those gotchas out

396
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:27,500
right away and then start to validate that design as we went through.

397
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,360
&gt;&gt; Okay, so very tight integration between research and design.

398
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,995
&gt;&gt; Yes, though they were, we had separatism.

399
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:36,976
Cuz before I was like I was my own researcher.

400
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:41,220
Or I wouldn&#39;t be able to do the recruiting.

401
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,010
I would farm that out.

402
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,080
But I would be running my tests.

403
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,720
I would be creating the test, etc., which could have some

404
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,220
ethical implications as far as am I objective when I&#39;m testing my own designs.

405
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,261
So it was good to have some of that was, okay.

406
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:59,990
I&#39;m not, I have no skin in this game.

407
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,990
I&#39;m just gonna test it for you.

408
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,690
So that was pretty cool.

409
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:09,893
And where I&#39;m at now we have a user research team that goes out there,

410
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:14,295
does observations, does ethnographic research.

411
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:16,670
But also we have a usability lab here at Ithaca.

412
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:21,170
So we kinda keep it separate, yet we&#39;re tightly integrated.

413
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,639
I meet with them probably every other week so

414
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:30,278
that they stay ahead of my recruiting needs or testing, design needs.

415
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:34,083
&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m gonna ask you for one parting thought, which is for

416
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:39,054
folks that are just starting out, maybe just looking at UX or something that

417
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:44,830
thinking about getting into, maybe thinking about moving towards a career.

418
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,918
Do you have any advice?

419
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:52,900
Absolutely, look at everything in your environment.

420
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,980
And try to think about why it&#39;s there and its purpose.

421
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,712
So I have a child.

422
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,300
And it&#39;s great to look at his toys to think about, okay.

423
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,270
What is its purpose?

424
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,960
Does it communicate that purpose and do I like it?

425
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,050
And so it really helps you influence of how you can think of an experience.

426
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,610
Like this glass for instance.

427
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:22,290
It has a purpose of it has to be a vessel to carry some water.

428
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,730
But there a lot of things you can do to it.

429
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,270
You can add color to it.

430
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,310
You can have different shapes.

431
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,230
But for instance it&#39;s not a bigger vessel.

432
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,800
Because you gotta hold it with your hand.

433
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,540
So it&#39;s think about that when you&#39;re thinking about your phone.

434
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,518
You have to use it with your hand.

435
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:38,200
And there&#39;s a certain amount of interaction with it and experience.

436
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,230
So anyone that&#39;s thinking about getting into experience design or

437
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,030
something like that it&#39;s fun to just critique things around you.

438
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,390
Because then you can start thinking critically about design and

439
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,665
why people create things.

440
00:23:50,665 --> 00:23:52,380
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; And then it really helps you influence.

441
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,520
When you&#39;re in the digital realm you can do anything you want when you&#39;re not in

442
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,130
the physical realm.

443
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,488
So I like to juxtapose those things together.

444
00:23:58,488 --> 00:24:00,243
&gt;&gt; Excellent, yeah.

445
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:04,730
So taking a designer eye view of the world

446
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,710
is something that you can just do throughout you entire life.

447
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,470
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.

448
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,776
And try to focus on the positive things and the things that make you feel good.

449
00:24:12,776 --> 00:24:17,690
Cuz a lot of times I could critic a ton of things that make me frustrated.

450
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,844
And a lot of times that&#39;s what a lot of users feel that too.

451
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:21,450
It&#39;s I&#39;m so frustrated and we gotta make this better.

452
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,570
&gt;&gt; So find some positive examples too.

453
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,860
&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly. &gt;&gt; Excellent, okay.

454
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,800
Well, thank you very much.

455
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,510
This has been great.

456
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,560
And I really appreciate you taking your time to chat with us.

457
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,340
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, thank you.
