Prototypes play a central role in UX design.

1
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:14,770
What do we mean when we talk about a prototype?

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,930
Well, Bill Moggridge, Co-Founder of the prominent design firm,

3
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,030
IDEO described a prototype as a representation of a design

4
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,860
made before the final solution exists.

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,807
And throughout the course of a UX design project, you&#39;ll typically create

6
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:37,227
many prototypes on the way to producing the final design solution.

7
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:39,218
So why do we prototype?

8
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:42,640
Well, there are a number of reasons that we prototype in UX design.

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,334
One is reification, this is a term that means to make something real or

10
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:50,085
make something concrete.

11
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:54,127
When we prototype, we make our design ideas concrete so

12
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:58,860
that we can test them out and figure out if they&#39;re going to work.

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,360
We prototype to support reflection.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,270
So by making things real, we can reflect on whether they are meeting the design

15
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,810
goals that we have or whether they are taking us in a different direction.

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,450
A critical role that prototypes play is facilitating communication.

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,927
So by making something concrete by embodying it,

18
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:24,730
we can then bring other stakeholders into the conversation to figure

19
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,483
out if the design idea is going to work.

20
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:31,647
And prototypes facilitate assessment, which,

21
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34,390
of course, is critical in the UX process.

22
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,490
So by creating embodiments of our design ideas,

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,450
we can use them in user testing or get feedback from

24
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,710
users as a way to determine whether they&#39;re going to satisfy user needs.

25
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,940
Prototypes can take a lot of different forms.

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,360
So that notion of a representation of design can really mean

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,670
a lot of different things that we might produce during a UX design process.

28
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,390
Ranging from just a verbal description of a design idea, to a sketch or

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,620
a story board or a flow diagram, to a physical model, a video,

30
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,630
a specification, it can mean lots of different things.

31
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,580
But usually in UX when we use the term prototype, we&#39;re talking about

32
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,010
a representation of the system as it will be experienced by end users.

33
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,400
And we typically produce prototypes at multiple levels of fidelity.

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,950
&gt;From low fidelity to middle fidelity,

35
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,290
to high fidelity prototypes as the design process progresses.

36
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,050
And typically in a UX Design process

37
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,860
we will be increasing the fidelity of our prototypes over time.

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,950
So starting early in the process, we&#39;ll produce low fidelity prototypes,

39
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,120
which are very cheap to produce, but

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,180
don&#39;t really represent what the system will look like in the final version.

41
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,200
As we progress farther,

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,700
we might produce prototypes of increasing fidelity, so mid fidelity

43
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,220
in that high fidelity prototypes as we go closer to the end of the design process.

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,228
And what are the reasons for

45
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:09,175
this is that the cost of producing each of these prototypes is going to increase.

46
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:13,676
And we wanna make sure that we&#39;ve worked out as many of the problems and

47
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:18,713
as many of the design ideas as possible while working in a cheaper medium before

48
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:24,056
progressing to things that are gonna cost more, require more effort to produce and

49
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:28,830
box us in more, in terms of the design decisions that we&#39;re able to make.

50
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,540
So let&#39;s go through these different types of prototypes.

51
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,382
So a low fidelity prototype is a prototype that we create to address

52
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,373
the functionality of the system,

53
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:43,080
to make sure that the system does all of the things that users need.

54
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,300
The basic organization of those functions, how you get from one function to another,

55
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,890
how they&#39;re integrated, and the task flow and coverage.

56
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,940
So how do you actually support the tasks that users need to do and

57
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,820
are we supporting all the tasks that they need to do?

58
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,400
At the same time, low-fidelity prototypes ignore things like graphics,

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,920
like the colors and fonts that are going to be used.

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,540
They don&#39;t involve any programming.

61
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,981
They&#39;re often made on paper so that they can be created cheaply and

62
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:13,444
thrown away when they&#39;re not needed anymore.

63
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:17,331
And they don&#39;t use real data as a result.

64
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,676
As we progressed through the design process,

65
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,343
we&#39;ll need to resolve some of these issues until we move on to other forms

66
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:25,460
of prototypes like mid-fi prototypes.

67
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,670
So these prototypes would address all of the concerns that lo-fi prototypes address

68
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,000
like functionality and

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,980
task flow, but start to also look at concerns like the layout,

70
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,730
how specifically are all of the different fields and controls going to be laid out?

71
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,460
They might start to address some of the issues of interactivity, so

72
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,310
how does it actually feel to interact with the system?

73
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,520
And how do you navigate from one part of the system to another?

74
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,890
Still, at this point, we would be ignoring things like the graphics,

75
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,350
the specific fonts, the colors, the images.

76
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,240
There would be little to no programming involved depending on the tools that

77
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,080
are used.

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,350
And again we would not really be interacting with real data, we&#39;d be using

79
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,930
fake data to fill in for the data that the system would actually use later.

80
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,996
And then towards the end of the design process when we&#39;re pretty sure we

81
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:21,874
have the basic idea of the design right, we would produce high fidelity prototypes,

82
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:25,533
which would tackle some of these concerns that we&#39;ve a thrust in

83
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,854
the meeting low fidelity prototype like graphic design,

84
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:32,490
some more interaction details like maybe animations.

85
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,360
And more realistic data that would map

86
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,950
what users would actually be interacting with.

87
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,630
Still a high fidelity prototype is not the final product.

88
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,970
It would probably not involve the backend programming that would be required.

89
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,860
And it might not have complete functional coverage, it would be focused on

90
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,951
the task that that particular prototype is supposed to accomplish.

91
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,860
Whether that&#39;s to support a user test,

92
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,230
to support communication with stakeholders and so forth.

93
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,240
An article by Lim, Stolterman, and

94
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,410
Tenenberg, introduces the economic principle of prototyping.

95
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,040
They say that the best prototype is the one that, in the simplest and most

96
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,585
efficient way, makes the possibilities of a design idea visible and measurable.

97
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:18,290
And this can be applied in the design process by

98
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,260
choosing the prototype that is most appropriate for

99
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,250
the phase of design to answer the questions that are critical at that time.

100
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,310
So early in the process, you&#39;re concerned with functionality and task coverage and

101
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,340
you&#39;re less concerned with the details of how it&#39;s going to look and feel.

102
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,070
Later in the process, after you&#39;ve established the basic functionality,

103
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,900
you&#39;re gonna be more concerned about those issues.

104
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,480
And that&#39;s why we progress through different

105
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,110
levels of fidelity as we prototype.

106
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,590
The main reason that we do this is we want to avoid premature commitment,

107
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,900
which is investing resources like time and

108
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,250
money in design ideas that are gonna turn out to be a dead end.

109
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,920
When we do that, not only do we waste money and effort, potentially exhausting

110
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,740
the project resources, in running out of time, where we might end up being stuck

111
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,500
with a bad design or design that isn&#39;t as optimal it could be.

112
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,380
But also, we end up investing in such a way that makes it very hard for

113
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,270
stake holders to let go of the ideas that have been developed and invested in.

114
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,170
So it&#39;s very difficult to let go of those cognitive and

115
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,930
emotional commitments that stake holders make once they&#39;ve invested

116
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,990
significant time and resources into a particular design direction.

117
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,820
By focusing on lo-fidelity prototyping early in the process, you maximize

118
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,930
the number of times you get to refine your design before you commit to code or

119
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,890
manufacturing or

120
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,619
whatever it is that you&#39;re gonna do to produce the product for distribution.

121
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:54,420
Low-fidelity prototyping uses lightweight materials that are quick, cheap and

122
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,840
easy to change unlike software or hardware.

123
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,310
And our friend Bill Moggridge said of low fidelity prototypes

124
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,180
that they are not precious and therefore invite more honest critique.

125
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,620
So people are willing to give honest and open feedback on

126
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,590
something that they perceive as not being finished or not being final, than they

127
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,500
are when they see something that looks like a lot of work has been put into it.

128
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,330
How does prototyping fit into the UX design process?

129
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,470
Well, before you can build a prototype that reafies your design ideas,

130
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,540
you need to go through the process of first assessing current needs and

131
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,860
understanding the design problem that you&#39;re trying to solve,

132
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,260
establishing guidelines and constraints for

133
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,930
what a good solution would look like, and developing things like personas,

134
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,110
scenarios, user stories, requirements, and so forth to guide the design process.

135
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,360
You also need to go through the process of designing solutions through ideation,

136
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,340
sketching, selection, and synthesis.

137
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,580
In after developing a prototype,

138
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,520
you&#39;re gonna use it to assess whether you&#39;re on the right track or not.

139
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,460
You might do that through user testing or through inspection methods or

140
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,800
just through getting feedback from different stakeholders.

141
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,920
And then after that assessment, you&#39;ll go through subsequent design processes and

142
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,960
more prototyping and

143
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,700
continue around this cycle until you&#39;re satisfied with the product.

144
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,820
So to sum up, prototypes play a central role in the UX design process.

145
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,640
They embody design concepts to facilitate our ability to think more clearly about

146
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,610
them, communicate with stakeholders and get feedback, and use them in assessment

147
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,740
methods that comes from UX research like user testing and inspection methods.
