When you&#39;re studying UX or when you work in the field,

1
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:17,954
you start to hear a lot of different terms and terminology for different things

2
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:23,089
that we do in the field or different ways of describing some of the things that

3
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:29,010
we&#39;re talking about in these courses, and it can be a little bit confusing.

4
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,850
A lot of those terms that you might hear whether it&#39;s human

5
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,180
computer interaction or interaction design or

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,900
user experience research or usability engineering or human factors.

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,490
A lot of those come from different parts of the history of UX and

8
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,550
how it&#39;s evolved over time.

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,040
So I thought it will be useful in this lecture

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,680
to just take you through the history of UX.

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,070
One version, I&#39;ll say it the outset this is a very brief,

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,740
very incomplete history, very much from my perspective.

13
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,130
If you asked ten different people in the UX field

14
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,840
about the history of UX you&#39;d probably get 15 different stories.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,630
So there&#39;s a lot of different ways that this story can be told.

16
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,410
But hopefully this will be useful for

17
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,790
at least putting into perspective how we got where we are today.

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,700
And where we wanna start this story is back in the early 80s,

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:31,140
which is when the field of human computer interaction was first getting started.

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,530
And the thing to realize about this period in time is that this was the beginning of

21
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,920
the personal computing era, the PC era.

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,200
Where we were starting to see for

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,890
the first time non-programmers, using, computers.

24
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:52,220
So before this, before you had things like the graphical user interface,

25
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:59,950
point and click, interfaces, devices or computer like the Apple Macintosh.

26
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,020
Pretty much the only people that were using computers were highly trained

27
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,610
professionals that had gone through a lot of education to be able to

28
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,210
write programs for the computers.

29
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,980
They knew a lot about how computers work, they memorize very arcane commands that

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,240
they would type into these devices to get them to do what they wanted.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,090
And now all of the sudden in the late 70s and the early 80s this world of computing

32
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,100
was opening up to a vast array of other types of users.

33
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,330
These might be secretaries who were doing a lot of word processing or people who

34
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,592
were entering information into inventory database is various other types of users.

35
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:46,690
And the question was how can we design, how can programmers are people

36
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:53,670
who are computer experts design software for these non-programmers to use?

37
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,570
And a lot of people in a fields of computer science,

38
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,600
in psychology started thinking really hard about this question, and thinking about

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,570
whether there were principled ways to design these types of systems.

40
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,310
And a landmark in this story was the publication in 1983 of a book

41
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,430
called The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction.

42
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,480
It was written by Stu Card, Tom Moran and Allen Newell.

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,870
And this had a big impact in bringing that field of HCI together in those early

44
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,100
days because it was the first attempt to really say that we can scientifically and

45
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,860
rigorously use what we know about humans,

46
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,660
about human psychology, about human perception, about human cognition and

47
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,230
how people work to design systems that will work for them.

48
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,570
Around the same time, a community of people was coming together and

49
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,880
starting to identify as a community.

50
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,450
That was interested in studying these types of problems.

51
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,860
So in 1982 we had the first CHI conference and

52
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,860
CHI is the premier conference in the field of human computer interaction.

53
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,660
The long name is the Association for Computing Machinery&#39;s Conference on

54
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,870
Human Factors in Computing, but everybody in the field calls it CHI.

55
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,740
The first conference happened in 1982 and it&#39;s still going strong today.

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:25,140
So here&#39;s a picture from 2016 in San Jose, California.

57
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,400
There were 4,000 people in attendance there.

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,310
And as you can see from this picture I took of a conference session

59
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,909
I was trying to get into, it&#39;s just overflowing and filled to capacity.

60
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,550
So the Card, Moran and Newell book and

61
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,300
the beginning of the CHI Conference was the beginning of the academic community

62
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,580
that was coming together to study these issues of human computer interaction.

63
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,500
And that&#39;s the term that we use for the academic field that studies the way that

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,630
people interact with computing technology and how we can design better systems.

65
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,470
But at the same time, a professional practice started to emerge in the 1980s.

66
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,250
However it was very closely tied to that academic community in the early days.

67
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,760
Because the only way that you could really learn about what was going on

68
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,150
in the field of HCI, was to go to the CHI conferences.

69
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,010
Or maybe you could take a handful, one of a handful of HCI graduate courses

70
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,850
that were sprinkled around, In universities in the US and

71
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,640
elsewhere, mostly in computer science and psychology departments.

72
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,080
But there wasn&#39;t a degree that you could get,

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,800
there wasn&#39;t a course of study that you could pursue that would just be about HCI.

74
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,754
Towards the end of the 1980s,

75
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:38,689
we started to see a handful of books come out that were aimed at a wider audience,

76
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:42,336
that were aimed at professional practitioners and other people that were

77
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:45,956
interested in some of these issues around human computer interaction.

78
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:50,196
So in 1986 we had user centered system design by Don Norman and

79
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:55,127
Norm Draper, which was the first book to really articulate this idea of user

80
00:05:55,127 --> 00:06:00,080
centered design that&#39;s still very much at the center of UX practice today.

81
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,717
In 1987 Ben Shneiderman came out with designing the user interface which was

82
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:07,718
the first textbook of human computer interaction,

83
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:11,620
that was meant to be used in university courses to teach this stuff.

84
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,820
And in 1988, Don Norman published the Psychology of Everyday Things later

85
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,680
republished under the name The Design of Everyday Things,

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,280
which was a very influential book that reached beyond the community of HCI

87
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,030
that introduced a lot of these ideas to a wider public and

88
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,980
became very important in promoting this field outside of its smaller origins.

89
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,170
But in terms of the way that human computer interaction was incorporated

90
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:47,330
into system design during this period of time is that usability was primarily seen

91
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:53,590
as the main factor of concern and it was seen as a software engineering issue.

92
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,400
Ad so you had a usability testing starting to be performed as part of

93
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,280
software development but it was often performed at the end of the development to

94
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,470
validate the product and say, yes this is ready for release.

95
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,140
But it would be done very late and much too late,

96
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,270
often too really influence the design of the product in the first place.

97
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:17,060
In user interface design or UI design, was often used as a way to put a pretty

98
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,030
face on software whose functionality was pretty much already determined.

99
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,760
So a UI designer would come in at the end and

100
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,670
sort of decide where the buttons should go and which buttons there should be and what

101
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,970
the labels on those buttons should be and maybe what some of the graphics should be.

102
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,550
But they wouldn&#39;t have very much influence on

103
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,050
the functionality of the software because that would have already been determined

104
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,360
by the software engineers who were working earlier in the process.

105
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,750
So flash forward to the 1990&#39;s and a bog sea change was starting to

106
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,190
happen that was going to influence the way that this field evolved going forward.

107
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,960
And a couple of key time points in this big change were first of all in 1988

108
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,480
The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee.

109
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:09,430
Essentially, provided a specification to allow pages to be linked to each other,

110
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,030
to make it very easy to share information on the Internet.

111
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,250
It wasn&#39;t until 1991 that what we now consider

112
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,530
to be the first web page was actually published by Tim Berners-Lee.

113
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,100
And one thing that&#39;s interesting, when you look at this original web page,

114
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,940
the statement in here everything there is

115
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,520
online about the worldwide web is linked directly or indirectly to this document.

116
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,620
So that was a very different era than we have now with billions and

117
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,660
billions of web pages and really no way to make sense of everything that&#39;s out there.

118
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,590
Another milestone in this progression

119
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,200
was the release in 1993 of the Mosaic Web Browser.

120
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,570
So, while the world wide web existed before this, and there were webpages out

121
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:59,000
there, there was not really a convenient, user friendly way for people to access it.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,260
The Mosaic Browser came along and made it much easier for

123
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,350
people to access the web, to follow links and go to different places, and

124
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,340
also to be able to see images for the first time

125
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,540
in a way that was convenient and integrated with the page layout.

126
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,640
A huge milestone occurred in 1995 when the National Science Foundation,

127
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,350
who was in charge of administering and governing the Internet,

128
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,960
changed a rule to allow Internet commerce to go forward.

129
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,140
And very shortly after that, Amazon.com released one of the first

130
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,090
major online stores that had a big impact.

131
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,800
And you can see on this slide the original version of Amazon.

132
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,440
It looks pretty different now.

133
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,050
But that opened the flood gates to lots of companies and

134
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,340
lots of different other types of organizations suddenly becoming

135
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,820
very interested in the potential of the Internet.

136
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,230
And so, you saw a lot of investors, you saw a lot of activity.

137
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,970
And ultimately that led us a few years later to what we refer to now as the dot

138
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,310
com bubble, which was a huge explosion of e-commerce websites and

139
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,660
different types of businesses getting in onto the Internet, and

140
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,220
trying to figure out how to make that something that could be profitable and

141
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,379
could provide different types of services to people.

142
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,970
And so, suddenly, in the late 90s and early 2000s,

143
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,300
a lot more people were dealing with this stuff,

144
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,580
were interacting with computers to do a lot more different types of things.

145
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,970
So, a lot more companies were getting involved, both new companies and

146
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,410
existing companies.

147
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,940
A lot more users who hadn&#39;t really had a reason to interact with computers before,

148
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,589
were using computers to do a lot more stuff.

149
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,310
So here&#39;s a graph that really illustrates how dramatic the rise of the Internet

150
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,210
was during this period.

151
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,690
So if you look at 1995, the year that Internet commerce

152
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,610
is first allowed when Amazon was founded, you can see that the bar is so

153
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,850
small on this graph that you can barely even see it.

154
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,920
You go forward a little bit, even to about 2000, and

155
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,380
you&#39;re already looking at hundreds of millions of users, which pales in

156
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,680
comparison to the number of users today, somewhere in the neighborhood of three and

157
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,760
a half billion or roughly half the world&#39;s population.

158
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,040
And you can see why companies and

159
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,760
other organizations who were interested in reaching users and

160
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,600
consumers would have started really paying attention to this phenomenon and

161
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,930
starting to figure out how to get involved in it.

162
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,450
And so, in that early era of the dot com bubble,

163
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,200
you saw huge growth in the number of jobs in the technology sector,

164
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,120
specifically around the creation and the evolution of these websites.

165
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,520
And so, you saw lots of software engineering jobs, but you also saw

166
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,140
thousands of new web designers that were getting into the field and

167
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,560
trying to figure out what&#39;s the best way to design websites to reach consumers and

168
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,610
to meet these business needs.

169
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,740
And so, it became clear during this time as well that user interface design and

170
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,210
usability engineering, the way that it had been done as part of the software

171
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,610
engineering process, wasn&#39;t really enough to capture some of the dynamics of what

172
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,500
was happening and what people were trying to do with the Internet.

173
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,770
So, a term that became popular that was discovered by the web design community

174
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,310
around this time was this concept of interaction design.

175
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,310
Well, interaction design was a term that was actually coined in the mid-1980s

176
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,300
by these two gentlemen, Bill Verplank and

177
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,280
Bill Moggridge, both of whom were industrial designers by training.

178
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,390
And they were trying to describe how industrial designers,

179
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,750
who had traditionally worked with physical products that might be things like

180
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,920
furniture or appliances, were starting to have to deal with

181
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,030
this notion of interactivity as software was starting to move into those products.

182
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,460
Well, people in the web design field picked up this term and

183
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,980
started to use it to describe what they were doing,

184
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,680
because it gave them a way to capture the shift beyond user interface design,

185
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,570
beyond this just putting the pretty face on the product at the end of it.

186
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,610
Beyond usability engineering, beyond this idea of just testing the product at

187
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,530
the end, but actually getting involved earlier in the process

188
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,906
in deciding what the interaction should be and how these things should go together.

189
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:26,820
Also beyond human-computer interaction,

190
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,840
as a way of differentiating the professional practice from the academic

191
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,030
research field that was studying the way that humans and computers interacted.

192
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,400
And also beyond some of the other

193
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,700
fields that we&#39;re feeding into this phenomenon of web design.

194
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,884
And so, a lot of people we&#39;re coming to this,

195
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:49,356
not necessarily from the background of human computer interaction, but

196
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:52,220
from graphic and industrial design and other places.

197
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,070
And they were looking for

198
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,150
a way to describe what they were doing that made sense to them as well.

199
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,480
And also, beyond software engineering to differentiate

200
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,440
the discipline of interaction design from the discipline of software engineering, or

201
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,880
to distinguish between deciding what a product should be and how it should

202
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,990
work from the process of building it and validating that it does work as it should.

203
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,010
A second shift was just on the horizon, though.

204
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,843
So you could see that by, that in 1985,

205
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:27,675
right around the beginning of the personal computing era,

206
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:32,743
a very small percentage of households had a computer in the house, so 13%.

207
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:37,042
By 2000, that number was up to 44%, but

208
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:43,850
still less than half of the households had access to a computer in the home.

209
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:49,210
Go forward to 2014, just a couple of years ago, and pretty close to

210
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:54,240
all of the households in the developed world have access to a computer.

211
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,250
So what we can see from this is that computing technology, and

212
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,260
interacting with computers, is moving very much out of the workplace and

213
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,250
into people&#39;s everyday lives, and starting to be used for the things that people do.

214
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,130
Shopping, education, entertainment,

215
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,980
and all kinds of things that are not work place related.

216
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,930
So that was one shift that was happening.

217
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:21,500
And another dramatic example of the diffusion of computing technology

218
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,330
into people&#39;s everyday lives can be seen through this graph of the adoption

219
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,310
of mobile phones, which really grew quite dramatically throughout

220
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,980
the aughts to the point where you can see in 2014

221
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,860
that there were 120 mobile phones per 100 inhabitants.

222
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,590
Meaning, that people on average owned more than one mobile phone.

223
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,040
And you compare that to 1997 where

224
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,430
it was barely a fifth of the population had access to these types of technologies.

225
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,280
So that was another Really dramatic shift.

226
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,360
And that caused a shift in the way that companies started to think about a way

227
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,550
that they could use technology, and the way that technology

228
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,430
facilitated their interaction with their users and their consumers.

229
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:17,530
So, you saw another shift from a website to these new forms of interacting with

230
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,720
consumers and with users in the forms of apps and services moving on

231
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,250
towards new types of devices in all kinds of different ways that this was changing.

232
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,210
And so, what characterizes this latest shift in the way people

233
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,910
interact with technology is that we really see computing as a way of life,

234
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,960
not a special activity that people do sometimes.

235
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,270
In some sense, we&#39;re always connected, or we&#39;re almost always connected.

236
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,820
And those connections are part of every aspect of our lives, not just

237
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,650
sort of isolated to things that we do at work, or things that we do at school.

238
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,440
And from a business perspective, businesses started seeing computing as

239
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,960
part of an ongoing relationship with customers.

240
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,600
So, not just a matter of publishing the site or shipping a product, but

241
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,160
a way of maintaining an ongoing relationship through, perhaps,

242
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,250
multiple products and multiple sites and multiple apps and

243
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,089
multiple services that were being provided.

244
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,660
And so, we saw a merging of usability and

245
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,970
interaction design with other concerns that had previously been separate, so

246
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,460
with things like marketing and branding with market research.

247
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,810
So now, insights for market research will be blended with insights

248
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,210
from usability research and user experience research.

249
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,070
A merging of these user experience,

250
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,460
or user centered perspectives with product strategy.

251
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,880
So, not just being brought in at the end to provide a pretty face,

252
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,290
or to provide usability.

253
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,886
Testing to validate something, but

254
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:56,550
actually being brought in at the beginning to figure out what we should be building?

255
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,200
What should we be making, and how should we be reaching people?

256
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,023
And also, increasingly a merger of usability and interaction designed with

257
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:09,990
physical design, as we start to move off of the web and into mobile platforms and

258
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:16,050
wearables, and the Internet of things in all kinds of other forms of technology.

259
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,520
And fundamentally, what we&#39;ve seen throughout this phase of the history of

260
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,630
user experience is a recognition of user experience as a central concern for

261
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,700
products and brands and enterprises.

262
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,140
So, it&#39;s no longer a peripheral concern or an afterthought.

263
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,430
But often,

264
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,700
a central concern that is essential to the success of these enterprises.

265
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,550
And so, user experience today, as I said,

266
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,060
is now seen by many firms as strategically important.

267
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,220
User experience shares a common side of concerns and basic approaches, but we&#39;re

268
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,190
also seeing that there&#39;s an increasing degree of specialization within the field.

269
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,320
And this is a topic that we can go into integrate depth about, but

270
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,460
I&#39;m just gonna kinda get a sense of it.

271
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,960
And so, one of the splits that we see, or one of the ways that people often

272
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,940
specialize is to specialize either in UX Research or UX Design.

273
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,730
And there&#39;s plenty of people that do a fair amount of both.

274
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,790
But even within those specializations, we&#39;re starting to see subspecialization.

275
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,710
So, within UX Research, you have people that specialize in

276
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,850
Qualitative UX Research that primarily do interviews and ethnographic observations.

277
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,180
And people that specialize in Quantitative UX Research that are maybe more concerned

278
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,830
with analyzing large data sets of analytics and click stream data.

279
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,850
And on the design side,

280
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,450
you see people specializing in different aspects of the design chain.

281
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,490
So, specializing in visual design, or kind of the more

282
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,880
graphical aspects of the presentation, versus interaction design, figuring out

283
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,570
how all of the different pieces fit together, or information architecture.

284
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,470
What&#39;s the best way to present large volumes of information to users?

285
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,240
And then sitting on top of this, you have sort of the more over arching

286
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,880
specializations of things like project management, user experience,

287
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,650
strategy, and so forth.

288
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,080
So, when we try to put it all together, it could look pretty messy.

289
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,510
So, here&#39;s an example of a diagram that tries to put together all of the different

290
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,690
concerns that feed into this notion of user experience design,

291
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,050
and user experience research.

292
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,150
And you can see that this diagram tries to capture

293
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,730
the relationship between user experience design and interaction design and

294
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,975
human computer interaction in marketing, in information architecture.

295
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:40,955
And you could draw this diagram a thousand different ways, and

296
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:43,775
it probably wouldn&#39;t get very much clearer than this.

297
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:49,970
But the really important thing is that, in a nutshell, the history of UX,

298
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,510
however you look at it, really is the history of user-centered design,

299
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,180
of putting the user at the center of the design process,

300
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,760
in making decisions about how to design products with the user in mind.

301
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,410
And overtime, that user center focuses become more and

302
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,820
more central to the way a lot of products are being designed.

303
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,360
Which is great.

304
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,760
The terminology changes, but the focus remains on the user.

305
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,600
And it also evolves to incorporate new things as we move along.

306
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,350
So, incorporating physical design and marketing and big data analysis and

307
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,650
all kinds of other things that have become sort of brought into the UX fold.

308
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,640
Specialization is common, as I mentioned,

309
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,980
especially now with a large and growing industry.

310
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,250
But it&#39;s important to be knowledgeable about the big picture, to understand

311
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,070
all of these different aspects of UX, even if you&#39;re only gonna spend most of your

312
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,350
time doing on of them, because you need to know how they all fit together.

313
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,720
And another important thing to get out of this is that user experience

314
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,490
is increasingly important to business, and really, to everything that we do.

315
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,020
And a final important point is the world needs more UX experts, and

316
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,900
so, I hope that you will be one of them.
