00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:12,740
https://youtu.be/F3hKYiXUQRw
So we use a lot of different methods in UX research.

1
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,570
But it&#39;s useful to think of really three basic methods or

2
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,970
approaches that encompass pretty much everything that we do in UX Research.

3
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,940
So they&#39;re really three basic methods that we use

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,980
in user experience research to guide a product towards a great user experience.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,290
We can ask people what they do and what they think,

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:42,190
we can observe what they do, and we can inspect prototypes and artifacts,

7
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,250
to determine whether or not they&#39;re likely to deliver a good user experience.

8
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,280
When we talk about gaining insight through asking,

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,330
there are a number of different specific methods that we use.

10
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,390
By far, the most common are interviews and surveys.

11
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,800
Interviews consist of conversations with stakeholders to understand

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,050
aspects of their experience.

13
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,940
And surveys consist of questions that are distributed to lots of people,

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,320
to elicit information about their attitudes, behaviors, and characteristics.

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,650
There are other methods we&#39;re not gonna go into right now, like focus groups,

16
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,369
diary studies and experience sampling.

17
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,600
When we talk about gaining insights through observations,

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,940
there are a number of different specific ways that we do that.

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,060
One is through ethnographic observations, which basically consists of

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,550
hanging around in particular environments, while people are performing activities.

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,780
And watching people engage in those activities to understand

22
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,630
how they go about them.

23
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,790
We can also observe how people interact with prototypes and

24
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,860
systems that we&#39;ve developed, by asking them to perform scripted tasks,

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,510
to see if a system supports them through user testing.

26
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,920
And after a system is built and

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,920
has been deployed in the wild, we can employ usage analytics,

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,220
often called web analytics or mobile analytics depending on the platform,

29
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,160
to analyze large scale traces of system usage, to understand the patterns of use.

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,990
And again there are other techniques that are more specialized,

31
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,310
like video analysis and social media mining that we won&#39;t go into.

32
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,210
And there are others as well.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,160
And finally, when we talk about using inspection methods to gain insight,

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,640
there are a couple of different ways that we do that.

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
We can perform guideline based inspections,

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,260
where we compare a system design against known best practices,

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,470
to find places where it probably breaks down, because it violates some principle

38
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,750
of what we know is likely to work for people in a particular context.

39
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,910
We can also perform walkthrough based inspections,

40
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,530
where we step through an interaction sequence using specific techniques to take

41
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,309
a users-eye view to find probable breakdowns.

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,840
And we also can perform comparative analysis, where we systematically compare

43
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,070
a design with similar designs to identify strengths and

44
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,750
weaknesses, and we often combine these different approaches in specific methods.

45
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,140
So in user testing, we not only observe people performing tasks, but

46
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,380
we usually accompany those observations with interviews, to get more information

47
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,380
about people&#39;s reactions to the product and learn more about what works and why.

48
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,480
And we also combine watching and asking through contextual interviews,

49
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,770
often in the early stages of a design project where we ask questions of users,

50
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,850
while observing their natural activities take place.

51
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,610
So we might sort of watch over their shoulders as they perform tasks,

52
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,390
using their current system, and ask them why they&#39;re doing things and

53
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,832
what works and what doesn&#39;t.

54
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,690
And there again, other techniques,

55
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,690
like artifact-based interviewing, that would employ a combination of watching and

56
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,880
asking, which we aren&#39;t gonna say much about here.

57
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,690
So a question might be, when do you use which of these different techniques?

58
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,930
Well, at a very high level, we probably wanna use

59
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,410
asking techniques where we&#39;re interacting and having conversations or

60
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,540
asking questions of members of our target population.

61
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,150
When perhaps observation is infeasible, maybe these are activities that

62
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,270
are infrequent, or take a very long time to unfold.

63
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,581
Or are private and not things that we can easily observe.

64
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:24,222
We wanna ask questions, when values and motivations are key,

65
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:28,343
because these are not things that are easy to get out of an observation,

66
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:31,522
where you can&#39;t find out why people are doing things.

67
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:37,200
And we specifically employ surveys when we need to get large numbers of responses.

68
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,532
And a high degree of certainty where we can employ statistical methods to

69
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,296
be able to make strong claims that particular characteristics

70
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,509
are present in our user population.

71
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:55,390
We wanna lean more towards observation, when self-report will miss information.

72
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,690
Perhaps because of the frailty of human memory, or because there&#39;s tacit knowledge

73
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,080
involved, that people will not be able to tell you about in an interview or survey.

74
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,790
We wanna conduct observations, when process and communication are important.

75
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,140
Where it&#39;s very important to see how people go about doing things and

76
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,610
how communication with other participants,

77
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,540
in the activity, is critical to the way that people conduct these activities.

78
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,590
And we specifically employ techniques like analytics,

79
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,830
again, where large numbers and high certainty are needed.

80
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:36,160
And we wanna perform inspections when, first of all,

81
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,120
you have a product to inspect.

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,320
So inspection methods don&#39;t work early in the stages of a design project,

83
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,875
where you&#39;re understanding users and their current practices, and

84
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,960
try to understand what the possible options for a solution are.

85
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,570
But once you have a prototype,

86
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,420
you can perform things like guideline based inspections and walkthroughs.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,140
Inspection methods are also useful, when interacting with users as too expensive or

88
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,710
cumbersome.

89
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,450
Perhaps because users are difficult to recruit, or you&#39;re simply not at a point

90
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,290
in the design process where it makes sense to invest in those kinds of methods.

91
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,900
And the critical thing to realize is that you will use

92
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,500
all of these methods in a typical design project.

93
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,213
So for example, and this is just one example.

94
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:26,985
Every project is different and they all unfold differently.

95
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:30,866
But for example, you might start out at the beginning of a project,

96
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:35,568
in the assessment phase, by conducting interviews, where you try to understand

97
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:40,150
what it is that users are doing, why they&#39;re doing things the way that they do.

98
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,207
And you might follow that up with observations,

99
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:45,179
where you try to understand the things that they&#39;re not telling you.

100
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:48,958
And try to understand the process by which they&#39;re conducting the activities that you

101
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,420
wanna support with your design.

102
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,640
After going through one cycle of the iterative design process,

103
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,470
going through the assess, design and build phase, you might come back around and

104
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,973
say, okay, now that we have some ideas, specific ideas.

105
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:06,081
How does that compare with what else is out there?

106
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:09,637
You might perform a comparative analysis, and go out and

107
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,945
look at the other products that try to solve the same kind of problem.

108
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:17,309
And understand which ones work better and why they work better, and

109
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:18,910
which ones don&#39;t work as well.

110
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,335
After another turn of the design cycle,

111
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:26,325
you might be ready to perform some low fidelity user testing.

112
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:32,075
So, you might take a paper prototype, for example, and put it in front of users and

113
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:37,035
ask them to perform some tasks, and try to understand again what works and

114
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:40,085
what doesn&#39;t about your design, so that you can fix it in the next cycle.

115
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,320
After the next turn around iterative design cycle,

116
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,470
you might be ready to perform a heuristic evaluation,

117
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,680
which is a specific form of guideline based inspection.

118
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,790
Where you can now take your design and say, okay, what are the aspects

119
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,900
of this design that are likely to deliver a positive user experience?

120
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,720
And which ones are probably going to lead to a negative user experience?

121
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,392
And then after another design and build phase, we might be ready for

122
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:11,230
high-fidelity user testing.

123
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,360
So now you have something that&#39;s pretty close to the final product that you think

124
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,210
you might be ready to ship.

125
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,140
And you wanna iron out those last few details, by putting it in front of users

126
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,870
and getting their feedback, and observing where it works and where it doesn&#39;t.

127
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,640
And even after the design process has concluded,

128
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,680
the user experience research doesn&#39;t necessarily end.

129
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,060
So, after a product has been released, it&#39;s common to set up

130
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,620
an analytics process where you can see how people are actually using their product,

131
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,080
so that you can use that information to improve the product in the next cycle.

132
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,770
And you might conduct surveys, to ask people about their experience using

133
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,889
the product, what their satisfaction level is, what works for them and what doesn&#39;t.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,490
In this lecture, I&#39;ve introduced the three basic methods that we use in UX research,

135
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,920
asking, observing, and inspecting.

136
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,870
In future lectures, we will go into much more detail

137
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,110
about specific ways that we do that through specific UX research methods.
