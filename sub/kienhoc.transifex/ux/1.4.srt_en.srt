So we all know what a good and bad user experience feel like.

1
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,845
And we can think of lots of words that can be applied to both those situations.

2
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:21,810
A system or an experience can be helpful.

3
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,240
It can be easy to learn.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,490
It can be attractive.

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,430
It can be fun or it can be stressful and ugly and

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,260
condescending and tedious and frustrating.

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,710
So how do we keep all of this in mind when we&#39;re designing?

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,510
How do we focus our design so that we make sure we&#39;re avoiding those qualities that

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,320
we don&#39;t want and moving towards the qualities that we do want.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,850
Well, Frank Guo, writing for UXmatters in 2012, offered

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,150
this simplified way of looking at user experience that I think is really useful.

12
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,800
He suggested we could break down user experience into four major components,

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,500
its value Usability, Adoptability, and Desirability.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,860
So when we talk about value, we&#39;re asking is this system or

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,240
is this design useful for people?

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,810
Does it accomplish what they need it to accomplish?

17
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,280
And is it better than the alternatives?

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,954
So as an example, we can think of Viscalc, which was developed in the late 70s and

19
00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:28,067
was the first software spreadsheet that was used by lots and lots of people.

20
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:32,955
And it was an enormous success because it allowed people to do something

21
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:37,599
they simply couldn&#39;t do before which was to be able to update a whole

22
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,097
network of different formulas and see the results immediately.

23
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:47,036
So it allowed people to rapidly explore different financial calculations and

24
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:51,000
so forth in a way that simply wasn&#39;t possible before.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,030
So it delivered enormous value for people that needed to do these kind of

26
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,370
calculations, and it was vastly superior than anything else that was out there.

27
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,050
By modern standards, it wasn&#39;t necessarily a huge usability success.

28
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,090
In fact, when competitors came along a few years later, like Lotus 1-2-3 and

29
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,700
Microsoft Excel, they eventually wiped out the market for Viscalc because they were

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,840
able to offer superior usability and other qualities that were superior.

31
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,470
However, because VisiCalc initially offered functionality that didn&#39;t exist,

32
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,270
it was able to be incredibly successful.

33
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,890
When we talk about usability, we&#39;re asking can users do what they need to do?

34
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,450
So assuming we have the value right,

35
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,690
are people able to actually realize that value.

36
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,610
An example of the product that got this wrong

37
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,410
was the Motorola ROKR which came out in the early 2000s, 2004 I believe.

38
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,740
It was actually several years before the iPhone but

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:59,630
it was the first phone that attempted to integrate mp3 playing functionality.

40
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,410
And it actually connected to the iTunes store that was run by Apple.

41
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,920
However, its usability by all accounts was awful.

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,650
People couldn&#39;t figure out how to use it.

43
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,570
They couldn&#39;t figure out how to access the music playing functionality.

44
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,220
And it had other strange limitations like only being able to show

45
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,220
the first 100 songs that you had stored on the phone, even though there were other

46
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,180
songs that were on there, perhaps thousands of other songs.

47
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,550
As a result, even though the value was there,

48
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,020
this was something that there was definitely a consumer need for

49
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,030
as demonstrated by the iPhone a few years later.

50
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,720
The usability prevented this from being a success, and

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,950
the product ultimately failed.

52
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,420
Desirability refers to the extent to which a system is fun,

53
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,200
attractive, and pleasant to use.

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,550
So sticking with a similar example to the ROKR, the iPod,

55
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,940
when it came out in the early 2000s, was an enormous success.

56
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,750
When the iPod came out, it offered a striking new design that

57
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,140
a lot of people just loved and found really fun and engaging to use.

58
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,640
In particular, the scroll wheel was a whole new way of interacting

59
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,430
with a device like this, and people really found it to be intuitive and

60
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,170
elegant and an enjoyable way of interacting with this device, and

61
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,750
that contributed to the success.

62
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,120
And finally Adoptability refers to how easy it is to find and

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,850
start using a system or a device.

64
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,590
And to illustrate this I&#39;ll show an example of a service that offers a very,

65
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,840
very nice initial use experience.

66
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,440
So, this is the website for duolingo, which is a service for

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,150
learning a new language.

68
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,480
And this is their screen that you see the first time you come to duolingo and

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,700
you haven&#39;t ever used it before.

70
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,570
So, very clear instructions, we get started and

71
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,990
the first thing it asks is what language do I wanna use?

72
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:10,550
Well, let&#39;s say I wanna learn French It then asks me how serious I am about it.

73
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,390
So I don&#39;t really know.

74
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,670
I&#39;ll just say I&#39;m regular.

75
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,890
So next it asks me am I new to French or if I already know some French.

76
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,160
Let&#39;s say I&#39;m new to French.

77
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,930
And I&#39;m immediately starting to learn French.

78
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,960
It asks me to select the translation of the woman, and

79
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,060
I start to engage in the learning process.

80
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,390
So you&#39;ll notice it didn&#39;t ask me to create a user name or password or

81
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,620
enter my credit card or any of those other things.

82
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,300
It just got me right into the system and allowed me to start using it.

83
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,337
As I go forward, at some point it does ask me if i wanna create a profile, so

84
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,696
I can save my progress so things like that.

85
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:52,225
But it succeeds on the adoptability criteria by making it very easy for

86
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:55,217
me to get in and get started without having to go

87
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:59,690
through a lot of other stuff that&#39;s actually not interesting to me.

88
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,580
The basic methods that we use in user experience research and design are aimed

89
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,375
at helping us address all of these Attributes of user experience.

90
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:17,040
So the methods that we use for understanding users for designing and

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,460
prototyping systems and evaluating designs can be applied to questions

92
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,010
around the value usability, adaptability and desirability of a system.

93
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,920
So for example, if we think about user experience research, I think about two

94
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,550
main types of user experience research activities that we typically perform.

95
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,870
Activities around understanding users and activities around evaluating designs.

96
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,110
So when we&#39;re asking questions about the value to users,

97
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,200
in the understanding phase, we ask what is it that users need?

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,400
What does our system need to provide for them?

99
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,710
And when we&#39;re evaluating,

100
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,400
we ask does this design fulfill the needs that we understand?

101
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:03,030
When asking about usability in the understanding phase, we need to understand

102
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,320
how do they do it now, how do they accomplish the tasks that our system is

103
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,030
going to support in their current lives and using their current systems?

104
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,600
Once we&#39;re evaluating designs that we&#39;ve produced, we ask, can they get it done?

105
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,510
Can they do those tasks with this system that we&#39;ve designed?

106
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,460
When looking at desirability,

107
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,490
in the understanding phase, we need to understand what do our users desire?

108
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,500
What do they look for, what are their turn ons and what are their turn offs.

109
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,410
And when we&#39;re evaluating designs we can ask is this design appealing?

110
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,900
Does it have those qualities of being fun and

111
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,100
delightful and elegant that we associate with desirability.

112
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,570
And finally, when looking at adoptability, when we&#39;re

113
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,040
understanding users in the initial phases, we can ask where do users look for things?

114
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,020
And how do they make sense of things when they first start to use them?

115
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,190
And when we&#39;re evaluating our designs, we can ask, can users find and

116
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,300
access this system based on how we&#39;re planning to provide it to them?

117
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,190
The iterative design process that&#39;s at the heart of user experience research and

118
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,240
design is your guide for making sure that these different

119
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,120
components of user experience are realized in the product that you&#39;re designing.

120
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,650
So to wrap up, user experience is multi-faceted, it&#39;s not just about

121
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,840
one of these things, it&#39;s not just about useability or elegance or desirability.

122
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,920
The basic UX methods that we are covering in this course and

123
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,439
in other courses can address these different UX concerns.

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,020
And most importantly, let the process be your guide.

125
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,530
It&#39;s not something that you can get right, right out of the box, but

126
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,860
you need to follow an iterative process,

127
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,710
asking questions all along the way to make sure that at the end

128
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,560
you come out with a product that delivers a great user experience.
