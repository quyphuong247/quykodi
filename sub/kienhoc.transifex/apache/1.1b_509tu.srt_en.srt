ANTHONY JOSEPH: So what is Apache Spark?

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,950
Apache Spark is all about scalable, efficient analysis

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,640
of Big Data.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,810
In this lecture, we'll talk about the analysis and Big Data

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,910
parts of that statement.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,080
In the next lecture, we'll talk about how

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,510
Spark achieves its scalable and efficient operation.

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,590
So let's start with Big Data.

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,480
Where does Big Data come from?

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,320
Well, it's all around us.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,070
Everything that you do online, well, someone could record.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,500
The clicks that you make, the ads that you see,

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,730
any billing events, when you're watching a video, if you fast

14
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,980
forward, or pause, or stop that video, every request that you

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,440
make to a server, or every transaction that you perform,

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,180
or every network message that you send or receive,

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,520
or any faults that occur in the network,

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,730
in applications that you use, or on devices--

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,600
all of this information could be recorded.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,870
This represents just the tip of the iceberg

21
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,830
in terms of the data that could be collected and then analyzed.

22
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,570
Big Data also comes from user generated content.

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,750
And this can be on the web or on mobile applications.

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,010
So from Facebook, or Instagram, or Yelp, or Twitter,

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,130
or TripAdvisor, or YouTube-- all of these applications

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,430
have user generated content, like posts and videos,

27
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,370
and pictures.

28
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,200
Another source of Big Data is health

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,520
and scientific computing.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,280
So in scientific computing, the large hadron collider

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,940
is generating petabytes of data.

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,300
Similarly, in protein applications,

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,610
we're generating gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes of data.

34
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,040
Genome X is generating many petabytes of data.

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,810
Graph data also is a source of Big Data.

36
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,550
And there's lots of interesting data

37
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,870
that has a graph structure.

38
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,160
So social networks, your friends relationships,

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,510
telecommunication networks, computer networks,

40
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,420
road networks, collaborations, and relationships.

41
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,700
Some of these graphs can be absolutely huge.

42
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,509
So think about the Facebook user graph--

43
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,220
all of those friends relationships

44
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,640
across billions of users.

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,380
Another source of Big Data is web servers.

46
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,610
An Apache web server log generates a record

47
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,660
every time you access something on that web server.

48
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,750
In this class, in the second lab,

49
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,340
you'll actually analyze an Apache web server

50
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,290
from a NASA web server.

51
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,050
Machines also generate lots of information.

52
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,440
Every interaction that you do with an application

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,980
on a machine generates a record in a file.

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,037
The internet of things is also a source of Big Data.

55
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,370
Here's a project that we're doing here at Berkeley where

56
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,840
we're measuring the humidity, temperature, and light levels

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,450
at different levels of a Redwood tree.

58
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,090
We have lots of Redwood trees here.

59
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,220
And they actually are so big that they

60
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,210
create their own microclimate.

61
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,820
And so this is an example of where

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,640
we use internet connected sensors to capture information

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,540
about what's happening over time at different levels of a tree

64
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,870
to measure this microclimate.

65
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,280
Another source is RFID tags.

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,840
So examples are here in California we

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,440
use RFID tags to pay our tolls.

68
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,840
It's the fast track electronic toll collection system.

69
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,920
We also use the data that's collected from the transponders

70
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,180
for traffic reporting.
