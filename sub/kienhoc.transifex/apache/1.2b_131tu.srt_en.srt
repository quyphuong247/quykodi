00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,290
SPEAKER: Hello.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,280
This video will see how to reset our password

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,140
in case we forget it.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,450
So we use community.cloud.databricks.com,

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,600
this URL, in order to come to the login form.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,070
Obviously, we remember our email,

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,480
but we don't remember our password.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,860
So all we have to do is to fill in our email

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,520
here and then click the Forgot Password link.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,100
If our email is correct, we're going

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,680
to receive an email a few seconds later.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,730
All we have to do then is just click on the link provided.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,189
We will then see this form.

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,800
And we will have to fill in our password twice.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,704
Then all you have to do is click Reset Password.

16
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:40,120
If all goes well, you will be back

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,670
in the Databricks Community Edition welcome screen.

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,418
