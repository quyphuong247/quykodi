ANTHONY JOSEPH: Hello, and welcome to an Introduction

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,680
to Apache Spark.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,210
My name is Anthony Joseph, and I'm

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,180
a professor in the electrical engineering and computer

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,980
science department here at the University

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,160
of California in Berkeley.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,590
Big data is all around us.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,920
And Apache Spark is one of the hottest new tools

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,460
for analyzing big data quickly and efficiently.

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,810
In this lecture, I'll cover the course objectives

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,960
and prerequisites.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,930
We'll talk about what is Apache Spark

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,930
and where big data comes from.

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,280
We'll look at the structure spectrum.

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,130
And then we'll look at Apache Spark and its key concept

16
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,934
of data frames.

17
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:42,600
And then we'll spend quite a bit of time

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,460
looking at different Spark transformations and actions.

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,720
So the objectives of this course are

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,950
that you experiment with use cases for Apache Spark.

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,040
You'll perform extract transform and load

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,740
operations, perform basic data and analytics,

23
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,600
and visualization.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,030
You'll also understand Apache Sparks

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,390
history and its development.

26
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,490
And you'll understand the conceptual model

27
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,100
of data frames and Spark SQL.

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,650
You'll know Spark essentials like transformations, actions,

29
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,420
pySpark, and the SparkSQL APIs.

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,070
And you'll learn basic debugging of Apache Spark programs

31
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,910
and where to find answers to Spark questions.

32
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,740
This course has several prerequisites.

33
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,150
The first is that you have a basic programming skill

34
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,350
experience.

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,630
You also should have some experience with Python 2.7.

36
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,690
If not, you can take the Python mini course at the link

37
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,220
below to learn Python pretty quickly.

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,640
You'll also need Google's Chrome browser.

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,450
The environment that we're using doesn't

40
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,503
support Internet Explorer, Edge, or Safari.

41
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:57,003
