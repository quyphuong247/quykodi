00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,420
SPEAKER: In the lab, you'll be exploring semi-structured data.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,550
In particular, you'll be looking at a semi-structured log file.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,240
These types of log files are created by printf statements

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,020
and server processes.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,290
So for example, web servers or database servers or network

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,040
file servers, or by operating system components.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,575
These log files are in a human readable text file format.

8
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:27,700
This is kind of ironic, because they're very rarely

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,880
actually read by a human.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,590
You can store these files also, or archive them,

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,420
in binary or compressed formats.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,260
The format of these files is typically

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,510
published or sometimes defined by the code.

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,810
And it can be very difficult to parse these files.

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,580
So we're going to be using an Apache web server log file.

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,790
The Apache web server log file format

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,760
is specified by the Apache common log format

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,790
specification.

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,750
So here's an example line from an Apache web server log file.

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,070
Let's go through the components of this log line.

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,880
The first component is the client IP address.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,140
This is the IP address of the web browser

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,720
that contacted the web server.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,210
The second component is the user identity

25
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,950
from the remote machine, and the third component

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,840
is the user identity from local log in.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,040
Now in both cases, this is typically

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,165
just a hyphen, which means that it's not available.

29
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:33,170

30
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,680
The next component is the request time.

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
And this is when the web client contacted the web server.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,570

33
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,870
The next component is the request from the client.

34
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,340
This is what your web browser sends to the web server.

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,480
And it's made up of several sub components.

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,290
The first sub component is the request method.

37
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,980
For example, get or post or put.

38
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,600
And the next sub component is the endpoint.

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,890
And this is a uniform resource identifier.

40
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,900
This is the URL.

41
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,165
The last component is the client protocol version.

42
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:16,360

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,350
So our last two components of the log file line

44
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,190
are the status code, and this is what the server sends back

45
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,370
to the client.

46
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,810
Typically, it's a 200 and says that everything was OK.

47
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,990
But there also other codes like 300 or 400 or 500 series codes.

48
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,970
And these typically indicate some type of error or problem.

49
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,330
The last component is the size of the object that's

50
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,530
being returned to the client.

51
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,150
Sometimes this will be a dash or a zero

52
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,575
if no content is returned.

53
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:50,670

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,480
So in the lab, you will be exploring a NASA web server

55
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,060
access log.

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,380
This log covers 21 days from the 1st of August

57
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,600
and then the 3rd of August to the 22nd of August from 1995.

58
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,010
And it includes one million requests.

59
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,870
Now we've partially cleaned the log for you

60
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,990
by removing some very hard to parse requests.

61
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,170

62
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,040
We can ask a number of basic log analysis questions.

63
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,810
So overall, there are questions like what

64
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,500
are the statistics for the content that's being returned?

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,300
Things like the sizes or statuses.

66
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,630
What are the types of the return codes?

67
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,420
Or how many 404-- that is, page not found errors-- are there?

68
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,870
There are also temporal questions

69
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,740
that we can ask, such as how many unique hosts are there

70
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,280
per day, how many requests are there per day,

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,870
or on average, how many requests are there per host?

72
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,170
And how many 404 errors are there per day?

73
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,720
Again, this is page not found.
