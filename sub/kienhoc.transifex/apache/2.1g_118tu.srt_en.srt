00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,560
Apache Spark is based on research

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,870
that was done here in the Amp Lab

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,940
at the University of California, Berkeley.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,130
If you'd like to learn more about the history of Spark,

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,450
you can read some of the research papers.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,160
This is the first publication about Spark,

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,100
and it appeared in June 2010 at a workshop.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,260
It's a short paper, at six pages,

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,190
and provides an interesting insight

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,300
into the start of Spark.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,340
This paper, "Resilient Distributed Data Sets:

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,090
A Fault-Tolerant Abstraction for In-Memory Cluster Computing"

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,200
is the first conference paper about Spark,

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,460
and it appeared in April 2012.

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,140
This paper is an invited paper titled

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,730
"Spark SQL: Relational Data Processing in Spark"

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,750
that appeared in June 2015.
