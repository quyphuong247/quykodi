00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,830
account.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,100
It all starts by visiting http://databricks.com.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,260
We then click "Try Databricks for Free"

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,570
or click on the Sign Up link on the top right corner.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,190
The Community Edition is provided for free

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,320
and has all the computer [? server ?] resources we

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,440

We click Sign Up.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,610
We'll end up with a signup form that looks like this.

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,290
Should be easy to complete it and then click Sign Up.

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,235
You then have to read the Terms of Service

14
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:39,680
and scroll down and click Agree.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,490

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,940
