00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:00,670
SPEAKER: Hello.

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,940
In this video, we are going to see how to prepare a cluster.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,280
This is a very important video because it has steps

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,910
that you will likely have to do many times as you

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,160
are on this course.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,680
So to reach the topic cluster, we go on the bar

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,200
here on the left and click on the Icon Clusters.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,260
Then we click on the bottom, Create Cluster.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,220
We can give any name we want in this cluster,

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,280
for example, my-cluster.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,090
We click the button Create Cluster.

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,940
And then we wait for a few seconds.

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,060
This creates for us a cluster with 6 gigabytes of memory.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,910
As we said before, we can restart it or terminate it.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,890
Now it's important to remember that your cluster will

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,994
be automatically terminated after one hour of inactivity.

17
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:51,410
This means that if you come later,

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,230
for example, another day, to continue with your course,

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,560
you will have to once again come and create your cluster.

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,500
What we now have to do is click on the Home icon

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,780
here on the left.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,530
And then we have to add the library, which

23
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,710
is specific to this course.

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,910
Its name is spark_mooc_meta.

25
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,030
The good news is that we will have to do this only once.

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,140
This is a Python library.

27
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,360
All we have to do is to right-click here and then do

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,540
Create Library.

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,340
Here in the dropdown, we select the second option

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,010
since this is a Python library.

31
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,955
We enter the name here spark_mooc_meta.

32
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:34,530

33
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,350
We click Install Library.

34
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,000
That's all.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,860
Now, if we click again on the Clusters icon,

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,380
we notice here that our cluster has one library selected.

37
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,190
And here this spark_mooc_meta is loaded.

38
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,280
We can easily confirm that we did this step correctly.

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,740
If we click on the Home button here on the right,

40
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,480
we can go here and right-click Create Notebook.

41
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,610
Let's name it test-library.

42
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,660
It must be a Python notebook.

43
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,979
And the cluster is the one we are already running.

44
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,980
Create.

45
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,700
This is a Python notebook.

46
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,980
And we can write and evaluate Python expressions,

47
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,936
for example, 1 plus 1.

48
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:21,890
Now I press Shift, Enter.

49
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,120
We can see the computation completed.

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,650
If we want to check that the library is stored correctly,

51
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,990
all we have to do is import and the name of the library.

52
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,140
Again, we press Shift, Enter.

53
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,730
If there is no error, it means that the input was successful.

54
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,920
That was it.

55
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,270
We are now ready to start our first lab.
