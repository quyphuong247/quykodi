00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,260
SPEAKER: In this lecture, we'll look

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,530
at big data problems including how we distribute work

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,350
and how we deal with failures and slow machines.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,770
We'll also look at the hardware and software for big data,

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,810
including MapReduce and Apache Spark.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,330
We'll look at the structured query language, SQL,

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,770
and we'll look at Spark's implementation, Spark SQL.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,840
We'll also look at Apache Spark resources and the growing

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,270
Apache Spark community.

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,490
And finally, we'll look at this week's programming exercise,

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,795
which is dealing with Apache web server log files.

12
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:38,370

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,480
So what is Apache Spark?

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,610
It's scalable, efficient analysis of big data.

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,520
In this lecture, we'll look at how Apache Spark achieves

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,570
scalability and efficiency.

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,220
So the challenge is that big data is growing faster

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,430
than processing speeds.

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,310
And data is growing faster than per machine storage.

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,470
We can't process or store all of the data on a single machine.

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,300
There's an opportunity, however, and that's cloud computing.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,850
Cloud computing brings millions of computers to us

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,190
and enables us to leverage those resources to deal

24
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,860
with big data.

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,190
The challenge is, how do we program this thing?

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,560
So again, the opportunity, cloud computing is a game changer.

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,290
It provides access to low cost computing and storage

28
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,080
and those costs are decreasing every year.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,880
But our challenge is how we program those resources.

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,521
