00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:00,700
SPEAKER: Hello.

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,290
In this video, we're going to explore the Databricks

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,440
Community Edition website.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,540
I assume that you already opened an account

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,540
and logged in at community.cloud.databricks.com.

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,970

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,760
So you should be seeing the welcome screen right now.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,410
I would like to draw your attention

9
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,430
on this bar on the left.

10
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,520
This is the bar that gives you access to most

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,210
features of your account.

12
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,300
You're right now in the welcome page.

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,930
No matter where you are, you can always click over here

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,950
on the first icon to return to the welcome page.

15
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,000
The next two buttons, Home and Workspace,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,390
give you access to your workspace.

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,360
Through this workspace menu, you can browse different content

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,610
that is available to you.

19
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,540
The Home icon takes you directly into your own space

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,260
inside the workspace.

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,390
Users, this will be your username.

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,210
And you will be able to see your files here.

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,700
There are important options provided to you

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,460
by doing right-click.

25
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,380
For example, by right-clicking on a file,

26
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,500
you can clone, rename, move, delete, and export it.

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,060
And by right-clicking on the white space in a folder,

28
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,990
you can create new notebooks, libraries, and folders

29
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,850
or import existing files from your file system or a URL.

30
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,740
You can see here you can easily import any relevant source file

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,020
format.

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,800
By using the Recent button over here,

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,830
you can have quick access to content you recently browsed.

34
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,310
By using the Search button on the bottom of the bar,

35
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,350
you can find the relevant content quickly.

36
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,820
Finally, by using the Clusters button,

37
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,350
you can create a new cluster for yourself.

38
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,450
You can give a cluster name-- for example, my-cluster.

39
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,760
Select here Spark 1.6.1 and then Create Cluster.

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,740
A few seconds later, a new cluster's

41
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,041
going to be provisioned for you.

42
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,030
You can see here on the right a few actions

43
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,220
you can take, like restart the cluster

44
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,972
or actually terminate it.

45
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:54,640

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,160
We'll see more relevant information in later videos.

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,550
This was a quick overview of features of the Databricks

48
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,448
Community Edition account.

49
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:02,948
