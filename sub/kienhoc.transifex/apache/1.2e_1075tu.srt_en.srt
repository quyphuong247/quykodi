00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,980
SPEAKER 1: Hello.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,930
In this video, we'll see how to use the Autograder.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,840
Again, we'll start from the edX website,

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,180
setting up the core software environment.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,470
And we will click in the last tab here,

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,280
using the Course Autograder.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,320
I will assume that you followed the instructions

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,240
in the previous video, and lab zero completed successfully.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,780
This means that we have already completed the first step here.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,680
Now, we'll go to step two, to use the Autograder notebook.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,240
Let's see how this works.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,410
Scroll a little bit down to see the detailed instructions.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,300
So again, I will assume we are already logged in.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,000
And then we do import [INAUDIBLE].

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,390
Right click, Import.

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,826
Here, we select a URL.

17
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:52,016
We copy and paste the URL.

18
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:54,540
We click Import.

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,200
Here we are.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,550
We can see the notebook here.

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,380
Subsequently, the instructions tell

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,760
us to follow the instructions in the notebook.

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,010
Here's an overview of what we have already seen.

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,700
And we scroll a little down.

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,410
We ignore this cell, as instructed.

26
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,650
We go straight here.

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,750
When you see this in any of the notebooks,

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,490
it means that you actually have to do something.

29
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,310
Here, we are instructed to fill in our email.

30
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,420
This must be a valid email address.

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,890
Again, we press Shift Enter.

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,680
Since this is the first set with code we run in this notebook,

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,200
it prompts us to attach to the cluster.

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,880
Excellent.

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,530
We're now ready to run the next cell.

36
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,085
This is just the confirmation cell.

37
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:41,980
It prints our email.

38
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,500
Confirm that this email is correct.

39
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,760
Shift Enter again.

40
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,220
And we get here.

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,650
We press Shift Enter again.

42
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,710
Notice that if, at this point, you get any import error,

43
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,040
it just means, once again, you haven't set up

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,270
the spark mooc meta library.

45
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,750
Follow the steps on the previous videos to see how this is done.

46
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,230
A few seconds later, you're going

47
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,570
to receive an email like this on your email account.

48
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,250
Obviously, check your spam folder

49
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,170
if it doesn't arrive after a while.

50
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,290
So all we need from here is this private token.

51
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,530
We can copy it.

52
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,830
And as instructed here on the notebook,

53
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,270
we go back to the beginning of the notebook

54
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,230
and we disable the comment here.

55
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,610
Again, we fill in the token here.

56
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,410
Excellent.

57
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,980
We press Shift Enter.

58
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,030
Now we scroll back to part two.

59
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,656
Again, we press Shift Enter, and Shift Enter again.

60
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:45,530
And this is a way for us to confirm

61
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,560
that the token looks right.

62
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,555
So now, we'll need to perform a few steps back in lab zero.

63
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:52,960
The steps are here.

64
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,750
So in order to make our life easier,

65
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,650
we're going to open lab zero in another tab.

66
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:04,200
We click on Recent, right-click Open Link in Tab.

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,250
Excellent.

68
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,610
The first step is to restart our cluster.

69
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,080
We go back to lab zero, and we restart our cluster.

70
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,120
This will take about half a minute.

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,690
Great.

72
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,450
Now the cluster is sorted, and the notebook is attached.

73
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,020
Let's look at the next step.

74
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,900
It tells us to click Run All.

75
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,740
This is easy.

76
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,210
Just click Run All, and wait.

77
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,480
After a few seconds, this [INAUDIBLE] pattern

78
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,190
will go away, and we'll be back with a Run All pattern.

79
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,860
We are done.

80
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,540
Verify that your notebook passes all tests.

81
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,550
Again, we scroll down, and we visually

82
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,200
confirm that everything looks OK.

83
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,460
One test passed, another.

84
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,620
Excellent.

85
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,570
The next step is to click Publish Notebook.

86
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,510
We can find this on the File menu.

87
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,990
File, Publish.

88
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,370
And then we click Publish.

89
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,930
It then gives us a URL.

90
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,350
We right click and copy it.

91
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,490
Done.

92
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,100
Excellent.

93
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,730
We get back to the instructions.

94
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,721
We can see here it tells us to paste our notebook URL.

95
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,220
Great.

96
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,430
We can press Shift Enter.

97
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,360
You have to remember that, in the meanwhile,

98
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,090
we reset the cluster.

99
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,530
Both the lab zero notebook and the Autograder

100
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,370
run on the same cluster.

101
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,490
This means that the contents of the Autograder

102
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,920
were reset, as well.

103
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,070
So this is the right time to click Run All in the Autograder

104
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,219
notebook in order to re-evaluate the fields.

105
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:42,260
We should be able to see the next step evaluated.

106
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,510
And they're giving us our email.

107
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,760
Verify that that's correct.

108
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,370
Again verify that your private token is correct.

109
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,710
And finally, fill in the lab version here.

110
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,700
Indeed, this is lab zero, so we just copy/paste this one.

111
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,007
For subsequent labs, we will need to update this.

112
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:04,350
We press Shift Enter.

113
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,150
So essentially, all we have done up to now

114
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,970
is to put our email, our private token, and the public URL

115
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,400
for our lab zero.

116
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,300
Now, we're going to submit those.

117
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,630
We press Shift Enter on the cell 3F.

118
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,500
Success.

119
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,640
If [INAUDIBLE] submit too often, we might see this error message

120
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,730
at this step.

121
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,300
We'll have to wait for a bit.

122
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,170
We can now move to the next step.

123
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,760
Here, we have some utility functionality.

124
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,020
By running, for example, this cell,

125
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,990
I can see the status of my submission.

126
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,180
We can see right now the status is processing.

127
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,760
We can [INAUDIBLE] this one.

128
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,240
We can now see that there are no submissions found.

129
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,690
This means that the submission was successfully created.

130
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,150
We can now move to part five.

131
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,260
This gives us a utility function that we can call in order

132
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,130
to see all our submissions.

133
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,900
Again, Shift Enter.

134
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,740
Excellent.

135
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,510
So we can see our grade here.

136
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,900
And this is our submission ID.

137
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,650
We copy this one, and we can paste it into the next cell.

138
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,410
Again, we press Shift Enter.

139
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,460
And then we can use the cell 6A to see more details

140
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,000
about our submission.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
We can see, in this case, this was a success [INAUDIBLE]

142
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,640
passed, and 100% score.

143
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,440
We can also run the next cell to see

144
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,670
all the output of our lab zero notebook as run

145
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,090
on the Autograder service.

146
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,660
Excellent.

147
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,480
So this was the process of using the Autograder.

148
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,460
Now we go back to edX in order to complete the third step.

149
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,220
We go at the very end of the course Autograder page.

150
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,360
And here, we fill in our user name and the submission ID.

151
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,480
Then we click Check.

152
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,620
After a few seconds, we can see the results here.

153
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,910
It's correct, and we just got 100 points.

154
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,680
We can also confirm those results

155
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,010
by clicking on the Progress tab.

156
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,760
Here's our 100%.

157
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,100
That was it.

158
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,720
You're now ready to move to second week's a little bit more

159
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,380
demanding labs.

160
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,930
Congratulations.

161
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,744
