Before we start exploring your meaning in life,

1
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,719
we need to get in the proper state of mind.

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,760
We will, therefore,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,640
start by introducing you to meditation and invite you to participate in a short meditation

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,800
session that will help you reach a mindset to think about your lives purpose.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,989
I fully realize that meditation might come across as “strange”.

6
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:35,700
I remember that during my engineering studies I made the wrong,

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,730
in retrospect, judgment against meditation.

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,350
I thought only people without connection to the real world where practicing meditation.

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:52,249
However as a consultant I had the chance to interact with many executives and to my surprise

10
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:56,260
many do some sort of meditation.

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,909
It is a way to deal with the daily hectic lives and the ambiguous,

12
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,650
wicked and unstructured challenges they face.

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,340
So what might seem strange is actually common practice by many leaders.

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,049
Meditation has many benefits that have been scientifically demonstrated,

15
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,950
including: Reducing stress.

16
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,159
Let me give you an example of one of the many studies that demonstrated this.

17
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,939
A group of people with high blood pressure was split into two groups.

18
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:32,789
Group 1 meditated regularly for 15 minutes, the other group got health education.

19
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:39,140
The group that meditated regularly decreased their blood pressure significantly more than

20
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,100
the other group.

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,909
Meditation has also other health benefits.

22
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,299
Heightening awareness, improving memory,

23
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:52,439
increasing learning skills and increasing control of the mind and body.

24
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,049
For example, a study demonstrated that children that were

25
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:01,219
exposed to meditation actually increased their grades.

26
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:06,749
Furthermore, research at Harvard Business School and INSEAD

27
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:12,230
has concluded that meditation is one of the two most effective new business tools for

28
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,290
the 21st century.

29
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,980
Today we will combine a short meditation to introduce you the technique,

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,890
together with another technique called “visualization”.

31
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,290
To illustrate the visualization technique, let me tell you an anecdote that will explain

32
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,209
the concept.

33
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:36,530
Benjamin Zander is a well-known conductor and teacher of classical music.

34
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:42,069
He noticed that his students were very occupied with comparing themselves with other students

35
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,870
and overly critical about their own performances.

36
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,680
He noticed that this behavior actually diminished their performance and “drowned out the music”

37
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,129
as he put it.

38
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,730
He, therefore,

39
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,080
did the following: At the beginning of the year,

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,540
he told each student: “your grade for the year is an A.

41
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,730
There is one condition.

42
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,189
You have to write me a letter at the date of the end of the course,

43
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:14,510
several months later, which starts with:

44
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,799
Dear Mr. Zander, I got an A because…” This way they would

45
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,480
have to describe who they would have become without their destructive habits of comparing

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,340
and over criticizing.

47
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,599
What happened was amazing.

48
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,110
The students got the feeling of what they could become and that this was something that

49
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,860
was in their control.

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:45,280
They stopped focusing on their mistakes and constantly comparing themselves to others.

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,170
The result was that Zander saw his students learn more than they had ever done before.

52
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,739
What does this story tell us?

53
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,360
You will all get an A for this course?

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,220
Something more important.

55
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,049
If you think about the person you would want to be at a certain point,

56
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,209
you are much more likely to realize this!

57
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:10,189
Let’s take this technique and apply it to your own life in the next exercise,

58
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:22,330
where we will use meditation techniques combined with visualization.
