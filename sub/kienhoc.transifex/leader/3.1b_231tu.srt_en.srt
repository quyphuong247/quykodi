It might feel a bit uncomfortable to reflect on yourself or push yourself in this way,

1
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,009
but personal reflecting is essential for developing yourself as a leader.

2
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:19,450
However, knowing yourself is not enough.

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,259
Effective leaders have also incorporated certain habits that make them effective.

4
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:28,899
There are many habits or skills we could discuss, but we only have a limited amount of time.

5
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,529
So we will only touch two sets of habits.

6
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,059
Be prepared for more ‘soft’ things to come.

7
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:38,969
The first set of habits relate to positive emotions.

8
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,059
Effective leaders are able to energize themselves in the most difficult situations and they

9
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:47,219
are able to keep a constructive mindset.

10
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:54,039
This is why we will explore a set of tools that you can use to evoke these positive emotions.

11
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,530
But effective leaders also have the ability to deal with tough situations and the corresponding

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,390
negative emotions.

13
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,040
Think of leaders such as Nelson Mandela, who spent decades institutionalized.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,750
Or entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, who faced personal bankruptcy before Tesla

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,020
became a success.

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,250
These are questions we will address in the second part:

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,170
stress management.

18
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,039
Apart from becoming more effective as a leader, these tools will also help you to experience

19
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:27,210
your life and leadership journey more positively.

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,840
Despite all the challenges associated with leadership,

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,229
leaders should be able to enjoy what they are doing.

22
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:43,360
We hope you will enjoy this section!
