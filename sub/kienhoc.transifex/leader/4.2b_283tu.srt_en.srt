Now let’s have a look at a second, completely different model:

1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,360
situational leadership.

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,360
This is the theory about the Chameleon leader.

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,430
The Chameleon leader adapts his or her style based on the situation.

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,720
This may sound a bit negative, but in a highly dynamic and networked world,

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,770
being adaptive can be very helpful.

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,149
In the following clip, we will illustrate the Chameleon leader.

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,270
Again, please carefully observe the behaviour of

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,660
the leader in this clip.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,150
My function as a leader is to understand the dynamics of this world.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,860
Yes, there are situations in which I will have

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,260
to stand firm.

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,090
I will have to put my foot down.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,670
I will have to decide and I will have to announce sometimes unpopular measures.

14
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:04,259
There are situations in which back paddling and compromising are not an option.

15
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:08,320
I’ll stand up for that and I’ll defend that if needed.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,570
And, yes,

17
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,990
there are situations when dialogue with people is key.

18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,090
Because they know so much better than I do what the relevant new concepts are.

19
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,840
They have the expertise that I do not have.

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,850
I will listen, I will learn and then I will lead.

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,770
Let’s briefly reflect on situational leadership.

22
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,920
Jack is clearly adapting his style as soon as the situation and the people around him

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,270
are changing.

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,159
He is making a real effort to read the situation and to do what he feels is right.

25
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,869
But there are some issues with Jack’s style.

26
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:48,100
It is not clear if he is reading the situation well and if he is effective in his leadership.

27
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,460
We are left with the feeling that Jack does not really know who he is or what he is standing for.
