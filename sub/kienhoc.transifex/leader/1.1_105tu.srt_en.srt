Welcome to the first week of this MOOC.

1
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:08,170
As I said in the introduction to this MOOC, most engineers have a very well developed

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,130
analytical mindset.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,370
In this first week, we will start with a case about a leader faced

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,540
with a complex problem.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,520
What you will hopefully learn is that your analytical mindset helps to solve this problem

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,910
– but that you need more than that.

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,650
We will explain why and we will make clear what the main components are

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,740
of this alternative mindset.

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,149
I hope you’ll enjoy this first week – and if you have any questions feel free to ask them.
