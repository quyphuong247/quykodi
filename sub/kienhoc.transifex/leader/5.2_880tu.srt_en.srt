https://youtu.be/yWjpPXK2eIQ
We all have moments during our careers where we become restless and think:

1
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:14,980
I am ready for something new, but I have got no idea what this next job

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,359
looks like!

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,800
This can be quite daunting or can even cause outright fear.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,769
Sometimes, we trigger this event ourselves,

5
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:24,230
while at other times, other people make the decision for us - for

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,030
example in the case of a job loss after a restructuring.

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,940
But, making career choices is a continuous process

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,109
during our whole career, rather than just a one-time event.

9
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:40,899
As we are learning and developing ourselves, we will want to move on to new challenges.

10
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:43,920
In addition, our work-context is continuously changing

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,159
around us and we may decide at some stage that our current work environment is not right

12
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,019
for us anymore.

13
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:56,299
Career changes therefore can be gradual moves to a next step or a complete departure from

14
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,339
what we were doing before.

15
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:03,149
As our life expectancies go up and the work context is more dynamic than ever,

16
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,089
we can all expect to make more career choices during our lives than our parents have ever done.

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,500
I do not believe in precise career planning.

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,020
As writer and cartoonist Allen Saunders has dubbed:

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,000
“Life is what happens to you while you are busy making other plans” In his commencement

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,690
address at Stanford in 2005, Steve Jobs likewise said:

21
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,850
”You can&#39;t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.

22
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,220
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

23
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,140
You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny,

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,130
life, karma,

25
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,130
whatever.

26
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,480
This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.”

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,600
So does this mean that it does not make sense to have a plan at all?

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,050
I believe that it is still helpful to have a plan,

29
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,990
as it gives a sense of direction in your work life,

30
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,880
even if you know that it will probably never play out the way you hoped it would.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,280
You may actually be positively surprised!

32
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,100
We have developed a simple framework that will help you think about your next career steps.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,060
Let us now share the framework.

34
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,650
There are four pieces to it The first box is your Edge.

35
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,209
This is everything that makes you special when you compare yourself to your peers.

36
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,280
It is up to you who you want to compare yourself to.

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,099
Your Edge are those strengths that make you special and differentiate you from others.

38
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,670
They make you you.

39
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,650
The second box is about Flow.

40
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,489
Being in flow means forgetting the world around you because you are fully absorbed by the

41
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,049
task at hand.

42
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,150
Flow is a joyful situation of energized focus.

43
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,760
When you are in flow, your work feels effortless.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,019
The questions for this second box are: • In which situations over the last few

45
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:01,439
months have you been in flow?

46
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,650
• What’s the common theme in these situations?

47
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,329
In the second part of the course, you reflected on your passions.

48
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,409
You may want to have a look at your workbook again,

49
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,439
as your passions may guide you to your moments of flow,

50
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,439
they may even coincide.

51
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,099
The third box is about Context.

52
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,209
The key question here is: what’s the context you need around you in

53
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,099
order to be successful?

54
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:29,680
The assumption here is that a context that supports our development will ultimately make

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
us more successful.

56
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,559
Let us reflect on this for a moment.

57
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:40,540
A context that supports our development is not necessarily a pleasant context.

58
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,739
Edgar Schein – former professor from MIT- argues that all learning is based on coercion

59
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:46,650
(i.e.

60
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,290
you have to be forced to do it) and even pain “because you either have no choice,

61
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,290
as is the case for children, or it is painful to replace something that

62
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,739
is already there with new learning.” I still believe that the optimum is a pleasant work

63
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,749
environment with significant, but healthy challenges.

64
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:09,930
Examples of specific questions to consider in the Context box are:

65
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,219
• In what type of organizational culture do I want to work?

66
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,900
• What are my colleagues like?

67
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,989
• How much money do I want to make?

68
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,419
• How important is career growth to me?

69
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,730
What are the opportunities for advancement?

70
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,400
• What does the work environment look like?

71
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,560
• What’s the ideal location of my work?

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,360
• Where do I want to live?

73
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,060
• How international should the environment be?

74
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,770
Are there opportunities to travel?

75
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,900
• What’s the work-life balance like?

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,550
• How important is autonomy to me?

77
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,860
• With which types of stakeholders do I want to work?

78
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,970
• And last but not least: What do my loved ones (e.g.

79
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,730
my partner, children,

80
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:55,030
broader family, friends) need from me in order to be happy?

81
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,960
The fourth and final box of the framework is Legacy.

82
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,440
You have defined your Legacy when putting together your Personal Charter in the second

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,300
part of this course.

84
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:13,290
Legacy is what you want to do for others .You now have all the pieces of the framework.

85
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,420
So perhaps you can create a first draft?.

86
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,600
I would encourage you to not overthink this.

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,450
Just make a first version.

88
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:33,720
You can always change things later, as you learn more about yourself.
