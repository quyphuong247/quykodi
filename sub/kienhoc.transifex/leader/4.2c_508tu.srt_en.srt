Let’s have a look at a third model: transformational leadership.

1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,750
This theory is linked to the Visionary leader.

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,830
The role of the transformational leader is to be a role model,

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,530
to create a shared vision, and to build a team’s trust and capacity

4
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,450
to work together.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,600
Transformational leaders create an environment in which individuals transcend their individual

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,190
goals to achieve the higher mission of the organization.

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,040
Transformational leaders have to be able to transform the context with their vision,

8
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,359
rather than simply react to it.

9
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,879
How to do this, is very interesting.

10
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:50,379
We critically reflected on the concept of visions Hans even argued that visions are

11
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:53,379
tricky, as sticking to a vision can make us blind

12
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:56,179
to changing circumstances.

13
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,289
In the following clip, you see a speech of Elon Musk,

14
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:03,789
CEO of Tesla, a great example of a transformational leader.

15
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:08,269
Again, please carefully observe the behavior of Elon Musk.

16
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:21,200
Welcome everyone to basically, the announcement of Tesla Energy,

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,070
all right.

18
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,439
So what I’m going to talk about tonight is about a fundamental transformation of how

19
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,090
the world works, about how energy is delivered across the Earth.

20
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,799
This is how it is today, it’s pretty bad.

21
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,359
It sucks, exactly.

22
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,329
I just want to be clear because sometimes some people are like,

23
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,320
confused about it, this is real,

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,369
okay.

25
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,049
This is actually how most power in the world is generated,

26
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:57,200
with fossil fuels and if you look at the curve, that’s a famous curve,

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,929
the Keeling curve which shows the growth in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and every

28
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:08,679
year it ratchets up, it gets higher and higher and if we do nothing

29
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,340
that’s how, that’s what,

30
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,610
where it’s headed, to levels that we don’t even see in the

31
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,000
fossil record.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,550
So this is – Well, I think we – we collectively should do something

33
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,860
about this.

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,050
And not try to win the Darwin award.

35
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,970
For us and a lot of other creatures too.

36
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,500
Let us briefly reflect on transformational leadership.

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,320
What’s the main difference between Steve Jobs as a Hero leader and Elon Musk as a Transformational leader?

38
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,160
Obviously, there are important parallels between both leaders.

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,030
They are visionary and they have changed the world with their new technological products.

40
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,040
One important difference is the higher mission of Tesla,

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,940
which is really about transitioning to a society based on sustainable sources of energy.

42
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,960
This is nothing less than transforming the way society works.

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,100
Transformational leadership is clearly appealing, so what are the issues with this style that

44
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,930
we need to be aware of when developing our own leadership style?

45
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,940
First of all, not all leaders have visionary personalities,

46
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,170
and these may be hard to develop.

47
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,870
Secondly, all attention goes to the visionary leader

48
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,000
instead of the issues that s/he is trying to address.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,090
Thirdly, the reputation of the organization is largely

50
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,640
determined by the visionary leader.

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,440
This is a risk.

52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,950
And fourthly, there is an organizational dependence on a

53
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,410
visionary leader, there is the potential for a lack of empowerment

54
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,210
for leaders at lower levels of the organization.
