Imagine there is a family.

1
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:20,529
A father, a mother and three children – an 18-year-old

2
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:24,640
daughter, a 16-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son.

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,890
The father knows that the eldest daughter will be leaving home at the end of summer,

4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,120
which means this summer is the last ever opportunity for the family to have a summer holiday together.

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,280
This is important to him and he is willing to fund a really special holiday.

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,140
He analyses the situation – where has the family already been and where not?

7
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,449
What activities do the family members enjoy or not?

8
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,940
What is the available budget?

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,589
After a thorough analysis, he decides on a holiday on the East Coast

10
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:56,430
of America, in August.

11
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,420
He now needs to secure the support of his family members.

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,150
Not everyone likes the idea.

13
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,740
One would like to go to the East Coast, but not with the whole family.

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,310
The second keeps her options open and does not adopt a position.

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,049
The third does not want to go with the whole family,

16
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,689
may be tempted by America, but not the East Coast.

17
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:19,240
The fourth wants to go to Europe.

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,150
So the father has a problem.

19
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,380
How does he solve it?

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,800
Option 1: you consult with the family and if they do

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,160
not change their position, you put them under pressure.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,670
Does that help?

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,880
Probably not – Option 2: change the agenda and create a multi-issue

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,560
game.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,020
A multi-issue game means: One,

26
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,500
widening your agenda – it is not just about the holiday;

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,810
two, asking the other players to come up with issues

28
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,340
that matter to them – in view of the wider agenda.

29
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,979
These issues could be: rules on going out,

30
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,530
the chores rota, whether or not to have a pet,

31
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,780
the summer holiday, the skiing holiday?

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,409
Perhaps someone wants to pass their driving test,

33
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,620
visit some famous museums.

34
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,630
Each of the players must have a list of issues that are attractive.

35
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,560
There must be something in it for them – there needs to be a perspective of gain.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,870
But the list can also include issues that the players actually strongly oppose.

37
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,260
The youngest daughter would really like a great skiing holiday in Italy,

38
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,799
but is completely against having a pet – so there is some potential gain and pain on the

39
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,159
agenda.

40
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,680
This is the multi-issue game.

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,420
The focus is no longer exclusively on the question of whether this family goes to America.

42
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,769
That would be a single-issue game, an either/or game.

43
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,379
A single-issue game provides a strong incentive for conflict.

44
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,829
You are either for the holiday or against it.

45
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:59,109
A multi-issue game provides an incentive for cooperation.

46
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:05,349
A multi-issue game has five potential effects: A multi-issue game is an incentive for the

47
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,950
parties to sit down with each other.

48
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,430
To begin a process of negotiation.

49
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,959
If the father invites his eldest daughter to a family consultation with just a single

50
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,200
issue on the agenda, there is a strong incentive for the daughter

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,859
not to attend.

52
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:22,549
Why should she?

53
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:25,129
There is nothing in it for her.

54
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,629
But with a multi-issue agenda, the situation is completely different – there

55
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:35,529
is something in it for her and if she refuses to engage in this process of negotiation,

56
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,760
others will gain and she will not.

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,499
And when you have entered into a process, it is not easy to use the exit option - to

58
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:45,590
leave the process.

59
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,879
A multi-issue game provides an incentive for playing the game of give-and-take.

60
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,790
As I said, a single-issue game is an either-or-game – you

61
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:01,709
are either in favour or against the issue and this almost always leads to conflict.

62
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,379
A multi-issue game creates much more room for manoeuvre – the game between the actors

63
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,379
gains more space and flexibility.

64
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,579
A multi-issue game includes incentives for cooperation.

65
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,780
What happens when the players in the multi-issue game have reached decisions?

66
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:23,400
A multi issue game creates changing coalitions.

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,560
For each issue there will be a different coalition of supporters and opponents.

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,750
There is a decision about the pet – the father and mother are in favor,

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,560
the children against.

70
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,650
A decision about the skiing holiday, with father and his daughters in favour and

71
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,780
mother and son against.

72
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,430
A decision on rules about going out, with the father,

73
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,530
eldest daughter and son in favour and the mother and second daughter against.

74
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,289
Changing coalitions create dependencies – when it comes to the pet,

75
00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:00,440
the father and his daughters disagree, but when it comes to the skiing holiday they

76
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,060
agree.

77
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,690
If the daughters need their father’s support to make the skiing holiday happen,

78
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:13,599
they know that they will need to collaborate with their father when it comes to the pet.

79
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,939
In a single-issue game, the players can of course also reach a decision.

80
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,699
It will be a compromise, with little room for maneuver for players

81
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:25,789
– ultimately there is only one issue on the agenda.

82
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:33,250
None of the players get his or her way and both parties can therefore be disappointed.

83
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,810
In a multi-issue game, there are many more opportunities to reach

84
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,590
a beneficial decision.

85
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,530
Smart combinations of issues can also be made, as a result of which the ultimate compromise

86
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,080
is more favorable – You can pass your driving test during the holiday,

87
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,680
or visit a famous museum and use the money that you save to spend on the skiing holiday.

88
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,319
Finally, a multi-issue game promotes learning.

89
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,889
Because there are so many issues, a lot of combinations are possible.

90
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:10,349
Some of these combinations will come as a surprise to participants in the multi-issue

91
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:10,889
game.

92
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,360
They only discover that these combinations are possible and attractive during the game

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,219
itself.

94
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:22,360
When these attractive combinations arise, this can result in players changing their

95
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,759
preferences.

96
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,479
Perhaps the father will give way on his preference for the East Coast during the process and

97
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,419
learn that other combinations of issues are also attractive.

98
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,300
A skiing holiday, including a day spent on cultural activities,

99
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,439
for example.

100
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:51,289
Multi-issue games promote learning processes.
