I am standing here in the cold of Amsterdam.

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,110
Welcome to week 4 of the MOOC Leadership for Engineers!

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,360
In the first two weeks of this MOOC we looked at leadership in a complex,

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,520
networked, and interdependent world with unstructured

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,410
and wicked problems.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,010
We showed that leaders, in order to deal with this reality,

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:32,090
need to move from a mindset of project management towards a mindset of process management.

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,000
At the end of week 3, you started looking at yourselves.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,460
You identified your strengths, passions and formulated your personal charter.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,750
This second part of the MOOC was really about YOU.

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,960
In this third part of the MOOC we will bring the CONTEXT and YOU together.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,719
In this week we will present a number of leadership models.

12
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,500
We’ll show what works and what does not work in these models.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,450
We will also present a leadership model that we believe is right for this day and age.

14
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:16,970
We’ll offer you concrete suggestions on how to develop this leadership style.

15
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,479
My colleague Dena and I very much look forward to working with your this week and see you

16
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,290
