We are here today with Peter Zeeuw van der Laan to talk about behavioral change and to

1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,160
understand how we can apply it to become better leaders.

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,580
Peter is an entrepreneur, very experienced in behavioral change techniques.

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,610
He has applied a lot of these techniques to his on life Peter welkom.

4
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,180
Thank you.

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,410
Our participants have by now identified some of the changes that we want to apply to their

6
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,180
own lives.

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,180
Where do they start?

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,180
If you want to start to change your own behavior.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,070
It is very important to first to understand the concept of willpower.

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,340
Research has established that willpower behaves as a muscle:

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,750
if you use your willpower you exhaust your muscle of willpower.

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:57,480
Or to frame it differently you can see willpower as a sort of reservoir of self-control.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,449
Every time you do something that requires willpower or self control you deplete the

14
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,430
reservoir.

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,300
If it’s a reservoir with a limited amount of willpower or self-control,

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,200
I can imagine that you want to apply it in the best possible way,

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,979
to get the best outcome out of it.

18
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,530
How do we do it?

19
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,500
The best way to change you behavior, given this concept of willpower,

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,040
is by creating new habits or new rituals.

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,030
A habit or ritual is an action that you do automatically,

22
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,490
therefore it does not require any willpower or self-control,

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,220
you just do it without thinking.

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,549
Luckily, there is a lots of research available on how

25
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:48,970
people can change their habits or rituals.

26
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,720
Tony Schwarz has made a very useful checklist for this.

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,369
Let me illustrate this checklist with a personal example of a situation in which I was able

28
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,090
to change my behavior.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,590
I had some back problems and therefore I had to work less.

30
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:20,819
The first  check was about creating an ambition that is on the one hand very realistic but on the

31
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,909
other hand it is also motivating enough to get you exited.

32
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,109
What I decided up on was to finish every day at six.

33
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:33,409
This was realistic as well as motivating.

34
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:42,919
The  second check is about how you define it.

35
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,799
It should be very precise and very specific.

36
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:51,650
In my case finishing every day at 6 is neither really precise nor specific.

37
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,709
It more an outcome than actually doing something.

38
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,120
Therefore I framed it as: “Start every day with those tasks that needed

39
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,879
to be get done that day, instead of doing something else”.

40
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,230
That is specific enough to get me going.

41
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:17,749
So for instance not starting with fun email or going on Whatsapp?

42
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:20,389
Start with the task at hand in the morning.

43
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:20,980
Yes exactly.

44
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,439
That is a good point.

45
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,469
That is also where to third check is about: You need to understand what are you going

46
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:29,730
to resist, when you are implementing this habit.

47
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,430
Because typically you already have some type of behavior.

48
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,849
You need to be conscious: What am I not going to do and what am I going

49
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,930
to do instead.

50
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,439
That is check number 3.

51
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,790
Number four is more about understanding what are other commitments that I made,

52
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,069
that I now need to compete against.

53
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:57,730
For my case I was also committed to professional excellence or doing a good job.

54
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:03,729
Sometimes I thought at six o clock, if I work on this a little bit longer this

55
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:04,749
will be better.

56
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:10,019
That were the sort of internal conflicts I had to resolve before I could implement my

57
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,189
new habit.

58
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,689
That is number four.

59
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:19,859
Number five is about understanding that you can only implement one significant new habit

60
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,270
at a time and that this takes time.

61
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,000
This typically takes about 30 days.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,530
I can imagine that it is quite hard to do that 30 days.

63
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,040
It is very important that you realize that this is a struggle.

64
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,630
It is not going to be easy and there are going to be instances where you not complying with

65
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,820
your new habit.

66
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,260
You need to except that and cut yourself from slack and just start over again.

67
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,870
Until you can do it without thinking, it just takes some time.

68
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,350
So at the first day of the 30 days it takes a lot of willpower and self-control to conscious

69
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,130
choose something else and you say that in the cause of the 30 days it becomes less difficult

70
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,240
It becomes more as a ritual.

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,560
It’s more in your system and hence after 30 days is going to be fully ingrained and

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,389
than you can move on to the next thing you want to change.

73
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,180
– Yes – I understand this be still it sounds very difficult.

74
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,220
Do you have any other thoughts or advise for us?

75
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,470
Yes, you can become more strategic about your reservoir

76
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,110
of willpower.

77
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,120
To give you an example you can think about, what are the situations that are typically

78
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,040
requiring my willpower, which are not really essential to my life

79
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,190
and than trying to eliminate those situations.

80
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,760
In my case: Every morning when I got up I would have a

81
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,610
full range of serial options.

82
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,420
One of them was really healthy and the others were very unhealthy.

83
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:55,970
Every morning I would require my self-control, I would tap into my reservoir of willpower

84
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:04,310
to make the right choice about my breakfast, while it was not really a useful decision.

85
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,340
What I did was, I eliminated all those other options.

86
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,890
I got rid of them; I did not buy them anymore so that I only

87
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,140
had one type of serial in my house.

88
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:19,620
This is allows me to use my willpower of implementing new habits.

89
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,570
Thank you Peter that sounds like a very good checklist that we can start working on.

90
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,860
We will do that with the participants.

91
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,190
They will take one thing that they want to change and they will try to follow the checklist

92
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,770
and apply it.

93
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,020
We will see what comes out of it.

94
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:47,949
Thank you very much for your time and I wish you a wonderful day.
