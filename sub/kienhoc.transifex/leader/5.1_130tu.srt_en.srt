Hi guys.

I just want to thank you for your very active participation in our course.

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,070
We have very vivid discussion on leadership.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,390
We have a very lively Facebook group and we all,

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,359
the staff, we all appreciate your participation very

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,150
very much.

00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,410
I also would like to draw your attention to the follow up of MOOC.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,000
We are working on a profEd on engineering and leadership.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,120
We will send you some information about our profEd in one of the coming weeks and maybe

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,440
that interests you and maybe you will take the decision to enroll for that course as well.
