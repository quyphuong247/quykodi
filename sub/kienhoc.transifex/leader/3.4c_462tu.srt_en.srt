We talked earlier about our freedom to choose between stimulus and response.

1
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:14,590
However, it sometimes doesn’t feel like we have this

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,019
freedom.

3
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:20,150
There are these moments when someone acts in a certain way and you automatically get

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,140
into protection mode.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,869
These situations are sometimes called hot buttons.

6
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,039
Or, more scientifically,

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,539
we say that an amygdala hijack occurs.

8
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,050
An amygdala hijack can occur when a threat is perceived.

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,519
This can be minor or major, physical or emotional,

10
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:43,069
depending on the person and situation. Take the following example.

11
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:47,789
You are tasked with an initiative that will take you a lot of work.

12
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,629
The value of this work is unclear, so you ask why this initiative is pursued.

13
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,829
You colleague reacts angrily to your inquiry.

14
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,459
In this instance, you might feel threatened.

15
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:07,710
It sounds like another time I had to put all my energy into a pointless piece of work.

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,350
Because of this perceived threat, your amygdala might kick in and take over

17
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,079
your behavior, eliminating your usual freedom to choose your

18
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,920
response wisely.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,500
Your amygdala might go on the offensive, overstating the case or raising your voice,

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,850
creating tension between you and your colleagues.

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,009
Only 6-10 seconds later, you come back to your senses.

22
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,299
Your neocortex takes over.

23
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:38,060
However, you might regret what you have said and have

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,320
seriously damaged the relationship with your colleague. This phenomenon is called the amygdala

25
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,710
hijack.

26
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,340
The amygdala hijack is triggered by a perceived threat.

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,090
This can be a real life threat, or a coworker reacting angrily to your question.

28
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:01,999
The only way to come out of the amygdala hijack is by activating the neocortex. Let’s now

29
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:06,139
dive in how you can prevent this scenario and create an alternative,

30
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:08,289
desired scenario.

31
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:14,480
The key is realizing that you are feeling threatened early on and keeping your neocortex

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,200
in control.

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,840
You can do this by pausing and asking yourself rational questions.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,379
Then you can decide on an appropriate action, leading to a more desired outcome.

35
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:34,260
Let’s now do an exercise to discover and anticipate your own hot buttons and amygdala

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,030
hijacks.

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,730
Think about a situation in the past 6 months where you did something you immediately regretted.

38
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,629
Deconstruct the situation: was there a perceived threat?

39
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:48,420
When did you start to feel this emotion?

40
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,150
Why did you feel threatened?

41
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,390
What did you do?

42
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,799
What were the consequences?

43
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,159
Now think about what you would have liked to have done.

44
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,060
At what moment should you have paused?

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,500
What should have been the question to ask yourself?

46
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,709
What should have been your response to the situation and what would have been the probable

47
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,799
outcome?

48
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,319
Now think about the future.

49
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,360
What kind of situations are prone to similar amygdala hijacks?

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,879
What should you do to prevent them?

51
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:29,529
Write down your findings in your workbook.
