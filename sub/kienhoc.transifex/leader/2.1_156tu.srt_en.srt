Hello students, welcome at the second episode of our MOOC

1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,630
Leadership for Engineers.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,910
So where I am at, I am at Scheveningen.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,960
Which is the beachside area near the campus of the TU in Delft.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,369
We are very pleased to see that you’ve already started some interesting discussions on the

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,239
discussion forum and that you are really grasping the materials.

6
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:28,019
We are also pleased to see that you’ve started to introduce yourself to each other through

7
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,399
the world map and through Facebook.

8
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,719
And if you’ve not yet done that, introducing yourself,

9
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,719
please do so because it is very nice to see where you all from.

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,050
So what are we going to do this week?

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,859
We are going to work on mindsets and on strengths.

12
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:46,109
So have fun with that.

13
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,660
But, before we are going to introduce you with

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,730
the materials we have a little exercise for you on leadership styles.

15
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,610
Enjoy, and see you online!
