Our world is an increasingly uncertain place.

1
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,160
We face complex, global challenges such as:

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,880
the pressures on natural and food resources; our ecological footprint and climate change;

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,450
regional instability and security concerns; access to healthcare and education,

4
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,930
and social disruption and technological change.

5
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:37,120
It has become clear that political institutions alone are not capable to address these complex

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,260
trans-national issues, as they are fragile,

7
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,840
captive to special interests or too local.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,170
In this interconnected world, political institutions need to work together

9
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,780
with businesses.

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,970
Businesses are increasingly expected to meet the ‘triple bottom line’ of social,

11
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,120
environmental and financial performance and to respond to the concerns of stakeholders:

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,649
people who gain from, or are damaged by,

13
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,170
organizational actions.

14
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,890
This organizational consideration for people, planet,

15
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,939
and profit is called corporate social responsibility.

16
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:18,950
Organizations are in desperate need of leaders who can carry this responsibility for people,

17
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,810
planet, and profit and can foster long-term relationships

18
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,009
with multiple stakeholders.

19
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:29,889
Leaders who make long-term sustainability of our world a top priority and who are able

20
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,289
to address all challenges.

21
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:36,799
Stated differently, organizations need sustainable leaders.

22
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,369
Fortunately, modern world knows many leaders who are not

23
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:45,179
solely inspired by a constant push for the creation of shareholder value.

24
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:48,189
Who sincerely want to contribute to a larger purpose,

25
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,590
while still making a handsome living.

26
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,179
Who are very capable of balancing short-term and long-term priorities and have the competencies

27
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,899
to be – or become - sustainable leaders of the future.

28
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:06,069
And engineers might be a large part of this population… We are now ready to introduce

29
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:09,069
the concept of sustainable leadership.

30
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,760
Sustainable leadership can be described by three groups of competencies.

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,520
Competencies consists of knowledge, skills,

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,250
and attitudes.

33
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,370
We will now take a deep dive into the three competencies of sustainable leadership:

34
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,459
These are: Relationship-building,

35
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,879
Systems thinking, Sustainability mindset
