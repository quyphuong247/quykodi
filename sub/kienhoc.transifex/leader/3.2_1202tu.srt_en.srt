Participant 1: Shut up [laughs]
Participant 2: What? Wait, wait.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Participant 3: Oh he's gonna be so embarrassed.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,600

Julian Huguet: What makes you happy?
Having fun?

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,339
Hanging out with friends?
Delicious food?

6
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:29,679
Making money?
Well consider this. Psychologists have scientifically

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,040
proven that one of the greatest contributing
factors to overall happiness in your life

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,680
is how much gratitude you show.
Yup. Think about that.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,940
Go ahead and marinate on that for a second.
You can thank me later if you want.

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,710
It will make you feel better according to
this study.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,490
You go ahead and click on it and read it if
you want.

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,970
Or, you can keep watching because we read
it, we thought it might be fun to test out

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,260
for ourselves.
We gathered a selection of volunteers to act

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,100
as our subjects.
First we gave them a test.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,620
They didn't know what we were looking for.
But they gave us a pretty good idea of their

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,739
current level of happiness.
We asked them to close their eyes and think

17
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:05,009
of somebody who was really influential in
their life.

18
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,560
Somebody who did something really amazing
or important for them.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,369
We had them write down as much as they could
about why this person was so important.

20
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,140
Now a lot of them thought at this point the
experiment was over until we really put them

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,299
on the spot and tried to get them to call
that person and read what they wrote about

22
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,229
them.
Thank you Jessica. We are going to have to

23
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,759
have you call your mother.
So who was that right person for you?

24
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,810
Participant 1: The person is my sister Erica.
JH: We're gonna give Erica a call.

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,009
Participant 1: [laughs] Okay.
JH: Who'd you end up picking?

26
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,869
Participant 3: Friend of mine, Greg Haines.
Participant 4: Her name is Dora.

27
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,889
Participant 5: My college accounting instructor.
JH: Really! Is this someone you're still in

28
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:39,240
touch with today?
P 5: No I'm assuming that he is passed on.

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,139
JH: That's a shame.
P5: To the great beyond.

30
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:44,310
JH: You up for it?
P3: Um, uh yes.

31
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,560
JH: What would you say if we called up Dora?
P4: We can try but she lives in Britain.

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,009
JH: In Britain?
P2: I don't know her number by heart, this

33
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,090
is awful.
JH: That's fine, I don't know my mom's phone

34
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,090
number by heart.
P5: If it's true that those who are gone

35
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,649
on are looking down on us, maybe he'll recognize
he is great.

36
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,689
[on phone]: Hi sweetheart!
P2: Hey how you doing. Um you gotta second?

37
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,600
Where you at, the hotel?
[phone]: I am, I'm in the hotel. You scared

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,510
me when you asked if I had a second, I thought
something was wrong

39
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,470
P2: No I'm on this little TV show and they
told me to talk about the person that influenced

40
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,000
me the most, and I picked you and they're
making me call, they're making me call you.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
[phone]: Oh wonderful!
[phone dialing]

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
[voicemail]

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,030
[phone dialing]

44
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,090
P1: Oh come on.
[phone]: Hello?

45
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:50,090
P1: Hi! Erica, it's me.
P2: Alright so I gotta read you this paragraph,

46
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,780
can you hear me?
[phone]: Yes I can. Go ahead sweetheart.

47
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,010
P2: Alright. The person that influenced me
the most would be my mother, Marlow Dawson.

48
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,070
She is a single mother of two, she is a very
hard-worker and dedicated to her family.

49
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:11,070
P3: Hey Craig, this is Lowy. Um, this is gonna
be a funny little voicemail so I hope you

50
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,800
enjoy it.
P4: I'm so sorry for calling you at 4 o'clock

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,580
in the morning!
P1: I have to read this to you okay? You can't

52
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,630
say anything or I don't know. You can respond
but, I probably will just keep going [laughs]

53
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,860
okay?
[phone]: Is everything okay?

54
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,470
P1: Yes! But I have to read this out loud
to you.

55
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,200
P5: The person who has had the biggest impact
on my life, outside of Jesus Christ who is

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:41,200
responsible for my existence, was my college
accounting instructor. He had a joy and enthusiasm

57
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,070
for his job like no other teacher I have ever
known.

58
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,150
P2: I love her to death, and she keeps me
going with positive talk, she is a woman that

59
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,500
knows what she wants and won't give up until
it is achieved.

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,500
[phone]: Oh pumpkin, I don't know what to,
I'm about to cry because that's so beautiful.

61
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,500
I have to say that's just wonderful.
P3: I first met Craig on an independent feature

62
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,860
film set in Whitefish, Montana. I recently
have been sending Craig a lot of positive

63
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,819
thoughts as he suffered a series of health
problems. Despite his medical problems, he's

64
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,889
continued to work and take pleasure in the
small things in life like sitting quietly

65
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:25,670
with his wife Jeanine on the porch.
P1: Erica is my older sister and my best friend.

66
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,220
Sometimes it even feels like we are twins!
She is my number one fan and my number one

67
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,040
supporter. She makes me happy because despite
all my mistakes and my decisions, she still

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,910
loves me no matter what.
P4: Your friendship is everything. And you

69
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,180
are one of the most important person in my
life.

70
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,340
P1: Even when she has a kid and many children
I will love her more than her kids! Okay,

71
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,880
maybe not. I will never forget when she flew
3000 miles at the drop of a phone call to

72
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,800
save me from a break-up.
[phone]: I'm being blessed by having a son

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,800
like you. I love you.
P3: Bye!

74
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,000
[phone]: Why did you do this to me?
P1: [laughs] I don't know because they made

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,560
me do it!
P4: Thank you for picking up, bye sweetie!

76
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,680
P1: And then they're like here you're gonna
write this letter and then I wrote like this

77
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,120
whole long-ass letter which you know I don't
write. And then all of a sudden they're like

78
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,000
"hey guess what you're gonna call her and
you're gonna read her this letter and it was

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
like what the [expletive] [laughs].

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,200
JH: Before we let them go we gave our subjects

81
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,800
one more happiness test. Now we mixed up and
rephrased the questions so they didn't know

82
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,560
they were taking the same test twice. For
those who took the time to actually write

83
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,840
something down but couldn't make the phone
call for whatever reason we saw happiness

84
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,870
increase between 2 and 4 percent. Good, but
not exactly mind-blowing. Now for those who

85
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,980
actually picked up the phone and personally
expressed their gratitude, we saw increases

86
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,980
between 4 and 19 percent. So either way! Expressing
your gratitude will making you a happier person.

87
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,610
But you want to know something really interesting?
The person who experienced the biggest jump

88
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,139
in happiness was the least happy person who
walked in the door. What does that mean? That

89
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:24,340
means if you're having a particularly tough
time, trying this out will more likely have

90
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:31,340
a greater impact on you. Trust me! I'm in
a lab coat. In fact, while you're at it, film

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,430
it and upload it to us and we'll do something
awesome with it. I'm Julian and this has been

92
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,919
