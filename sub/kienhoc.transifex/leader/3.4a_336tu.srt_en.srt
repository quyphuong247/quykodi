Grab a piece of paper and imagine the following scenario.

1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,510
You have worked 6 months on a top priority project for the CEO.

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,269
Today you are presenting your recommendations to him,

3
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:19,160
along with his top team.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:30,359
Thank you for your report and your presentation.

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,230
Peter will talk to you about everything you brought up.

6
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,760
We will consider it.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:56,850
I see you soon.

8
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,090
How did that go?

9
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,350
Could you imagine the situation and what you would feel like?

10
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,560
What would be your thoughts in such a moment?

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,190
One way to think about this is as follows: The CEO left because he was irritated by my

12
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,760
presentation.

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,930
I am not smart enough to give this presentation.

14
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,970
In fact, I think I do not have what it takes for my

15
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,570
position in general.

16
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,720
Now my career at this company is in jeopardy.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,900
This is a pessimistic view of what happened.

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,570
Exaggerated?

19
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,670
If this would happen in real life, a lot of people would feel like this.

20
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,840
However, there are other ways to view the event.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,479
He listen!

22
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,520
I had to go.

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,640
I had to talk to John, cause John really need talking to.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,830
He was very much against to your ideas.

25
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,010
I think they are great.

26
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,350
I thought your report was sublime.

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,260
I thought your presentation was very skillful, excellently done.

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,119
But john had to be talk to.

29
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,030
John is onboard now.

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,080
So you can go ahead, you can make a plan and start implementing

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,950
your ideas.

32
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,259
John and I will give you all the backup you need.

33
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:12,940
By simply reflecting on our ability to frame and reframe reality in any moment,

34
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,950
we are able to shift from default response to reflective action.

35
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,150
In short, it helps us become less reactive and more

36
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,599
proactive.

37
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,510
The key here is not to become an unrealistic optimist,

38
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,690
but to increase your awareness of how you are viewing a certain situation.

39
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,750
This can then help you examine the evidence for your thoughts and maybe shift to a more

40
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:46,760
realistic point of view.
