Before we introduce you to the concepts and theory of this topic,

1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,390
let us first explain where these ideas comes from and illustrate their power.

2
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,130
Let us talk about Viktor Frankl.

3
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,689
Viktor Frankl was a psychologist who lived around World War 2.

4
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:29,949
He was trained in the methods of Freud, that assumes that whatever happens in our

5
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:33,370
childhood largely determines the person you will be as an adult,

6
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,870
and there is little you can do about it.

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,920
If we put it into a diagram, it looks like this:

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,489
there is an impulse, and a determined response.

9
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,860
For example, if I hit you,

10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,710
you hit me back Because he was Jewish during world war 2,

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,399
Viktor was sent to the concentration camps, where,

12
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,850
needless to say, he saw and experienced terrible things.

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,620
It was in this environment that the deterministic view he had been taught was not correct.

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,789
His environment did not determine who he was and what he did.

15
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:14,450
He discovered that in the absence of freedom, the only freedom he had was to decide his

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,659
response to whatever happened around him.

17
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:25,500
He learned that there was a freedom to choose between stimulus and response.

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,070
If someone hits us, we have the freedom to choose our response.

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,939
We can for example turn the other cheek.

20
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,610
We can use our self-awareness, imagination,

21
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,170
conscience and free will to determine our response.

22
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,119
Leadership can be associated with responsibility.

23
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,950
Letâ€™s deconstruct that word: response-ability.

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,890
Our ability to determine our responses.

25
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,790
In short, for our development as a leader it is critical

26
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:06,049
that we understand and exercise this freedom.
