CEOs of large corporations have Boards and external advisors

1
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,900
(e.g. strategy consultants, executive search firms, accountants)

2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,699
who provide them with advice.

3
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,630
Actually, being able to ask for help and being open

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,570
to advice is a critical competency for leaders in this unstructured and ambiguous world.

5
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,910
It is just impossible for one person to know it all.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,340
Our advice to you is to appoint your own Board of Directors.

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,220
These may actually be multiple Boards depending on the issue you need advice on:

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,160
You can have mentors on life questions

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,500
(e.g.family members, friends)

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,540
You can have sponsors at your work, who would advise you about work issues.

11
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,780
Fitness trainers or sports coaches that help you stay fit.

12
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,960
In a Board of Directors, all members have a fixed term.

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,500
Thatâ€™s the period of time during which they serve on the board.

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,380
Members roll off and join the board depending on these terms.

15
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,430
The good news about your own Boards that you can define the terms of each of the members.

16
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:29,610
It is important to select your advisors carefully and to track if they still add value to your development.
