Of course, you need a project-management mindset if you

1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,879
have to manage complicated technical projects.

2
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,000
But it is not enough in a networked, dynamic world with wicked problems.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,340
That calls for a different mindset.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,340
We call this the process-managerial mindset – leadership is not,

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,340
or not only, a project,

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,370
but a process of aligning actors, finding out what the best solution for the

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:39,250
wicked problem is and being adaptive, in view of the dynamic nature of our world.

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,440
For someone with a project-based mindset, everything starts with a problem.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,280
This problem must be defined as precisely as possible.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,720
You are looking for the right problem definition.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,560
The more precise you are, the easier it will be to select the right solution.

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,720
But the leader with a process-based mindset knows that ‘the right problem definition’

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,600
often does not even exist.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,700
Problems are wicked, which means that different actors may have

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,350
very different views on what the right problem definition is.

16
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,730
If that is the case, you need to define the problems as broadly as possible.

17
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,369
The more precisely you define a problem, the more likely it is that there will be opposition

18
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:27,920
and that others will accuse you of being narrow-minded.

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,200
The more broadly you define a problem, the more likely it is that others will find

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,710
it sufficiently attractive to work with you.

21
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,330
Something similar applies to objectives.

22
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,830
People with a project-managerial mindset like to have clear goals,

23
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,010
because they provide direction.

24
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:51,310
But what is the risk of having well-defined goals in a networked world?

25
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,580
You lack resilience and are unable to adapt to changing circumstances.

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,299
You cannot learn – in the course of the multi-issue process,

27
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:07,710
unexpected opportunities may emerge that may also be attractive.

28
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,370
If you have a pre-defined goal and are single-mindedly focused on achieving that goal,

29
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,200
you will not see the opportunity and will not seize it.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,230
It is strategically clumsy to be very explicit about your goals.

31
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,739
It can make you less adept at playing the game.

32
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,510
The clearer you are about your goals, the easier you make it for your opponents

33
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,730
to block these goals.

34
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,780
The next phase is gathering information.

35
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,110
In the project-based mindset, your goals determine which information you gather.

36
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,599
Engineers often adopt a need-to-know approach to this – you need the information that

37
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:56,310
helps you to achieve your goals and the rest is information overload.

38
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,770
In the process-based mindset, the attitude to gathering information is often

39
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,610
very different.

40
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,360
You need to take account of a large number of actors and any information about these

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,520
actors and their problems can be of interest – especially if you wish to design a multi-issue game.

42
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,200
In fact, unnecessary information does not exist.

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,459
The more you know about the players, the better you can play the game.

44
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,450
And there is more here.

45
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,730
Someone with project-managerial DNA searches for the right,

46
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,730
objective information.

47
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,879
With a process-based mindset, you know that problems are unstructured and

48
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,370
that a lot of information is contested.

49
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,390
The question is therefore not, or not only,

50
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,200
what the objective information is.

51
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,400
It is not possible to remove the many uncertainties with information alone – after all,

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,090
that is often contested.

53
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,709
The question is how to get the parties involved to such a stage that they see the uncertainties

54
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:02,920
as a shared problem.

55
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,099
And therefore join forces to manage these uncertainties as much as possible.

56
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,180
How do you achieve that?

57
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,830
By making the process attractive for them.

58
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,620
When the process is attractive, has a perspective of gain,

59
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,759
actors will be willing to work together in managing uncertainties.

60
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,879
How do you make it attractive?

61
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:34,729
By ensuring that there is something in it for them – by means of a multi-issue game.

62
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:39,180
Then the solution can be designed by refining the information.

63
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,900
In the project-based mindset, the solution arises from problems,

64
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,869
goals and information.

65
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,759
First, there is a problem,

66
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,389
and we then we try to find a solution.

67
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,990
In the process-based mindset, that is often different.

68
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,389
There is a solution, and we then try to find problems.

69
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,909
Someone has a solution that he or she wishes to achieve.

70
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:03,509
Take our mayor, for example,

71
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:06,839
who wants to achieve a port expansion.

72
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,469
So what do you do next?

73
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:12,149
You look whether you can link other problems to the solution.

74
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:14,860
The port expansion can, after all,

75
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,539
also contribute to solving many other problems than the problem faced by the mayor.

76
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:21,849
Why would you do that?

77
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:26,699
If the mayor succeeds in linking her solution, the port expansion,

78
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,849
to other actors&#39; problems, she will probably gain the support of those

79
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,259
other actors.

80
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:34,969
Decision-making.

81
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:39,699
In the project-management mindset, you have analyzed problems,

82
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:42,149
set goals, collected information,

83
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:47,759
designed a solution, and then the time comes for decision-making.

84
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,389
This is an important moment – the go/no go moment.

85
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:57,169
In the process-management mindset, the difference between decision-making and

86
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:02,169
the other stages in the process is not so clear-cut.

87
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:08,279
Because of the multi-issue game, decision-making is actually a continuous process.

88
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,749
The decision is not made, it emerges.

89
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:16,869
Then there is this: anyone with a project-management mindset also

90
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:21,210
knows a large number of tools and techniques that are effective in a project.

91
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,879
The rule of thumb is: tools that are effective in a project do not

92
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,199
work in a process.

93
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,789
Take a simple tool: a deadline.

94
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,009
In a project, a deadline is an incentive to achieve something

95
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,580
on time.

96
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,689
But what happens if the mayor in our case study sets a deadline for all the other players?

97
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:46,639
For example, if she says that a decision must be made by

98
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,139
September 1st: Nothing.

99
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,689
Why should the other actors take any notice of this kind of deadline?

100
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,719
Even worse – the actors can ask themselves a simple question.

101
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,360
Who will have a problem on September 1st?

102
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
The mayor will, but her opponents will not.

103
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,819
Because they know that the mayor will have a problem,

104
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:14,699
the deadline could even serve as an incentive for delay.

105
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,789
Decision-making is followed by implementation.

106
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,129
For this, you mainly need a project-management mindset.

107
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:27,349
The final question is: what makes you successful as a leader?

108
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:33,110
What are the evaluation criteria for good leadership in a networked world?

109
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,939
The criteria for success in a project-management mindset are often threefold:

110
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:42,229
Have you achieved your goals?

111
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,229
Have you done it on time and on budget?

112
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,139
Of course, these criteria are not appropriate for a process,

113
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,360
in a networked world.

114
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,849
The first criterion: are you satisfied with what you have achieved?

115
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:03,550
You may have something different from what you were originally looking for – and the

116
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:12,020
question is therefore not or not exclusively whether you have achieved your original goals.

117
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,330
The second criterion: is there a trust among the other parties and

118
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,479
have good relationships emerged with them?

119
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,839
Remember that, in an interdependent,

120
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,649
networked world, you will encounter these other parties again

121
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:35,990
and you are dependent on the other parties.

122
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,000
If you have gained a lot but the other parties are highly disappointed – that can be extremely

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,310
damaging in future processes.

124
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,800
The third criterion: have you learned something?

125
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,560
If, through interaction with multiple parties

126
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,089
and by means of a multi-issue change process, you achieve what you wanted at the outset,

127
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,839
you have probably learned nothing.

128
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:11,220
Other parties can block your initiative but other parties and other issues can also improve

129
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,800
your initiative.

130
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:23,850
Then you will have learned something.
