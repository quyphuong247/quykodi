Leadership is always based on a vision.

1
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,250
A vision for the long-term.

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,930
A vision that is based on the big picture.

3
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,470
Leadership also calls for decisiveness.

4
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,310
Courage.

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,140
A can-do attitude.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,669
To transform vision into reality.

7
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:36,190
I am the mayor of New Portland, one of the largest cities on the continent

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,190
with one of the biggest sea ports.

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,910
The port is the region’s economic powerhouse and I have developed a vision for the port,

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,719
based on an analysis by one of the best consultancy firms in the country.

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,350
The result of that analysis were very clear.

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,449
If we want to remain the biggest port on the continent,

13
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,429
we will need to go offshore.

14
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:06,350
An offshore port is good for the economy.

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,700
It makes the area stronger and provides more jobs.

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,659
An offshore port is also good for the environment.

17
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:17,890
Because I will phase out the old, polluting inland ports.

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,829
They will be replaced by a modern, green,

19
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,740
offshore port.

20
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,329
An offshore port is a very cost-effective investment – thanks to our location,

21
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:34,640
we need less funding for an offshore port than our competitors.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,440
In the year ahead, I will transform this vision into reality.
