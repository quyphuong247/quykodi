Let’s have a look at the fourth model: servant leadership.

1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,100
This is a very popular concept now.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,080
But ask yourself the question: does this style work in a world of political

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,410
game playing?

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,140
The following clip is an example of servant leadership.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,060
Let’s have a quick look.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,951
My role is to listen to all of you so I understand your priorities and your worries.

7
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,930
I want to be of service to you so we can jointly create a climate of mutual respect where we

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,730
can all flourish.

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,879
Your growth is my true measure of success.

10
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,259
Leadership is a gift and is given by those who &quot;follow&quot;.

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,539
Your talents and interest should be your guiding principles of where your heading.

12
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:01,350
I strongly believe in the power of teams and in the power of your dreams.

13
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,870
I need you to help me see things from your perspective.

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,520
Servant leadership is about serving the needs of your people.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,220
However, one issue these leaders face is that their

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,980
people might not know what they want and, if they do,

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,950
they might want different things.

18
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,650
In addition, there is more focus on the quality of the

19
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,570
relationships and less on delivering results.

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,990
We want both quality relationships and results.
