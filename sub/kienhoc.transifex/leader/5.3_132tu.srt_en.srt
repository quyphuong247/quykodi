What the framework really does is provide you with a picture of all the relevant criteria

1
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,420
for your next job.

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,320
Think about it:

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,640
What is your Edge: the things you are really good at.

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,070
Flow: what you enjoy doing.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,600
Context: the environment you want to work in.

6
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:29,209
Legacy: what you want to build during your career.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,050
The next step is to start brainstorming about your options.

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,300
The question is: which jobs meet at least some,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,470
or most, or even all of these criteria?

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,600
This is what we call a search strategy.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,559
Based on some 100 career counseling discussions using this framework,

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,620
my insight is that Context is often the most helpful entry point for the generation of

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,500
career options, as it is the dimension that forces you to

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,780
be very specific.
