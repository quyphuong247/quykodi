00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,530
Previously you have been infused with the complexities of leadership in a networked world.

1
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,620
Also you have seen leadership is highly contextual.

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:22,670
A good understanding of who you are can help you to understand in what context you are

3
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,060
most likely to flourish.

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,250
It also helps you to live your life, rather then being lived.

5
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,890
Many senior leaders take the time to reflect on the complexity of the world they faced

6
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,160
with and also on who they are.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,690
What their strengths are and what their weaknesses are.

8
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,700
What leadership means for them personally.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,500
In this part we will try the impossible.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,370
In a very short period of time we aspire to help you learn more about yourself and you

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,600
will do this by writing your personal charter – a self-determined reference guide that

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,760
might help you throughout your life.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,189
Around the globe, many people including business and society

14
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:10,060
leaders go on “coaching classes” or “leadership development courses” to develop their personal

15
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,969
vision or spend months, sometimes years of reflection to discover

16
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:16,979
what they want in life.

17
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,770
Personal leadership is a 40 billion euro industry globally ranging from one-on-one personal

18
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,229
coaching with a professional coach to multi-day programs like “leadership trails in nature”.

19
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:34,369
While it will be very hard for us to offer you a similar experience without face-to-face

20
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,630
contact or a personal development coach.

21
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:45,329
We aspire to be the first online course to help you discover more about yourself and

22
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:47,599
your mission in life.

23
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,979
But even if we can’t offer the same as “in-person” leadership journeys we are certain that the

24
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,770
topics of this chapter can help you start the discovery.

25
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,849
We will take the time to look inwards, and to find out what kind of leader you want

26
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:03,729
to be.

27
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,329
What drives you?

28
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:06,130
What are you good at?

29
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,630
We will ask you to write down everything that you learn about yourself,

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,250
in order to develop your “personal charter”.

31
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,570
To help you during this journey you can download the “workbook” called “Reflections and

32
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,950
Personal Charter”.

33
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,650
After that, we will switch the focus from “understanding

34
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,700
yourself” to “leadership habits and rituals”.

35
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:36,720
We will apply a set of proven tools of effectiveness to further develop your leadership style,

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,470
focusing on increasing positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions.

37
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,640
We will look at the future.

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,190
We will explore the principles of how to create lasting change in your personal behavior.

39
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,110
And there will be time to revisit your Personal Charter.

40
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,580
Let’s get started.

41
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,010
In my years as a strategy management consultant I have worked with many teams from different

42
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,480
companies with different cultural backgrounds.

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,790
At the start of working together as a team we used to do “team learnings” – a session

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,560
where we would align our ideas on what a successful outcome of the engagement would be and also

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,670
how to approach it, but we would also take a moment to share with

46
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,090
the team what every individual wanted to learn.

47
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,010
And interestingly, whenever I asked the questions “what are

48
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:36,180
you good at and what do you want to develop”, the majority of the people had a hard time

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,170
articulating their strengths and how to apply them in their work streams clearly,

50
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:48,590
whereas almost everyone could clearly articulate the things they were less good at or wanted

51
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,260
to develop.

52
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,580
Interestingly, research shows the importance of strengths

53
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,560
above anything else.

54
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,510
Let me give you a couple of examples.

55
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,880
Researchers looked for the strongest predictor for high performance teams.

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,060
The answer?

57
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,680
The number of team members that indicated they are using their strengths every day.

58
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,289
Another research study quotes the observation of bowling teams in 1982.

59
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,160
They focused on two teams.

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,029
Team 1 was shown a video highlighting only mistakes in previous games.

61
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:28,520
Team 2 was shown a video highlighting only successes.

62
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,740
In fact, both teams got better.

63
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,360
But the team that saw the video with the successes, improved twice as much as the other team!

64
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Furthermore, this research shows that people grow the most

65
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,919
in areas in which people already show high performance to begin with.

66
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,210
When we are children, we find this very logical.

67
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,999
Anna is good at math, so she finds it easy to learn the new mathematics

68
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:54,439
material.

69
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,080
Timmy is good at English, and he also learns the new English material

70
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,900
more easily than new material in other courses.

71
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,699
But somehow we seem to forget this when we grow up.

72
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,159
However awareness, utilization and development of your strengths

73
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,039
is critical for adults too.

74
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,469
This is not to say that you should forget about your weaknesses,

75
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:17,400
of course not.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,840
It is good to be aware of your own weaknesses and even try to improve them.

77
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,979
Especially, if they are holding you back from using your

78
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:25,629
strengths.

79
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:31,620
But it is strengths where real performance and growth comes from.

80
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,639
And thus, we will focus on strengths for the remainder

81
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,599
of this part.

82
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:48,659
We will do one exercise - an online survey, where you will explore your own strengths.
