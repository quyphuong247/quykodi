Traditionally, leadership models are vertical.

1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,910
The leader has a hierarchical relationship with her/his followers.

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,630
The leader leads from the top and the follower looks up to the leader from the bottom and follows.

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,300
This does not work anymore in this extremely dynamic and networked world:

4
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,419
There is no way that leaders can know and understand everything whatâ€™s going on inside

5
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:31,439
and outside their organization.

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,820
Also Followers do not want to be told anymore what to do.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,860
And other stakeholders want to be engaged

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,470
in the decision making of the leader.

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,180
Consequently, leaders need to rely on their people and the

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,670
broader stakeholders around their business and engage with them at an equal footing.

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,710
Therefore, sustainable leaders need to adopt a more

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,660
horizontal approach.

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,210
They need to understand people across cultures, embrace diversity and build productive,

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,920
long-term relationships with key stakeholders through dialogue,

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,780
leading to concrete and positive results.
