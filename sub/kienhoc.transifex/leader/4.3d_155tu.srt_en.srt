After the competencies of Relationship Building and Systems Thinking,

1
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,580
we close with the third and most important competency which is the Mindset for Sustainability.

2
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,620
Sustainable leaders have a strong interior sense of purpose that grows into a sense of

3
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,170
purpose and mission for their organization.

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,450
That’s why we have spent so much time together developing your personal charter.

5
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,770
You identified your mission (why do you exist?) and your legacy (what do you want to build

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,130
and leave behind?).

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,150
Mission and legacy are elements of your purpose.

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,320
Sustainable leaders are oriented towards the long term.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,170
They feel an inherent motivation to meet the ‘triple bottom line’ of financial,

10
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,280
social and environmental performance or ‘people, planet and profit’.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,380
We summarize all these aspects under the header of ‘sustainability mindset’.

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,960
The core of the sustainability mindset is to move from the ‘me’ (i.e.

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,260
promoting one’s own interests) to the ‘we’ (do what’s good for all major stakeholders).
