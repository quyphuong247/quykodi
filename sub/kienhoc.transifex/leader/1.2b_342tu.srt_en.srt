I need your advice – we have still not built the port expansion.

1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,270
We are facing two problems.

2
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,980
The first is that I need central government support to fund my project.

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,439
But the minister responsible has serious doubts, because there are two other ports that also

4
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,800
have plans for expansion.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,489
She wanted to investigate every aspect in this matrix – long-term economic impact,

6
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:42,719
long-term environmental impact, effect on traffic flows and on recreation

7
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,140
and so on.

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,219
All of this research has now been conducted, but it has turned out to be full of uncertainties

9
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,050
and assumptions and the more research we do, the less we know.

10
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,190
In my view, the research shows that my project scores

11
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,960
best for all of these criteria, but others disagree.

12
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,320
Every time I cite a specific piece of research to prove that I am right,

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,070
the others pick holes in that research, arguing that it is poorly conducted,

14
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,630
that the data is inaccurate and the models ineffective.

15
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,350
The second problem is that I am confronted with as many as thirty stakeholders,

16
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,950
many of whom are tempting to prevent my project.

17
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:33,070
It is not in their interest, or at least that is what they claim.

18
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:38,479
I am certain that some of the players I need are actually playing a political game – blocking

19
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,590
my project to improve their own negotiating position.

20
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,979
The Lower Portland region, for example,

21
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,469
one of the economic powerhouses in the country.

22
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:53,219
I need their support – for them, it is a win-win situation but the governor

23
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,460
of the region is keeping his options open, simply because he probably wants to gain even

24
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,729
more.

25
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,600
My question to you is this: come up with a strategy to help me out of

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,789
this situation.

27
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,030
I have my arguments, reports and research,

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,370
but no one will accept the good sense of my specific arguments.

29
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,989
Plus, I am being confronted by all these stakeholders,

30
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,370
who refuse to cooperate with this project – worse than that,

31
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,769
they are playing political games.

32
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:36,190
What strategy will extricate me from this situation?
