The complexity of our world.

1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,710
Let&#39;s take a look at the context of leadership.

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,590
This context can be simple or it can be complex – which means that leadership can also be

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,980
simple or complex.

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,189
It is simple if you are at the top of the hierarchy.

5
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,869
Your world has a pyramid structure and you are the boss.

6
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,370
Other players depend on you.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,570
However, leaders hardly ever operate in hierarchies.

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,989
Most often, they operate in networks.

9
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:46,579
A network means that there are multiple players, often with opposing interests.

10
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,550
This is no pyramid, but rather a spaghetti-like structure of mutual

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,850
dependencies.

12
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,399
In a networked, interdependent world,

13
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,649
player A depends on player B, player B depends on player C and player C

14
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:01,260
on A and B.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,719
And so on.

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,000
What is the dominant management style of a leader in a hierarchy?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,530
Command and control.

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,910
Give commands and check whether your people follow them.

19
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,160
Does that work in a network?

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,910
In a networked world?

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,500
Of course not.

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,020
In this MOOC, we will therefore need to go in search of

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,440
an alternative management style.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Leadership is simple if problems are structured.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,450
A structured problem is a problem that has one right solution.

26
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,880
An example of that type of problem is 1+1.

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,069
Whatever your cultural background, or your political views,

28
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:38,080
1+1 is always 2.

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,090
However, many problems are unstructured.

30
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,700
There simply is no one right solution.

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,270
There may be all kinds of reasons for this: there is no unambiguous data,

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,500
no clear criteria to weigh up conflicting aspects of a problem,

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,200
the models we are using may be questionable.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,539
So what is the dominant strategy if problems are structured?

35
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,640
Management by expertise.

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,239
A leader is someone with the specific expertise to guide us in the right direction.

37
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,530
Someone with a specific vision.

38
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,420
But if problems are unstructured, this does not work.

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,910
Leadership is simple if the world is stable.

40
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,879
In a stable world, there are no major changes in the networks

41
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,430
and the problems and solutions also do not change.

42
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,960
But in most cases, the world is dynamic.

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,820
Networks change – one player may gain in terms of their power position,

44
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,360
while another loses.

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,790
New players may suddenly emerge.

46
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,350
And the definition of problems and solutions change.

47
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,150
We redefine problems or new innovative solutions emerge.

48
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,400
In a stable world, project management proves very useful.

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,000
You plan your activities and carefully implement them.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,360
Of course, that does not work in a dynamic world – so

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:03:02,830
we need to search for an alternative leadership style.
