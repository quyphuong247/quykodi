In this part, we’re going to explore four popular leadership theories.

1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,759
During our explanation and examples of each model,

2
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:20,020
I want you to consider the following questions :

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,430
In this model, what different types of behaviour have you

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,720
observed in the leader?

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,930
Imagine that you are part of this leader’s team.

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,820
As a ‘follower’, which behaviours worked for you?

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,989
Which behaviours did not work well?

8
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:39,750
Does this leadership style fit you as a leader?

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,420
Please write a few sentences about what fits and what does not fit,

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,829
given who you are.

11
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,809
How effective is this style is in a context of a networked and highly dynamic world with

12
00:00:52,809 --> 00:01:02,829
unstructured problems?

13
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:18,500
The first model is trait-based leadership - a theory that relates to the Hero leader.

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,550
The core belief of trait-based leadership is that one can become a great leader by emulating

15
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,880
the personal characteristics and behaviors of great leaders.

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,580
One can think of big heroic leaders such as Winston Churchill,

17
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:41,270
the former British prime minister during WWII, or you can think of Nelson Mandela,

18
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,830
the first president of South Africa after the abolition of apartheid.

19
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,770
A more recent example is Steve Jobs, the former CEO of Apple.

20
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,800
In the following clip we will illustrate the Hero leader using Steve Jobs.

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,410
Please carefully observe the behavior of Steve Jobs and how he is described by others.

22
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,729
My second story is about love and loss.

23
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,140
I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life.

24
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,480
Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20.

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,560
We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,940
the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.

27
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,690
We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier,

28
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,160
and I had just turned 30.

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,010
And then I got fired.How can you get fired from a company you started?

30
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,510
Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,420
was very talented to run the company with me,

32
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,880
and for the first year or so things went well.

33
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,560
But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,740
When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.

35
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,100
So at 30 I was out.

36
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,150
And very publicly out.

37
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,180
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,

38
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,790
and it was devastating.I really didn’t know what to do for a few months.

39
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,010
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down – that I had dropped

40
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,720
the baton as it was being passed to me.

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,100
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.

42
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,040
I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from

43
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,290
the valley.

44
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:30,380
But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did.The turn of events

45
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,960
at Apple had not changed that one bit.

46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,800
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,670
And so I decided to start over.I didn’t see it then,

48
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,930
but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever

49
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,680
happened to me.

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,930
The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again,

51
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,840
less sure about everything.

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,270
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

53
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,209
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT,

54
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,459
another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who

55
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,920
would become my wife.

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,709
Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film,

57
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,459
Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio

58
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,480
in the world.

59
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,410
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT,

60
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,789
I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is

61
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,669
at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance.

62
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:30,419
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.I’m pretty sure none of this would

63
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,800
have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple.

64
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,130
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

65
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,880
Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick.

66
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,530
Don’t lose faith.

67
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,610
I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.

68
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,910
You’ve got to find what you love.

69
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,820
And that is as true for work as it is for your lovers.

70
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,310
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,

71
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,740
and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.

72
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,810
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

73
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,570
If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.

74
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,380
And don’t settle.

75
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,620
As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.

76
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,699
And, like any great relationship,

77
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:16,820
it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

78
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,030
So keep looking.

79
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,760
Don’t settle.

80
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,740
Let us briefly reflect on trait-based leadership.

81
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:34,490
Steve Jobs is clearly a very impressive leader who had a significant impact on this world.

82
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,460
The trait-based leadership theory says that we can become a great leader by acting like

83
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,169
Steve Jobs.

84
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,960
The issue with this theory is that we are not Steve Jobs.

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,330
Being Steve Jobs probably worked for Jobs, but will it work for us?

86
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,840
And can we do it without losing ourselves?

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:05,889
Will our people trust us if we as leaders display behaviors that are not ours?
