1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,340
So how do I measure the quality of a forecast?

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,660
Well, we can think of it as a trade-off.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,130
And so if I think of my forecast here--

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,090
and I have a chart-- and the horizontal axis

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,390
is the forecast accuracy.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,380
So as I increase, this gets more accurate over here, right?

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,150
And less accurate down here.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,690
And you can think of the cost on the vertical axis.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,840
So we can think about a cost of errors in forecast.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,660
So as I increase my forecast accuracy

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,280
I expect some cost to go down.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,040
These are the costs of having to deal with low-quality.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,660
So the rework, removing some items, expediting items.

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,630
If my demand gets more accurate, then I

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,060
expect to have less products that become obsolete.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,790
I won't have to discount as much.

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,010
So I can think of a whole bunch of different error forecast

18
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,520
costs that are reduced as I improve

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,070
the quality of the forecast accuracy of my forecast.

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,110
Now at the other side, that a lot of people

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,490
don't think about, is there is a cost

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,846
of having more accurate forecasts.

23
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,220
And so some of these things would

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,790
be the cost of the system used.

25
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,640
You'd have a much more expensive system.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
But even more importantly, there would be a time aspect.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,230
It takes more time to produce this forecast.

28
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,470
So there's a delay in producing that forecast.

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,350
There's more time and energy spent

30
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,560
in producing that forecast as well.

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,880
Also, as I get more accurate forecasts

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,380
and spend more time on this they tend to get more nervous.

33
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,330
They jump around.

34
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,140
They're not as consistent.

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,470
And so the idea here is, there are

36
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,690
costs of spending too much time-- or an excess amount

37
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,380
of time on forecast accuracy.

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,690
So ideally, what you want to do is be somewhere in the middle.

39
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,830
And so you look at this total cost

40
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,170
and you say, OK, what's the region that I

41
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,720
want to be in in this acceptable region the middle?

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,550
You don't want to be too excessively over here

43
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,480
with your causal models, and you don't

44
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,850
be too overly naive in your models.

45
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,356
Now, this is just conceptual.

46
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,730
This is just a general framework.

47
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,430
But I think it's important to remember this.

48
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,280
Because we can get caught up in spending so much time

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,370
to forecast for forecast's sake.

50
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,910
And that's the idea of coming up with these really, really

51
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,950
intricate, detailed forecasts.

52
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,660
And we lose sight of what the cost is of doing that.

53
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,640
So let's return back to the idea of what is a quality forecast.

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,220
How can I determine if a forecast is good?

55
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,670
So what we want to end up with is

56
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,600
a metric, or a series of metrics.

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,430
And so let's do an example.

58
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,030
And this is a very simple example.

59
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,120
So time is on the horizontal axis,

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,960
and the vertical axis is the demand.

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,630
And so I have two forecasts.

62
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,590
The first forecast is my blue square forecast.

63
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,820
And for every time period you can see what they forecasted.

64
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,690
So for time period one they forecasted 900.

65
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,140
Time period two they forecasted 1,100.

66
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,320
Time period three they forecasted demand

67
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,780
would be back to 900, and so on.

68
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,480
Another forecast that was developed

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,870
is the green triangle forecast.

70
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,110
And they forecasted, or estimated,

71
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,980
that demand would be the same, 1,100, for every time period.

72
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,470
So these are the two forecasts.

73
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,050
So what happened?

74
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,180
Here's the actual.

75
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,470
These red circles are the actual demand values.

76
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,010
So the question is, which forecast

77
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,590
is better, the square or the triangle?

78
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,250
And so this gets to the heart of the question of,

79
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,550
how do you measure the quality of a forecast.

80
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,280
Because let's look at it.

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,410
They both have the same level of accuracy.

82
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,150
In other words, each of the forecasts,

83
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,160
whether it's the blue square or the green triangle

84
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,510
is exactly 100 units off from what the actual demand was.

85
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,910
So in each case I'm off by 100 units.

86
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,240
So which one is better there?

87
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,410
Another way to look at it though is the idea of bias.

88
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,250
And so what do I mean by bias?

89
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,930
Well, look at the green triangle.

90
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,640
It's always above the actual.

91
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,970
It's 100 units up.

92
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,110
So it's positively biased.

93
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,710
My forecast is always higher than the actual demand.

94
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,470
If I look at the blue squares, it's not.

95
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,400
There is no bias.

96
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,530
I'm equally above or below.

97
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,570
So the question is, which is better there?

98
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,399
I would argue that it's probably better to be not biased, right?

99
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,200
Because if I'm overly-biased then

100
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm always going to over-predict.

101
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,200
If I'm negatively-biased I'm always going to under-predict.

102
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,190
However, if I came into a situation

103
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,700
and I determined which would I rather

104
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,600
step into, a situation where I have

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,830
these blue square forecasts or the green triangles?

106
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,600
It's easier to fix a bias.

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,760
If I go in and see that I'm always over-biased,

108
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,980
over-predicting by 20%, that's an easy fix.

109
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,380
I reduced it by 20%.

110
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,170
And so I'd almost rather step into that to fix it.

111
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,560
At the end of the day though we'd

112
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,070
like to have an unbiased forecast.

113
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,210
So let's look at this in a little bit more detail

114
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,720
and define what we mean here when

115
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,920
we talk about accuracy and bias.

116
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,960
Accuracy is essentially the closeness

117
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,330
to actual observations.

118
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,830
The bias is, the persistent tendency

119
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,760
to either over or under-predict.

120
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,210
So we can think of these two terms as different dimensions.

121
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,500
And as they get more accurate, I don't necessarily

122
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,880
get less biased or more biased.

123
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,620
So there are two dimensions in forecasts.

124
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,160
So I can put these on a two by two.

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,390
And so I've got accuracy on the vertical,

126
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,380
and the horizontal is bias.

127
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,440
So in the best case, I've got a very accurate forecast.

128
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,190
I mean, these are my bullseyes, right?

129
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,400
All in the bullseye here, right?

130
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,360
It's tough to see red on red.

131
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,330
And they're not biased, in that they're all

132
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,004
pretty much solid in there-- as opposed

133
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:49,170
to something being accurate.

134
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,620
Again it's a nice tight spread.

135
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,600
But it's biased.

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,830
It's all positive and a little bit to the right.

137
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,420
Then I can think of having something that's not accurate,

138
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,320
right?

139
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,290
And not biased.

140
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,540
Because if I look at this it's evenly spread throughout,

141
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,960
but it's not accurate at all.

142
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,440
And then down here for this-- whoops, going the wrong way.

143
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,851
This last one, it's not that accurate.

144
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,100
It's still kind of spread out.

145
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,900
But it's biased.

146
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,240
Everything's shooting lower left.

147
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,680
So you can think about these two metrics, accuracy and bias.

148
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,160
And whenever we look at forecasts

149
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,680
we want to think about both dimensions.

150
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,561
They're not totally fungible.

151
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:27,060
They're different dimensions and you

152
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,650
want to capture and look at each one separately.
