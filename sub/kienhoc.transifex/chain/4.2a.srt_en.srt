1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,210
So now let's develop our first inventory model.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,480
We're going to develop the simplest form,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,507
but it's also one of the most commonly used,

4
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:09,840
and one of the most useful ones.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,470
And it's called the economic order quantity, or EOQ.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,590
So let's look at first the assumptions.

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,370
This is a big laundry list of assumptions we made.

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,550
And here's what we're assuming for EOQ.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,510
Let me highlight the critical ones.

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,000
The big assumption that we are making is in demand.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,465
We're assuming that it's constant, it's known,

12
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:30,140
and it's continuous.

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,490
It's a uniform level of demand.

14
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,310
Lead time in this initial model will be instantaneous.

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,700
When I place the order, it shows up.

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,290
All the items are independent.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,580
I'm constantly reviewing my inventory level.

18
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,420
I'm only looking at one location.

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,280
I assume I have unlimited capacity at this point.

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,130
No discounts, no shortages or stock outs--

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,190
that's a critical assumption.

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,240
Perishability doesn't exist, so things

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,280
can last forever if I want them to.

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,940
It's an infinite planning horizon.

25
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,200
So this means I don't have to worry about end effects.

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,110
I can develop a steady-state policy,

27
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,220
and what happens during one replenishment cycle

28
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,770
we assume will happen in every replenishment cycle.

29
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,600
So it's an infinite planning horizon.

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,240
We're only going to look at one item,

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,531
and we're going to look at a single stage of that item.

32
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:18,870
So like I said, it's the simplest case.

33
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,710
But as we'll see, it's very powerful.

34
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,980
So the notation-- nothing new here.

35
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,935
We talked about demand with the large letter

36
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:30,600
D, the variable or purchase cost, the fixed ordering

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,980
cost-- the c sub t, the holding charge is h.

38
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,640
We're going to mainly use the c sub e for the excess holding

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,030
cost, which is dollars per unit time.

40
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,700
We're going to look at Q. In fact, this is what we're really

41
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,470
going to be looking for, is this Q star,

42
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,470
which is the optimal replenishment order quantity.

43
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,320
We're going to be looking for how frequently it happens,

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,420
so how much time elapses between each order for that T.

45
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,440
That's called order cycle time.

46
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,940
And if you take the inverse of that,

47
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,880
you get the amount of orders that

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,490
happen over a period of time.

49
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,224
And we'll use these two interchangeably.

50
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:06,640
And we're going to eventually look

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,300
at the total relevant cost, and the total cost

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,760
of the different policies that we apply.

53
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,940
So one way to really get a handle on this

54
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,330
is to look at inventory charts.

55
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,830
And we did this a little bit before,

56
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,370
but let me build this one out.

57
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,050
So this is for EOQ, and we're assuming

58
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,140
demand is uniform and deterministic,

59
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,210
lead time is instantaneous, and whatever amount is ordered

60
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,870
is actually received.

61
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,440
So my demand is steady state.

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,460
So this is EOQ's main assumption,

63
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,160
that my demand is relatively stable and known.

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,380
And when I place my orders, whenever they are,

65
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,520
they're going to show up instantaneously.

66
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,170
So when I place the order here, it's

67
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,840
going to show up at that same time.

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,330
Remember, this horizontal axis is time.

69
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,210
And so my inventory on hand is going

70
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,640
to be this nice, familiar saw-tooth pattern

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,120
that we've talked about in the past.

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,560
And so when I look at and want to understand

73
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,570
what my average inventory on hand

74
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,420
is, because it's an infinite planning horizon,

75
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,440
I can just look at one replenishment cycle

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,340
and just look at this inventory on hand.

77
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,690
I'm coloring that part.

78
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,820
This is what my inventory will be.

79
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,660
So if I want to figure out what is

80
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,135
my average inventory on hand, I know from basic geometry

81
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:21,730
that it's going to be one half base times height.

82
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,500
Well, what's the base here?

83
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,747
Let's figure this out.

84
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:25,830
It's going to be one half.

85
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,590
The base is going to be one replenishment cycle.

86
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,890
Because it's infinite, right?

87
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,580
So I can do one and it will apply to all of them.

88
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,840
And what's my height?

89
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,530
Well, I'm ordering Q, whatever my order is.

90
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,820
So my average inventory for cycle stock--

91
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,770
that's what this is-- is just going

92
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,110
to be Q over 2, which is the area of that triangle.

93
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,730
So keep that in mind.

94
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,660
We'll use that in a few minutes.

95
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,590
But these inventory charts help us understand

96
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,140
how the demand, the ordering pattern, the lead time,

97
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,460
affect the average inventory on hand.

98
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,000
So when it gets down to it, what we're really

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,740
trying to figure out is the optimal policy.

100
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,620
And you can think of it as a choice between ordering,

101
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,120
say, with this green period, where every green T units

102
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,060
of time, I order this green Q amount.

103
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,269
Or do I order a smaller quantity, this little red Q,

104
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,700
more frequently?

105
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,290
So that's really, at the heart of it,

106
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,623
what we're trying to figure out.

107
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:29,700
Is it better to order once monthly, or a smaller

108
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,530
amount each week?

109
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,100
And so it's a trade-off between the two.

110
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,390
And what we're going to end up with is a policy.

111
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,100
And it's going to say something along the lines of ordering

112
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,190
Q star every period of time T star--

113
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,910
and I'll find numbers for those, obviously.

114
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,840
Or it might be in the case where I order Q star

115
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,970
when the inventory on hand is 0.

116
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,000
So for the green policy, I place an order here,

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,290
place an order here, my inventory goes down,

118
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,220
place an order here, place an order here, and so on.

119
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,620
So this is the ultimate objective

120
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,820
that we're trying to figure out, and the policy

121
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,540
that we're trying to determine.

122
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,850
So now let's look at the total costs,

123
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,040
so back to the four common components that we had.

124
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,920
And let's get a little more specific with them.

125
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,530
And I'm going to go through this total cost equation,

126
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,027
explain each term.

127
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:18,860
But I also want to make sure the units work.

128
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,250
So I'm going to use the following units--

129
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,970
U is for the number of units, or items.

130
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,600
My time-- I'm just going to do it as years.

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,840
So I'm going to use year for the time.

132
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,010
It's common, because you talk about your holding

133
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,320
rate per year, and things like that.

134
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,381
For orders, I'm just going to use O. And for the cost,

135
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,880
I'm just going to use a dollar sign.

136
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,210
It doesn't matter what the currency is,

137
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,804
but it just makes it a little simpler.

138
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,470
So let's go through each of these terms.

139
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,297
Let's start with the purchase, which is this first term.

140
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:51,880
And so what are the units going to be?

141
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,920
Well, it's cost is dollars per unit.

142
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,320
The D is the annual demand, units per year.

143
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,240
And so just looking at this, I see that the units cancel out.

144
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,530
And I end up with dollars per year, which is nice,

145
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,090
because this total cost equation I'm

146
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,990
trying to minimize the total cost, which is essentially

147
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,740
going to be in dollars per year for that length of time.

148
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,110
So now let's go to the ordering cost.

149
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,650
So same thing-- the ordering cost

150
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,306
is going to be the cost for each order, dollars per order.

151
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:26,680
And that's going to be multiplied

152
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,290
by the demand, which is units per year.

153
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:38,520
That's divided by the quantity, which is units per order.

154
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,950
So the units cancel out there.

155
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,650
The order would go on top, and that

156
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,870
would cancel out with here.

157
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,440
So again I'm with dollars per order.

158
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,760
So this D over Q is telling me the number

159
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,615
of times I'm going to place an order.

160
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:53,990
And so that will become important

161
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,640
as we go further along.

162
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,150
All right, let's talk about holding costs.

163
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,710
This is the third term.

164
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,810
This first value, c sub e is the cost of the excess inventory.

165
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,570
So it's going to be dollars per each unit per year.

166
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,450
So it's unit time.

167
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,790
Q over two is that the level that we said we'd

168
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,660
have-- that average inventory level.

169
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,530
And the units on this is just units.

170
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,000
It's not units per order.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,570
It's how much I'm expected to have.

172
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,980
It's a value.

173
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,100
It's not the order quantity, or quantity per order.

174
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,760
This always confused me when I was first learning this.

175
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,260
But you see if it's just units, it's

176
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,820
just the level of the inventory that we have.

177
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,810
It all cancels out fine, and it ends up

178
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,560
being, again, dollars per year.

179
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,400
The last term, the shortage cost,

180
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,090
which isn't going to be as relevant when

181
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,760
we talk about EOQ because we made the assumption there's

182
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,820
no stock outs, but let's just go through it anyway.

183
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,740
The c sub s is very similar to the c sub be.

184
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,620
And what it is, it's going to be dollars for every unit

185
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,630
that I'm short per year or length of time.

186
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,460
And then this expected unit short term

187
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,910
is just the number of units per replenishment cycle

188
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,290
that I might be short.

189
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,140
So you see that the inventory holding cost and the shortage

190
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,540
costs have a very similar structure.

191
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,085
One is measuring how much I have on hand,

192
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:18,710
and one is measuring the average amount

193
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,300
that I expect to be short.

194
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,790
So they're very parallel, and that will become important

195
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,950
in a lecture or two.

196
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,170
But again, units cancel out.

197
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,120
Its dollars per year.

198
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,409
So all the units work for this, and so we get this total cost

199
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,679
equation.

200
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,950
Now the question is, of these elements,

201
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,480
which ones are relevant to the quantity decision

202
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,510
that I'm making?

203
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,659
Because as you can see by the function,

204
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,470
it's the total cost as a function of Q.

205
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,870
So the thing I'm trying to determine is q.

206
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,950
Everything else is an input.

207
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,350
So what's relevant?

208
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,030
Well, it's only relevant if I can control it,

209
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,060
and it impacts my decision.

210
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,380
So if Q was not in the individual term,

211
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,040
it doesn't impact my decision.

212
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,700
So if I look at this first term for purchase orders,

213
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,990
does the amount I buy change how much it costs per item,

214
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,840
or how much my demand is going to be?

215
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,630
No.

216
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,410
So therefore, it's not relevant.

217
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:16,040
Purchase cost is not relevant in this inventory model.

218
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,540
What about for the ordering cost?

219
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,340
Well, yes.

220
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,020
The ordering cost will change as Q gets bigger or smaller,

221
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,540
so that stays in.

222
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,490
What about the holding costs?

223
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,680
Well, same thing here.

224
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,940
It changes as Q changes.

225
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,000
Shortage costs?

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,020
No.

227
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,910
So we can say that for total relevant costs for Q,

228
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,820
the two terms that matter the most are this first term, which

229
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,800
we're calling the order costs, and then the second term, which

230
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,540
is going to be the holding cost.

231
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,060
These are the two critical values, or cost components,

232
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,620
that we'll trade off.

233
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,100
So before we go into the analytical derivation of how

234
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,890
we come up with this EOQ, or the economic order quantity,

235
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,310
let's get some intuition.

236
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,840
Let's look at a simple example.

237
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,520
And we'll do this a couple times.

238
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,700
And again, what I put in the top right here

239
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,090
is your total relevant cost equation as a function of Q.

240
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,230
This first thing is my ordering costs-- the number of orders

241
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,540
that I expect in the course of that time, that year,

242
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,100
and the cost for each one.

243
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,130
And this second term is my holding cost-- however

244
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,710
much inventory I have on hand times

245
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,290
the cost of holding each unit for that period of time.

246
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,650
So I have this-- so I give you some values here.

247
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,960
Demand is 2000 units per year.

248
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,610
Cost of placing an order-- remember,

249
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,510
that's c sub T-- is $500 an order.

250
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,710
The cost of the product, c, is $50 per unit.

251
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,480
And the holding cost is $0.25 of the unit cost per year.

252
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,960
Think of that as the hurdle rate, the capital cost.

253
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,910
So what does that mean the c sub e will be, the cost for excess?

254
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,390
Well, it's simply going to be 50, the cost of the item,

255
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:04,910
times 0.25, which equals 12.5-- $12.50.

256
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,960
Now, I give you the selling price, but does that matter?

257
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,140
No, it's irrelevant.

258
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,890
It's a red herring.

259
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,890
So that doesn't matter at all.

260
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,970
We'll talk later when price matters,

261
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,230
but for this, it's a total minimal cost.

262
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,500
Because I'm assuming for my relationship

263
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,430
here, whatever I charge doesn't have an impact on my inventory

264
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,400
replenishment policy.

265
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,000
So now let's map these.

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,280
And what I have here on the horizontal axis

267
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,680
is the order quantity from 100 to 700 units per order.

268
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,090
And on the vertical axis, I have the total relevant costs.

269
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,120
And this is in dollars per year.

270
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,940
And so what I want to do is see how these costs trade off.

271
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,520
So this first line is the ordering cost.

272
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,480
And you can see that as Q increases,

273
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,960
ordering cost decreases.

274
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,867
And it's not linear, just like you would expect.

275
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:58,950
You look at this equation.

276
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,060
As Q is very small, this is going

277
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,690
to be a very large number.

278
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,800
And as it decreases, it's going to get smaller and smaller.

279
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,300
And it will eventually be asymptotic to 0.

280
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,030
What about the holding costs?

281
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,194
Well, these will increase as Q gets bigger.

282
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:16,110
That means I'm going to have more hanging out.

283
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,484
I'm going to have more inventory.

284
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:20,350
So the holding cost increases with Q,

285
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,560
and it increases linearly.

286
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,360
And so if I add these two together

287
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,520
to get my total relevant cost-- not

288
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,990
my total cost, my total relevant cost-- I look for the minimum.

289
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,150
And this will be what we call Q star.

290
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,150
And that's what we're going to try and find out.

291
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,750
The critical takeaway, though, from EOQ is it essentially,

292
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,410
we're trading off two conflicting costs--

293
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,680
the ordering costs, which decreases as the Q gets bigger,

294
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,420
and the holding cost, which increase as the Q gets bigger.

295
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,400
And we want to find the point where the combination of those

296
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,654
is minimal.

297
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,070
And as you will see, that actually

298
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,300
happens where they are equal to each other.

299
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,280
And we'll talk more about that in a little one.

300
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,159
