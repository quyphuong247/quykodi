1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,560
OK.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,520
So let's talk about subjective and objective approaches.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,590
You can break most forecasting approaches

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,350
into either being subjective or objective.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,750
And it's kind of an arbitrary distinction,

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,650
but you can think of subjective approaches are generally

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,360
used more by the sales and marketing side.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,320
And the objective ones are used predominantly

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,570
by the production inventory.

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,750
But that's not always true.

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,580
But when you look at subjective, you've got two types.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,120
The first is judgemental.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,240
And the underlying concept here, or the thought is,

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,610
that someone somewhere knows what the demand is.

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,720
So you want to get their judgment because someone knows.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,310
Maybe their collective judgment.

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,380
They know what the demand will be.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,880
So this shows itself in sales force surveys.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,290
So when I was working in software

20
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,950
we would ask the sales reps what they expect the demand to be

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,890
because they're the closest to the customers.

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,560
We think that they have a better idea of the situation.

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,760
So we're using a subjective, judgmental approach

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,124
to trying to forecast demand.

25
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:05,540
Now, of course, they're sales guys

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,000
so we divide their estimate by two.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,160
But still, it's the idea of, you think

28
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,470
the judgment is out there.

29
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,950
Someone somewhere knows.

30
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,470
You can also use a jury of experts, or Delphi techniques.

31
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,510
And this is a more refined technique

32
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,050
of using a jury of experts.

33
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,320
We'll talk about that in a future lecture in more detail.

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,610
But the idea of these judgemental approaches

35
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,110
is that the thought is, someone somewhere knows.

36
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,830
And we want to use a technique to pull that answer out.

37
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,840
The second class of subjective forecasting approaches

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,430
is the experimental.

39
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,240
And so in the experimental approaches

40
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,700
the idea is that we want to sample

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,000
local and then extrapolate.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,600
And so we do a customer survey.

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,000
We get an idea of, what's the favorite flavor

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,910
or color in a small group.

45
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,190
And then we extrapolate what we think the demand's going to be.

46
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,960
Same thing with focus group sessions and test marketing.

47
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
It's all the same thing.

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,670
We test on a small group.

49
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,230
We see what their demands are, what their preferences are,

50
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,139
and then we extrapolate that to a larger market

51
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,080
to get our full-fledged demand.

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,900
So that's one category of forecasting.

53
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,060
Then we can look on the objective side.

54
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,870
And on the objective side we have

55
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,160
these causal, or relational, models.

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,140
And the idea here is that we think

57
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,500
there is an underlying cause or reason for demand,

58
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,320
and we can capture that and measure that and thereby

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,330
determine what the demand is going to be.

60
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,350
Because we think that the demand is driven, or caused by,

61
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,060
some underlying factor.

62
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,300
So think about-- if I think the demand for umbrellas

63
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,830
is driven by weather I can track the weather

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,980
and get a sense of what my demand is going to be.

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,480
Or if I think that the demand for diapers

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,330
is going to be driven by the birth rate

67
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,740
then I can track leading indicators

68
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,700
of births in an area, and then that'll

69
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,650
give me a proxy for the demand for diapers later on.

70
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,670
You can think about it for sports jerseys.

71
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,294
And we'll talk about this in an example

72
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:05,970
in a few weeks, where the demand for National Football League

73
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,360
sports jerseys is really driven in a large amount

74
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,010
by the record of that team, how well they're

75
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,540
doing- winning or losing.

76
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,110
So in any of these you think there's some underlying factor

77
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,240
that you can measure and capture ahead of time

78
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,660
to give you an indication of what demand is going to be.

79
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,210
And we'll focus in on this mainly

80
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,940
with econometrics models, like regression

81
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,260
where you try to capture these independent variables

82
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
onto this dependent variable, this demand.

83
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,990
Because you're saying the demand depends

84
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,210
on these underlying factors.

85
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,100
And there's other models, leading indicators,

86
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,370
input-output models.

87
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,310
But the idea here is all the same.

88
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,920
There's something that's driving demand,

89
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,020
and I can measure that and capture that ahead of demand,

90
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,351
and that will give me a proxy for what the actual demand will

91
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:53,460
be.

92
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,030
Then the final category is time series.

93
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,930
And we'll spend a lot of time on this one.

94
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,780
But it's very different from the causal approach in that,

95
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,550
you don't know what the underlying cause is.

96
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,390
You don't care.

97
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,560
It's a black box approach.

98
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,637
What you're doing is, you're looking at patterns.

99
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:12,470
And we'll talk about the different patterns.

100
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,990
But you can think of seasonality, trend, or level.

101
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,048
So you look at these patterns and you see how they apply.

102
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,589
Because you're going to say, OK, what

103
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,760
patterns happened in the past?

104
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,620
That's probably going to help me predict the future.

105
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,830
But this is very different from a causal analysis.

106
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,305
Because on the causal approach I'm identifying the drivers

107
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,180
and I'm mapping them.

108
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,520
I'm tracking them and using those to predict the demand.

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,950
For time series I'm just looking at the patterns.

110
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,740
I don't know why the seasonality is there,

111
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,940
I don't know what's driving the trend, I don't care.

112
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,474
I look for the pattern and I think it's going to repeat.

113
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,890
So what are we going to do for these different approaches?

114
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,130
Let me just clean this up a little bit.

115
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,630
We're going to spend a lot of time on time series

116
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,360
because it's very commonly used in supply chains.

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,760
We'll spend a little bit of time on causal,

118
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,880
and we'll talk about that.

119
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
And we'll spend some time looking

120
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,794
at these subjective metrics specifically

121
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:09,460
when we look at new product introduction

122
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,450
because that's when they're widely used,

123
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,820
because for new products you don't have a history of demand,

124
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,380
which you need some kind of history for the causal models.

125
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,220
You've got to develop a relationship.

126
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,490
And you need some kind of history for time series,

127
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,890
because you've got to look for those patterns in time.

128
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,680
If you've got no history, you can't really do a time series.

129
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,630
You can't really do a causal analysis.

130
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,830
So that forces you, a lot of times,

131
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,870
to use the subjective metrics.

132
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,860
So these are the four classes of approaches

133
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,140
and we're going to focus in a little bit on each of them.
