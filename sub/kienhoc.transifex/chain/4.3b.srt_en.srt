1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,020
All right.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,070
So let's get started.

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,720
And we're going to start with non-instantaneous lead time.

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,220
I'm going to say, as I said before, I'm

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,550
going to change only that the lead time is a constant.

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,670
So when I place an order, it doesn't show up right away.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,820
It takes a little bit of time.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,840
So let's look at the inventory charts.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,770
Demand is still deterministic and uniform.

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm going to place these orders, and now,

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,600
instead of receiving it instantaneously,

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,490
when I place the order here-- just draw this down--

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,376
it looks like the lead time, L, is

14
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:37,750
going to be that much longer before it actually shows up.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,380
So L is the length of time it takes between the order being

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,980
placed and it being received.

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,600
And so what this is going to do to my inventory chart

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,580
on the bottom, it's going to create two types of inventory.

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,650
So the first is Inventory on Hand,

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,090
which we've been playing with.

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,790
That's the solid green line.

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,520
And this is simply how much inventory i have on hand

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,740
and it's going to show up exactly when it's received.

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,470
So it's the same saw tooth we've always had.

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,410
However, when I place an order, right now,

26
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,080
I've got this inventory.

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,310
And it's this inventory here in under this dotted line.

28
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,950
And this is known as my Pipeline Inventory.

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,630
We talked about this earlier, in one

30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,170
of the first slides on inventory.

31
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,520
And so this pipeline inventory is

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,970
inventory I placed an order for, and I committed to.

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,840
It just hasn't shown up yet.

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,300
So the question is how do I handle that?

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,710
How do I take that into account?

36
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,610
Because, as we'll see, I need to look at more than just

37
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,100
what inventory I have on hand, I need

38
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,490
to start looking at my whole Inventory Position.

39
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,170
And so let's talk about that.

40
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,250
So here's just a little blow up of the inventory chart,

41
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,350
and the horizontal axis, again, is Time.

42
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,120
The vertical axis is Inventory Level.

43
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,220
And we saw the two charts.

44
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
And what I did here in red is I just

45
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,730
overlaid what's known as the Inventory Position.

46
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,410
And it's simply equal to the Inventory

47
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,900
on Hand plus the Pipeline Inventory.

48
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,867
Now, later on, when we allow backorders,

49
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,450
it'll change a little bit because I'll

50
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,450
have to subtract off what's already been backordered,

51
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,720
and already being committed, and things like that.

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,040
But for right now, the Inventory Position

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,910
is simply the amount of inventory

54
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,970
I have on hand plus the amount that I've ordered and hasn't an

55
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,370
arrived yet, that's the Pipeline Inventory.

56
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,400
So the question we might want to ask--

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,230
what is my average amount of pipeline inventory?

58
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,260
And so what we're looking for is for one replenishment time.

59
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,980
Each cycle, I want to know how much of this pipeline inventory

60
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,620
should I expect to have?

61
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,150
Because now I've got two different types of inventory.

62
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,010
I've got that pipeline inventory that I just highlighted.

63
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,910
But I've also got this cycle stock

64
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,580
that we're all comfortable with this.

65
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,829
Let me just double-hatch that.

66
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,640
There we go.

67
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,030
So I've got these two different types of inventory.

68
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,580
And I can control them with very different managerial actions.

69
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,000
This is why we look at functional roles of inventory.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,344
So let's go in and let's try to understand what's

71
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:14,010
the average amount of pipeline inventory

72
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,910
I have during each replenishment cycle.

73
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:22,850
So we notice, during the length of this cycle, which is T*,

74
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,450
that the pipeline inventory changes.

75
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,660
There's two periods.

76
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,510
There's a period of time-- and let me just mark it here--

77
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,670
where I have no pipeline inventory.

78
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,170
Right?

79
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,628
Because nothing's been ordered yet.

80
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:36,590
And then I've got a period of that cycle time

81
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,510
where I have pipeline inventory.

82
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,330
So let's just break those in half and start with a time

83
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,670
when I'm in transit, when I have something ordered.

84
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,180
So how much will I have there?

85
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,450
Well I have Q*, because that's what I order each time.

86
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,616
We don't know how we're going to calculate that yet,

87
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:53,160
but when I place an order, I'm placing it for Q*.

88
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,650
And so the next question is how long will that last?

89
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,420
What percentage of time of the cycle will it be?

90
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,890
Well, if my T*, let's just say my T* is 10 days,

91
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,170
and my lead time, let's say my lead time is 4 days,

92
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,720
then I'm going to be in transit 4 out of 10 days or 40%.

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,880
So L/T* tells me the percent of that cycle time that I'm going

94
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,500
to have inventory in transit.

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,236
So now let's look at the second time.

96
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:25,610
And this is the time when I don't

97
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,900
have any inventory in transit.

98
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,600
How much will I have in pipeline?

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
0.

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,900
Right?

101
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,840
I'll have 0 because nothing's in the pipeline.

102
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,310
How often will that happen?

103
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,550
Well it's going to be 1 - L/T*, which in this simple example

104
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,570
would be 60% of the time.

105
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,960
So I just take an expected value here,

106
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,040
so for the time when I have inventory in the pipeline,

107
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,910
Q* times L/T*, and when I don't, and if I just carry it through,

108
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,230
what I end up with is my average pipeline inventory is D (the

109
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,450
demand rate per year), times L (my lead time in units

110
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:05,950
of year).

111
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,040
Always make sure the units match here.

112
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,520
But D times L tells me my average amount

113
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,070
of pipeline inventory for each replenishment cycle.

114
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,790
So what is my average inventory in the system then?

115
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,210
It's going to be that cycle stock, which we know very well

116
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,890
is Q/2 plus the pipeline inventory, DL,

117
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,030
and so now I know what my average inventory is.

118
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,655
And again, I've got two different types

119
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:34,280
of inventory, cycle stock and pipeline.

120
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,850
Now in real life, for pipeline inventory,

121
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,640
we might want to consider who owns it, when.

122
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,260
Does the vendor own it when they deliver it

123
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,550
or do you pick it up and take it.

124
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,690
But in this case, we always want to, since inventory is coming,

125
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,110
we want to consider it in our planning.

126
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,350
And so later on, we'll talk about different payment terms,

127
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,060
and what that means is, when you take

128
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,780
ownership of the inventory.

129
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,740
But from here out, until I say otherwise,

130
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,530
just assume that you're taking ownership.

131
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,480
You want to consider that inventory coming

132
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,770
into your pipeline when you manage your total inventory.

133
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,270
OK.

134
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,220
So let's go a little bit deeper.

135
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,984
And let's figure out: what's your new total cost function?

136
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,400
So this should look very familiar.

137
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,470
My total cost is a function of Q, my order quantity,

138
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,000
and consists of the four main elements-- purchase cost,

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,570
the ordering cost, cost per order times

140
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,880
the number of orders expected over the course of a year,

141
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,140
and then, I've got my holding cost.

142
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,410
But I've got two separate elements.

143
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,450
I've got my cost for holding an item for unit time for a year,

144
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,130
and this Q/2 is my cycle stock.

145
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,690
And this D/L is my pipeline inventory.

146
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,740
And then here I've got my shortage cost.

147
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,390
So the question is, what's relevant when I'm making

148
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,040
my decision for Q*?

149
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,940
So as I look through, is the purchase cost relevant?

150
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,440
No.

151
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,550
There's no Q in there.

152
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,690
So the purchase price, the purchase cost of each item,

153
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,300
does not affect what my Q is going to be.

154
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,160
Order cost?

155
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,550
Sure, that's still going to be relevant.

156
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,140
If I look at the inventory cost, well the cycle stock--- sure,

157
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,810
that's still going to be relevant.

158
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,230
But look at the pipeline inventory.

159
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,770
Does the length of the lead time impact what my Q should be?

160
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,940
Is there any relationship?

161
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,130
And the answer is no.

162
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,950
So the pipeline inventory is not part of the relevant costs

163
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,480
for determining what my optimal order quantity is going to be.

164
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,420
And for here, same thing here-- it

165
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,160
hasn't changed for the shortage costs,

166
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,740
plus we're still assuming there are no stock-outs.

167
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,570
So my total relevant cost is going

168
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,110
to be the same as it was when I had lead time of 0,

169
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,820
or instantaneous lead time.

170
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,460
So what's my new Q*?

171
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,950
Same as the old one.

172
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,730
It has not changed.

173
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,060
So lead time, constant lead time,

174
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,950
does not affect my order quantity.

175
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,680
What's my new optimal policy?

176
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,580
Well now, some things will change

177
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,712
because if I blow this up again-- and again

178
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:57,420
this is just a simple inventory chart-- I

179
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,870
got my inventory on hand, and then I've

180
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,250
got my pipeline inventory.

181
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:09,170
Again, pipeline, and then here, it's going to be cycle stock.

182
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,020
Let me just double hatch it.

183
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,460
And then my inventory position, which

184
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,370
is just the sum of the two.

185
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,190
And so my policy is going to look at-- I

186
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,540
want to determine WHEN I will place my order.

187
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,370
Well I know if I place my order here,

188
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,310
it will show up L units of time later.

189
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,980
And then what is that point in time?

190
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,649
How much inventory will I have left here?

191
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:33,690
What would this point be?

192
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,309
Well if my demand is at a rate of D

193
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,840
and it's going to L units of time,

194
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,360
then this point is simply D times L.

195
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,210
So my policy is going to change, and it's going to be:

196
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,980
Order Q* units (because that hasn't changed, right--

197
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,270
the quantity hasn't changed), when the inventory position = D

198
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,230
times L. Two things are different here.

199
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,420
One is "Inventory Position", not "Inventory on Hand".

200
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,460
Right?

201
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,569
You're adding IN the order.

202
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:05,360
What if you didn't?

203
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,560
What if you said this was inventory on hand?

204
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,050
Well then you'd keep ordering when

205
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,880
I'm down here because my inventory on hand

206
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,120
is still less than or equal to DL

207
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,220
while I'm waiting for something to come in.

208
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,140
So it's "Inventory Position", not "Inventory on Hand"

209
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,240
when it's = D times L, because you order then,

210
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,509
it'll show up in L units of time.

211
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:30,050
Now the other interesting thing to note is that I could still

212
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,690
have it as: Order Q* units every T* time periods (because

213
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,980
the next time I order is going to somewhere around here,

214
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,940
and this distance is still T*).

215
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,120
All I've done is shifted things left.

216
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,830
So what's the net effect here?

217
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,350
The big takeaway is adding in a lead time

218
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,410
does not change the optimal order quantity.

219
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,790
It does change the policy by changing

220
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,390
the timing of when I would place that order.

221
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,330
But that's it.

222
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,300
