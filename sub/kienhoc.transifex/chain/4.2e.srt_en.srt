1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,260
OK, so the key points from this whole lesson about introducing

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,930
economic order quantity, there's a couple things

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,070
you should take away.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,080
The first thing is the EOQ model:

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,010
yes, it has restrictive assumptions,

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,920
you saw the whole list of assumptions,

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,634
but it's still widely used.

8
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:18,050
And whenever you have a case where

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,400
you have relatively stable demand,

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,370
it's a good place to start.

11
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,340
The second thing is to understand

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,260
what the EOQ model is doing because it's

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,470
kind of a simple, simple example of what we're going to be doing

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,580
throughout any inventory model.

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,220
You're trading off two things, you're

16
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,880
trading off these fixed costs-- these order costs,

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,800
and these variable holding costs.

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,097
And whenever you have the "value of one

19
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:42,680
goes up as the other goes down" you're

20
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,240
going to find an equilibrium, and that's

21
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,190
what we're doing here.

22
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,650
We're trading off the fixed and the variable costs.

23
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,960
We also showed that the EOQ was really

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
pretty insensitive to changes, or errors, or bad assumptions

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,870
in the order quantity-- so I can round up or round down

26
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,070
order quantities.

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,110
The cycle time, we saw that it's OK to round those up

28
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,990
to more practical times.

29
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,920
Errors in forecasting, as well as errors in the cost

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,740
parameters-- whether it's the cost of the item itself,

31
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,610
the ordering cost, the holding cost,

32
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,870
or the cost of holding any inventory.

33
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,500
It's pretty insensitive to those, so start with it

34
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,850
and it's got that nice bathtub function, where

35
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,540
it won't be dramatically off.

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,790
The other thing that we really haven't talked too much

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,910
about but something you should take away,

38
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,760
is that the EOQ helps you focus in on different process

39
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,830
improvements, helps you focus where

40
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,750
you should maybe spend some time.

41
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,790
And you want to understand if you do some analysis,

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,580
how should I lower my c_t?

43
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,390
Is that going to drive a lot of costs?

44
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,550
Should I lower my cost of each item?

45
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,340
Should I change or look at how the interest

46
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,260
rate affects my costs?

47
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,410
So it helps you focus and determine

48
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,340
where the most bang for your buck should be.

49
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,350
And finally, the thing I want you to take away--

50
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,420
that I hope you take away is that EOQ

51
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,370
is a pretty good starting point, but it's not always a place

52
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,310
to end with.

53
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,110
So you start with it and then you take some other assumptions

54
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,037
into effect.

55
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:04,620
But it's always a good place to start,

56
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,920
it's kind of like Wikipedia-- you want to start there,

57
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,554
it gets you up to speed really quickly,

58
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:10,220
but you might want to go a little deeper

59
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,450
to find your final answer.

60
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,916
OK, so that wraps up this lesson.

61
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,040

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,270
