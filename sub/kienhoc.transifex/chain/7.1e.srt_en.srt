1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:01,740
OK.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,890
So let's find the optimal order quantity for the NFL Jersey

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,390
Problem using a data table.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,070
So I'm going to set up a data table.

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,190
And the version I'm going to show you is in Excel.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,950
And this is attached to the unit if you

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,850
want to follow along and see how the spreadsheet's set up.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,790
There's also a version of Libra Office in there as well.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,780
All the functions are the same.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,430
Data tables are a great way to test and see

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,400
different relationships for an equation.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,890
So all we're going to do here is try

13
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,240
for different values of x and q, demand and the amount I order,

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,020
what the profit function tells us.

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,020
What's the profitability if I order

16
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,630
a certain amount and a certain demand materializes.

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,660
So what I have here is my spreadsheet.

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,500
And up in cells B2 and 3, up here,

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,070
is the demand distribution.

20
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,320
Now, I put all my demand in units of 1,000.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,580
So my mean is 32,000 units over the eight week

22
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,260
period with a standard deviation of 11.

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,280
I've got my price per unit, $24 per jersey.

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,500
$10.90 is the cost per jersey.

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,590
And then, I have each of the columns

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,290
is a potential order size.

27
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,080
So this column is saying, what if my order

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,310
size is 24,000 units?

29
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:25,380
This column is, what if my order size is 27,000 units?

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,490
Then, I've got each row.

31
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,790
And each row in my data table represents

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,770
a demand that materializes.

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,330
So for example, this row --let me

34
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,570
see if I can circle that-- is what

35
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,690
happens if 2000 units of demand materialize.

36
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,060
And down here, this row, is what if 20,000 units of demand

37
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,340
materialize.

38
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,960
So each cell is essentially an instance

39
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,860
where I look at a certain quantity was ordered,

40
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,070
in this case 25,000 units, and a certain demand occurred,

41
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,580
4,000 units.

42
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,580
So this cell, which is cell E8, is essentially

43
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,900
telling me what is the profitability

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,580
if I ordered 25,000 of these jerseys,

45
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,990
but only 4,000 units of demand showed up.

46
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,020
And that this is in this cell is this profit function up here.

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,760
And it's just tied in to the quantity and to the demand.

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,040
Now, this is for each instance.

49
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,790
I now need to figure out, well, how frequently will that

50
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,780
happen?

51
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,100
And so what I've done for each one of these instances

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,610
of demand, because that's what's random, the demand is random.

53
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,860
The q is something I'm going to pick.

54
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,100
I'm basing this off the normal distribution.

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,050
So here in Column A, what I've done

56
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,990
is the cumulative normal probability.

57
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,980
And so, you see I'm just using the norm dist

58
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,840
function that we've seen before.

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,020
And so for this cell that highlighted,

60
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,880
it's simply saying, what is the cumulative probability

61
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,310
that I will receive-- that my demand will be at least

62
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,540
eight units, 8,000 units or less?

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,700
And that's going to be 1.5%.

64
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,280
And that's based off of the mean of 32,000

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,590
and standard deviation of 11,000.

66
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,130
Then all that I do for the probability of each

67
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,960
of these demand values occur is the difference

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,540
between the two cumulative values.

69
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,210
So look at the spreadsheet and you can see how that works.

70
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,770
But the net effect is that each cell tells me

71
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,950
what the profitability will be given

72
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,439
a certain demand and a certain order quantity.

73
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,480
Now, here's what the whole spreadsheet looks like

74
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,960
or a larger piece of it.

75
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,780
And again, I've got each column is one demand quantity.

76
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,880
So the one that I just highlighted

77
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,780
is where I ordered 24,000 units.

78
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,730
And then each row, again, is the demand that materializes.

79
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,940
So that first row, Row 7, shows all the profitability

80
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,020
if only 2000 units of demand materialized.

81
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,170
So I have that for a bunch of different demands.

82
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,430
And you can see that the probability for those

83
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,220
go up to 100%.

84
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,410
So I go up to 70,000 units, which

85
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,714
is pretty unlikely to get.

86
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,130
And then, what I'm doing here is I want to find out, well,

87
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,550
what's the expected probability if I order a certain amount?

88
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,920
So for this column, Column E, which

89
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,650
is when I order 25,000 units, I have each instance here.

90
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,009
But I want to find out what's my expected profitability.

91
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,550
And that's simply going to be the sum

92
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,250
product of the probability that each one of those demand

93
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,980
values happen.

94
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,530
And that's going to be multiplied

95
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,000
by the profitability of each one of those occurrences.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,250
So this sum product is essentially

97
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,210
finding the expected profitability

98
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,570
if I order 25,000 units.

99
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,100
And so if I look across here, you

100
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,940
can see that as I increase from 24,000 all the way up

101
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,200
to 33,000 units, that profitability is increasing

102
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,166
and it maximizes when I hit right around 34,000.

103
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,260
And you see I highlighted it green down here.

104
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,120
And then you can kind of see, as I increase further,

105
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,560
as my queue gets bigger, my profitability

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,860
starts dropping off.

107
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,050
And so what I have here is I actually

108
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,080
mapped this and charted this.

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,790
And so along the horizontal axis is simply

110
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,390
Row 5, which is the order quantity,

111
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,520
and along the vertical access is that bottom, Row 42

112
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,890
--let met just go back here-- this row

113
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:48,720
down here, this bottom row, that shows me the profitability

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,050
for each order quantity that I have.

115
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,540
So this is Row 42 from the spreadsheet.

116
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,190
And it's just showing my expected total profit.

117
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,970
And as it showed, is the total profitability increases,

118
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,170
peaks out at a certain point and then decreases.

119
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,200
And so the area to the left of that optimal quantity

120
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,680
is where I ordered too little.

121
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,110


122
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,080
And over on the other side is when I ordered too much.

123
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,350
And so what we're finding here is that data tables helping me

124
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,800
find the zone where that order quantity will be maximal.

125
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,300
And so data tables or data spreadsheets

126
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,700
are great ways to explore a problem.

127
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,250
What we're going to do next is look at the marginal analysis

128
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,020
to find an analytical form for finding q star.
