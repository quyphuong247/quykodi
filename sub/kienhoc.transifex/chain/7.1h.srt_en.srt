1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,170
OK, let's go over some key points from this lesson.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,940
And I think there's really three big ones.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,080
The first is that these Newsvendor problems

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,360
are everywhere.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,840
You see them wherever you have to make a firm

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,190
bet, in this case an Order Quantity,

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,070
in the face of uncertainty, in this case

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,030
uncertainty of demand, over a Single Period.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,110
You have no opportunity for replenishment

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,410
within that period.

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,720
And you see it in things as diverse as ordering

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,730
for fashion items, which have a set selling

13
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,080
period; perishable goods, which only

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,090
last a certain period of time.

15
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,870
To things that you wouldn't expect,

16
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,100
like the sizing of a private fleet,

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,400
whether to buy it yourself and have your own fleet

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,290
or use higher priced spot market.

19
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,750
Same thing for contracting.

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,705
We'll see later on how this same model applies

21
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:49,630
to different contracting relationships between vendors

22
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,820
and buyers.

23
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,870
You can think of it in terms of space missions,

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,660
where I only get to replenish a trip to the moon once right

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,484
at the beginning.

26
00:00:58,484 --> 00:01:00,400
So you can think of all these different cases.

27
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,090
We'll see this everywhere, the Newsvendor problem.

28
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,630
And what it's really doing is having this classic trade-off

29
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,140
between having too much -- so I have this Excess Cost,

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,000
the cost of having too much product there,

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,376
and trading that off with having too little, the Shortage Cost.

32
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,000
And the important thing to take away we

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,950
haven't really talked about too much

34
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,100
is that these have linear marginal costs.

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,330
We haven't gone into any non-linear marginal cost.

36
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,472
But generally, if you have linear marginal costs,

37
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:30,930
that's where this classic trade-off

38
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,920
can be measured using this model.

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,225
The last thing is that I think you need take away

40
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:37,839
is what the Critical Ratio is doing.

41
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,380
And hopefully that's the big takeaway

42
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,130
from this whole lesson.

43
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,460
And it's simply the ratio of the Cost

44
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,980
of the Shortage over the sum of the Cost of the Shortage

45
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,540
and the Cost of the Excess.

46
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,160
And that, for the Critical Ratio,

47
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,490
is determining what percent of the demand distribution

48
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,990
I should cover, or the probability that x, the demand,

49
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,940
is less than or equal to that Q that I ordered.

50
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,380
So these are the three big takeaways

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,160
that I think you should take from this lesson.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,680
And if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions,

53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,830
please use the discussion.
