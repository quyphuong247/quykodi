1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,570
So we've derived the EOQ.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,370
And we know how to find that given input data.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,200
So now we want to do is find out how sensitive the EOQ

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,930
solution is to changes or errors in our assumptions.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,730
So suppose we have a case where I used a wrong order quantity.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,550
My Q was wrong for whatever reason.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,650
Management decided to use something else.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,820
I made a mistake, whatever.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,150
So the question we want to ask is how much worse will my total

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,210
relevant cost be by using this wrong Q-- this Q here--

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,530
compared to the one that actually should have been

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,990
the Q*.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,170
And to do this, I just want to do a simple ratio.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,950
And my ratio is going to be my total relevant cost

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,960
equation, which is up here.

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,270
And I'm going to divide that by the optimal.

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,010
And we've already shown how we got that.

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,590
That's the optimal total relevant cost given the right

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,910
Q*.

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,320
So if I look at this ratio, and all I'm going to do

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,790
is do some algebra to clean it up a little bit.

22
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,090
I split this up and have the sqrt( 2*c_t*c_e*D) under each.

23
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,500
And then I'm just going to clean up and cancel some things out.

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,380
I'm going to multiply the first term by 1, sqrt(2) / sqrt(2),

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,560
because I want to get this 2 on the bottom of each term.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,720
Let's clean up a little bit more until I

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,070
get to something like this.

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,730
And all I did was take the 1/2's out and kind

29
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,290
of combine "like terms".

30
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,790
But I want you to notice something--

31
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,590
make sure you can do the algebra--

32
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:33,220
but this term should look very familiar, as should this term.

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,040
This is just Q*: sqrt(2*c_t*D / c_e).

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,810
And same thing, this is the inverse of Q*.

35
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,450
So a nice little term we get, a nice little relationship is

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,570
that the ratio of the relevant costs for the wrong Q compared

37
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,510
to the correct, optimal Q* is 1/2 times (Q*/Q + Q/Q*).

38
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,100


39
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,760
So what this allows us to do is to very quickly determine

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,260
how far off our error is.

41
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,600
In other words, if we make a mistake in Q,

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,479
how much of an impact will it have?

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,200
And the nice answer is: not that much!

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,730
So here's that same example we've

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,370
been playing with where the annual demand is 2,000 units.

46
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,940
The cost is $50 / unit.

47
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,490
The holding cost is $12.50 / unit / year.

48
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,150
And the order transaction cost is $500 / order.

49
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,690
And remember, we found Q* = $400.

50
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,930
And so all I did here was break out what

51
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,340
the ordering costs are, the holding costs

52
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,010
are, the total relevant costs, which

53
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,220
is just the sum of the two.

54
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,970
And then I did the ratio of the Q/Q*.

55
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,025
And for this, since this is Q*, we're just saying it's 1.

56
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:48,060
So we're just leaving it blank.

57
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,540
And then what the relationship of the total relevant cost

58
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,940
would be compared with the optimal would be.

59
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,980
So looking at this, I did it for different values of Q.

60
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,200
And so what happens if I ordered 50% less.

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
So instead of ordering 400 at a time,

62
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,410
I only order 200 at a time.

63
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,940
So this means I would order more frequently, but not as much.

64
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,510
So as you would expect, the ordering cost for that

65
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,660
go way up, because I'm ordering twice as often.

66
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,440
And the inventory holding costs go way down.

67
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,860
But the combined amount is, of course, greater than optimal.

68
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,680
You expect it to be greater, not equal to.

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,250
And how much is that?

70
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,210
Well, my Q is 50% smaller than my optimal.

71
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,630
But that's only a 25% error.

72
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,650
That's pretty amazing.

73
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,840
Let's look at the other way.

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,750
Suppose instead of ordering 400, I order 50% higher.

75
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,450
I order 600.

76
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,200
So now I'm ordering 50% more each time than I should.

77
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,490
Now, what this means is because my total demand doesn't change,

78
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,510
I'm going to be ordering less frequently.

79
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,770
So my ordering cost is naturally going to go down.

80
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,000
My holding costs is going to go up, because I'm ordering more.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,630
I'm keeping it there longer.

82
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,280
My total combined cost, of course,

83
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,520
is higher than the optimal cost.

84
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,350
So even though my ordering size is 50% higher than the optimal.

85
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:16,360
It's only 8.3% higher total relevant cost.

86
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,680
That's amazing.

87
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,610
So the whole idea-- I can be 50% off-- order 50% more

88
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,850
than I should in my order size-- and I'm only 8%

89
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,570
off in terms of my ratio of total relevant costs.

90
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,510
Which begs the question now, is it better

91
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,415
if my optimal quantity is something

92
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:35,790
that doesn't make sense, as much as is it better to order

93
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,190
a little more or order a little less?

94
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,510
Which is the better error to make?

95
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,670
Is it better to round up or round down?

96
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,610
And well, if we look at this, and we just plot the ratio

97
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,270
of Q/Q*.

98
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,180
So that's this horizontal axis.

99
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,100
It's just Q/Q*.

100
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,090
And the ratio on the vertical axis

101
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,170
is just the total relevant cost to

102
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,820
the optimal total relevant cost.

103
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,660
And then if I just do this for different values for Q and Q*,

104
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,190
you can see that the relationship is not linear.

105
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:16,080
And so here is-- if I order exactly the right amount-- if I

106
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,080
order 50% more, that would be this point right here.

107
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,830
And that's about-- what did we say?

108
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,360
--8.3 percent more in total relevant cost.

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,970
But if I do 50% the other way, that would be right here.

110
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,240
And that's about what?

111
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,210
25% higher costs, and this is because if you

112
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,740
think back to the EOQ relationship-- remember,

113
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,520
you've got the inventory holding cost here.

114
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,530
And your ordering cost kind of go like this.

115
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,470
They're non-linear.

116
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,020
Every time I go this way, I'm adding

117
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,370
a linear cost for holding.

118
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,970
So for holding cost, it doesn't matter whether up or down.

119
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,520
It's going to be the same amount,

120
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,810
because it's a linear function.

121
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,450
But for the order cost, as I go down,

122
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,400
it will decrease at a slower rate, than if I go up.

123
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Because I'm going up that steep part of the slope, where

124
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,750
I have that big fixed cost.

125
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,100
So that the answer is it's always better

126
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,580
to round up a little bit than to round down, because the way

127
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,070
that the non-linear order cost function

128
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,550
is compared to the linear holding cost function.

129
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,740
So what we saw is if I ordered the wrong Q,

130
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,320
generally the EOQ is pretty stable.

131
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,140
It's pretty stable.

132
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,760
So I can round things up a little bit.

133
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,580
And I'm still going to be in a pretty good solution.

134
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,260
But what about if my demand changes?

135
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,180
So what happens if I make a forecast,

136
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,425
and I have my demand forecast-- I do this ahead of time--

137
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:50,340
and out of that forecast, I make an EOQ based on that?

138
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,440
And that's this.

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,880
So with the best information I have at the time,

140
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,970
I forecast there's going to be 2,000 units out there.

141
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,190
And I base my EOQ off that.

142
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,620
But afterwards, at the end of year, I look back and say,

143
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,320
you know what, the real demand was

144
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,670
something totally different.

145
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,170
The actual demand.

146
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,700
And so the question is, if I go back and say, OK,

147
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,060
if I know what the real demand is,

148
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,780
and I calculated what the actual Q* should be,

149
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
how much of a difference will it make?

150
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,720
In other words, how much will the accuracy

151
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,130
of my forecast impact EOQ?

152
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,350
Well, let's take the same relationship we developed.

153
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,470
This is the total relevant cost with a Q versus the Q*.

154
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,660
And we showed how we got this relationship.

155
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,470
And you can see that this is the same thing--

156
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm just going to clean that up-- as Q*/Q.

157
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,330
And Q/Q* here is the same thing as the forecast,

158
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,550
which it turns out to be the incorrect Q,

159
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,490
versus the actual optimal.

160
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,370
So I can use this same relationship.

161
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,340
And so what I want to figure out though

162
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,240
is the relationship of the wrong D's,

163
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,900
because I want to see how bad my forecast is way off.

164
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,310
What's the effect?

165
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:06,140
So Q*a / Q*f is simply this term over this term.

166
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,200
Then if you look at it, everything cancels out, right?

167
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,760
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, except for the sqrt(Da)

168
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,420
/ sqrt(Df).

169
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,630
So this term, I can just substitute in.

170
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,020
And I end up with this relationship

171
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,020
that the total relevant cost for the forecast versus the actual

172
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,730
is 1/2 times the square root of the actual demand

173
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,150
over the forecast demand plus the square root of the forecast

174
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,640
demand over the actual demand.

175
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,679
In other words, the error is not going to be as great.

176
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,710
Because before we had it just Q*/Q, way up here.

177
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,419
And now, it's the square root of that.

178
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,710
So we know it's not going to have as much of an impact.

179
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,260
But let's just go through the analysis.

180
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,950
So this is the same example.

181
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,300
We should be getting very comfortable with this.

182
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,520
And we found out that if our actual-- because out of this,

183
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,470
we found-- we predicted our forecasted demand was 2,000.

184
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,980
If it actually was 2,000, then the ratio

185
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,160
of actual demand versus forecast demand, of course, is 1.

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,620
The Qa / Qf would be the same.

187
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,350
And there'll be no difference in terms

188
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,080
of the total relevant cost.

189
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,190
However, let's suppose, I was 50% off.

190
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,950
In other words, my demand was 50% higher.

191
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,900
It went to 3,000.

192
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,610
So my demand is 50% off.

193
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,450
I was 50% higher than what I thought it was going to be.

194
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,750
And then that means my Q*s are going to be off by about 22%.

195
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,520
But my relevant cost is only going to be off by 2%.

196
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,710
That's amazing.

197
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,120
And so let's go the other way.

198
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,740
Suppose for 2,000 I'm down 50%.

199
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,490
So that means my actual demand, let's say,

200
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,850
was 1,000, when I predicted it would be 2,000.

201
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,540
And so it's actually 1,000.

202
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,170
So my demand is half of what I thought it was going to be.

203
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,730
So my Q* was actually going to be about that 3/4 what it

204
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,230
should be.

205
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,460
But the error is only going to be 6%.

206
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,270
So what we've seen here is that the demand

207
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,100
is pretty insensitive to that.

208
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,620
So if I'm a little bit off, it's OK.

209
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,900
This optimal solution still works.

210
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,680
Now the critical thing here is I did this for demand forecast.

211
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,720
But, you know, it doesn't really matter.

212
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,110
Let me just clear this off, so you can see.

213
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,010
Let's say I wanted the c_t changed.

214
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,220
That I use a cost / order, but I was way off.

215
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,690
So my forecasted cost / order was way

216
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,450
different from what it actually was.

217
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,120
Well, I have the same relationship,

218
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,740
because everything else cancels here.

219
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,610
And so this would really just be the c_t

220
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,610
for the actual / the c_t of the forecast, and same thing here.

221
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,185
So this same relationship holds for whether I

222
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:46,900
have errors in my c_t, my c, my cost / unit, or my cost

223
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,930
for holding inventory.

224
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,040
So the net effect of this is that EOQ is very robust.

225
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,370
It's a great solution.

226
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,060
And it's known as a bathtub function,

227
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,010
because you look how flat that is.

228
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,090
It's very flat around the optimal.

229
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,609
So this is nice because you come up with a solution,

230
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:05,400
and if you're a little off in the forecast,

231
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,240
a little off in how you implement the Q, it's OK.

232
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,760
It's OK.

233
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,720
You're still within a nice optimal region.

234
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,390
The error won't be that great.

235
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,444
