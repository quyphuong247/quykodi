00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,850
Welcome to week 4 of SC1X Supply Chain Fundamentals.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,330
Now we're going to turn from doing forecasting, which

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,189
we spent the previous three weeks on,

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,260
and we're going focus in on inventory.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,740
So you'll see that the primary driver

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,230
for the way that you manage inventory for the most part,

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,740
it's a function of what you assume your demand is.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,770
If demand is very sporadic, if it's got a lot of randomness,

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,240
if it's steady state.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,290
Each of these assumptions will dictate the type tool or type

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,790
of method that you manage your inventory with.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,120
So let's start with a simple case.

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,190
Let's assume that I've got demand--

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,920
this is demand for my product, single item--

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,580
is known as deterministic and it's constant.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,230
So it's constant demand.

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,700
So what does this mean?

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,200
This means I'm going to place orders

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,820
at a certain period of time.

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,430
And I'm going to order a certain amount.

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,459
And I'm going to call that order quantity Q.

22
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,000
And we'll find out that's the thing we're really looking for.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,540
What is the best Q to use?

24
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,380
And you're going to find out that I'm

25
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,210
going to have to order this Q periodically.

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,180
And since it's a uniform deterministic demand,

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,530
these periods will be the same.

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,030
Makes sense because it's going to be

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,440
happening over and over again.

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,160
Now I place an order and then what happens?

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,090
Well, at some point I will receive that same amount.

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,140
And I will receive the same amount Q.

33
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,860
And so let me just draw those in.

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,500
And this is the product that I'm receiving.

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,940
And you'll notice that they aren't-- let me just do this

36
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,440
one.

37
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,010
If I draw this line down, it's not happening at the same time.

38
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,650
That's because we live in the real world.

39
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,210
And that's called your lead time,

40
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,590
L. So I have some lead time between when I place the order

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,279
and then when the product shows up.

42
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,570
And we'll play with this a lot.

43
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,510
This is transportation, this is the amount of time

44
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,093
it takes to actually make the product,

45
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:48,570
to do the order of the product.

46
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,480
All those different things go into that L.

47
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,340
But the end result here is I can see

48
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,310
how this affects my inventory.

49
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,330
So what I have down here in this lower chart

50
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,340
is what my inventory is going to look like.

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,760
And so what will this look like?

52
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,850
Well, I'm going to receive this order,

53
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,587
so my inventory, assuming I'm at 0 here is going to go up.

54
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:07,920
And then what's going to happen?

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,700
My demand is going to go down.

56
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,260
And then I'm going to receive a new order, up.

57
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,140
And then it's going to go down.

58
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,549
And it's going to go back up again and continue.

59
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:20,590
And you can actually see that this would actually

60
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,570
go back this way as well.

61
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,910
This is known as the sawtooth diagram.

62
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,640
This is what inventory tends to look like.

63
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,040
Now if this demand is a little more random,

64
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,780
then this won't be a straight line.

65
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,780
But you can think of it.

66
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,580
You have a bunch of stuff there, it gets sold,

67
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,180
and then you get a bunch of stuff in.

68
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,660
So this sawtooth diagram is key and core

69
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,970
to all inventory models.

70
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,517
Now you might say well, when I place my order though,

71
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:48,100
I might have already placed money out.

72
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,390
So we want to actually compare between what I have on hand

73
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,260
and what I drew down there is actually

74
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,430
what's known as the inventory on hand.

75
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,760
That's what I physically have sitting there versus what

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,980
my inventory position is.

77
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,680
So what that is when I place this order--

78
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,900
if I follow this down-- I've now placed

79
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,580
an order for a certain amount.

80
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,139
And while it's not sitting at my location,

81
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,680
I've already placed the order for it.

82
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,096
I might have put money out for it.

83
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:20,710
It's in transit.

84
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,230
And so I can actually look at again,

85
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,450
here, I placed this order.

86
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,180
Up a little bit, and so this inventory,

87
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,980
it isn't at my location, it's what's

88
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,110
known as being in transit.

89
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,660
And depending on the terms, you might own it and already

90
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,250
pay for it, or it might be something

91
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,490
you receive at the end.

92
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,865
But it's something you need to be

93
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:43,750
aware of because then this line is what's known

94
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,330
as your inventory position.

95
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,640
It's not just what you have on hand,

96
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,319
it's what you have on hand plus what you have on order.

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,860
And that becomes very important when we develop our inventory

98
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,660
models.

99
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,840
So we want to try to figure out what is the best

100
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,997
Q that minimizes my total cost.

101
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:03,830
Because that's what we're trying to do here,

102
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,692
minimize our total cost of ownership.

103
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:08,150
So we're going to go back and start

104
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,040
developing that total cost equation I

105
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,710
talked about earlier.

106
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,790
And it's going to consist of, for this purpose, three terms,

107
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,910
my purchasing cost, what does it cost to actually buy

108
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:28,000
the stuff, plus what is the cost of actually placing an order,

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,190
plus what's the cost of holding it, of having the inventory

110
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,000
there.

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,090
Three terms.

112
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,900
And so because we're a quantitative course,

113
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,730
we're going to turn this into an equation.

114
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,980
What do I need to do for that?

115
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,140
Well, I need to define some terms.

116
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,931
We need to define our demand.

117
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,430
And we're going to use the letter D.

118
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,950
Where does this demand come from?

119
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,100
It comes from your forecast.

120
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,920
That's how forecasting ties in inventory management.

121
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,750
And we'll see later on when we loosen

122
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,470
the assumption of deterministic demand, how this influences

123
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,340
my variability of demand.

124
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,700
And that influences my safety stock and other things.

125
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,040
But for right now, forecasting is just

126
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,380
determining that annual demand.

127
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,900
I need to know what my order quantity is going to be.

128
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,700
That's when I'm going to solve for.

129
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,570
I'd have a purchase cost, what I'm paying to get the product.

130
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,900
The order cost, this is what it costs me to place an order.

131
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,960
Think of this as transportation, the cost of using the system.

132
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,050
Whatever-- all of those costs to place an order, irregardless

133
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,112
of the size of the order.

134
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:28,570
And then I've got the holding cost.

135
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,470
How much does it cost to keep inventory sitting here?

136
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,447
Because if I have inventory here, remember,

137
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,530
it's costing me something.

138
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,820
I paid money for that.

139
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,380
So that money is just sitting there.

140
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,180
You could think of inventory as a stack

141
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,300
of dollar bills, a stack of money, sitting there.

142
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,580
If I have inventory sitting there,

143
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,870
that's money that's tied up.

144
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,690
That capital that's tied up.

145
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,370
So I have these terms.

146
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,070
How do I come up with an equation here?

147
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,574
We'll go into detail, but basically you

148
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:57,240
can think of it if I purchase something,

149
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,650
it's going to cost me C, purchase cost for every item

150
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,450
that I use that year for my demand.

151
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,440
My ordering cost is going to be that C sub t

152
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,150
every time I place an order.

153
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,740
How many times will I order?

154
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,620
Well, that's going to be my annual demand divided

155
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,600
by the units that I order each time.

156
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,851
So this will tell me the number of times that I order.

157
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:23,058
And don't worry if you don't get this the first time.

158
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:25,190
We'll go over this in detail in the lectures.

159
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,680
I just wanted to set the stage for you.

160
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,210
Then I've holding cost.

161
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,300
That's going to be C sub e, that holding cost that's

162
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,310
dollar per dollar per time.

163
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,840
And what will that be?

164
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,765
Well, this is what kind of confuses students

165
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,390
the first time.

166
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,790
It confused me the first time.

167
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,015
It's Q over 2.

168
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:43,100
Why is it Q over 2?

169
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,580
Because when I order, remember this amount, this level is Q.

170
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,030
And so you can think of the average inventory

171
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,450
that I have on hand is going to be this area

172
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,160
under these triangles.

173
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,450
And so what is that?

174
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,060
Q over 2.

175
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,540
And so that's the average inventory.

176
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,980
So I've got these three cost components

177
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,420
to give me my total cost.

178
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,300
And we'll find out very quickly that purchase cost doesn't

179
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,117
affect my decision of how much to order.

180
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:12,200
It doesn't have a Q in it.

181
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,240
And we'll talk more about that in the lesson,

182
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,100
but at the end of the day, we have

183
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,320
two major costs that are competing,

184
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,750
the ordering cost and the holding cost.

185
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,260
And what we can do is chart these two costs to show

186
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,060
how the trade-offs are made.

187
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,420
So let's go with a holding cost, and that

188
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,930
looks something like this.

189
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,250
It's a straight line.

190
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,130
This is my holding cost.

191
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,980
And that if I increase my Q, I'm going

192
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,600
to have higher holding costs.

193
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,710
Because if I order a lot, more of it will sit around longer.

194
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,890
So my total costs will increase, my holding costs

195
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,980
will increase as my Q gets bigger.

196
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,490
Now for my ordering costs, it's just the opposite.

197
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,026
If I order very small quantities,

198
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:56,650
I'm going to be ordering a lot of time,

199
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,500
so that cost will go up.

200
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:05,294
As my Q gets bigger, than my ordering cost gets smaller.

201
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:07,460
So if I look at both of these and put these together

202
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,970
for my total cost, then what it's going to look like

203
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,110
is something like this if I add them together.

204
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,230


205
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,450
And what we're trying to find is what

206
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:24,130
is the Q that minimizes this total cost equation?

207
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,740
It looks like a convex continuous function.

208
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,700
We know how to do that.

209
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,770
We want this point which you'll see

210
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,130
is actually where these two values meet.

211
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,299
And we're going to, call that Q star.

212
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,190
And so what is Q star?

213
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,900
That's also known as the economic order quantity.

214
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,970
That's the Q that you want to use

215
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,870
to minimize your total cost of ordering and holding.

216
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,790
And as I said before, the order size

217
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,660
doesn't affect my total purchase cost.

218
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,209
So it's irrelevant to this discussion.

219
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:59,250
So how would I find this?

220
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,650
Well, I can do it graphically, but we also know a better way.

221
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,010
You can take a first order condition, take a derivative,

222
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,010
solve for Q, and you'll find that the economic order

223
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:14,760
quantity is 2 times C sub t times D over C sub e.

224
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,560
This is your economic order equation, order quantity.

225
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,390
And you'll be using this a lot.

226
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,200
Every inventory system essentially relies on the EOQ

227
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,020
to start.

228
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,620
And all that it is is a way of making

229
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,730
the trade-off between ordering cost and holding cost.

230
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,470
And it's part of that total cost equation

231
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,430
that we're developing over the course of this course.

232
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,540
Big week this week.

233
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,620
Three lessons.

234
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,190
Lots of practice problems to get your arms around how

235
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,870
to do this inventory modeling.

236
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,060
This is the first step of the next four weeks

237
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,840
where we'll be dealing with inventory.

238
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,490
Have fun.
