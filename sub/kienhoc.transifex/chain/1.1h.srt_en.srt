1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,750
OK, so what are the key points from this lesson?

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,930
There's a couple.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,820
First, the whole idea of Push versus Pull Systems, where push

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,280
is where I'm being proactive, and I'm making my decisions

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,990
based on a forecasted demand.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,610
I'm doing it on a forecast, on a best estimate.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,130
A pull is reactive, and it's based on the actual demand.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,650
Think of the sandwich shop.

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,290
Push, I'm putting premade sandwiches out,

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,870
based on my forecast, or my estimate of what

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,840
demand will be.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,340
Pull, I'm making them as the orders come in.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,610
There are benefits to having these mixed systems.

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,336
And where a system changes from a push to a pull,

15
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,960
then that's called the push-pull point,

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,180
or the push-pull boundary.

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,240
The idea here is you want to maximize

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,420
that external variety-- the customized type of products

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,470
I have-- and minimize the internal variety.

20
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,940
And one way to do that is this wrap concept.

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,020
Keep things raw as possible, modularity, and postponement.

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,170
Because this has an added benefit--

23
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,620
is that if I have sub-assemblies or components,

24
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,560
I can aggregate demand.

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,270
If they go into multiple end items and it

26
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,690
makes it easier to forecast.

27
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,800
We'll spend a lot more on that in forecasting

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,260
in the next several lectures.

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,530
But the idea is that virtually all supply chains

30
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,250
are combination, both push and pull.

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,770
And so you want to utilize this and use

32
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,129
the idea of postponement to improve operations.

33
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,920
Then we talk about segmentation strategies.

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,400
Because if I have different supply chains in my company,

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,220
I want to determine how different products should flow

36
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,410
through those different supply chains.

37
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,580
So the idea of segmentation is, I find different ways

38
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,340
to divide the products, the customers,

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,020
and treat them differently.

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,310
You always segment with a purpose in mind.

41
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,790
We talked about functional versus innovative products.

42
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,980
It's a classic example of segmenting

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,030
two types of products.

44
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,850
Product segmentation is typically

45
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,120
done with an ABC type analysis, somehow the demand,

46
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,050
the velocity is included in that.

47
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,870
Higher value items are the As.

48
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,060
Faster velocity typically are As.

49
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,420
The slower, lower value things are Cs.

50
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,010
It's a good starting point, but different companies

51
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,030
add different flavors to this.

52
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,150
Some look at variability.

53
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,549
Some look at profitability.

54
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,590
There's all these different ways you can do this,

55
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,020
but they all kind of sit on top of the standard ABC analysis.

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,425
Then we quickly went over two types of distribution

57
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:32,880
that we'll be focusing on a lot in this course,

58
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,380
the Normal Distribution and the Poisson Distribution.

59
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,737
So hopefully you got a lot out of this lesson,

60
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:40,070
and if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions,

61
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,010
don't be confused.

62
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,330
