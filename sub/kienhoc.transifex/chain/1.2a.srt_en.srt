1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,290
OK, recall that we said that supply chain management is

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,000
all about making supply match demand.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,500
So understanding and being able to forecast that demand

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,430
is a critical and usually a first step

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,230
in designing a supply chain.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,880
But before we get into the math of forecasting,

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,070
let's step back and talk about demand planning

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,560
to understand what we're really trying to do.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,240
It's important to always remember

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,930
when we're in the middle of forecasting

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,290
and all the different models what our objective is,

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,050
and that forecasting isn't the end game.

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,850
We don't forecast just for forecast sake.

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,970
We always forecast for a reason, whether it's

15
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,724
the planned capacity, to manage our inventory,

16
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:39,265
or to set up our transportation plan,

17
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:41,290
or anything in between that.

18
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,840
But there's always a reason for doing a forecast.

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,690
And forecasting is actually part of a larger process.

20
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,690
And then you can think about the demand process.

21
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,550
And there are three main big questions

22
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,160
that we try to answer in this demand process.

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,120
The first one is, what should we do to shape and create

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,910
demand for our product?

25
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,270
And this is sometimes known as demand planning.

26
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,560
And you can think of what falls in this category as the five

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,261
p's.

28
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:07,510
You want to think about the product that you're making

29
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,740
and the packaging.

30
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,920
What does the size and the final form look like?

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,560
Because this will shape demand.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,630
It'll change whether people really want it or are not

33
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,030
as interested in it.

34
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,680
Think about promotions.

35
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,820
And so the interesting thing about promotions,

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,890
if you're talking to the consumer

37
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,880
packaged good industry, the companies that make things

38
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,380
that you buy in the grocery store or department store,

39
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,860
40% of all products in supermarkets sold by CPG

40
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,510
are sold under a promotion.

41
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,500
Promotions drive huge swings in the business.

42
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,370
So that will definitely change demand.

43
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,080
You want to think about the pricing.

44
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,660
What's your list price versus what discounts do you offer?

45
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,690
Because that changes the way the demand will be shaped.

46
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,840
And then finally, place.

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,270
And what we mean here is what kind of channels are you using?

48
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,260
Is it all internet?

49
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,310
Is it small mom and pop stores?

50
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,970
Is it large grocery stores?

51
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,290
Anything in between.

52
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,830
So how you set up your product, your packaging,

53
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,710
the way you run promotions, your pricing plan,

54
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,430
and where you place, where you sell your products,

55
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,340
that will help shape demand.

56
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,770
So now we can think about the next question.

57
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,380
And that's given this plan, what do we expect the demand to be?

58
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,850
And so this is where forecasting comes in.

59
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,410
So we've got this plan in place.

60
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,750
We know what the promotions are going to be

61
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,041
and all these different things.

62
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,530
And now we're going to forecast.

63
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,060
And as we'll see in a second, there

64
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,980
are different levels of forecasting.

65
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,320
You can think of strategic, tactical, and operational.

66
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,370
And they all vary with the time horizon

67
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,640
you're trying to plan over.

68
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,477
And we'll talk more about that in a second.

69
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:38,310
But the second thing is you want to consider

70
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,670
both internal and external factors.

71
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,080
And the key word here is factors.

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,250
So you want to understand that demand plan-- that's

73
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,780
the internal factors that you're shaping,

74
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,390
how you're setting up your promotions and everything--

75
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,270
but also your external factors, the competitive landscape.

76
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,580
What you don't want to include in here is your capabilities.

77
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,200
You don't want to set a forecast based

78
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,010
on what you want to happen or what

79
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,080
you think you would like to see.

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
It's really all about what your unbiased, the baseline

81
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,500
or unconstrained forecast is.

82
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,330
So you try not to have other things influence

83
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,300
the forecast that don't fit in.

84
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,220
You look at those factors that are

85
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,790
beyond your control-- the competitive landscape.

86
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,260
But you really don't want to bias your forecast.

87
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,030
And we'll talk much more about that in later lectures.

88
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,000
And then the third question is, OK,

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,010
given that we have this demand, how do we prepare and act

90
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,970
for this when it starts materializing?

91
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,200
And this is known as demand management.

92
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,010
And this is kind of at the end of the process.

93
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,200
But it's an ongoing process.

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,320
And this is where we try to balance the demand

95
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,060
and supply across the organization.

96
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,530
So you can think about this demand planning up here.

97
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,100
A lot of this is happening at the marketing or sales side.

98
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,740
Product development, they're trying to figure out policies.

99
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,950
Forecasting is done in different places within a company.

100
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,220
A lot of times it's done in the marketing side,

101
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,310
sometimes on the supply chain side.

102
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,810
But demand management is the process

103
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,300
that involves all of the company,

104
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,920
because you're balancing the demand and the supply.

105
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,110
So the key tool or process used here

106
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,570
is the S&OP processor, Sales and Operations Planning,

107
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,839
which we'll talk about a little bit later.

108
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,640
But essentially what this is, it's

109
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,510
a meeting or series of meetings or a mechanism

110
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,770
that ties the operations or the supply side

111
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,110
with the demand side.

112
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,620
So the supply side is focused on minimizing cost and inventory.

113
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,440
This is the guys in the supply chain trying

114
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,549
to make things as efficient as possible.

115
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:38,340
And they balance this with the demand side.

116
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,240
These are the marketing and sales side.

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,120
And their objective is to maximize revenues and margins.

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,020
And so what this S&OP does, it creates a bridge

119
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,510
across the firm to try to balance

120
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,940
between what we want to sell and what we're able to make.

121
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,780
So these are the three key questions

122
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,720
within the demand process.

123
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,470
And the last thing I want to say before we

124
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,420
get into some of the details is the different types

125
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,440
of forecasts.

126
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,420
And again, they all differ based on the time horizon.

127
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,400
So you can think of a strategic plan or strategic forecast

128
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,980
as being multiple years.

129
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,630
This is one year, multiple years.

130
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,600
In the pharmaceuticals industry, you

131
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,030
might be planning five, 10 plus years out,

132
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,840
because you have to base it on the life of the drug

133
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,990
that you're creating.

134
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,120
For large infrastructure investments,

135
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,880
such as for the government for a department of transportation,

136
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,880
they've got to look 20 to 30 years out,

137
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,400
because the life of the product itself, the investment,

138
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,230
the highway, the bridge, whatever has a long lifespan.

139
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,250
So they have to look much further.

140
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,770
So you see these strategic level forecasts, mainly

141
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,100
for investment strategies.

142
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,860
And the big questions-- capacity planning, building a new plant,

143
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,034
large business changes.

144
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:53,700
Then you get down to the tactical level.

145
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,240
You can think of quarterly tactical plans as well as

146
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,522
months or weeks plans.

147
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,230
And they're really all about those things

148
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,970
that we can change within a quarter

149
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,960
or within a month or a week.

150
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,180
So here on the month or week, we can

151
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,970
think about short term capacity planning,

152
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,900
master planning, inventory planning.

153
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,140
This is where we'll spend a lot of time.

154
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,900
But quarterly, that's pretty much

155
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,492
how you can adjust your labor, your manpower, some

156
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:17,450
of your sales planning.

157
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,920
A lot of these things run on quarterly cycles.

158
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,600
Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is another question.

159
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,580
But a lot of times, you have these things tied to a quarter.

160
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,560
And then finally, you have these operation or shortform term

161
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,280
plans.

162
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,009
And I'm forecasting over days or hours.

163
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:34,050
A lot of times you'll see this for transportation

164
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,450
on the current operations, production planning, inventory

165
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,440
deployment, those kinds of things.

166
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,960
So essentially, you forecast to the level

167
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,650
that which your process can change.

168
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,030
So if an investment up here, like

169
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,370
we're talking about for a factory or a large plant,

170
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,240
if it's going to last for 50 years

171
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,176
and takes five to 10 years to build,

172
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:55,800
then you're going to need a longer term

173
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,410
vision than if you're trying to plan how many trucks I need

174
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,720
next Tuesday.

175
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,220
So the type of the forecast depends

176
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,140
along the length of the horizon you're trying to plan for.

177
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,310
So what are we going to talk about for the rest

178
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,880
of this lecture?

179
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,530
Four things.

180
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,140
First, we're going to go into some truisms about forecasting.

181
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,015
We always have to address these when we first

182
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,604
talk about demand forecasting.

183
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,520
We're going to talk about different approaches

184
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,530
and classify them as subjective versus objective.

185
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,770
And then we're going to go into quality of forecast,

186
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,500
how do you tell if it's good or bad,

187
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,620
and then getting into metrics.

188
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,520
So let's get started.
