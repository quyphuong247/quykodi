1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,170
So we know how to find the optimal quantity using

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,070
Critical Ratio, now we want to look

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,060
at how to find the expected profitability.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,510
So remember what we're doing here

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,050
is we're maximizing the profit.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,820
We started with a profit function

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
and that's how we determined what the optimal quantity would

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,480
be.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,160
Remember how we set this up.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,290
There's two cases: the first is where

11
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,200
my demand is going to be less than my Q, the amount

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,180
that I order, and the second is when

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,677
demand exceeds what I order.

14
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:31,510
And remember what each of the functions are:

15
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,000
if my demand is less than my Q, my profit

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,550
is going to be p, the price I can charge for each unit,

17
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,680
times x, the demand that materializes,

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,470
minus c, the cost per item that it cost for me to acquire

19
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,570
the item minus Q, my quantity.

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,900
So it's really just the margin.

21
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,080
If my demand is greater than what I have,

22
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,990
it changes slightly in that I could only sell Q units.

23
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,750
I can't sell the full x that's demanded,

24
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,300
but I still get to subtract off a cost for each of the units

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,490
that I ordered.

26
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,880
So if we expand this out a little

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,980
and look at the continuous case, this

28
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,120
is simply the summation, or the integral, from zero

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,700
to infinity of that profit function.

30
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,810
I can break it up into two, where this first term is

31
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,170
the case where my demand is less than my quantity that I order,

32
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,080
and the second is when the demand exceeds

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,680
what I order for my quantity.

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,970
Now I can clean this up a little bit

35
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,230
and kind of combine the terms, and the critical thing

36
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,900
that I'm doing here is this first term now is actually

37
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,560
the sales for the expected demand for all of the demand,

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,430
regardless of what my Q is.

39
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,630
It's really, what I did is, I combined

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,290
some terms from the previous equation.

41
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,170
I still have the cost that it will

42
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,300
incur for each of the units that I order,

43
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,100
and then this is essentially capturing my expected units

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,190
short.

45
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,350
So what I end up with is this expected profit equation,

46
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,470
consisting of three terms.

47
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,580
The first term is p times my expected demand,

48
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,000
regardless of what my Q is.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,975
Then I've got this term for my costs:

50
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:19,930
it's c, the cost per unit times the quantity that I ordered.

51
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,380
And the third term, I have to subtract off the expected units

52
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,740
that I'll be short.

53
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,720
Because for here in this first term, remember what I'm doing

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,390
is I'm multiplying my price per unit

55
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,584
times my total expected demand, regardless of what my Q is.

56
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:37,500
But I know I'm not going to sell all of those.

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,590
I'm only going to be able to sell up to Q,

58
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,210
so I've got to subtract off the expected numbers

59
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,390
that I'm short.

60
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,015
Now this gets a little more complicated

61
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,380
when we introduce some other terms.

62
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,610
In the previous lesson, we introduced this idea

63
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,280
of a Salvage Value, or a discount,

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
where if I don't sell something within the normal period,

65
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,550
I can't get p for it anymore.

66
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,100
But I might get a lower price.

67
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,900
Whether this is a discount or salvage, it doesn't matter,

68
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,300
but it's a lower unit value.

69
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,260
I can also think of adding in a penalty.

70
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,740
In addition to the lost profit, I might have loss of goodwill,

71
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,240
let's say.

72
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,320
If I stock out of these jerseys, maybe I

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,620
figured that I'd lose, I don't know, $5 in goodwill.

74
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,700
Whatever that is, you can add that

75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,770
in as well in these same two equations,

76
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,040
a profitability equation, for when I have demand

77
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,060
is less than what I ordered and when

78
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,210
demand exceeds what I ordered.

79
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:37,200
If it all falls out the same terms as in the previous and it

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,960
turns out to be this equation.

81
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,240
But if I rearrange some of the terms --

82
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,740
I like to clean it up a little bit because it makes a little

83
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,000
more intuitive sense -- I end up with this equation

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,734
at the bottom.

85
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:50,900
And there's four terms here.

86
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,250
Let me talk about them really quickly.

87
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,110
This first term I have, p, the price I can sell each unit for,

88
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,540
the full price.

89
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,985
And this expected value of x minus the expected units short

90
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:08,470
-- that's the expected number of jerseys, or units,

91
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,960
that I will sell, given what my order quantity is.

92
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,010
So it's the expected total demand, EE[x],

93
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,440
the expected value of x minus that expected number that I

94
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,810
will be short.

95
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,570
Notice that the same term repeats itself here,

96
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,128
and I'll get to that in a second.

97
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:29,044
So this first term, p times the expected value

98
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:32,750
of x minus the expected units short

99
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,490
is essentially the revenue I'm getting

100
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,480
from the units I sell at the full price.

101
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,190
This term the negative c times Q, should be very familiar --

102
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,850
it's just the cost for each of the items that I order.

103
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,270
And then this last term is simply

104
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,100
that new B that we talked about for the expected unit

105
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,460
short that I'm going to be, I get dinged this B for that.

106
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,090
That's that penalty for lost sales.

107
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,040
But the term that I want to focus on

108
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,500
is this term, the third term.

109
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,330
Right?

110
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,010
And this is going to be g, that Salvage Value.

111
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,740
And what am I multiplying that by?

112
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,350
Well, Q is the amount I ordered.

113
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,680
And I'm subtracting off the amount I expect to sell.

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,950
And so this is essentially the number

115
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,230
of units that will be sold or sent through the Salvage Value.

116
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,140
So this is the equation, let's dive

117
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,440
a little deeper now into this expected unit short function.
