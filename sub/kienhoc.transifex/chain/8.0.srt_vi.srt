1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,029
Chào mừng quay trở lại những điều cơ bản Chuỗi Cung ứng SC1*.

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:05,070
Tuần này, chúng ta sẽ tiếp tục bàn đến

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,630
bản kiểm kê.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,180
Chúng ta sẽ mở rộng ra hai mô hình

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,980
mà chúng ta vừa mới xem xét, EOQ, trong đó

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,757
nó là yêu cầu tiên quyết.

7
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:14,340
Rồi đến vấn đề Newsvendor, trong đó

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,710
chúng ta có yêu cầu ngẫu nhiên cho từng khoảng thời gian.

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,430
Và chúng ta xem xét các trường hợp trong đó chúng ta có yêu cầu ngẫu nhiên.

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,700
Nhưng bây giờ, chúng ta xem xét chân trời vô tận,

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,880
and we're going to focus back on lost sales.

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,150
So it's kind of a combination of these two methods.

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,970
And these are the most commonly used forms

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,180
of inventory policies out there.

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,900
And so let's take an example.

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,340
And let's look what happens here.

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,750
I've got my demand.

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,159
And like we said, it's random.

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,700
But we're going to assume it's level.

20
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,991
So we're going to ignore trends and seasonality and all

21
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:44,460
that stuff you learned in forecasting for right now.

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,750
But demand is something like this.

23
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,640
So it's random.

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,659
So we expect some kind of level.

25
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,200
But we don't know exactly how much is

26
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,435
going to be sold each period.

27
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:54,810
Now, what I'm going to do is show

28
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,020
you two types of inventory policies, a continuous policy

29
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,670
and a periodic policy.

30
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,500
The first one, a continuous policy

31
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,550
that we're going to talk about, is the sQ policy,

32
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,980
where that's a little s.

33
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,560
And what we do here is we're trying

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,960
to come up with a policy or a plan

35
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,540
to try to minimize our total inventory cost

36
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,550
or maximize our level of service.

37
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,980
And we'll talk about that trade-off in a second.

38
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,510
What it consists of is you find a value of little s.

39
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,460
And that's the reorder point.

40
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,420
And so what this is.

41
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,640
I'll just put a dash line here.

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,010
This is the point at which, if the inventory drops

43
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,350
below a certain level, I place an order.

44
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,270
Because we're a continuous order policy,

45
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm constantly watching my inventory.

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,410
I'm looking at my stuff all the time.

47
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,250
And so what will this look like?

48
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,904
Well, instead of a straight triangle,

49
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:42,570
it will look something like this, right?

50
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,890
Because it's random demand.

51
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,060
But it's going to go down.

52
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,016
And then it's going to hit a certain level.

53
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:48,140
It hits that reorder point.

54
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,770
What do I do?

55
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,810
I place an order for how much?

56
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,180
Q. I order Q. Where does Q come from?

57
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,990
It's an economic order quantity.

58
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,220
So I order Q. My demand keeps going down.

59
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,220
But at some point, it shows up, right?

60
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,920
Remember this is what's on order.

61
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,220
And the time between here, we talked,

62
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,010
is the lead time, time between when I place the order

63
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,360
and when it shows up.

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,920
And then this just repeats itself.

65
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,910
It's random.

66
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,440
It hits down here again.

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,110
I order up to Q, a Q amount.

68
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,060
It shows up and so forth.

69
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,840
And it keeps going down.

70
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,380
So this is a continuous policy.

71
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,690
I have a reorder point of little s.

72
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,960
And when Inventory gets to that, I place an order for Q.

73
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,370
So that's a continuous policy.

74
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,150
And this makes a lot of sense.

75
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,260
However, in many situations, you can't afford to just

76
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,640
be watching your inventory.

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,790
If I've got 10,000 SKUs, I can't be watching them and placing

78
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,350
orders at random times.

79
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,190
So that's where the periodic policy comes in.

80
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,091
And so periodic review is a little bit different.

81
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,090
And we're going to look at the policy called RS,

82
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,230
were S is a big S, a capital S. And what R

83
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,990
is telling me is I can only look at my inventory

84
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,580
every R time periods.

85
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,700
That can be once a week, every two weeks, every four weeks,

86
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,720
twice a month.

87
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,020
Whatever I want that to be, that is R. So every R period.

88
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,470
That's the only time I can look at my inventory

89
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,970
and place an order.

90
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,100
Then I'm going to have this big S.

91
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,767
And that's called the order up to point.

92
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,850
And so we're going to have the same thing, looking

93
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,820
at this demand.

94
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,840
What's going to happen?

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,020
Well, I'm going to have my inventory.

96
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,040
It's going to go down.

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,880
I'm selling stuff.

98
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,930
I'm selling stuff.

99
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,817
I hit this time period here, and I order up to this level S.

100
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:35,400
And I'm going to just draw a line out.

101
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,775
So I'm going to order up to that.

102
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,720
Now sometimes I might order a certain amount.

103
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,470
Other times I'll order a different amount.

104
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,510
I always order up to the same amount.

105
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,030
As opposed to this policy, I always or the same

106
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,230
amount every time.

107
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,160
So I place my order, all right.

108
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,820
Things go down.

109
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,790
It finally shows up, right?

110
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,690
And my line goes up.

111
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,280
Let me just draw this out.

112
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,300
I place another order here, up to this.

113
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,120
It shows up and so on.

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,680
So I've still got my Lead time here, right?

115
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,820
So when I place my order to when it shows up,

116
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,160
that's still my Lead time.

117
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,070
But now I've got this R period.

118
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,200
So this is very commonly used.

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,097
You might ask why.

120
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,930
It seemed like this would be more efficient.

121
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,829
And it is.

122
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,610
But this makes a lot of sense in many situations.

123
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,270
And you can think of the case where,

124
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,630
for example, stocking a vending machine,

125
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,490
like a soda machine or candy machine,

126
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,180
you can't constantly be there.

127
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,760
You're going to check it once a week.

128
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,030
And so periodic review is very commonly used.

129
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,340
Now the question that we're going to try to solve

130
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,520
is, how do I set these parameters for my policy?

131
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,050
And what we'll see is there are two main ways.

132
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,615
One is to look at level of service.

133
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:50,010


134
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,080
And I want to come up with a policy

135
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,540
where I achieve a certain level of service.

136
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,430
And the other is to minimize cost.

137
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,740
Now we're going to look at two specific cases here.

138
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,531
And so for level of service, I'm going look

139
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:07,330
at something called Cycle Service Level and Item Fill

140
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,290
Rate.

141
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,840
So Cycle Service Level is, what is the probability

142
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,850
that I had a stock out at all?

143
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,310
Item fill Rate is looking at the probability of the number

144
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,710
of items that I stock out of.

145
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,215
Minimizing cost, I'm going to put a cost per stock

146
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:24,370
out event or a cost per Item short.

147
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,730
If I can put a dollar value on each time I'm short

148
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,350
or each item that I'm short, then I

149
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,270
can put that on my total cost equation

150
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,410
and minimize that to find the optimal parameters to minimize

151
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,487
my total cost.

152
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:38,320
So this is what we're going to do this week.

153
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,787
We're building on the EOQ and the Newsvendor problem.

154
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:43,120
And we're going to tie it to a very common policy that's

155
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,650
embedded in almost every ERP system out there.

156
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,480
OK, so watch the videos, take the quick questions,

157
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,500
do the practice problems, have fun.
