1
00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:02,210
So let's talk about the different components

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,170
we'll be looking for in time series analysis.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,800
The first component we're going to look for is the level.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,410
This is the value where a demand hovers, the mean.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,520
So over here on the right we have this picture

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,660
of all the different observations.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,200
What we can see here is that they're

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,710
all kind of hovering around a certain level.

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,490
And this captures the scale of the time series analysis

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,640
because this kind of sets the level on the demand side.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,710
And if there's no other pattern, no other components present,

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,560
then we can say the forecast is going

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,590
to be this constant value.

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,690
So we're going to call this Level (a)

15
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,070
and you can see it's just the mean or the average

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,600
where all those different observations hover.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,080
So this is the easiest pattern-- level.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,210
The second one is a trend, and this

19
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,520
is defined as the rate of growth or decline.

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,120
It's got to be persistent movement

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,300
in one direction or the other.

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,140
We show this as a positive trend.

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,100
You can also have a negative trend.

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,670
It could happen.

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,580
It's typically linear like what we have right here.

26
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,080
So this is a linear trend, and we're

27
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,769
going to say the slope is b.

28
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,520
But you could have an exponential trend

29
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,020
that would look something like this.

30
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,990
Very dangerous, because then you have

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,570
to make sure it goes-- grows exponentially.

32
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,580
So you have to monitor it very closely.

33
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,230
If you start modeling an exponential trend,

34
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,540
it will blow up.

35
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,380
So you have to be very careful in monitoring that.

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,850
More common is you'll see something

37
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,285
like this, where you have a level,

38
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:29,450
and you expect it to tail out.

39
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,010
It'll dampen.

40
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,370
And we'll talk more about that, because the thing

41
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,170
about trends-- trends don't go on forever.

42
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,920
And so we eventually assume that they

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,910
will change slope and maybe temper down a little bit.

44
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,950
So you have to monitor that.

45
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,550
But that's the second component we're looking at is trend.

46
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,299
So we've got level, trend, and then we've got seasonality.

47
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,840
We're going to call that F, and we'll

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,480
talk about what that means, this F factor.

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,220
But essentially, seasonality is a repeated cycle.

50
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,070
And the important thing is it's around a known or fixed period

51
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,650
of time-- hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually.

52
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,300
It doesn't matter as long as it's fixed and known.

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,590
And it can be caused by either natural forces or man-made.

54
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,340
You can think of summer and winter.

55
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,260
In the winter you're not going to have

56
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,900
as much demand for certain products.

57
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,340
Man-made things like back to school,

58
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,130
that happens at a certain time of year.

59
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,620
It always happens in the fall-- in North America, anyway.

60
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,010
And so what that means is there's

61
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,560
going to be this seasonality, and it's nothing

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,810
to do with natural causes-- it's all man-made.

63
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,060
But again, remember when we talk about time series,

64
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,190
this is a black box method.

65
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,370
I'm just looking at the seasonality

66
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,870
to try to see the patterns in the existing data.

67
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,050
Then the last one-- or not the last one, the fourth one,

68
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,620
is random fluctuations.

69
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,030
And we're going to call this e, or epsilon.

70
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,970
And this is the remainder of the variability

71
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,900
after all the other components have been used.

72
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,090
So it's kind of what's left over.

73
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,950
And you see irregular, unpredictable variations.

74
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,890
Everything you see here, all the little noise.

75
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,389
Right?

76
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,850
All the little noise.

77
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,090
And it's something that we will always have there,

78
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,850
because a prediction will never be totally accurate.

79
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,250
So you're always going to have this noise.

80
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,620
Now there is a fifth component that we

81
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,777
want to talk about briefly.

82
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,360
We're not going to do too much with it

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,818
the remainder of this course, but I

84
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:29,010
want to make sure you understand what it is.

85
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,920
And that's cyclical movements.

86
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,090
So a cyclical movement is not like seasonality.

87
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,450
Yes, it's a periodic movement, but it's not

88
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,910
with a fixed period.

89
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,470
So the length of it differs.

90
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,530
A lot of times this is used for business cycles or any kind

91
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,610
of economic or macroeconomic conditions.

92
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,510
So let me give you an example here.

93
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,620
This is a great statistic.

94
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,830
This is the PMI, the Purchasing Manager Index

95
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,860
from the Institute of Supply Management.

96
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,200
And that's an index they run from 0 to 100,

97
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,610
and the key number is 50.

98
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,840
And so if their index is below 50,

99
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,670
then that means they think the economy is contracting.

100
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,769
And if it's above 50, they think it's expanding.

101
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,060
And they do this through a bunch of surveys and things.

102
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,601
They've been doing it for many years.

103
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:19,240
And here's a recent snapshot from 2006, October 2006,

104
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,980
to October 2010, which captured a recession.

105
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,380
Pretty much a global recession.

106
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,455
So you see here what happened is they

107
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:29,370
were kind of in the middle, kind of hanging out in the middle,

108
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,960
and then we had a very big contraction.

109
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,920
And then we started expanding out over the last couple years.

110
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,510
So this is a business cycle.

111
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,230
And in this case, the business cycle

112
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,550
lasted about-- what is that?

113
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,550
About a year and a half?

114
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,780
18 months?

115
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,110
So you can think about that, but other business cycles

116
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,630
will last many different lengths of time.

117
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,460
So here we are-- the same index, but going back to 1949.

118
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,390
And you can see that these different troughs and cycles

119
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,450
have many different lengths of time.

120
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,800
So this is why it's a cyclical movement-- it's not periodic.

121
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,420
If we knew exactly how long each downturn in the economy

122
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,750
would be, it would be a very different world.

123
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,150
Let me point out one other thing.

124
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,010
If I'm sitting here-- let's say we're in the summer of 2009,

125
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,070
or the spring of 2009, right in here--

126
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,030
and I'm forecasting for the next three to six months,

127
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,050
if I just take this snapshot, and this is my world,

128
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,500
what does my world look like?

129
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,610
It looks like I'm in a major trend.

130
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,740
So depending on the level of your view as you come in,

131
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,450
and if you do a very short term forecast,

132
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,910
you might be seeing a tremendous uptick,

133
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,850
a steep trend in the economy.

134
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,680
And so one thing about these different patterns,

135
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,070
it really matters what your level of view

136
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,160
is, what your horizon is.

137
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,470
Because similarly if I was sitting over here,

138
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,640
and I'm in the fall of 2008, I'm in a negative trend.

139
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,410
So the point I'm trying to make here-- where you sit

140
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,740
and what your time frame is dictates

141
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,311
a lot of what pattern you're looking at.

142
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:12,810
OK.

143
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,840
So we have these five patterns.

144
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,190
We have a level, we have a trend, we have seasonality,

145
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,530
we have the cyclical movements, and then we

146
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,950
have this error term.

147
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,950
What do I do with those?

148
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,110
Well, I can combine them.

149
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,270
And there's different ways I can combine these components.

150
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,250
One way is multiplicative.

151
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,860
If I think the trend changes with-- Let's say

152
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,980
I have every season-- winter, spring, summer, and fall

153
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,100
has a different trend level, and it increases by say 10%

154
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,260
or decreases by 10%.

155
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,186
If I think it's a multiplicative trend, then I multiply it.

156
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:48,560
And then I can multiply the error

157
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,830
and all those kind of terms.

158
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,830
So this is where I think that the changes in the seasonality

159
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,620
are relative.

160
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,380
Now another way to look at this-- let's

161
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,140
clean this up-- is to think of them as additive.

162
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,800
If I think, for example, in the summer my increase in demand

163
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,180
is an absolute amount-- say 100 units or 1,000 units-- then

164
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,380
that's additive.

165
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,070
If I think it's just a straight bump,

166
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,080
if I think it's a percentage of the trend,

167
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,840
then I'm here to multiplicative.

168
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,430
So you have to think about how you want to use these trends.

169
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,880
Is it an additive function?

170
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,630
Is it a multiplicative function?

171
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,210
But as you some of you might have already realized,

172
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,940
if I think it's all multiplicative,

173
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,650
I can change that into an additive function

174
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,830
just by taking a log transformation.

175
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,630
Take a natural log-- actually a log

176
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,700
of any base-- to this function, and it

177
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,990
turns into an additive function.

178
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,540
And so you can turn a pure multiplicative function

179
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,410
into an additive function.

180
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,720
It gets a little more confusing, but you can do it.

181
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,390
But what happens more often, more commonly,

182
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,580
is this idea of mixed.

183
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,450
And so here are three examples of mixed models.

184
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,430
And there are many other ones you can do.

185
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,970
In the first one, it's saying that the demand

186
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,330
x of t-- so this is the actual demand in period t--

187
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,280
is going to be equal to the seasonality factor-- we say

188
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,600
it's multiplicative-- of the level and the trend.

189
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,991
Now this is b times t.

190
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:16,490
Right?

191
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,320
So this b is the slope, t is the number of time units

192
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,150
that I've done.

193
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,300
So you can see down here at the bottom the notation.

194
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,670
So this is saying that if the seasonality in the winter

195
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,350
for sales goes up by 10%, it's affecting

196
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,440
both the level and the trend.

197
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,960
Then I added the cyclical and the error term as well.

198
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,450
Another one, the second one, where

199
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,090
the actual demand in period t we're going to say

200
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,960
is equal to the level, but the level doesn't change over

201
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,350
the seasons, we're saying.

202
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,446
We're saying only the trend changes.

203
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:49,070
So we're saying that during the winter,

204
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,329
say, sales go up 3% instead of 6%.

205
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,370
And then in the summer it changes some other way.

206
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,810
So only the trend is being affected here.

207
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,932
And then the final one that I have down here.

208
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:01,890
It's just the opposite.

209
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,470
It's saying the level is affected by the season.

210
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,270
So we could say something like, in the summer,

211
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,220
usually we sell 1,000 units a month across the year,

212
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,880
but in the summer I sell about 20% more.

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,810
But the trend over time isn't changing.

214
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,970
It's just the level in the summer is different.

215
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,840
So you can see you can have a combination

216
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,646
of multiplicative and additive functions.

217
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,020
So what are we going to focus on?

218
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,210
We're going to focus on four models.

219
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,610
The first is just a straight level model.

220
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,850
And this is saying that the demand in period t

221
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,310
is equal to this level, this constant amount,

222
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,507
plus some error term, some noise bouncing around.

223
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:41,090
Next we'll go for a trend, where we're

224
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,881
saying there's this level, but then there's

225
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:45,660
a general trend either increasing or decreasing.

226
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,390
And if it's decreasing this b would be negative, of course.

227
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,260


228
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,650
And then the third model is where

229
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,700
we're going to mix level and seasonality.

230
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,690
So I'm saying there is a level, and there

231
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,500
is some kind of seasonality.

232
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,400
And then the last one is kind of combining them all together,

233
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,910
where I have a mixed level, trend, and seasonality.

234
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,200
Where the level and the trend are additive,

235
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,120
but it's multiplicative in the seasonality,

236
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,600
and seasonality affects both of them.

237
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,770
So these are the models that we're going to focus on.

238
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,270
All right.

239
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,250
So let's get started.
