1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,660
OK, so here's a problem that we're going to look at today.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,140
Like I said, you will find this in this week's problem set.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,730
So I encourage everyone of you who haven't already

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,450
to go back, look at this problem,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,550
try to solve the problem, wrestle with the problem

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,633
before you come here and watch the solution on how

7
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:17,200
to solve it.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,366
I think you will find this video much more rewarding

9
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:21,710
if you've actually worked through the details

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,740
of this problem.

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,420
So those of you haven't, stop the video now and go back,

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,254
and then you can come back.

13
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:32,170
Those of you feel like you've understood this,

14
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,950
feel free to skip ahead, because I'm just

15
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,650
going to go and read through the problem

16
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,775
and highlight a few things.

17
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,010
If you feel like you understand the problem properly,

18
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,940
feel free to skip ahead.

19
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,717
The rest of you, OK, here we go.

20
00:00:43,717 --> 00:00:45,050
So we're looking at a bookstore.

21
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,650
The MIT bookstore is selling a popular book

22
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,830
on supply chain management.

23
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,240
So it's a popular book, good.

24
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,400
The book is used as a textbook in a supply chain course

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,440
during the fall semester and is sold

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,900
by the store at $160 per book.

27
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,280
Once the semester is halfway through, sales tend to drop.

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,860
At this point, since the bookstore

29
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,370
needs to use its retail space for other books,

30
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,950
the store clears any remaining inventory of the supply chain

31
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,060
book by selling it at $60 per book.

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,740
The supply chain course has approximately 500 students

33
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,912
every fall semester.

34
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,370
During previous semesters, the book

35
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,010
has sold 200 copies, on average.

36
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,990
The bookstore purchases the books

37
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,730
from a distributor at $100 per book.

38
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,140
There is a significant lead time from the distributor,

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,810
so orders out before the book need

40
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,860
to be placed well before the semester.

41
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,190
Also, due to the lead time, there's

42
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,190
no time to replenish the books once the semester starts.

43
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,080
Consequently, the bookstore needs

44
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,760
to make a single decision about how many books to order

45
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,579
before the start of a semester.

46
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:50,120
Looking at previous semester's sales,

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,580
a manager at the bookstore sees that they have never

48
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,270
sold more than 250 copies of the book.

49
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,980
The data also shows that they have sold as few as 100 books

50
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,330
in some semesters.

51
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,210
Based on this, she believes that ordering the average sales

52
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,600
in previous semesters-- that is, 200 books--

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,780
is a good policy for the upcoming semester.

54
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,810
OK, so what are we looking at here?

55
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,950
Clearly, this is a single-period model.

56
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,537
Why?

57
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:15,120
Because it has the two characteristics

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,406
that I told you about.

59
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:18,530
We know that we have a well-defined selling season,

60
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,030
right?

61
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,180
It's up here.

62
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,580
It says that it's during one semester

63
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,600
that we sell the books.

64
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,016
And at the end of the semester, we

65
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:29,410
want to clear any remaining inventory, right?

66
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,540
So we can no longer sell the book at full price

67
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,190
after a certain point in time.

68
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,820
So it's a well-defined sales period.

69
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,330
Also, we cannot replenish during the sales period.

70
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,870
And that's over here.

71
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,576
It says that due to the lead time,

72
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,200
there is no time to replenish the books

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,960
once the semester starts.

74
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,870
So we're looking at a single-period decision

75
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,680
where the manager has to make a quantity

76
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,950
decision about how many books to order

77
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,240
before the semester starts.

78
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,770
So the manager has to make a bet.

79
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,010
How much do you think we're going to sell,

80
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,186
and how much are we going to order in order

81
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:05,040
to meet that demand?

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,540
So this is the problem that we're going to look at.
