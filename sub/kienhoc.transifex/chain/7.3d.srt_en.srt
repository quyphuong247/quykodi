1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,020
So now we're moving on to a problem

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,019
where we actually get information

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,600
about the probability of selling a certain book

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,850
or not selling a certain book.

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,300
And part two says the following.

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,180
Suppose the demand during a semesters actually normally

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,890
distributed with mean 220 and standard deviation 30,

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,400
what is the optimal order quantity?

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,430
So let's draw a graph-- a small graph here.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,900
I'm going to put on the x-axis, x,

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,700
which is demand in this case, and on the y-axis,

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,940
the probability density function of demand, f of x.

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,390
We know it's normally distributed.

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,200
So it's going to look something like this almost bell-shape

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,480
with a mean of 220.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,870
Now the problem is asking, what is the optimal order quantity?

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,920
So we want to find some q-- q star could be over here

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,250
or it could be over here.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,350
We want to find the q star that is optimal.

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,310
What does it mean that an order quantity's optimal?

21
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,550
Well, it means that it's maximizing our expected profit,

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,120
so an expectation that is the order quantity that brings us

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,200
the highest profit.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,790
In the lesson, Professor [? Kaplan ?]

25
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,330
has showed you one way of doing this-- that

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,780
was through marginal analysis.

27
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,810
And he show that using that analysis,

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,760
you will find a critical ratio.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,730
Based on that critical ratio, you

30
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,680
will find the optimal order quantity.

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,141
Now I want to show you one more way of doing this.

32
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:24,640
There are many different ways you can approach this problem.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,120
So I'm going to show you another way of doing this--

34
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,862
and this is using calculus.

35
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:31,320
So I'm going to go through all the steps from the beginning

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,470
to the end, taking first order conditions

37
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,350
to find the maximizer of the expected profit function.

38
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,500
This is a slightly more general way of solving it.

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,692
So in many cases, it might be difficult to just eyeball

40
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:45,150
to find the critical ratio, finding

41
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,440
the shortage cost or the excess cost

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,700
just by looking at the problem.

43
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,180
And in that case, calculus might be a good way for you

44
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,620
to actually find the problem properly and finding

45
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,490
the correct solution to the problem

46
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,390
without just eyeballing it.

47
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,270
So it's a slightly more general approach,

48
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,730
but being more general also means it's more technical.

49
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,230
OK?

50
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,480
So-- bear with me.

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,047
OK?

52
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,630
I'm going to go through all the steps.

53
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,180
I'm going to show you how to do this.

54
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,429
And what you're going to see is we end up with exactly

55
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:15,310
with the same solution as in the lecture.

56
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,520
So this is just one of many ways of solving the problem.

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,800
But of course, we will end up with the same solution

58
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,469
as any other way to the problem.

59
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:29,010
The first thing we want to do is to find the profit function.

60
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,870
So I'm going to call it pi of q.

61
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,610
And let's look at two different cases.

62
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,790
One is when demand is less than what we have in stock,

63
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,640
because it means that we going to have some stock left.

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,172
And the other one is when demand is

65
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,630
greater than what we have in stock,

66
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,546
because it means there's some demand we're not

67
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:47,860
going to be able to sell to.

68
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,957
What is the profit in these two different cases?

69
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:52,290
We'll start with the first case.

70
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,920
Right?

71
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,461
How much revenue are we going to get?

72
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:57,730
Well, we going to get p units, the sales price for every book

73
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,450
that we sell.

74
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,760
How much are we going to sell?

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,260
Well we're going to sell the demand.

76
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,495
We're going to sell d, because the demand is less

77
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:04,620
than what we have in stock.

78
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,880
So we're going to sell whatever's demanded.

79
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,380
How much costs are we going to have?

80
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,784
Well, every book is going to cost a c.

81
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:12,950
And since we ordered q, it means that our total cost

82
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,884
is going to be c times q.

83
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:16,550
At the end of the semester-- all right--

84
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,475
since demand is less than q, it means

85
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:20,600
there's going to be some books left at the semester

86
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,910
that we never sold.

87
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,930
These books will bring in a salvage of g per book.

88
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,300
How many books do we have left?

89
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,670
Well we have whatever we have in stock

90
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,030
minus what the demand was.

91
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,810
So this is our profit if we're in this case, where the demand

92
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,776
is less than or equal to q.

93
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:40,970
But there's another case.

94
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,470
Right?

95
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,860
This case over here.

96
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,760
What is the profit in these cases?

97
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,100
Well, the revenues are no longer driven purely by demand.

98
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,600
Right?

99
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,580
Because the demand is greater than what we have in stock.

100
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,830
And we can never sell more than what we have in stock.

101
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,510
So the revenues are going to be p times q.

102
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,130
And the costs are going to be c times the order quantity.

103
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,340
And do we do have any salvage?

104
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,850
No.

105
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,250
Right?

106
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,560
Because we don't have any stock left.

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,730
If there was more demand than what we have in stock,

108
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,771
then we're going to sell every book that we have.

109
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:11,070
And there's not going to be any books left to salvage

110
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,194
at the end of the semester.

111
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:16,230
So what we have is-- for the two different cases--

112
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,519
our profit function is going to look like this.

113
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,342
Now we want to move from this to the expectation.

114
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:23,800
And to get the expectation, we need

115
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,120
to know the probabilities of each of the different outcomes

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,380
for these two cases.

117
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,880
Right?

118
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,254
Because for every case, there are

119
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:31,620
many, many different outcomes.

120
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,812
Demand could be anywhere from 0 to q star and then from q

121
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:36,560
star up to infinity.

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,250
So let's try to find expectation by looking

123
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,980
at all these different cases.

124
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,810
So we're going to call expectation e of pi

125
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,280
of q, the profit function.

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,100
And what I'm going to do is I'm going

127
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,759
to start with the revenues.

128
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,300
Then we're going to look at the cost.

129
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,320
And then we're going to look at the salvage.

130
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,820
All right.

131
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,410
So we look at them case by case.

132
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,260
The revenues-- we're still going to have

133
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,250
a revenue per unit of p.

134
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,431
The first case is when demand is from 0 to q.

135
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:05,930
Right?

136
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,920
This is the first case over here.

137
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,680
That means we look at all the cases from 0

138
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,900
up to what we ordered.

139
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,090
Here, the demand, x, is what we're going to sell.

140
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,590
Right?

141
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,920
We're going to sell the demand.

142
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,961
So we're going to sell x.

143
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,810
And we want to know the probability of that event.

144
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,480
And then we take the integral.

145
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,540
And we do the same thing for the next case,

146
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,580
where we go from q to infinity.

147
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,016
But now, we're no longer going to sell demand.

148
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,640
For these cases, we're going to sell q.

149
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,030
Right?

150
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,238
Because demand is greater than what we have in stock,

151
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,030
we're going to sell what we have in stock.

152
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,580
We also want to know the probability of that event.

153
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,950
Like that.

154
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,300
So that'll be the revenues coming in from our book sales.

155
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,762
We're still going to have a cost.

156
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:47,970
What is the cost going to be?

157
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,830
Well independently of what the outcome is,

158
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,585
we're going to have the same cost.

159
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,960
That is not the case for salvage.

160
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,460
Right?

161
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,410
So salvage is going to look different.

162
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,020
For salvage, for salvage we're going

163
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,820
to have-- only in this case, right?

164
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,740
We only have salvage in the first case.

165
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,310
That's the case over here.

166
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,230
Because otherwise, we're not going to have any books left.

167
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,890
So it's only in these cases, we're going to have book left.

168
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,370
So we take the integral from 0 to q in here.

169
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,455
How much do we salvage?

170
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:17,920
Well we salvage q minus the demand.

171
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,860
Then we take the probability.

172
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,160
Then we go like that.

173
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,000
So this is our expected profit function.

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,880
Now we can make some observations from this.

175
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,810
If you look at this part over here

176
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,480
after the p, this part over here,

177
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,150
this is really what we expect to sell.

178
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,420
That's how much we expect to sell.

179
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,541
So we can call this the expected sales.

180
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,790
What I'm going to do is I'm going to call the expected

181
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,254
sales s of q.

182
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:49,420
It means we can simplify this function a little bit.

183
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,840
So calling the expected sales s of q,

184
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,450
we still have c times the order quantity.

185
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,839
And then we have the salvage.

186
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,130
How can we express the salvage?

187
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,000
Well let's think about this.

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,780
How much do we expect to salvage?

189
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,310
We expect to salvage whatever we have in stock minus

190
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,941
what we expect to sell.

191
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:10,440
Right.

192
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,230
Think about it-- whatever we have in stock

193
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,090
minus what we expect to sell, that's

194
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,960
what we expect to salvage.

195
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
Makes sense, right?

196
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,310
So we take whatever we have in stock, which is q, minus

197
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,060
what we expect to sell s of q.

198
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,930
So this is a slightly more simple way

199
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,860
of writing the expected profit function.

200
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,710
You may not be familiar with this,

201
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,240
but actually from the lesson, you've seen this.

202
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,540
Let's write down a relationship.

203
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,460
You know from the lesson that the expected demand--

204
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,975
I'm going to call it mu because it's

205
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:44,980
a normal functional and normal distribution.

206
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,770
You know that the expected demand

207
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,080
is the expected sales times-- or plus the loss function,

208
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,630
the expected units short.

209
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:59,770
So we know that we can express-- or sorry--

210
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,370
we can express-- I want to write the expected sales.

211
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,470
We can express that as the expected demand minus the loss

212
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,220
function.

213
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,240
So if you want, you can plug this in.

214
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,740
Right?

215
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,650
I'm going to do that.

216
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,080
It means we get p over here.

217
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,910
And then we take the unit's short,

218
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,670
and then we have minus the cost times the order quantity.

219
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,510
Here, we have q minus all of this, which is

220
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,575
mu, loss function, like that.

221
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:35,204
And if you look at this, if you look at this specific--

222
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:37,370
I'm going to put an arrow over here so we specify.

223
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,450
This is something that you've seen in the lesson.

224
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,700
So if you go back and you look at the slides from Professor

225
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,685
[? Kaplan's ?] lesson, you will find this expression.

226
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:44,185
All right?

227
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:47,970
Where with the loss function over here are the units short.

228
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,700
So this might look familiar to you.

229
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,230
And these two are equivalent.

230
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,730
Right?

231
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,320
These are two ways of expressing the expected profit function.

232
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,897
I'm going to work, in this session,

233
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,230
I'm going to work with this one.

234
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,146
So I'm going to focus on the one where we have

235
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,850
it expressed as expected sales.

236
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,260
Why am I going to do that?

237
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,710
Because I find it slightly easier

238
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,640
to take the derivative of this function.

239
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,270
Why do I want to take the derivative?

240
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,644
Well, because we want to find the first order conditions.

241
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:18,300
We want to maximize the expected profit function.

242
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,540
But of course I mean, you can work with this if you want to.

243
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,830
You can also take the derivative of this.

244
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,710
And those are two different ways of approaching the problem.

245
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,110
Whatever you find suitable, these are equivalent.

246
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,360
Now, how do we take the derivative?

247
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,500
Let's focus on this function over here,

248
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,300
the expected sales function, and look at that first.

249
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,310
And then we can go back.

250
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,810
OK?

251
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,080
So let's start with a clean sheet of paper.

252
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,710
And remember that the expected sales,

253
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,930
it's the integral from 0 to the order quantity.

254
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,280
And in this region, we're going to sell the demand.

255
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,370
We take the probability of that happening.

256
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,130
And then we have the other region,

257
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,980
which is from the order quantity to infinity.

258
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,560
And in this region, we're going to sell q units,

259
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,921
we take times the probability of that outcome, dx.

260
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:05,420
OK.

261
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,280
So this is our expected sales.

262
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,120
When we want to take the derivative of this,

263
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,900
it's problematic that we have two functions

264
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,730
in this integral over here.

265
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,907
We have x, which is one function in f of x,

266
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,990
which is another function.

267
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,670
So they're multiplied.

268
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,300
In order to make this simpler, we're

269
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,930
going to make use is something called integration by parts.

270
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,580
Integration by parts says the following.

271
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,280
So suppose you have an integral of one function times

272
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,100
the derivative of another function, then

273
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,730
that is equal to those two functions multiplied

274
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,050
minus the integral of the derivative

275
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,930
of the first function times the other function.

276
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,120
So we're going to use this.

277
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,080
How can we use this?

278
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,550
Well let's see here.

279
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:59,350
We can identify if this integral that we have over here,

280
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,110
let's try to identify it as this one.

281
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,740
It means that x is equal to u, and f of x will be v prime.

282
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,160
In that case, we can rewrite this in this form.

283
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,880
It means that we have first our x

284
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,880
times the primitive of this, which

285
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,390
is the CDF, the cumulative density function.

286
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,910
We have F of x, and that's going to go from-- it's going

287
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,940
to be evaluated at q and o.

288
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,850
We take minus the integral-- the integral is also from 0 to q.

289
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,880
And here in the integral, we have the derivative

290
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,190
of u, which would be the derivative of x, which

291
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,360
is 1, times the primitive of v prime, which

292
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,060
is once again the CDF, dx.

293
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,650
All right?

294
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,710
So this is this first integral expressed using integration

295
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,930
by parts.

296
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,140
Now let's just add the last integral over here--

297
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,160
this part over here, which is integral from q to infinity.

298
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,970
We have q times the probability for those events, dx.

299
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,429
Let's evaluate this part over here.

300
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:02,928
Right?

301
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:03,660
What do we have?

302
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,170
We have q, f of q.

303
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,430
And then we have minus 0 times f of 0-- and that's zero.

304
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,290
Right?

305
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,300
So we're left with nothing.

306
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,950
Now we take minus-- here it's a one multiplied,

307
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,110
so we can take that away-- integral from 0 to q,

308
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,440
cumulative density function, dx.

309
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,910
So let's now focus on this part over here.

310
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,680
What do we have?

311
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,410
Well, we have an integral over a probability density function.

312
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,340
We can take q out because that's just a constant.

313
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,430
We're left with this integral, and this integral

314
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,100
goes from q to infinity and is an integral over a PDF.

315
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,560
When we have it over a PDF, that is a probability density

316
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,060
function.

317
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,396
We know that the integral over that kind of function

318
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,520
will leave us with the cumulative density function.

319
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,130
Right?

320
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,450
The cumulative density function tells us

321
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,570
the cumulative probabilities-- we add everything up.

322
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,890
That's why it's the integral of the PDF.

323
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,910
So really, what we're left with is

324
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,180
the tail of that distribution.

325
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,680
Right?

326
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,220
Because we go from q to infinity.

327
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,650
So it's 1 minus f of q.

328
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,550
It's the last tail all the probability density function.

329
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,050
Right?

330
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,730
It's all the probability mass-- can draw small graph over here

331
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,380
where we have the PDF, the probability density

332
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,794
function, and x.

333
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:25,960
We have something like this.

334
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,839
We have a q over here.

335
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,130
And we want to look at the combined the cumulative mass

336
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,870
of everything above q.

337
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,830
So everything over here from q to infinity,

338
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,790
that is really equal to 1 minus f of q.

339
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,100
All right.

340
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,530
If we look at this further, we see

341
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,480
that q times the cumulative density function

342
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,110
is also what we have over here.

343
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,054
So we can take this out with this,

344
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,470
and we're left with the following.

345
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,300
And we're left with q minus the integral from 0

346
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,610
to the order-- sorry-- 0 to the order quantity,

347
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,580
over the cumulative density function, f of x, times dx.

348
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,090
So this will be our expected sales function.

349
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,720
And the derivative of this expected sales--

350
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,110
that is d s of q with respect to q-- is what?

351
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,610
Right?

352
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,010
We have-- this part over here is just a constant

353
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,500
so the derivative is 1.

354
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,550
Then we take the derivative of an integral

355
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,370
being evaluated at q and 0.

356
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,180
It's just the top evaluation that matters.

357
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,730
So these kind of cancel out, and we're

358
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,240
left with cumulative distribution function at q.

359
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,260
So this is the derivative that we were interested in.

360
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,760
Right?

361
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,010
This is a derivative of the expected sales function.

362
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,810
And it's 1 minus the cumulative distribution function at q.

363
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,560
Actually, this is sometimes referred to as

364
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,470
the complementary CDF, f bar q.

365
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,430
And it's really just the top tail

366
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,070
of the cumulative distribution function.

367
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:51,570
OK.

368
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,790
So now we found the derivative of the expected sales function,

369
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,430
it means that we can move on to take

370
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,660
the derivative of the expected profit function.

371
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,420
So let's do that.

372
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,840
Let's start by noting that the expected profit function, e

373
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,800
of pi of q, is the revenue per unit, p,

374
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,880
times what we expect to sell, given order quantity q.

375
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,340
So s of q minus cost per unit times what we

376
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,967
order, q, plus the salvage cost per unit times

377
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,050
what we expect to salvage.

378
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,900
And we expect to salvage the order quantity

379
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,480
minus what we expect to sell.

380
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,270
So q minus s of q.

381
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,181
Now the derivative is what we want to get at.

382
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:31,680
Right?

383
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,770
So the derivative of the expected profit

384
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:39,760
function with respect to q, here-- this we just found out.

385
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,930
So we take 1.

386
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,880
We know it's 1 minus f of q.

387
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,840
Over here, it's just q, so we're left with constant, c.

388
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,750
Same goes for this-- just a constant,

389
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,130
g, minus g-- and this we had from before

390
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,090
as being 1 minus f of q.

391
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,870
So this is the derivative of the expected profit function.

392
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,684
This we want to set it equal to 0

393
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:08,350
in order to find the extreme point where

394
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,320
the profit is maximized or expected profit is maximized.

395
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,410
So we can do that by collecting the terms.

396
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,480
Let's see what we have-- we have a few constants.

397
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,080
We have p.

398
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,280
We have a c.

399
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,970
And then these will cancel out.

400
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,340
So we have also a minus p f of q.

401
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,576
And we have a plus g f of q.

402
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:33,420
All of this equal to 0.

403
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,320
We can move over p and c.

404
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,810
And then we can take these and divide it by-- so

405
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,610
what do we get?

406
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,900
We get f of q on this side.

407
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,080
We have-- we can move over the p and the c.

408
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,880
So we have minus p plus c.

409
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,300
And then we divide that by g minus p.

410
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,780
Now let's just multiply all by minus 1 over minus 1.

411
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:07,109
We see that this is equal to p minus c over p minus g.

412
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,585
You recognize this?

413
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:11,140
This is the critical ratio.

414
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,640
Right?

415
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,450
So we ended up with the critical ratio using the calculus.

416
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,329
All the steps that I went through,

417
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,944
we end up with the critical ratio

418
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:19,069
that you saw in the lesson.

419
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,569
Right?

420
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,619
So this-- you can see it for yourself.

421
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,160
It's a nice exercise-- look at-- this

422
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,920
is the shortage cost over the shortage

423
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,170
cost plus the excess cost.

424
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,530
So really looking at the critical ratio,

425
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,540
and we're saying here, what is the optimal order quantity?

426
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,730
Or rather, what is the order quantity that

427
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,210
maximizes the expected profit?

428
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,891
Well, it's the inverse.

429
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:40,390
Right.

430
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,240
So q star is equal to the inverse

431
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,090
of the normal distribution function at the critical ratio,

432
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,870
p minus c over p minus g.

433
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:57,330
Now remember from before that p, the average-- or the sales

434
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,540
price per unit, is 160.

435
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,210
The cost is 100.

436
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,570
And the salvage is 60.

437
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,530
So what we want to take the inverse of

438
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,420
is the critical ratio of 0.6.

439
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,130
How do we take this inverse?

440
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,820
Well, it depends on the distribution.

441
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,080
If it's a normal, which is what we have in this case,

442
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,705
there are really two different options.

443
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:21,020
One, we standardize it, and we use the standard tables

444
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,000
to solve it.

445
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,360
Or two, we use some kind of spreadsheet software--

446
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,290
spreadsheet software of choice.

447
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,880
Now before we do that, I wanted to point out

448
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,710
that this is more general than applying

449
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,220
to just a normal distribution.

450
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,210
We haven't really used the fact that it's a normal distribution

451
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,900
yet.

452
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,920
All this-- what this solution is saying here

453
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,260
is that optimal order quantity is

454
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,620
equal to the inverse of the CDF of the demand

455
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,790
distribution evaluated at the critical ratio.

456
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,930
And this could be any type of distribution.

457
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,430
Right?

458
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,340
It could be uniform.

459
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,570
It could be triangular.

460
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,240
It could be beta.

461
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,054
And all it's saying is that we want

462
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:02,220
to take the inverse of that.

463
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,360
So in some cases, it means we could use tables.

464
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,750
In some cases, we use spreadsheet software.

465
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,940
And in some cases, we have a closed form solution,

466
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,630
where we could just use algebra in order to find the optimal q.

467
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,130
OK.

468
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,290
That being said, now it's a normal distribution.

469
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,150
So I'm going to open my spreadsheet software of choice.

470
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,270
And I'm going to use a function called norm in,

471
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,320
as in normal inverse.

472
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,126
What it asks for is the probability

473
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,250
that it's a critical ratio.

474
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,749
Right?

475
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:31,170
It's something between 0 and 1.

476
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,320
In this case, it's 0.6.

477
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,220
And we're going to put in the mean.

478
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,450
I'm going to put in the standard deviation, which is 30.

479
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,400
And then we're going to evaluate this.

480
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,650
And the function gives us 227.6.

481
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,240
So our optimal q-- that is the order

482
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,330
quantity that maximizes expected profit-- is 227.6 books.

483
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,180
That's it.
