1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,110
Now let's talk about how you should

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,580
ask for help, because you'll be working

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,620
on the stuff at different times-- sometimes by yourself,

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,450
sometimes collaborating with others,

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,850
and you might get stuck.

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,960
One of the beautiful things about these online courses

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,210
is that you got a community across the world

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,490
that you could leverage.

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,620
So what I want to do is talk about different ways

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,540
to ask for help, and it really depends on the type of question

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,120
that you're trying to answer.

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,230
And this was inspired by a video that I saw by Robert

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,590
[? Pang ?] and one of our community TAs,

14
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,580
Arun, who asked me to do this and really give me

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,980
some good input.

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,710
All right, so who is out there to help you on course material?

17
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,000
This is really easy.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,630
If you look at this, think of it as

19
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,870
a massive upside-down pyramid.

20
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,020
That most people are the other guys

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,710
taking the class, other guys and gals, people

22
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,720
and fellow students who are doing that.

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,010
10,000 to 30,000 people right now

24
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,390
are working on the exact same problems you are.

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,100
This is one reason why we keep it and release things

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,490
on a weekly schedule.

27
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,320
It kind of pace is the work so you can all talk

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,900
about these things together.

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,420
The next layer are the community TAs,

30
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,860
and these guys are the heroes of any online course.

31
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,630
These are people who've taken the course before

32
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,960
across the world and they did really well originally,

33
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,350
and now they want to give back.

34
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,280
And so they're-- as community TAs--

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,850
they're there to assist you.

36
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,240
They monitor the forum, they give you some guidance

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,300
as you go along.

38
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,890
Not for the graded assignments or the final exam,

39
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,880
for the thing, the components where

40
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,550
you're learning-- the practice problems, the quick questions,

41
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,450
and other general comments.

42
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,590
The next level or the MIT TAs.

43
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,680
We always have a team of about one to three,

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,730
sometimes a little more, TAs that are here

45
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,680
and this is their job.

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,950
And they work certain number of hours per week.

47
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,460
This is to man, mainly, the hotline desk,

48
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,305
any big problems that come up.

49
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:54,430
They also assist in the development of the courses,

50
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,690
as well.

51
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,840
And beneath this is the instructor.

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,964
There's only one of me.

53
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:00,380
Sometimes for some courses there's

54
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,460
two depending on the weeks.

55
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,770
I cannot respond to all 30,000 questions.

56
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,440
That's why we have this whole buffer here,

57
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,630
and I really encourage you to talk

58
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,140
with your fellow classmates for a couple reasons.

59
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,960
One is they probably know the answer to your questions.

60
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,650
Two, this is going to be the start of a longer

61
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,180
career for you, so this is your network.

62
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,370
Get to know your network.

63
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,220
So the more you communicate with others in your network,

64
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,680
the better will help you longer, later, on in your career.

65
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,930
All right.

66
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,340
So I want to ask for help.

67
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,340
There are three paths here.

68
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,110
The first path is the discussion forum.

69
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,510
This is the where for general questions.

70
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,910
If you have thoughts, comments, something

71
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,280
that you saw on the news that you want to comment on,

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,370
this is the perfect place for that.

73
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,210
It's also used for quick questions and practice

74
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,120
problems.

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,710
It is never used for graded assignments.

76
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,020
Don't use is to try to get answers or even

77
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,570
clarify any comments about the graded assignments, that

78
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,430
is not what this is for.

79
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,060
The TAs and the community will monitor and assist you

80
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,380
on the discussion forum.

81
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,980
That's their main area.

82
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,220
The next path is our TA email.

83
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,630
It's SE#Xhelp@MIT.edu, where that number sign is actually

84
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,950
the number of the course.

85
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,250
So if you're taking SE1X, then you send SE1Xhelp@MIT.edu.

86
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,840
If you're taking SE3X, its SE3Xhelp@MIT.edu.

87
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,320
Just makes it simple.

88
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,460
You only use this for clarification questions

89
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,390
on graded assignments and final exams.

90
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,740
Please don't use this just to communicate something, use

91
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,190
the discussion forum for questions and comments.

92
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,210
If you have a specific graded assignment

93
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,380
question of final exam question where

94
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,160
you think there's an error or you see where you don't think

95
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,110
you understand some of the assumptions,

96
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,130
that's what you use this for.

97
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,260
This is not a tip line.

98
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,235
Don't go here and say, hey, got any tips for me,

99
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:01,660
can you help me out here?

100
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,840
That's not what that's for.

101
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,300
Remember, graded assignments are for assessment,

102
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,770
so we want to see how well you can apply those concepts

103
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,870
that hopefully we've taught you in the videos

104
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,070
and you reinforced in the practice problems.

105
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,589
All right, the third pass beyond discussion forums, the TA

106
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,529
email, is edX.

107
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,510
So if you have a question with payment, photo ID,

108
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,230
the verification, a technical platform issue,

109
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,055
we are not the path for you.

110
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:29,380
You Want to go to edX directly.

111
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,010
And here's two places you can go,

112
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,890
one is the contact us form on their website,

113
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,502
the other is a technical edX email address.

114
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:39,710
That's where you go for that.

115
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,680
We will empathize with you if it's not

116
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,840
taking your credit card.

117
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,650
There is nothing we can do here at the course to help you that.

118
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,480
That's an EdX issue, you need to work with them directly.

119
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,250
All right, so which path do you use?

120
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,200
Let's do some examples.

121
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,380
So example one.

122
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,630
You have a question on graded assignment, question 2.3.

123
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,789
It's not accepting decimals.

124
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:02,830
You have a question, it's not accepting something

125
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,590
that you think it should.

126
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,344
Use the TA email.

127
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:07,010
This is perfect.

128
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,280
It's for graded work, so you're not going to use the forum.

129
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,160
And edX won't help you here.

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,320
It's exploring whether there's an error

131
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,170
or if maybe they misunderstand the question.

132
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:21,130
So the TA email is the perfect path for that kind of question.

133
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,490
OK, example two.

134
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,900
I don't understand how to calculate the critical ratio

135
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,810
as shown in video four of lesson whatever.

136
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,190
Well this one is perfect for the discussion forum

137
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,930
because it's a general concept.

138
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,200
It's not tied to grated work, it's for a video.

139
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,640
So hopefully the way to do it is to go to that video

140
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,870
and press the discussion link, and then it'll

141
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,670
automatically classify it.

142
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,906
That way you can-- anyone who's interested in that question--

143
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:48,280
knows where to go for it doesn't have to look through all

144
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,500
the discussion forum.

145
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,790
So the discussion forum is a perfect path for that.

146
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,490
Third example-- hey, why's my credit card being turned down,

147
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,260
I can get verified?

148
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,420
This is edX.

149
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,950
It involves a platform issue.

150
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,630
It's not about the course material,

151
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,590
edX controls all this.

152
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,140
So please use their contact us or technical email address.

153
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,290
Fourth example-- I'm down to my last attempt

154
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,190
on graded assignment question 1.2, I need help.

155
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,790
We get these a lot.

156
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,350
There is no path for this.

157
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,620
Remember, this is in an exam.

158
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,260
This is like taking an exam at school

159
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,030
and standing up in the middle and saying to the teacher, hey,

160
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,870
can you help me with this problem?

161
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,980
The graded assignments are not there for further education,

162
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,320
they're there to assess.

163
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,050
We have all those practice problems in the quick questions

164
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,010
and all those other things, recitations

165
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,040
to help you understand the concepts,

166
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,990
graded assignments are here for assessment.

167
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,650
So if you get stuck with something

168
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,356
and you don't understand how to do something, not

169
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:50,730
a clarification issue, but you don't understand something

170
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,450
in a graded assignment, I suggest you go back

171
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,070
to the practice problems, because I

172
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,180
guarantee there's a practice problem the

173
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,930
covers that similar material.

174
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,700
It won't be the exact same problem,

175
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,980
but it'll cover the same concepts.

176
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,480
OK, last example.

177
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,800
I'm down to my last attempt on practice problem 1.2,

178
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,829
I need help.

179
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,870
Now this one, it's all about the discussion forum

180
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,300
because it's a practice problem, it's not a graded assignment.

181
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,840
So this is where your peers, the TAs, the community TAs

182
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,780
can help you.

183
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,490
We encourage you to collaborate on practice problems.

184
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,110
Use the link at the bottom of the practice problem page

185
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,690
to make sure you are on a focused discussion forum.

186
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,340
We encourage collaboration except in graded assignments

187
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,670
and final exams.

188
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,790
OK, now when you request helpful problem, especially

189
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,000
on the discussion forums, please check and make

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,940
sure it hasn't already been answered.

191
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,040
Nothing's more frustrating than seeing the same question asked

192
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,610
because the person didn't go and look

193
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,250
what was out there previously.

194
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,440
Again, this is a good reason to always use

195
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,840
that link that's right next to each of the practice problems.

196
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,840
So that way you can see which problem the referring

197
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,960
to and you can see who's posted something there,

198
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,634
see if it's already been asked and answered.

199
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:00,800
Be sure to let us know which problem you're talking,

200
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,060
about especially in those emails you send us

201
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,450
for graded assignments.

202
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,380
If you just say I don't understand,

203
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,464
we don't understand.

204
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:09,880
So you've got to help us out and let us know whole problem

205
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,140
you're talking about.

206
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,540
You need to be very explicit what exactly is the problem.

207
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,740
What have you tried?

208
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,862
Sometimes explaining the problem helps

209
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,820
you understand where you made a mistake anyway.

210
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,040
I find this myself.

211
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,350
As I'm explaining something I don't understand,

212
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,360
I understand it and it helps me better comprehend the problem

213
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,620
that I'm working on.

214
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,020
OK, provide the minimum amount of information

215
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,590
needed to help solve.

216
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,460
Don't just post whole spreadsheet

217
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,210
and say hey, take a look at this.

218
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,307
We can't do that.

219
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:39,640
We don't have the time for that.

220
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,110
And so help us out by giving us the minimum amount

221
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,070
of information you think we need to help you solve your problem.

222
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,670
And big one, be courteous.

223
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,520
Whenever you have electronic communication,

224
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,370
whether it's forums, email, texting, people get frustrated,

225
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,590
and frustration translates into anger.

226
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,190
And so try to keep it civil.

227
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,315
We'll try to calm you down.

228
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:02,740
It's just a course, it's no big deal.

229
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,300
Everyone here is trying to help you.

230
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,883
Community TAs are doing this out of the goodness their hearts,

231
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:09,050
they're not on the MIT salary.

232
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,530
So you want to be courteous whenever you interact with us

233
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,280
and we'll try to be courteous back to you.

234
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,060
Let's keep it civil because there's

235
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,810
more to life than just this one question.

236
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,790
Don't get too angry.

237
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,590
And let us know if you solved your problem.

238
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,510
So if you post something and you realize

239
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,135
when you're in the shower the next day,

240
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:26,220
ah, now I figured it out.

241
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,030
Let us know.

242
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,790
We don't need to know that you were in the shower,

243
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,789
but we just need to know you solved the problem.

244
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:32,280
We like to close out the problems.

245
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,200
It helps us know when to stop.

246
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,110
OK, things not to do.

247
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,360
Please don't-- knee jerk reaction is to say,

248
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,710
you know what, there's obviously an error in the problem

249
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,850
because I didn't get the right answer.

250
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,600
99.99% of the time, that's not the case.

251
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,760
Don't make it your default response.

252
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,240
Check your work first.

253
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Please do not post graded assignments

254
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,560
on the discussion forum.

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,190
That's illegal collaboration and we'll

256
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,890
deal with that very severely.

257
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,520
Don't ask the TA to find the problem, especially when you're

258
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,750
sending those clarification emails to us.

259
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,460
That doesn't help us.

260
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,540
We won't find your problem for you on a graded assignment.

261
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,850
Please try to be reasonable in requesting help.

262
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,080
Sending a question every 30 minutes

263
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,419
will not speed things up.

264
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,960
We really look through things as they

265
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,043
come in, we have a team of people looking at this,

266
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:27,150
we're trying to respond within 24 hours, faster if possible.

267
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,540
But emailing us and constantly updating every 30 minutes

268
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,840
won't really speed things up.

269
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,340
And emailing us a question about a graded assignment an hour

270
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,460
before it's due, chances are we're not

271
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,010
going to get to you in time.

272
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,370
You should try to get those done ahead of time.

273
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,870
That's why we give you a lot of time to get those done.

274
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,170
And finally, make sure, to post a question that's legible.

275
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,510
But I know English is not the first language

276
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,390
or primary language for many of you,

277
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,020
but please take the time to at least proofread your email.

278
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,570
Because one of the frustrating things

279
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,010
is trying to troubleshoot the email,

280
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,620
to try to understand how to troubleshoot the problem.

281
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,940
So make it easy for us.

282
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,200
We're here to help you, but try to make it easy

283
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,370
for us, don't make it harder.

284
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,270
All right, last thing about this.

285
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,390
Some examples.

286
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,170
Let me start with, do the good, the bad, and the ugly.

287
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,610
Let's start with the ugly.

288
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,630
So here's an email sent for help and it says,

289
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,620
I get 24.5 but it's not right, I used both practice chances

290
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,330
already.

291
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,330
We have no idea what you want.

292
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,680
This wastes everyone's time.

293
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,340
It wasted your time writing it, it

294
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,980
wastes us because we have no idea what

295
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,520
question you're asking about.

296
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,210
Our response will be something like,

297
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,400
what are you talking about?

298
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,700
What problem?

299
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,567
You got to help us out there.

300
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:38,900
So here's a slightly better one.

301
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,720
Still bad, and you say I get 24.5, there

302
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,540
must be an error in the problem, but at least you tell us

303
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,090
what you're talking about.

304
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,030
So that helps us.

305
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,290
We focused in, but we have no understanding of what you did,

306
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,800
where you went wrong, where your assumptions are.

307
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,870
So always ask those questions.

308
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,220
So by doing either one of these, you're

309
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,850
creating more email responses back and forth which

310
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,510
lengthens the response time.

311
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,500
And here's one that's good, is the same thing,

312
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,855
you let us know where it is, you set the problem up, you ran it

313
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:09,730
but it's not correct.

314
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,790
My solution seems to have a product but nothing

315
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,350
left [? the ?] plants, did I misunderstand some assumptions?

316
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,290
Now we can help you because we know what you're talking about,

317
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,960
we know a little bit about what you did,

318
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,810
and we probably have an inkling of what you need to do.

319
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,100
And it's probably going to be something like this,

320
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,240
you should check your conservation flow constraints.

321
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,450
Anyway what I wanted to do for this section is

322
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,040
this let you know we're here to help you.

323
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,820
There are different has to use depending on your question.
