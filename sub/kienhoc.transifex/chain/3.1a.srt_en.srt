1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,220
In this lesson, we will extend our use

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,660
of exponential smoothing to include seasonality patterns.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,900
Now remember that seasonality is a repeated cycle around a known

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,370
and fixed period.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,190
This means while it get the annual, when

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,830
we think of the four seasons.

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,230
It can also be tied to monthly patterns, weekly patterns,

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,750
daily patterns, day of the week, anything in between,

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,625
anything, again, that is repeated

10
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,720
and run a known fixed period of time.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,110
Now, in practice, most things have some kind

12
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,360
of annual seasonality, especially

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,750
for products that are consumer packaged goods or CPG products

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,220
that some consumer uses at the very end.

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,150
So let's just go through some examples, because this is fun.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,330
So I have the 12 months of the year up here at the top.

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,100
And the winter months, for the Northern hemisphere anyway,

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,930
are in gray, and then the spring is in green,

19
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,170
the summer months are in yellow, and brown

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,740
is in the fall months.

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,820
So let's talk about a couple products, chocolate and candy.

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,450
Where is there peak seasonality?

23
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,750
In fact, there's a two-week period in the United States,

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,470
where 10% of all candy is sold.

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,010
And if you're from the United States, you know this.

26
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,070
It's Halloween.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,640
It's at the end of November.

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,270
And so it's a huge spike in demand.

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,030
Now there's also some around in Easter and Valentine's Day,

30
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,370
but it's an order of magnitude smaller

31
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,540
than the amount of candy that is sold at the end of October,

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,520
the last two weeks here.

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,970
So why do we care about seasonality?

34
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,350
Well, we care about it, because to produce

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,450
10% of all your product over the course of a year in just two

36
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,910
weeks, you've got to start preparing way

37
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,010
in advance and start stockpiling.

38
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,960
You've got to try to figure out how to make that product ahead

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,386
of time, and figure out where you're going to keep it,

40
00:01:45,386 --> 00:01:46,760
and how you're going to make sure

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,274
it's available when that peak demand comes.

42
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:50,690
Now I also have this other period,

43
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,600
because Chinese New Year.

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,310
When I talk about this example in class,

45
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,340
all the students from China say, well, wait a minute.

46
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,160
Chinese New Year is a huge bump for candy.

47
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,670
And that's also true.

48
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,270
So this illustrates another point

49
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,860
that seasonality isn't always the same

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,470
in different parts of the world.

51
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,080
You'll look at Northern hemisphere,

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,780
Southern hemisphere, but also each country

53
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,930
might have different types of seasonality.

54
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,230
Because remember this can be either driven

55
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,520
by nature or by man-made events.

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,090
So Halloween, it has nothing to do with nature.

57
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,890
That's a man-made event, but it is

58
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,280
driving the seasonality of chocolate and candy.

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,780
All right.

60
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,510
Let's do another example.

61
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,640
Salads, whether they're prepackaged or actually

62
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,780
consumed like it's shown here in the little picture in a salad

63
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,819
bar.

64
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,610
So where do you think the peak for that is?

65
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,984
Well, what's interesting, talking

66
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:44,280
to some of the manufacturers of packaged salad goods,

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,010
it's really at these two time periods,

68
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,210
at the end of November, early December and in early January.

69
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,980
Why?

70
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,105
Because you've got big holidays in the US

71
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:58,020
at Christmas, at the end of December, and Thanksgiving,

72
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,390
at the end of November.

73
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,050
So people eat so much that they want to be healthy,

74
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,540
so there's a peak in salad right after that,

75
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,990
because people try to start losing weight again.

76
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,530
Interesting what drives these different seasonalities?

77
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,030
OK.

78
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,050
Another one.

79
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,930
Garden tools.

80
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,700
These are lawn mowers, wheelbarrows,

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,610
anything you need for your lawn or any kind of outdoor repair.

82
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,540
So this kind of would be naturally

83
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,240
where you think in the northern hemisphere,

84
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,920
we'd have things in the spring.

85
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,950
And so you have this big peak in the April,

86
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,380
May timeframe, getting ready for the summer months.

87
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,950
And in the southern hemisphere, you

88
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,600
have just the opposite of course.

89
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,950
This is when their spring is, ready for their summer months.

90
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,580
So you see that it's the same pattern,

91
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,260
but because the winter and summers are flipped

92
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,530
for the hemispheres, they will offset each other.

93
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,720
Last one.

94
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,870
Cloth bandages.

95
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,920
When someone from a company told me about this,

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,900
I didn't believe it.

97
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,410
So there is seasonality with the cloth bandages.

98
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,900
And in the US, the peak time, 4th of July.

99
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,260
Why 4th of July?

100
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,080
Because that's one of the major times

101
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,150
that people use fireworks.

102
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,530
And so there's a lot of hand injuries and people

103
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,370
hurting themselves by doing fireworks in their backyard.

104
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,300
It's a huge seasonality for cloth bandages.

105
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,100
And again, the Chinese students in my class

106
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,870
say, well, wait a minute.

107
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,089
The Chinese New Year, that's also a peak as well.

108
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,589
And so again, this is not because of nature.

109
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,340
This is a man-made event.

110
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,160
So the point of this is, it's interesting

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,740
always to see what the seasonality is

112
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,979
for different products.

113
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,020
And you should always be aware that there usually

114
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,260
is some kind of seasonality.

115
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,300
It's rare that you have an item that

116
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,490
is steady state across the year or across a month.

117
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,390
In fact, for a lot of times, you see seasonality

118
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,670
driven by sales, and you've got this sawtooth diagram

119
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,950
where you have big sales or at the end of a financial quarter,

120
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,670
because sales guys are trying to make their quotas.

121
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,990
And that's a kind of an artificial seasonality,

122
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,365
but still it's something present.

123
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,198
And you might want to try and get rid of it,

124
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,390
but it's something we as supply chain professionals

125
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,640
have to deal with.

126
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,140
All right, what are we going to talk

127
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,710
about in the rest of this video?

128
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,918
Well, we're only going to talk about a couple things,

129
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:08,650
but it'll take a little while.

130
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,580
We'll start talking about seasonality

131
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,130
and how we include that in exponential smoothing.

132
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,170
We'll introduce a double exponential smoothing

133
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,050
model that takes care of level and seasonality.

134
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,010
Then, we'll introduce the Holt-Winter model

135
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,160
that takes care of all three of the patterns that we've

136
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,180
been looking at, level, trend, and seasonality.

137
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,500
Then we'll talk about initialization of parameters,

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,890
something we've been ignoring over the last two videos

139
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,764
and lectures.

140
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:35,180
And then we'll finish up with some practical concerns that

141
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,560
are just about exponential smoothing and forecasting

142
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,590
in general.

143
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,210
All right.

144
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,100
Let's get started.
