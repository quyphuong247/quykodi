1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,430
So we talked about the cumulative forecast

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,620
where all the history matters and is treated equally.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,029
Then we talked about the naive forecast, where you only

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,810
use the latest history, the latest observation--

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,235
only yesterday matters.

6
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:15,110
And you might think, well, these are extreme,

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,840
there must be some kind of compromise.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,550
And there is.

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,490
It's the moving average forecast.

10
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,100
And this can actually be seen not just

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,840
as a compromise between the two.

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,950
It's a way to generalize.

13
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,150
So what does this model look like?

14
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,840
What we do is we don't include all the data necessarily.

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,905
We only include the last M, whatever M is.

16
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:36,530
M is a variable.

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,770
We include that many observations.

18
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,530
And this is, like I said, a compromise

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,430
between the cumulative and the naive.

20
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,760
So let's look at it.

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,730
The underlying model is still that stationary model,

22
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,540
where the demand for time in time period t

23
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,010
is going to be equal to some level,

24
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,220
plus the error term, some variance around it, some noise.

25
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,330
And that variance, that noise or the error,

26
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,090
is going to have a mean of 0 and a variance of some variance.

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,660
But the big thing is that mean is 0, so we're not biased.

28
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,690
So the forecasting model for this, it looks complicated,

29
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,220
but it's really straightforward.

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,200
So my forecast for demand sitting in time period

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,270
t for time period t plus 1 is going

32
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,370
to be equal to the sum of the demand over the last m periods,

33
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,540
divided by m, the number of periods I'm including.

34
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,740
So this term, I equals t plus 1 minus m,

35
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,840
simply goes back m periods.

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,630
So if I'm in time period six and my m is 4,

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,840
then I'm going to go back six, five, four, three, two.

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,830
So it's just going back that many time periods.

39
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,180
So here I have the same data we've been looking at.

40
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,250
The first column is the time period.

41
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,130
The second column is the demand.

42
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,510
And then I've got in the red the naive forecast.

43
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,710
And we showed how to do that.

44
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,340
In the green on the other end of the table

45
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,450
is the cumulative forecast.

46
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,990
And again, in those columns, in these last five columns,

47
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,220
this is the forecasted demand made

48
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,770
at time period t for the next time period t plus 1.

49
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,040
So for these five columns on the right,

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,100
we're all looking at the next period demand forecast.

51
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,590
So let's plot these.

52
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,710
And here, I put the actual.

53
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,970
And again, I connected the actual domains with the line.

54
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,270
And here's the naive.

55
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,400
And again, it's just a shift of one.

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,290
You can see it's very volatile, very noisy.

57
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,250
And now let's see what the M2 is.

58
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,640
The M2 is the moving average of two periods.

59
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,500
So the moving average that the forecast

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,490
made at time two for the next period, time three,

61
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,030
we're going to say is 100.5, which

62
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,419
is just the average of 109 plus 92.

63
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:57,960
And so that's going to be right here.

64
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,970
And then the next period, the forecast

65
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,090
made at time three for time period four,

66
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,142
is going to be 95, which is just the average of these two.

67
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:09,850
So you're just making the moving average.

68
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,410
You're averaging the last m periods.

69
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,370
In this case, it's m2.

70
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,310


71
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,970
And then you can see the same thing happens for M4 and M6.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,950
Two things to point out-- one is I can't start the M2 forecast

73
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,150
until two periods after.

74
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,500
I need two periods to have something to average.

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,480
Same thing for the four-- the M4,

76
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,060
I need four periods to be able to do something.

77
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,450
M6, I need six periods.

78
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,750
So one of the things is, as I use more history in my forecast

79
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,840
model, I need more history.

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,800
For the naive model, I don't need any history.

81
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,520
I just need what happened yesterday.

82
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,020
That's the only history I need.

83
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,260
For these other models, I need two periods, four periods,

84
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,420
or six periods, because that's how long it takes to average.

85
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,450
The other thing is, notice what happens.

86
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,790
They approach the cumulative model.

87
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,580
They get calmer and calmer as I increase the number of periods.

88
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,440
So as M gets bigger, I get calmer.

89
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,680
Versus the naive, which is essentially equivalent to what?

90
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,630
M equals 1.

91
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,510
So at M equals 1, it's very volatile.

92
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,136
As M approaches t, it starts getting very calm.

93
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:27,980
So this is why it's a trade off.

94
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,570
And in fact, it's really just a generalization.

95
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,570
If I plug in M is equal to t, all the data,

96
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,720
I will have the cumulative model.

97
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,930
If I plug in M is equal to 1, I will be the naive model.

98
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,680
So it's something in between is that compromise.

99
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,230
But you can model either of them just

100
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,040
by picking the appropriate M. So how big should M be?

101
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,110
Well, if it's too small, then you're

102
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,910
going to be overly responsive to noise.

103
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,243
You're going to be very nervous.

104
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:57,630
You're going to have that very volatile forecast, the naive

105
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,230
forecast.

106
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,710
And if it's too big, you're going to miss step changes.

107
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,050
You're going to average out all that noise.

108
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,690
So there's no one definite always

109
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,020
use this value of M. People typically use practical value.

110
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,460
So if I'm looking at months of forecast,

111
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,920
I might do it over six sometimes three.

112
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,590
So you're averaging over the quarter.

113
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,620
Or you might average, if it's a long period,

114
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,760
over a 12 month moving average.

115
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,780
So it really depends.

116
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,030
You want to see what the purpose is.

117
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,390
If the purpose is to see a long term trend,

118
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,677
you can go for a longer M.

119
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:31,260
If it's used for other purposes, you might want to shorten it.

120
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,470
But there's no hard and fast rules of what your M should be.

121
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,150
There's no optimal value.

122
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,450
Two points, though-- or the main point

123
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,360
I want to make before we move on is

124
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,170
to note that this moving average model will always

125
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,350
lag any change.

126
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,560
And this is for two reasons.

127
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,230
The first is we're still assuming

128
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,220
that's stationary demand.

129
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,450
Remember, we're still assuming that the model, the forecast,

130
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,690
is going to be equal to a level plus some kind of noise.

131
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,190
And so I'm assuming this level.

132
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,970
So if something happens, a trend or a step change,

133
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,020
if something moves, I'm going to miss that,

134
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,010
because I'm assuming a stationary demand.

135
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,330
I'm going to assume that that's just some noise.

136
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,740
And the larger the M, the longer that lag is going to be,

137
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,880
the longer it'll take for that change, that step change,

138
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,330
that trend to show up.

139
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,860
And we'll talk more about this.

140
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,050
And this is also a function because we've

141
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,470
got that stationary demand.
