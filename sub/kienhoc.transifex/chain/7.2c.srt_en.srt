1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,410
So let's take a look at how to calculate the expected

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,850
units short.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,140
First though, let's look at the other values

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,922
that we're going to have to find expected values of.

5
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:11,880
And so I'm going to look at this for two cases.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,810
One is where we have a continuous variable for demand,

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,320
and that could be something like the Normal distribution,

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,650
as well as a discrete case.

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,300
And this is where I might have --

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,640
my demand only takes discrete values like a Poisson

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,680
distribution.

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,830
So I'm always going to have to calculate

13
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,580
my expected units demanded.

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,830
This is my expected amount of demand,

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,770
or my mean value of the demand distribution.

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,280
And this is simply going to be for the discrete case.

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,070
The summation from x=0 to infinity of the value

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,020
of demand, x, times the probability that that

19
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,290
occurrence happens.

20
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,530
We'll call this sometimes x hat.

21
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,537
And you can see for the continuous case,

22
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:50,370
it's the same thing.

23
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,870
Instead of a summation, I have an integral from zero

24
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,760
to infinity of x times the probability distribution

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,670
function f(x)dx and again, it's x hat.

26
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,830
Now we'll also want to calculate the expected units sold.

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,680
And we've talked about this before,

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,800
but it consists of two terms.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,360
The first term is when demand is less than my order quantity,

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,920
and the second term is when the demand

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,990
is greater than my order quantity.

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,360
So two summations, and for the first one,

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,590
I'm going to sell x, the demand, and for the second term,

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,350
I'm only going to be able to sell Q,

35
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,400
because that's all that I have on hand.

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,570
And the continuous case is the same as the discrete case,

37
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,230
with the exception that the summations are now integrals.

38
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,210
The last case, though, is what we're

39
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,510
going to focus on in this lesson, in this short video.

40
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,890
That's the expected units short.

41
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,070
So for the discrete case, let's take a look at it.

42
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,690
It's going to be a summation from the x is just

43
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,160
greater than my order quantity up to infinity

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,510
and it's going to be x - Q. So it's

45
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,050
the amount above my order quantity,

46
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,240
times the probability that that value of x occurs.

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,990
And I've got the same form over here on the continuous case.

48
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,210
What I want you to think about, though,

49
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,470
is these are all related.

50
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,880
So I can think my expected units demanded

51
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,100
is going to be equal to my expected units sold

52
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,240
plus my expected units short.

53
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,740
So look at that, look at the terms

54
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,620
and convince yourself that it's true.

55
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,140
Expected units demanded is going to be equal of two components.

56
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,400
One is the expected units sold, plus the expected units

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,950
that I'm going to be short.

58
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,810
So now let's go into the expected units short,

59
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,570
and I'm going to explain this through a simple example

60
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,470
of a discrete case.

61
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,440
So suppose I'm selling freshly baked widgets.

62
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,850
We don't know what widgets are, it doesn't matter.

63
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,790
Here's the demand distribution.

64
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,490
I'll sell between one and eight.

65
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,960
Equal probability for each, so it's

66
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,787
1/8 or 0.125 probability for each.

67
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:08,120
At the end of the day, all the widgets that are not sold

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,840
are thrown out.

69
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,660
So therefore it's a Newsvendor Problem.

70
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,480
It's a single period inventory model.

71
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,420
And suppose based on my Critical ratio and all

72
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,620
that, I'm going to order 5 units each day.

73
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,630
So my Q=5.

74
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,180
So I'm giving that to you.

75
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,030
What we want to figure out is what is my Expected Demand.

76
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,730
Remember that x hat?

77
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,820
I want to find my expected units that I'm going to sell,

78
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,630
and I want to find my expected units short.

79
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,320
So here's our example again.

80
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,390
And remember, I have 5 units that I already had.

81
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,130
That's my Q. And you can see the probability

82
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,930
for each of the other values of x is equal; it's 0.125.

83
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,910
And so the first thing I want to find is my Expected Demand.

84
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,600
So what is the average demand?

85
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,700
We could probably eyeball the distribution up here and figure

86
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,160
out what it's going to be, but essentially all we're going

87
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,050
to do -- it's a sum product.

88
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,170
I'm multiplying this array times this array.

89
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,750
So it's going to be the demand value, 1,

90
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,325
times the probability, 0.125; plus 2 (the demand) times

91
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,074
the probability that I have a demand of 2,

92
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:16,529
which is 0.125 (that's 0.25); 3 times 0.125 and so on...

93
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:22,620
And I add those all up and I get an expected value of 4.5 units.

94
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,490
Now this is the Expected Demand, and note

95
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,360
that this doesn't take into account what the value of Q

96
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,180
is at all.

97
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,370
It doesn't matter.

98
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,760
It's the pure demand.

99
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,542
But the next thing we want to look at is the expected sales.

100
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,000
And we can think of this, actually,

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,700
as a conditional expectation.

102
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,740
We're finding the expected units sold

103
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,050
given that my order quantity is 5 because now it matters.

104
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,780
Remember, 5 units, so let me just draw a line here.

105
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,920
That means up to demand equal to 5,

106
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,090
I will sell the amount of the demand.

107
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,420
So if demand -- only 1 unit of demand comes in, I'm going

108
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,080
to sell that.

109
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,360
And if 2 comes in, I'll sell 2.

110
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,420
Above 5 though, I'm only going to be able to sell 5.

111
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,130
So again, this is just simply going

112
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,820
to be the x times the probability of x for the values

113
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,390
of the demand up until my Q. And then

114
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,150
down here, for any value greater than Q,

115
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,712
it's simply going to be Q times the probability

116
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:26,130
of that x value.

117
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,620
And so again I'm going to sum these up,

118
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,060
and I get my expected sales -- let me clean that up a little

119
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,120
bit -- is 3.75 units.

120
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,570
So with this Q of 5, I expect to sell 3.75 units on average.

121
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,970
Now the last thing we want to figure out

122
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,720
is expected units short.

123
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,300
Again, this is a conditional expectation.

124
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,100
It's the expected units short given

125
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,780
that I have 5 units on hand.

126
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,750
My Q is 5.

127
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,270
So all I'm going to do is figure out this loss function.

128
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,120
And we call this L_q or L(Q), and it's

129
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,640
equal to the x, the demand, minus the Q,

130
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,960
given that my demand is greater than or equal to my Q.

131
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,650
So my loss is going to be 0 up until I hit 6 units of demand.

132
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,390
Why?

133
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,540
Well if I have 5 units of inventory,

134
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,690
if I have 5 units hanging out, and I have a demand of 3,

135
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,010
will I be short any?

136
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,530
No.

137
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,330
I have enough to cover it so I won't have any loss.

138
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,850
However, if I have 5 on hand, and 6 units of demand come in,

139
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,700
then I'm going to be short 1.

140
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,300
So my loss function is going to be 6 minus 5, or 1.

141
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,805
If 7 units of demand come in, my loss function

142
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:50,480
is going to be 7 minus 5, or 2.

143
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,105
Eight units of demand comes in, 8 minus 5 is 3.

144
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:55,810
I'm going to take each of those losses,

145
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,710
multiply it by the probability that it occurs, and I get this.

146
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,750
Which is simply just the loss -- the L(Q) --

147
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,540
times the probability of that x.

148
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,760
And I'm gonna sum that up.

149
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,010
So my expected units short is 0.75.

150
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:16,650
So notice that my Expected Demand, my x hat, remember,

151
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,420
was 4.5.

152
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,680
My expected units that I actually sold

153
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,120
was equal to 3.75.

154
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,220
And my expected units short, this was equal to 0.75.

155
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,950
Notice that I didn't need to calculate all three,

156
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,300
because once I have two, I know the third.

157
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,260
4.5 = 3.75 + 0.75.

158
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,650
The Expected Demand is equal to the expected units

159
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,580
to be sold, plus the expected units short.

160
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,220
OK, now we're going to take a case,

161
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,250
and we're gonna look at it with the Normal distribution.
