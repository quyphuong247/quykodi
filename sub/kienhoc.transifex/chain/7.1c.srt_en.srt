1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,260
OK, let's solve the EOQ- Planned Backorders.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,820
We last left with this Total Relevant Cost equation,

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,110
which is a function of the order quantity, Q, and the quantity

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,870
I'm allowed to backorder, b.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,140
We had the three terms -- the Ordering Cost,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,010
then the cost of holding inventory,

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,230
and then the cost of stocking out, or the Shortage Cost.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,620
It's a continuous function.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,510
So how do we find the minimum value for this?

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,930
We take first order conditions, set them equal to zero.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,590
Since I have two equations, I've got

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,790
to use partial differential equations.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,840
A full derivation is attached in the PDF to this unit,

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,470
if you want to see that, but the end result is what's important.

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,439
So we end up with optimal form for the Q*_PBO,

16
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,480
that's the optimal quantity we're going to order.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,850
And I subscripted it with PBO, so we

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,820
know it's for Planned Backorders.

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,360
And then we'll also be able to determine the b*,

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,230
the optimal amount we're willing to stock out.

21
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,550
So the form of the Q*_PBO is right here, I'm boxing it.

22
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,970
Why is that important?

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,190
Well, we're going to see that this ratio of (c_s / c_e) + c_s

24
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,680
is going to be very important.

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,090
It plays a big role going forward.

26
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,040
And so we're saying that the new Q*_PBO is going to be equal

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,650
to the old Q*, which is the optimal quantity,

28
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,740
the EOQ when Backorders were not allowed,

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,900
times sqrt ((c_s + c_e) / c_s), which is just a ratio

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,300
of the sum of the Excess and Shortage Cost divided

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,250
by the Shortage Cost.

32
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:38,410
The b* is going to be equal to the Q*_PBO times (1 -

33
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,920
(c_s) / (c_s + c_e).

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,440
So if I know the forms for the new Q* and the new b*,

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,050
then I can figure out my Inventory Policy:

36
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,780
It's simply order Q*_b0 when Inventory On Hand is equal

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,530
to -b*.

38
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,720
Or comparably I could say order Q*_PBO,

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,450
quantity we figured out every T* PBO time periods.

40
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,540
Now, remember, once I figure out a Q,

41
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,020
I know the T, and vice versa.

42
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,430
So the important thing here is this Critical Ratio,

43
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,420
this ratio of the Cost of Shortage divided

44
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,880
by the sum of the Cost of Shortage plus Cost of Excess.

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,690
We see that it plays a role here in the determination of b,

46
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,370
and the inverse of it plays a role in determining what

47
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,600
the new Q* is going to be.

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,520
This Critical Ratio is something we're

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,590
going to use a lot of going forward.

50
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,570
So let's take a closer look at it just for a second.

51
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,460
We know that the range of the Critical Ratio

52
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,200
can take is between 0 and 1, because c_s / (c_s + c_e)

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,850
can never be negative.

54
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,910
And it can't be greater than 1 since it's

55
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,700
a part of the denominator.

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,010
So on this chart I have here, on the horizontal axis,

57
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,480
you see it goes from 0 to 1, and this is the Critical Ratio.

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,640
So this is the Critical Ratio on the horizontal axis.

59
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,040
And on the vertical axis is the Q*_PBO as a percentage of Q*.

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,260
So it's the Q* allowing Backorders divided by the Q*

61
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,060
not allowing Backorders.

62
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,100
So let's take some extremes, because it's always

63
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,490
helpful to look at extreme values first.

64
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,920
So what happens if the c_s is very, very big?

65
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:30,080
Now, remember, we know that Q*_PBO is equal to Q* times

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,280
the sqrt(1/CR).

67
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,510


68
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,900
So what happens as the Critical Ratio gets really big?

69
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,270
Well, as you can see, as it gets really big, it can go up to 1.

70
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,190
This term, this sqrt(1/CR) will go to 1,

71
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,160
which means that Q*_PBO will equal Q*.

72
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,150
So it's really costly to be short,

73
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,980
essentially not allowing it.

74
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,960
If it goes really, really high, then, essentially, I'm

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,220
going to order what I normally order for EOQ when

76
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,085
I don't allow Backorders.

77
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:09,850
At the other extreme, what if c_s is very small?

78
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,470
Well, when it's very small, then we're going to make our Q*_PBO

79
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,040
very, very big.

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,820
It'll be tremendously higher.

81
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,550
It's essentially saying at the end of the year,

82
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,927
I will place the order for all the demand

83
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,510
that I had up to that year, because it

84
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,670
costs next to nothing for them to stock out.

85
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,700
So I'll order at the last possible time

86
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,840
and I'll order a very, very big amount.

87
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,540
But I can plot this relationship for all the values of CR

88
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,350
and I get this kind of curve, which is very useful to see.

89
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,140
And so now you can see that, based

90
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,480
on the ratio of how big the Shortage Costs are compared

91
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,590
to the Excess Costs, that tells me and sets

92
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,620
how much I'm going to order.

93
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,340
And it's a trade-off, again, between the Shortage

94
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,506
and the Excess Costs.

95
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:57,005
