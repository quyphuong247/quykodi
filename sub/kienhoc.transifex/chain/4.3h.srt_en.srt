1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,280
All right.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,196
Let's go over the key points from this lesson,

3
00:00:03,196 --> 00:00:05,400
the extensions to the EOQ model.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,730
Hopefully by now, you're very comfortable with EOQ,

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,650
and you can see it's a great place to start.

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,070
It's very robust, it's simple to calculate,

7
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,190
and again, it's a great starting point.

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,710
And as you saw from this lesson, we

9
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,300
can extend it to cover many different variations.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,044
First thing we did was we looked at the lead time.

11
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:22,460
Instead of it being instantaneous,

12
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,480
we said what happens if it was a positive, constant number.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,220
We saw it had no effect on Q*.

14
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,710
It does not impact the optimal quantity you will order.

15
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,116
It does change how you want to monitor your inventory, though.

16
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:35,490
And as we said, you want to start

17
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,900
looking at the position of the inventory, not just what

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,190
you have on hand.

19
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,610
You have to include what's in the pipeline.

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,610
And your timing of the replenishment

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,930
changes-- you look at when your inventory position is

22
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,610
less than or equal to the demand times the lead time.

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,000
So essentially, you're going to place your order when

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,700
your inventory position is such that you only

25
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,770
have enough inventory to cover until your next replenishment

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,024
is supposed to arrive.

27
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:02,190
Then we looked at discounts.

28
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,879
We looked at the All Units, Incremental, and One Time Buy.

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,670
Very common in practice.

30
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,750
The first two, All Units and Incremental,

31
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,880
really look at the situation where

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,690
if you order above a certain amount,

33
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,950
your purchase price, c, changes.

34
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,242
Therefore, it becomes relevant.

35
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:19,700
And all we did there was look at the different break points

36
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,450
and compare and see whether it made sense to take the discount

37
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,530
or not, at that breakpoint volume.

38
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,360
Then we looked at One Time Buy, and that's

39
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,230
where you want to decide-- do I take advantage of this one time

40
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,820
deal, and if so, how much?

41
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,060
And what happens there is, we turn into a finite problem.

42
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,740
We want to look over the time frame

43
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,570
that it would take to deplete that Qg amount of quantity.

44
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,650
And then finally, we looked at the EPQ,

45
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,400
the economic production quantity.

46
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,280
This is where we have finite replenishments.

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,960
And so items become available incrementally over time,

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,010
as I make them.

49
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,780
They don't just come all at once.

50
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,400
And we saw what that leads to is a lower holding

51
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,490
cost because you're making stuff-- as you're making stuff,

52
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,640
you're not having it incur a holding cost,

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,580
and that leads to a higher EPQ.

54
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,289
So these are our three simple extensions.

55
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,244
And so hopefully this helped you understand EOQ a little more.

56
00:02:12,244 --> 00:02:14,410
