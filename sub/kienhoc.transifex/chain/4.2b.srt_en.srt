1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,720
So now let's derive the equation for EOQ,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,280
how to solve it analytically.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,440
We already saw how we could solve it using a chart

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,830
and find where the minimum value is, as I plot the holding

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,500
cost and the order cost with relation to the order quantity.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,770
But let's find out how to solve it analytically.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,660
So what I have is this continuous equation,

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,505
this total relevant cost as a function of Q. Remember,

9
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:27,900
it's just the sum of the ordering cost and the holding

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,190
cost.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,830
And all I want to do is find where at this point

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,110
is the minimum.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,560
And to do that, if you remember back from Calculus I,

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,390
you take a first derivative, you set it equal to 0

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,280
and solve for Q. And then to make sure it's global min,

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,770
then you want to make sure and take a second derivative.

17
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,990
And you want to say if it's a minimum,

18
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,910
I know that the second derivative will always

19
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,340
be greater than 0.

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,710
And if it's a global max, it's always going to be less than 0.

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,880
So let's see what we've got.

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,240
We start with this equation, we take a first derivative.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,280
Very straightforward.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,031
Set it equal to 0, and I'm going to solve for Q.

25
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,489
And I have all the steps here, just

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,738
in case you want to follow it.

27
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:08,570
It's really simple algebra.

28
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:14,347
But we end up with Q* = sqrt(2) times the cost per order times

29
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:16,840
the annual demand divided by the unit cost for holding

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,590
inventory.

31
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,100
Now, to make sure that it's a global minimum,

32
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,377
we want to go and take a second derivative.

33
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:25,960
So I take a second derivative of this.

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,830
Again, pretty straightforward.

35
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,920
And I end up with this term, 2 times the cost

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,890
per order times the annual demand

37
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,260
over the cube of the order quantity.

38
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,490
The important thing here is that this value will always

39
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,510
be greater than 0.

40
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,490
The ordering cost will never be negative.

41
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,290
The annual demand won't be negative.

42
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,480
And you're never going to order a negative amount.

43
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,790
So this value will always be greater than 0.

44
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,400
Therefore, this is a global minimum.

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,750
And so this is the EOQ equation that you'll be using a lot of.

46
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,600
But now let's find some other things.

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,410
Let's find the time between replenishments for the optimal

48
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:09,340
Q. And remember, here's our Q* and that T* is simply Q* over

49
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,960
D. Remember, because Q* is units per order, D is units per year,

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,480
and if the units cancel out, this tells me the years between

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,530
the order.

52
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,840
So I could just divide Q* by D. Or I could find it in terms

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,860
of the input variables.

54
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,110
And all I did was just carry it out with a Q* in here.

55
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,510
And so I know that the T* going to be = sqrt(2 times the cost

56
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,250
per order divided by the annual demand and divided by the cost

57
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,880
per holding inventory per unit).

58
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,230
So either way, you can do this.

59
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,310
And sometimes it's also helpful to have this in terms of the N,

60
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,320
which is just the inverse of T, 1/T.

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,630
Because T will tell you the years between each order.

62
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,940
The N will tell you the number of orders

63
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,910
you'll place in the time of a year.

64
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,950
The critical thing, whichever you do,

65
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,720
is it's always helpful to put the T* in units that make

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,340
sense.

67
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,240
Telling someone that its 0.33 years per every order

68
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,450
isn't as helpful sometimes as saying you order three times

69
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,190
a year.

70
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,800
And so make sure it's in units of time that

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,670
make sense to the decision maker.

72
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,350
OK, the last thing I want to do is find the total relevant cost

73
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,010
for this optimal Q. So I've got my total relevant cost equation

74
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,050
here.

75
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,650
And here's the Q* we just derived.

76
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,960
And what I'm going to do is just plug the Q* back in.

77
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,120
Going to clean it up a little bit by moving terms around,

78
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,350
combining some common terms.

79
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,950
And you end up with this total relevant cost = the sqrt(2

80
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,420
times the cost per transaction-- the order cost--

81
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,240
times the inventory holding cost per unit time times the annual

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,410
demand).

83
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,120
Now, remember this total relevant cost is not

84
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,750
the same thing as the total cost.

85
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,130
I've got to add back in the purchase cost, which

86
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,920
is c times D. Now, notice that this purchase cost has

87
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,060
no bearing on what the optimal order quantity is.

88
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,560
It just helps me when I need to know

89
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,320
what my total cost is going to be.

90
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,960
But the purchase cost doesn't impact

91
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,661
what my order quantity is going to be.

92
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,160
All right.

93
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,260
So let's do a really simple example.

94
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,610
This should look familiar.

95
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,630
This is the same example we did to get an intuition.

96
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,290
So we know our demand, our D, is 2,000 units per year.

97
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,660
We know our transaction cost, our c_t is $500 per order.

98
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,282
We figured out our c_e, our cost of excess inventory, is $12.50.

99
00:04:38,282 --> 00:04:40,220
Let me just write that in there.

100
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,000
It's just 50 times 0.25.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,710
And I think that's all we need to know.

102
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,410
Our c is $50 per unit.

103
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,980
So what do I want to figure out?

104
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,800
Well, I want to figure out Q*.

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,060
So as we just figured out, this is going to be = sqrt( 2 times

106
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:07,771
my c_t which I said was 500, times my D, which is 2,000--

107
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:09,570
let me just spread that out.

108
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,760
This is going to be divided by my c_e which is 12.5).

109
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,630
So I get a Q* = 400 units per order.

110
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,130
All right.

111
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,920
And from this, I can very easily figure out my T* What is

112
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,580
my order frequency going to be?

113
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,800
And that's simply-- remember, the Q* over D.

114
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,340
And that's going to be 400 units over 2,000 units per year,

115
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:47,010
which equals 0.2 years per order.

116
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,370
Like I said, that's not so helpful, right?

117
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,700
So if I multiply it by 365 for the days in the year,

118
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,950
I can get this 73 days per order.

119
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,670
But what might be even more helpful

120
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,340
is to put this in terms of N, which is simply the inverse.

121
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,840
Right?

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:15,610
1/T* And that's simply going to be 2,000 over 400, which is 5.

123
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,300
And that's 5 orders per year, which

124
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,830
makes it a little easier to understand.

125
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,330
OK.

126
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,430
We also want to figure out our total relevant cost.

127
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,260
And remember, we said our total relevant cost is going to be =

128
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,440
sqrt( 2 times c_t times c_e times D).

129
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,210
And that's going to be = sqrt (2-- cost per transaction

130
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,110
we said was, what, 500?

131
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,020
12.50 for the cost of holding inventory per unit time,

132
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,250
and I think we had 2,000 units per year).

133
00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:01,290
So I got my total relevant cost to be $5,000 per year.

134
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,500
Check for yourself.

135
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,600
Plug this back in to the straight TRC equation,

136
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,240
and you'll find out that holding cost = ordering cost = 2,500.

137
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,740
Right?

138
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,150
It's even for this.

139
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,880
It's where those two are equal.

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,220
What's my total cost from this?

141
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,060
Well, I've got to add in my purchase cost, cD,

142
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,920
plus my total relevant cost.

143
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,490
So that's going to be equal to, what? c is, what did I say?

144
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,980
50 times 2,000.

145
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,660
And I've got to add in my $5,000, which I just

146
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,710
figured out from my total relevant cost.

147
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:48,430
And this comes out to be $105,000 per year.

148
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,770
100,000 of that is in the purchase of the product itself.

149
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,370
The 5,000 is in the inventory holding

150
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,504
costs and the ordering costs.

151
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:58,420
So at the end of the day, I want to figure out

152
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,910
what is my inventory policy.

153
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:07,710
So my policy is going to be really straightforward.

154
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:14,290
I want to order Q* which is 400 units.

155
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,240
Right?

156
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:23,616
And I want to order this when inventory on hand = 0.

157
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:25,490
Because remember, we said the assumption here

158
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,270
is when I place the order, it gets delivered immediately.

159
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:36,140
Another way I could say this is I would say that I order 400

160
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:46,160
units every 73 days, which is T* So all we did is state

161
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,610
our policy in terms of Q* and T* so it could be implemented.

162
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,690
And that's the whole essence of an inventory policy.

163
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,100
And this is how you do it for assuming an economic order

164
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,650
quantity.

165
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,559
