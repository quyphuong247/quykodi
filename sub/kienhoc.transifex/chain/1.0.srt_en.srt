00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,017
Welcome to SC1X Supply Chain Fundamentals.

2
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:04,850
And so what we're going to do in this course

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,590
is apply all of the techniques and methodologies

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,330
that you've learned previously.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,480
Now recall what we started with the supply chain is that it's

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,550
all about managing flows.

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,600
You have a customer and a supplier.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,380
And so you can think about the flow of information

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,840
where someone places an order, and then you've

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,490
got that physical flow that comes back

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,220
of the actual product itself.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,950
And then hopefully, you get paid.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,640
And so there's some money or financial transaction.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,260
And now also there is some information

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,324
in between for these different exchanges.

16
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:42,740
And so in this course, we're going

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,640
to focus primarily, not exclusively, but primarily

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,266
on this physical flow.

19
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,390
Because we're dealing with the logistics of things,

20
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,370
the flow of materials.

21
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,500
Now this is the simple view of it.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,330
But we all know that there's actually

23
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,280
a lot of interaction in your whole supply chain.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,480
So if this is you, you have your suppliers

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,069
that are giving you product, and they, in turn,

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,690
have their own suppliers.

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,850
And then you have your customers.

28
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,130
And then they distribute their product down.

29
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,620
And you have this nice complicated supply chain

30
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,850
or supply web that you've got to control or manage or operate

31
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,750
within.

32
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,690
And so everything we're going to do in this course deals

33
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,134
with how you manage this complex operation.

34
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:26,550
We'll start with something simple,

35
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,974
but we'll try to make it more and more realistic.

36
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:30,640
And what we're going to function on here

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,310
is-- what we're going to work on are three areas, forecasting,

38
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,280
inventory, and transportation.

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,830
These are the things that we're going to work on.

40
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,230
Now, the key word that we have across all

41
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,160
of the topics that we will talk in this course

42
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,721
is the word trade-off.

43
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:49,350


44
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,470
And so everything we do in this course

45
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,150
is a series of trade-offs.

46
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,460
And it's mainly between money, financial costs, and what's

47
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,160
known as level of service.

48
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,210
How well you serve.

49
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,680
How fast you serve.

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,900
How often you have product there.

51
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,630
So this whole idea of level of service and cost.

52
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,940
And there is a series of other trade-offs that we have,

53
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,500
and we'll focus on those.

54
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,140
The way that we'll handle and make those trade-offs

55
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,089
is we'll use what's known as a total cost equation.

56
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:19,880
And so we're going to develop this equation

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,620
over the series of weeks, and it's

58
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,131
going to be a function of a bunch of different things.

59
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:26,630
You can think of it being a function

60
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,340
of the demand, the amount that you order,

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,410
the lead time that it takes to actually get

62
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,160
that product, the variability of that lead time.

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,950
How variable it is-- or whether it's really deterministic--

64
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,120
and a bunch of other things.

65
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,100
And we'll spend a lot of time on that.

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,300
And so we'll go into those in detail.

67
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,630
But at the end of it, we're making a trade-off.

68
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,220
And we're making that trade-off using this total cost equation.

69
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,990
So what are we going to do this week?

70
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,940
This week we're going to start off first

71
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,230
with some key concepts.

72
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,090
And the first one we're going to focus on

73
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,630
is what's known as push versus pull.

74
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,890
And this is a core concept.

75
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,500
And what it really means is at some point

76
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,650
if I'm making product, I'm pushing it out to the product.

77
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,600
And I'm making it based on a forecast.

78
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,750
So this is based on a forecast of demand.

79
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,639
But at some point in that supply chain,

80
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,680
I'm going to be making actions based on an order.

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,990
Someone has actually ordered it and I do something,

82
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,730
and that's what's called a pull.

83
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,680
And this is done on an actual order.

84
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,850
And so the point between the push and the pull,

85
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,330
is called the push/pull point.

86
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,030
And we'll spend a lot of time here,

87
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,430
because depending on your supply chain, whether it's

88
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,010
a push supply chain or a pull, or probably

89
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,340
some kind of hybrid, that changes how you forecast,

90
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,990
how you manage your inventory, and how

91
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,830
you manage your transportation.

92
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,960
The second key concept we're going to learn

93
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,570
is known as segmentation.

94
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,730
Segmentation is the key tool that you'll use

95
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,290
to manage your supply chains.

96
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,160
Because as you'll learn very quickly,

97
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,920
there is no single supply chain.

98
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,410
Every company has many different supply chains.

99
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,260
Your customers are different, your suppliers are different,

100
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,560
your products are different.

101
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,670
And so you want to segment them and treat them differently.

102
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,769
And what we'll be talking a lot about

103
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,079
is what's known as an ABC analysis

104
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,809
where you break your products, your suppliers,

105
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:23,100
your customers into categories.

106
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,020
Your A customers, your B customers,

107
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,550
and your C customers.

108
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,630
And again, the reason why you do that

109
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,380
is because you will treat them differently

110
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,960
in terms of forecasting, inventory, and transportation.

111
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,180
The third key concept we're going to focus on,

112
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,890
which you should be familiar with from previous class,

113
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,390
is uncertainty.

114
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,850
And what are we talking about here?

115
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,683
Well, this is when you have any variability.

116
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,980
Variability in demand, variability in supply,

117
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,160
variability in processing.

118
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,410
We'll talk about different ways you can manage or deal

119
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,459
with uncertainty.

120
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,750
The second lesson we're going to introduce forecasting,

121
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,850
because we're going to start working our way

122
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,149
down these three main topics.

123
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:07,440
And in forecasting, we're going to hit three big things

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,600
to set the stage.

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,040
Because we'll talk about this for the next several weeks.

126
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,070
The first we'll attack what I call truisms.

127
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,600
And we all know these.

128
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,020
People say well, all forecasts are wrong.

129
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,510
And this is true, but we'll talk about why that matters

130
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,010
and what you can do about it.

131
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,430
Another truism is if I have an aggregated forecast,

132
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,510
it's better.

133
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,720
Aggregated means if I forecast for many different things

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,670
instead of an individual thing, it'll always

135
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,960
get better as I aggregate.

136
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,760
And this is an example of risk pooling.

137
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,550
And we'll talk more about this as we go forward.

138
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,840
Another truism is that a forecast for a shorter horizon

139
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,640
is better than a longer horizon.

140
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,830
I can probably predict the weather for tomorrow

141
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,510
better than I can say, a year from now.

142
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,397
And so the shorter the horizon, the better.

143
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:52,980
And so we'll talk about those and show

144
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,940
how those play in to the ways that you can forecast.

145
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,280
We'll introduce basic techniques and classify them.

146
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,167
And the main way I want to classify them in this lesson

147
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,750
is the difference between a subjective

148
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,780
and an objective technique.

149
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,670
So an objective technique is one that

150
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,360
uses history and uses data.

151
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,042
Subjective uses opinions.

152
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,500
And they both have a role, and I'll

153
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,110
talk about how they fit together.

154
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,025
And the last thing we want to do is talk about metrics.

155
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:25,670


156
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,080
How do you measure your forecast?

157
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,610
There's many different ways.

158
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,080
And how you measure your forecast

159
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,496
is very important because it feeds

160
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:34,790
into how you manage your inventory, which feeds into how

161
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,600
you set up your transportation.

162
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,342
So hopefully you get the point that everything ties together.

163
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:40,800
We're going to be making trade-offs

164
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,342
with the total cost equation.

165
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,300
And we're going to do that to try to understand

166
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,820
how supply chains work.

167
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,640
So watch all the videos, take the recitations,

168
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,690
work the quick questions and the practice problems.
