0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499


1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,990
The first seasonality model that we're going to look at

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,370
is the double exponential smoothing model.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,700
So it's called a double exponential smoothing model

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,100
because we'll look at both a level and the seasonality.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,980
And so we're going to introduce seasonality

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,750
as a multiplicative seasonal term.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,080
So my underlying model is going to be this demand in time, t,

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,320
is equal to the level, which we can think

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,550
of as the average demand per period, multiplied

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,020
by the seasonality index that's appropriate for that particular

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,980
time period, F sub t.

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,520
And then we're going to add in our old random variable, where

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,970
we expect that to be the noise around the expected value.

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,260
We expect a value of that random variable that we say is zero,

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,280
so it's not biased, and we have some kind

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,700
of variance, just like normal, and its iid.

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,340
So let's talk a minute about that F sub t.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,880
So let's look over here at this right table,

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,510
where we have the seasonality with time.

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,860
And let's say this is time period 1,

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,620
this is time period 2, 3 4, and you can see.

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,540
And so I've got every time period,

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,200
it's like a two-period seasonality.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,900
I've got a low period on the odds and a high period

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,810
on the even periods.

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,770
Let's say that's my seasonality, odd and evens.

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,230
And so down here, let's say this value is 0.5, or half of what

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,830
the average demand is, if I averaged across.

29
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,930
That's what that dashed line is.

30
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,050
And up here it's 1.5.

31
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,050
So what would that mean?

32
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:47,030
That would mean that F sub odd is going to be equal to 0.5,

33
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:54,500
while F sub even equals 1.5.

34
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,110
So makes sense, right?

35
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,490
Because if it's half, half the time, then it

36
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,910
has to be one and a half the other half of the time.

37
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,490
So you'll see what this means is that the sum

38
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,440
of those seasonality indices for one full season

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,870
have to add up to the number of periods in the season.

40
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,980
In this case, the sum is two, because we have two seasons,

41
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,645
or two periods in the season.

42
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:19,020
You can also look at the average,

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,930
and the average will always be 1.

44
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,460
It has to average out.

45
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,660
So keep that in mind, and we'll just keep going.

46
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,480
So my forecasting model is going to look

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,390
very similar to the underlying model, like it always does.

48
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,250
So the forecast or the estimate for the demand made in time, t,

49
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,340
for time, t plus tau, so I'm ongoing tau

50
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,590
units in the future, is going to be

51
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,990
equal to the estimate of the level made at time period, t,

52
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,830
at the end of time period, t, multiplied by this factor

53
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,950
the seasonality index, and it's t plus tau minus p.

54
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,260
Now, we'll talk more about this in a second,

55
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,070
but essentially what it's doing is

56
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,310
looking at the most current estimate

57
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,380
of the appropriate seasonal index.

58
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,950
So if I'm in an odd period, it would look back

59
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,620
to the most recent odd period where

60
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,999
I estimated that seasonality index.

61
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,040
And we'll talk more about this in the next slide.

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,060
But just think of it as being the most recent estimate

63
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,290
we have.

64
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,770
Then, because I've got two patterns,

65
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,650
I've got two updating procedures, two variables

66
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,350
that I need to constantly update,

67
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,370
the a, the level term, and the seasonality term, f.

68
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,190
So let's look at the a term first.

69
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,280
It's, again, it's like every other smoothing function.

70
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,410
I've got this alpha term, goes from zero to 1.

71
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,280
So the estimated level-- I'm going

72
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,334
to go back-- estimated level of demand in time period, t,

73
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:46,250
is going to be alpha times my new information,

74
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,150
plus 1 minus alpha, times my old information.

75
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,960
Now my old information we should be familiar with.

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,240
That's the estimate of the level from the previous time period.

77
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,530
The new information, think about what we're trying to do here,

78
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,500
we're trying to see what is the average demand going

79
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,140
to be with this new information.

80
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,530
So what I'm going to do is de-seasonalize it.

81
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,590
I'm going to take that actual demand,

82
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,280
xt, this is what actually happened at time,

83
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,050
t, the actual demand that showed up, and divide it

84
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,829
by the seasonality index that's appropriate for that time

85
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,540
period, for the most recent estimate of it.

86
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,170
So that's f hat t minus p.

87
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,140
So I'm de-seasonalizing it, because I

88
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,680
want to see if it comes in on an odd day,

89
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,350
it's way down here, right?

90
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,450
But I say, OK, if it's only half of a typical period, the number

91
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,250
divided by 0.5, to get me up to here, to find out

92
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,450
what that average is.

93
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,160
Because I'm trying to find an estimate of the level,

94
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,480
so I'm de-seasonalizing it.

95
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,100
And we'll spend a lot of time talking about this more,

96
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,920
doing some examples.

97
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,540
The last term is the estimate for the seasonality index, F

98
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,910
hat sub t, and it's going to be equal to gamma.

99
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,440
Gamma is our smoothing variable here,

100
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,236
and it goes between zero and 1, just

101
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:00,610
like the alpha and the beta for the other smoothing terms

102
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,000
we've done.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,100
So it's going to gamma times my new information, that's

104
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,080
xt, which is the actual demand that materialized in time

105
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,520
period, t, divided by the estimate for the level in time,

106
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,300
t, that we just did, we just did that up here.

107
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,390
So what am I doing here?

108
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,870
Well, I'm de-leveling the actual demand now.

109
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,740
So I want to take out the level and see

110
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,040
if this told me anything about any new seasonality.

111
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,080
And then I'm going to add to that 1 minus

112
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,820
gamma-- sorry, 1 minus gamma, times the seasonality

113
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,670
index of the most recent relevant period.

114
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,800
So let's dive a little more, because people

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,230
get confused because of the nomenclature.

116
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,530
And so the one thing that I think is helpful

117
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,770
is to think about this multiplicative seasonality

118
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,030
factor, this F sub i, as the percent

119
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,770
of the average demand for that period, i.

120
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,020
And, remember, all the Fi for all the periods

121
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,500
within one season must equal p, which

122
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,780
is the number of time periods within the season.

123
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,860
So let's talk about the sandwich shop, where we also sell

124
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,890
bagels.

125
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,760
And what I've got here on this chart,

126
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,890
there's a time period zero to 114, and every day is labeled.

127
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,850
So we've got three weeks here.

128
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,420
And I'm closed on the weekend, so it's a five-day week.

129
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,080
So my seasonality has five periods in it.

130
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,930
So I think that every week has a certain season.

131
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,090
So suppose I didn't have any seasonality,

132
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,564
and that it's just a level.

133
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:36,480
It's just a simple exponential smoothing model

134
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,850
I'm going to use, because I think the demand is level.

135
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,340
Then, essentially, all we're saying

136
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,140
is that the seasonality index would be 1 for every period,

137
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,330
because it's the same.

138
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,217
So, you see, that would still add up to p, right?

139
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:51,800
For one week I would add these up and that still adds up to p.

140
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,710
And the average is still 1, so that fits, that's OK.

141
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,820
But suppose, instead, we had seasonality like this.

142
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,430
And you see Monday sells half the average daily bagels,

143
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,330
number of bagels, while Friday sells

144
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,300
50% more than the average.

145
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,810
And if you look at these, you can see they sum up to 5,

146
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,090
and the average is 1.

147
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,460
So what would this look like?

148
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,560
Something like this.

149
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's see the green diamonds.

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,950
And so you see it's a repeating pattern.

151
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,160
It's seasonality, seasonality over the week.

152
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,460
So, remember, our forecasting model

153
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,160
is this x hat t, comma t plus tau,

154
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,330
predicting from today for tau days in the future,

155
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,280
and that equals the estimated level in today,

156
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,370
multiply by the most relevant seasonality factor.

157
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,510
So what does that mean?

158
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,250
That F hat t plus tau minus p always confuses people.

159
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,680
So let's do an example.

160
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,990
Suppose we're sitting in Monday time period 105,

161
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,050
and I want to forecast for Thursday, t 108.

162
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,010
So what is going to be Ft plus tau, minus p?

163
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,100
Well, tau is going to be 3, because I'm

164
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,910
going three days in the future, right?

165
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,230
One, two, three, to Thursday.

166
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,060
What's my p?

167
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,390
My p is 5, so I'm going back five days.

168
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,730
And where does that take me?

169
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,020
That takes me to the most recent Thursday that I've estimated.

170
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:24,180
So the x hat 105, 108, which is the estimated demand made

171
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,520
from period 105 for period 108, is

172
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,790
going to be the estimated level I made in time period

173
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,870
105 in Monday, plus the seasonality index that was last

174
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,080
estimated in time period 103, which was the last Thursday.

175
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,700
Since I'm forecasting for a Thursday, I want to say, OK.

176
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,039
What is the most recent update or estimate of a Thursday

177
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,160
seasonality, and that's what I apply.

178
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,970
So you can think of it as, what we

179
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,260
do is modify the most recent estimate of the level

180
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,520
by the most recent relevant seasonality index.

181
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,850
And by relevant, I mean the same type of period,

182
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,980
a Monday to a Monday, a Tuesday to a Tuesday, and so on.

183
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,240
So let's do a quick example.

184
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,510
We're in our sandwich shop, we've got bagels,

185
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,300
and we're sitting in Friday time period, t 104.

186
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,940
And we've estimated that the level of demand is 121 bagels.

187
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,110
So that's, on average, I sell 121 bagels a day.

188
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,170
A little less on Monday, a lot more on Friday,

189
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,520
whatever, but on average I'm estimating I'm selling 121.

190
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,370
And here's the seasonality factors,

191
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,950
they're on this table to the right.

192
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,220
And I've got a smoothing factor of alpha 0.1, gamma 0.05.

193
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,520
So what's my forecast for time period 105?

194
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,600
So sitting in Friday, I want to make a forecast

195
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,370
for the next business day, Monday,

196
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,300
so that's time period 105, so my tau is just 1.

197
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,700
We're going one day in the future.

198
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,720
So there's our forecasting model.

199
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,060
So we're looking for x hat 104, 105.

200
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,900
So that's simple.

201
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,310
It's going to be the level estimated at my time

202
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,030
period 104, which I gave you up here-- 121,

203
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,040
times the most relevant seasonality factor, so that's

204
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,900
104, plus 1, is 105, minus p is 5, means it's going to be F hat

205
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,180
100, which is 0.5, my last Monday.

206
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,280
Makes sense.

207
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,370
So 121 times 0.5 is 60.5, that's my estimate for Monday.

208
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,160
I'm estimating, due to seasonality, I

209
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,640
don't sell many bagels on Monday, I'm going to sell 60.5.

210
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,780
That's my forecast.

211
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,987
Suppose now Monday happens, and you had a bang-up day.

212
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:32,820
You had a great day.

213
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,980
You sold 76 bagels, so more than you expected.

214
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,340
That's OK, you had extras lying around, you had safety stock.

215
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,910
So the question now is, what your forecast

216
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,440
demand for Tuesday?

217
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,196
So I want x hat 105, 106.

218
00:10:48,196 --> 00:10:50,070
I'm going to use a spreadsheet, because we're

219
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,870
going to be using these more and more.

220
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,080
So what do I have here?

221
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,970
I have the alpha and the gamma terms in cells C1 and C2.

222
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,000
Then here's my current seasonality factors

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,140
in column E from cell E5 to E9.

224
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,050
And then all I'm going to do in cell

225
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,990
D10 is calculate the level in time period 105,

226
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,250
because I need that to determine my forecast for period 106.

227
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,650
And that's simply alpha, times the actual demand

228
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,770
in time period 105, divided by the seasonality of the most

229
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,960
recent estimate.

230
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,700
Now, I'm doing a level here, so what

231
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,170
am I going to divide it by?

232
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,820
E 105, it's a Monday, right?

233
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,780
Because I want the level and I'm de-seasoning it

234
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,660
by a Monday seasonality factor.

235
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,900
And then I'm going to add to that 1 minus alpha,

236
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,150
times D9, and where D9 is the most recent estimate

237
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,170
for the level, which is 121.

238
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,330
For the seasonality, I have the gamma times--

239
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm de-leveling here-- C10.

240
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,430
What is C10?

241
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,050
The most recent estimate or the most recent demand

242
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,680
that came in, divided by D10.

243
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,600
What is that?

244
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,750
What I just calculated, the most current level estimate.

245
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,030
I'm going to add to that 1 minus gamma, times what's in E5?

246
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,770
What's in E5, well, that's, again, the Monday,

247
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,410
because I'm estimating what is the seasonality at Monday.

248
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,180
And then, to find the final estimate

249
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,050
if we're going forward, I'm going

250
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:27,190
to take the estimated level, so that's in cell D10, right here.

251
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,820
And I'm going to multiply that by what?

252
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,740
I'm going to go F hat t, plus tau minus p.

253
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,270
Where is that going to take me?

254
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,895
That's going to take me up to cell E6.

255
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:39,590


256
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,540
Why E6?

257
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,090
Let me make sure you get that.

258
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,680
Why E6 and not E5?

259
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,060
Well, this is a forecast for a Tuesday,

260
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,790
and so I want to use Tuesday's seasonality.

261
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,730
And so if you look at the numbers, they work out.

262
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,610
And so calculate the F sub t, because we're

263
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:02,420
going 105, plus 1, minus 5, is 101, which tells me Tuesday.

264
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,310
All right.

265
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,970
So hopefully you saw the mechanics.

266
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,470
Just pause the video if you need to,

267
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,980
and you can see what the cells do.

268
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,540
Do this in your own spreadsheet.

269
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,100
But I want you to notice something.

270
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,190
Our seasonality factor changed from Monday,

271
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,250
it went up a little bit.

272
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,590
Makes sense, right?

273
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,960
We sold more than we expected, so what

274
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,570
we have to figure out now is, well, is the level going up

275
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,590
or is the seasonality changing?

276
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,100
So what the exponential smoothing is doing

277
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,885
is it's upping both of them.

278
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:31,010
And you'll see that both the level estimate went up

279
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,795
a little bit, quite a bit, actually, by three bagels,

280
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,920
because it's saying, hey, new information, maybe we

281
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,310
have a new level now, but also it's saying,

282
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,690
maybe Monday's aren't as bad from selling bagels

283
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,790
as we thought.

284
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,720
So what we have to do now is normalize those seasonality

285
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,200
indices, and we'll do that in the next video.
