1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,760
So let's dig into this problem a little bit further.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,840
Two other Coop employees, Sally and Bob,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,030
they're suggesting that we can further improve this,

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,440
but they have different solutions to the approach.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,970
Sally is suggesting that we order using an EOQ policy.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,040
And Bob suggests that the original order quantity of 500

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,330
is fine, and that he has a way of reducing

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,880
the set up cost to $25.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,380
And this would be really helpful.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,840
So let's analyze these two options using

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,820
the annual purchase, holding, order, and total cost

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,194
for both Bob's and Sally's plans.

13
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:41,610
And once you've done that, there's

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,140
also a look into what is the ordering frequency for each

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,160
of these options.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,360
Well, having done that, there's one more question which is now,

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,640
if we understand Bob and Sally's suggestions

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,480
and the current scenario, is there a fourth situation

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,760
where we can even do better than what

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
Bob and Sally are suggesting?

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,450
But we'll get there.

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,260
So let's proceed.

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,490
Let's try to analyze the two options that Bob and Sally are

24
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,040
suggesting.
