1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,265
So let's dive into the first type

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:06,900
of quantity discount, the All Units discount.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,820
So what we're looking at here is a case

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,580
where-- I've got really two cases here.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,030
One is, I order a quantity that's

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,350
below this break point, Q1.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,030
So if I order on this side of it, I'm going to be paying c0.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,470
Or I order above that, and I'm going

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,140
to be ordering at a cost of c1 / item.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,610
And so let me just clean this up.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,210
The two cases are obviously if I'm below, I'm ordering at c0.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,310
And if I'm above, I'm ordering at c1, where c1 is discounted.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,370
And I just did it by this product

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,100
of this d1, this discount.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:51,192
So if it's a 10% discount, if d1 = 0.1, then c1 = 90%,

16
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:54,420
or 0.9 * c0.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,290
So when we're going to look at this, what happens

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,031
is the total relevant cost changes.

19
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:00,530
This is the first time-- this is why

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,530
we're doing this extension-- because you always

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,260
want to think about what is relevant.

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,520
And in this case, the Quantity is now relevant

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,040
because it changes how much I pay per item.

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,570
Before, it didn't matter and we didn't need to include it.

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,830
Now it does.

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,330
And so when we look at this and we think about it,

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,190
there's really only going to be three places or three

28
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,810
quantities where we're probably going to order.

29
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,370
One is, the original cost curve, and that's

30
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,650
this black line-- we could end up doing its EOQ.

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,750
Or this blue line, which is with the discount price,

32
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,600
and we're going to order that, if it's EOQ

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,850
is over here, to the right of that break point.

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,960
Or there might be a case where this doesn't occur there

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,990
and we want to order at this amount, which is just

36
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,010
enough to get that breakpoint, that discounted price.

37
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,330
So really those are the three spots that we want to look

38
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,960
at, because if you think about it, typically,

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,550
this Q* for the original price, this black line,

40
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,390
that's always going to be less than Q1.

41
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,270
What if it's greater than that?

42
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,260
Well, if it's greater than that, then what they're telling you

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,294
is "I know you already buy this amount,

44
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:16,210
and it's cheaper for you to buy this amount"--

45
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,020
but you're buying that amount anyway.

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,150
So it doesn't make sense.

47
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,766
If you're already buying above that discount level,

48
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,390
then why would they give you a discount

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,140
for doing what you're already doing?

50
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,705
So let's go in and see how we can find out

51
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:30,830
where you should buy, what your quantity should be,

52
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,299
with this given All Units discount.

53
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,090
So the procedure is pretty straightforward.

54
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,850
Let's just go through it with an example.

55
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,920
I've got my annual demand here.

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,490
I've got my holding cost at 25%.

57
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,970
My cost / transaction is $500.

58
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,600
My c0 is $50 / item.

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,080
And the discount for c1 is-- I take 15% off,

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,070
so c1 is going to simply be 50 * 0.15.

61
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,480
And that comes out to be $42.50.

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
Right?

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,740
So I'm saving 15% if I order above 800 units.

64
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,040
So let's go through it.

65
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,790
First step, find the optimal quantity

66
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,030
with the original price, and the optimal quantity, the EOQ,

67
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,020
with the new price.

68
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,890
And this is just straight EOQ.

69
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,980
You should be able to do this in your sleep now.

70
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:26,630
It's going to be = sqrt ( 2 * c_t * D / ch),

71
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,290
where c is the relevant price and h is that 25% holding rate.

72
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,750
So you should get these numbers.

73
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,067
If you don't, check your math.

74
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,400
Then you want to go to step two.

75
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,080
You say OK, does the quantity discount-- is it

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,640
greater than the breakpoint?

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,570
Does it qualify?

78
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,790
Does this quantity, which I've figured out with the new price,

79
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,630
comes out to be 434-- makes sense

80
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,016
if it costs less per item, I'm going to order more,

81
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,890
because the inventory holding cost goes down,

82
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,450
because it don't doesn't cost as much per unit--

83
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,470
but unfortunately, it doesn't pass my minimum quantity there.

84
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,900
I've got to do over 800 to get that discount.

85
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,570
So go to step three.

86
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,660
Now for step three what I'm doing is I'm saying OK,

87
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,400
let's look at what the original total relevant cost is

88
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,450
without the discount-- just normal every day--

89
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,709
and compare that to what the total relevant cost would

90
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,880
be if I buy at the break point.

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,830
So if I buy at 800 units-- because if I buy at 800 units,

92
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,730
what does that mean?

93
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,870
I get that discounted price.

94
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,000
So I just go right in.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,426
We've already calculated this before.

96
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:33,300
And then I'm just going to do the same thing.

97
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,820
I just do it long ways here.

98
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,300
So this is the new c-- this is c1 times D.

99
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,250
And I've got (c_t * D) / Q1.

100
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,340
This is Q1, the quantity that I have to cross.

101
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:57,020
And then times, again, ch, 42.5, the new c1*h over my average

102
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,060
inventory, 800/2.

103
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,580
So that comes out to be-- if you do the math, $90,000.

104
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,390
And so if I look at these two, obviously this

105
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,907
is less than this.

106
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,490
So they are different from each other,

107
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,710
so I'm going to take the discount.

108
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,420
I'm going to order 800 units.

109
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,490
So my order quantity with this All Units discount

110
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,390
will be 800 units.

111
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,710
And I know I'm going to save-- just

112
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:30,330
comparing these two-- about $14,500 / year.

113
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,926
