1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,840
So let's look at different forecasting metrics.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,930
So no matter what metric you use,

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,690
they are all based off of the error term.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,100
And the error is simply defined as the actual amount

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,420
at time t, whatever that observation is, minus

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,360
what I forecasted at that time.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,310
Now, some books will define this opposite.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,300
They'll say the error is the forecasted minus the actual.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,310
It doesn't matter.

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,490
Half the books say one, half the books say the other way.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,230
At the end of the day, all that matters

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,500
is the difference between the two.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,700
The error is simply the difference.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,805
So I can look at different types of metrics

15
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:41,280
that are used to measure the quality of a forecast.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,950
One is the mean deviation.

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,070
And so what I'm doing here is I'm summing up

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,660
the errors for each observation.

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,470
And then I divide that by n, the number of observations I have,

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,970
to find the average, or the mean, deviation.

21
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,710
So think back to the example we did

22
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,850
with the blue squares and the green triangles.

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,440
In that case, the blue squares, this mean deviation,

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,700
would be zero.

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,190
Because if something's totally not biased,

26
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,170
the over predictions will balance out

27
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,760
with the under predictions, and they'll cancel each other out.

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,430
That doesn't give you a good sense of accuracy.

29
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,830
So what people typically do is they

30
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,670
take the absolute value of the error term.

31
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,120
So mean absolute deviation of the MAD,

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,810
you simply sum up the absolute values of each of the error

33
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,230
terms and divide by n.

34
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,650
Now, another way to get rid of that positive negative,

35
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,100
that canceling out, is instead of taking the absolute value,

36
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,810
you square the term.

37
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,680
And so that's the whole idea behind the mean squared error.

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,375
So I'm squaring each error term, summing them up, dividing by n,

39
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,640
so I'm finding the mean or the average squared error.

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,150
And so again, this gets rid of the canceling out

41
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,030
by the over and under predicting.

42
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,330
But it does do something that's a little more subtle in that it

43
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,530
biases the forecast, or the error

44
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,610
gets influenced by larger outliers.

45
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,240
So if I have a forecast that's way out there,

46
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,284
then that difference is now being squared.

47
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:10,159
And so it's going to have a larger influence.

48
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,170
And we'll talk more about this when we talk about regression

49
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,230
and causal analysis, because it has an impact.

50
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,490
Typically in practice, we take a square root of this.

51
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,000
And that's what's known as a root mean square error.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,100
We do that mainly to make it in terms

53
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,030
so it's the same as the expected value.

54
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,571
And so instead of squared units, it's in single units.

55
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,570
But it's the same thing.

56
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,470
It's the square root of the sum of the squared errors divided

57
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,905
by the number of observations.

58
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,260


59
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,450
All of these four that we've talked about so far

60
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,380
are absolute.

61
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,800
So if I had a forecast of, say, a thousand units

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,310
and my error was 10, that would be much better

63
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,410
than if my forecast was 100 units and my error was 10.

64
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,710
But all of these metrics-- the mean deviation,

65
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,900
the mean absolute deviation, the mean square error, the root

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,390
mean square error, they wouldn't say anything different.

67
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,800
And so that's why I introduced these metrics that

68
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,860
look at the mean percent error.

69
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,600
So you look at the error divided by the actual amount.

70
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,520
So it gives you the percent of the actual that you're off.

71
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,900
And you take the average of that.

72
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,590
But this metric still has the same problem

73
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,520
as the mean deviation in that it,

74
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,600
in the biased and unbiased forecast, the overage

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,172
and the underage will cancel out.

76
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,630
So what people typically do is they

77
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,850
look at the mean absolute percent error, or the MAPE.

78
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,030
And it's simply the summation of the absolute values

79
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,150
of each observation divided by the actual values divided

80
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,340
by n to take the average.

81
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,840
So let's look at how these are used.

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,350
Let's do a simple example from our sandwich shop,

83
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,820
the bagel shop, again.

84
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,380
And what I show in this chart is what I forecasted the demand

85
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,900
to be for each day of the week and what actually happened.

86
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,300
And you can see the forecast looked like Monday

87
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,900
through Thursday, it's a pretty steady state 50.

88
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,400
And since everyone loves bagels on Friday,

89
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,250
I estimated that to go up, the demand to go up, by 50% to 75.

90
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,297
You can see what the actual demand values were.

91
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:12,880
So what we're going to do is calculate

92
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,900
the mean absolute deviation, the root

93
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,070
mean square error, and the mean absolute percent error.

94
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,290
So how do I do this?

95
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,490
Well, I get the data.

96
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,740
And the first thing you should do on any of this stuff

97
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,850
is graph it.

98
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,040
Take a look at it, because people, humans,

99
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,090
are very good at picking up patterns and identifying things

100
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,090
visually.

101
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,300
So we look at this.

102
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,720
And we get a sense of where our forecasts are.

103
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,590
And now to find the actual metrics,

104
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,010
I'm just going to extend the data table.

105
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,290
So this part we already had before.

106
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,320
Every row is one of the days.

107
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,440
The first column is my forecast.

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,060
The second column is what actually happened.

109
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,490
And then the third column is the error term.

110
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,270
It is simply the actual minus the forecast.

111
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,500
And you can see in this case, I summed them up here.

112
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,620
And this happens to sum out to zero.

113
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,120
And then if I look here at the mean,

114
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,070
obviously the mean of zero is zero.

115
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,084
So that's the error column.

116
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:11,750
Then I add another column, which is just

117
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,590
the absolute value of the error term.

118
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,080
And you see, it's just to get rid of the sign.

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,210
And you can see the sum is 54, because I'm not canceling out

120
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,520
anymore.

121
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,050
And the mean of that is 10.8.

122
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,830
Then I add a column that has the square of the error.

123
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,940
And you can see that all the way down.

124
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,010
And then I also add one with the absolute value

125
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,360
of the error over the actual.

126
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,364
And so once I have this, the metrics

127
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:39,530
are very easy to figure out.

128
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,190
I just sum up each of the columns

129
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,600
and I find the averages, or the means.

130
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,306
So the mean absolute deviation, I

131
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,710
look at the absolute deviation.

132
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,840
And it's going to be 10.8, which is just 54 divided by 5.

133
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,879
There are five days.

134
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,420
The root mean square error, I'm going

135
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,170
to take the mean of the squared columns, 126.8,

136
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,190
and take a square root.

137
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,030
So it's 11.3.

138
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,550
And then the MAPE is 21%, which is just the sum

139
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,180
104% divided by 5.

140
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,390
So finding these metrics are very easy.

141
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,260
We'll talk more about how they trade off,

142
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,191
and how you should treat them, and how they interact

143
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:17,440
with each other-- or how they're related to each other

144
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,510
rather-- in a little later-- in a future lecture.
