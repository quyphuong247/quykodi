1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,950
So our third forecasting truism is

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,220
that shorter horizon forecasts are more accurate.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,350
The idea here is it's easier to predict the temperature

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,140
tomorrow than a year from tomorrow.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,470
And it makes sense, because you have

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,430
more knowledge about the shorter term, what's

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,930
happening right now, than what might

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,620
be happening a year from now.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,020
But this applies to shorter time horizons as well.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,590
So let's go back to my favorite sandwich shop.

11
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,390
And just like it's easier to forecast for tomorrow

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,250
than a year from tomorrow, it's easier

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,230
to forecast on a very short time frame, say, a half an hour,

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,870
than it is for a whole day in advance.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,890
So let's think about my sandwich shop here.

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,829
And I've got these four sandwiches over here

17
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:40,370
on the right.

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,430


19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,610
You see these guys.

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,000
And this is a time frame.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,300
And I expect them to be consumed at noon on the following day.

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,960
And so this is going backwards in time.

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,840
So this is at 9 o'clock, or 2100 hours, the day before.

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,080
And let's say I have to make my sandwiches at that point.

25
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,780
Well, if I'm doing that, I'm making

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,920
a forecast for the next day.

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,640
And that's nine hours in advance.

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,510
And that's fine.

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,830
I can probably do that.

30
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,560
But I'm going to have a coefficient of variation.

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,490
So if I knew the variance of the demand for each one of these,

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,665
I could figure out what my coefficient of variation

33
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:17,860
would be.

34
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,750
But what if I did something different?

35
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,690
What if instead of making them all into a forecast,

36
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,920
make to stock the night before, instead I

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,300
will slice the ham that I think I will need.

38
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,240
And I'll have them ready so that one hour before, once I

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,340
see what the day is shaping up, I

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,460
make them at a much shorter time.

41
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,620
So I start making right before noon,

42
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,510
but I make my forecast for how much ham

43
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,770
I slice the day before.

44
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,310
What are we doing here?

45
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,800
Well, we're postponing.

46
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,790
We're postponing the final consumption

47
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,170
instead of making of four those items, each of those sandwiches

48
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,760
back here the day before, hoping to guess

49
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
what the demand for each would be.

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,512
I'm waiting and I'm pooling that demand for the ham

51
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:03,970
and I'm slicing that ahead of time.

52
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,740
And I'm not making that final customization

53
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,240
until the very end.

54
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,020
So this is another example of risk pooling and postponement.

55
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,220
So this will increase the forecast accuracy of the ham,

56
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,020
because what I'm doing is if I know the CV of each

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,420
of these sandwiches separately-- and let's say

58
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,170
they're identical, just for the sake of argument--

59
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,260
then I know my CV for ham for here

60
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,620
will be half of the CV for each of the individual items.

61
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,510
Why?

62
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,760
Because it's going to decrease by a factor square root of n. n

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,880
is 4 here-- one, two, three, four.

64
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,920
So the CV of the individual one divided by the square root of 4

65
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,160
is divided by 2.

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,290
So it's 1/2.

67
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,660
So my coefficient of variation is cut in half by postponing.

68
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,020


69
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,200
So this is a simple example, but you see postponement

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,980
all the time.

71
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,700
And this is why we try to think about that concept as raw

72
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,390
as possible.

73
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,200
We talked about it in the first week.

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,420
The idea is you want to push and postpone

75
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,260
the final customization for as late as you can,

76
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,860
whether it's a high end electronics

77
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,000
item, a car, or even something as simple as a sandwich.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,250
So let's look at all three of the truisms.

79
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,170
The first one is forecasts are always wrong.

80
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,070
People will say this to try to discount

81
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,600
the value of forecasting.

82
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,470
And it's really a bad argument.

83
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,040
The idea is that forecasts are wrong.

84
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,810
Yeah, it's true.

85
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,930
They will always be wrong.

86
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,470
But to combat that, you should use a range forecast.

87
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,302
You should track your forecast error,

88
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:36,760
because that's what you can use to,

89
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,970
one, improve your forecasting capabilities,

90
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,110
but also understand how it is used

91
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,500
within your different operations,

92
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,680
whether it's your inventory or capacity planning.

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,730


94
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,990
The second truism is that aggregated forecasts are always

95
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,120
more accurate.

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,690
And this is true, and this gets the idea of risk pooling,

97
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,720
because risk pooling reduces the coefficient of variation.

98
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,050
And when you reduce the coefficient of variation,

99
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,740
it makes it easier and more accurate to do a forecast.

100
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,390


101
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,270
And then the third truism was that shorter time horizon

102
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,590
forecasts are more accurate.

103
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,080
Again, it's true.

104
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,214
It's a truism.

105
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:11,630
And this leads to the idea that we

106
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,710
want to postpone customization as late as possible.

107
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,230
That raw as possible concept, keep

108
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,320
products as raw and customize as late as possible.

109
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,850
So these three truisms, yes, they're true.

110
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,710
But they lead to actions that you

111
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,874
should take within your supply chain.

112
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,290
And then the rest of the lectures,

113
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,880
we'll talk about how each of these impact the forecasting,

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,950
the inventory planning, as well as the transportation design.
