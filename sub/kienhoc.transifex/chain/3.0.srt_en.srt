00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,720
Welcome to week three of SC1x Supply Chain Fundamentals.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,655
This will be our third and final lecture or final week

3
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:08,280
on forecasting.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,060
We're gonna wrap this up before we turn into,

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,119
turn over to inventory and transportation.

6
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,660
So what are we going to do this week?

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,034
Well, we're going to finish up with exponential smoothing

8
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:18,990
first.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,080
And what we're going to do here is introduce seasonality.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,650
So let's say you're looking like your demand is something

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,749
like this.

12
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:28,290
You're finding it all over the place.

13
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,880
This is time.

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,380
And so if you look at this, you start seeing a pattern.

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,421
And you say, you know what, it looks like there's

16
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:35,540
a level there, right?

17
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,990
A level, a trend.

18
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,770
But there's also some kind of maybe some seasonality.

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,920
And so this is how we want to fit that last pattern in.

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,320
We've already shown how to put level in, trend in,

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,890
and how to deal with that randomness, that error term.

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,770
Now we're going to say what happens with seasonality.

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,210
And what we're going to do here is

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,310
we're going to introduce a series of different terms.

25
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,200
And what you're going to end up seeing

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,430
is that it's going to be a function,

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,530
your forecast for sitting in time period T for T plus tau,

28
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,660
where tau is the number of periods in the future,

29
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:14,020
is going to be a function of my estimate for the level,

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:20,790
plus tau times my estimate, my current estimate,

31
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,900
for the trend times my current estimate.

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,320
Let me use another color there, of the seasonality.

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,450
And this is the seasonality for this time period

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,200
plus tau minus p.

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,660
And we'll explain what that is, but essentially it's

36
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,030
looking if I have seasonality by months of the year,

37
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,880
I look at last year's same month.

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,650
So if it's in November right now,

39
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,210
I look at last year's November.

40
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,910
If it's October, I look at last year's October.

41
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,170
You look at the similar period.

42
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,860
And so what we have here is three terms.

43
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,870
And we have a level that you're going to estimate.

44
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,290
And you're, I'm gonna show you how to update that.

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,959
You're going to have a trend.

46
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,250
And you see that it's multiplied by tau, because that's

47
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,750
as far out as I go.

48
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,850
Remember, because it's a linear trend.

49
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,980
And the last thing you have is that seasonality.

50
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,300


51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,760
And we'll spend a lot of time developing this.

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,070
And what you'll see by doing this a number of times

53
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,160
is that it's really, the hard part is the bookkeeping.

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,280
Keeping track of all the terms, initializing the terms,

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,720
and making sure all the terms stay in sync.

56
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,681
So that's the lesson that I want you to take away from that.

57
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:40,180
Then in the second lesson we're gonna turn to special cases.

58
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,971
And we're gonna go over three special cases

59
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:43,450
that you'll see in practice.

60
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,256
The first one is causal analysis.

61
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:46,380
And we've done this before.

62
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,580
This is called regression.

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,370
We'll use ordinary least squares regression as our technique.

64
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,870
So this is the case where maybe my demand is the number of ice

65
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,250
cream cones that I stand.

66
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,500
I have an ice cream stand and how many ice cream

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,820
cones I sell.

68
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,884
And I think that's a function of the temperature.

69
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,300
And I think it's also a function of whether it's a weekend

70
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,570
or not.

71
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,760
And so recalling back to what we did in a previous class

72
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,710
with ordinary least squares regression,

73
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,950
I know that I can set up a linear equation here

74
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,590
if I have data in the past for this.

75
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,195
And I can create a linear expression

76
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:25,380
where that's temperature plus beta 2 times x if it's weekend.

77
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,200
And that will be a binary variable, a 1 0.

78
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,120
And I can estimate these terms for beta 0 beta 1 and beta 2.

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,490
And so then I would use this to forecast.

80
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,840
I would use my regression model to estimate or forecast

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,800
my demand.

82
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,750
And we'll talk about when this makes sense,

83
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,120
when it doesn't, how compares to exponential

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,610
smoothing in the lecture.

85
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,790
The next thing we'll talk about is new products.

86
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,290
And this is a massive area.

87
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,479
You're going to spend a lot of time here if you go,

88
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,770
wherever you work in companies.

89
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,228
Especially if you're in fast moving

90
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:59,640
consumer goods or high tech.

91
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,760
So the idea here is there's a lot of ideas

92
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,160
that come into a company of new products

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,430
and they get thrown into what most companies call

94
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,050
some kind of funnel.

95
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,100
And this funnel takes all those millions of good ideas

96
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,970
and says OK, which ones actually are we going to act upon.

97
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,100
And it's something that's called a stage-gate process.

98
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,910
Stage-gate.

99
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,630


100
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,220
Where all these new ideas have to pass certain hurdles as they

101
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,000
make their way down the line to become an actual product.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,360
Now why am I talking about this in forecasting?

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,800
Well, because new products are special because you

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
have no history.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,830
You have no history to run a regression.

106
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,160
You have no history to match a pattern to.

107
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,910
So how do you forecast something you have no history for?

108
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,440
That's what you need to know.

109
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,660
The other interesting thing for new products as I

110
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,450
move down this path, my forecasting technique

111
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,260
will change.

112
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,320
And the what you need to forecast will change.

113
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,720
So new products, fascinating area.

114
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,730
We'll spend a lot of time there.

115
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,220
The last one is intermittent demand.

116
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,079
Think spare parts.

117
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,620
This is a special case, and this will

118
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,800
happen to anyone who's in automotive, large

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,980
manufacturing, where your demand is very intermittent.

120
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,000
It's sparse.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,560
So down here I have a chart.

122
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,297
This is time and this is demand.

123
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,630
And what if my demand pattern looks something like this?

124
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,830
In time, zero demand here.

125
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,990
Then I have nothing for a number of periods.

126
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,350
Then I've got some demand.

127
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,570
Then I've got nothing.

128
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,790
Then I've got demand.

129
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,770
Then I've got nothing for a long time.

130
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,840
Then I've got this other demand here.

131
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,450
So I've got this very sporadic demand.

132
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,980
It's very intermittent.

133
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,580
Very hard to have that forecast fit into an inventory

134
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,100
model like this.

135
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,400
It's very spiky.

136
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,170
So it causes problems, especially

137
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,339
if I try to use exponential smoothing.

138
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,130
So what I'm going to introduce is something

139
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,500
called Croston's Method.

140
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,220
And that allows you to smooth out

141
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,800
this demand for the purpose of planning for inventory.

142
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,111
So it's a method of smoothing out intermittent demand.

143
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:05,040
OK, so this is wrapping up everything

144
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,900
we're talking about for forecasting.

145
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,020
We're going to finish it up in this lesson

146
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,240
and talk about exponential smoothing,

147
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,430
and then talk about some special cases.

148
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,030
All right.

149
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,640
So please watch the videos, work the recitations,

150
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,440
work the quick questions and the practice problems, have fun.
