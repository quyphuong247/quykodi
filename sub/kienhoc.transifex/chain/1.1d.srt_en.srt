1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,470
So let's talk about the distribution of Stock

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:07,380
Keeping Units, and I'll use as an example a grocery store.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,750
This is a project we did several years ago,

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,870
where we looked at a local grocery store which is located

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,822
just off of MIT's campus in Porter Square,

6
00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:18,030
and we looked at it for a bunch of different reasons,

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,930
and we wanted to find out how they replenish

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,550
different types of items there.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,130
And so we looked through, and we examined

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,650
the number of items that are in the store,

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,760
and there's about 20,000 SKUs, or Stock Keeping Units,

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,970
in this grocery store, and they generally

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,530
fall into three categories.

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,050
You have the dry goods, the frozen goods,

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,950
and the perishables, the meats and vegetables,

16
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,730
things that have to be kept refrigerated but not frozen.

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,530
And we focused in on the dry goods.

18
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,660
Of the 20,000 in the store, there

19
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,330
were about 8,000 SKUs that constituted the dry goods.

20
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,800
And we looked over one year, and we found that 1.2 million,

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,320
roughly, items were sold of that 8,000 SKUs.

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,850
So 1.15 million items were sold.

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,000
So if we look at the number of units

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,190
sold per SKU, what's interesting is

25
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,240
it's not quite what you'd think.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,820
If I look at this, the average number,

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,060
if I just divide 1.156 million divided by 8,000, on average,

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,330
each SKU sold 144 items over the course of a year.

29
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,880
If I look at the median-- remember,

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,338
the median is if I put them from the lowest to the highest,

31
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:29,190
it's the one in the middle for the frequency--

32
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,160
the median is 72.

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,100
So just by seeing that they're not the same or close

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,150
to each other means I'm not looking

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,120
like it's nice, symmetric distribution.

36
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,810
Then I look at the mode, and the mode

37
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,320
is the most frequent observation.

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,170
And the most frequent number of times a particular SKU was sold

39
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,970
is 0.

40
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,962
That's the most frequent number.

41
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:54,920
And then we can look at the standard deviation,

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,580
another metric.

43
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,490
That's the spread around the mean, and that's about 355.

44
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,060
So if my average is 144 and my standard deviation

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,910
is 355, that tells me right away it doesn't look very symmetric.

46
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,880
But let's think about it a little more,

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,536
and let's go through to flesh it out.

48
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:13,410
What do you think some of the biggest sellers

49
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,400
might have been?

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,140
Well, we went through and looked at this,

51
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,723
and what's interesting is because it's

52
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:21,140
right near a campus, you can guess it's a lot of water,

53
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,130
a lot of macaroni and cheese, and a lot of tuna fish.

54
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,930
I thought that was kind of interesting.

55
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,610
Then we also looked to see, well,

56
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,430
do sales happen constantly across the year?

57
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,660
And actually, there were three massive days

58
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,370
that sales were about two times what the normal daily shopping

59
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,350
experience is.

60
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,170
The sales increased by a factor of two or more,

61
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,130
and those were right before Thanksgiving, a large U.S.

62
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,274
holiday, right before Christmas, and right before the Superbowl.

63
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:51,440
So it's kind of interesting.

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,310
The Superbowl is a football game that's played here in the US.

65
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,980
It's the championship game.

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,550
So those were the big three days when sales really peaked.

67
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,470
But what we wanted to focus on is of all these 8,000 Stock

68
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,260
Keeping Units, how is the demand distributed?

69
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,200
Is it uniform?

70
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,920
Is it normal?

71
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,480
Is it something else?

72
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,290
How do they fall?

73
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,972
And so we looked at this, and there's

74
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:15,930
a couple different ways you can think about it.

75
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,930
One is, what if everything sold the same amount?

76
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,840
So on average, they sold 144 items each.

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,790
What if every item sold 144?

78
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,310
Then that means 50% of my SKUs, my Stock Keeping Units,

79
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,750
would constitute 50% of my sales volume.

80
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,880
And I'm just using volume here, not dollar value.

81
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,570
This is just units.

82
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,660
If every single one of my items sold the average amount,

83
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,480
then this is what that demand distribution would look like.

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
This is what it would look like if it was normal.

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,370
So if I had normal, let's say, the expected amount.

86
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,570
The average is 144, but some sell a little less,

87
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,200
some sell a little more, but it follows

88
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,170
that nice, symmetric distribution.

89
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,520
Then my distribution chart of percent

90
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,210
of SKUs versus percent of sales volume

91
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,110
would look like that green line, kind of curved.

92
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,130
Now, this blue line is another distribution.

93
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,470
It's called the power law.

94
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,000
And this is the idea that a lot of items don't sell much,

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,950
but then I have some that sell a lot.

96
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,710
So it's very skewed in the percent that

97
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,595
actually sell different amounts.

98
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:29,120


99
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,940
And then finally, I've got this one that

100
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,550
follows a log normal distribution, where again, I

101
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,150
have this long right tail where I have some that sell a lot,

102
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,690
but then I have others that are selling less.

103
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,950
It's kind of skewed to the left.

104
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,780
So you look at these four different types

105
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,200
of distribution, so which do you think

106
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,670
the products at the grocery store followed?

107
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,270
Well, they followed very closely to the power law.

108
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,910
The idea is that very few of the items

109
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,050
contribute to most of the items sold.

110
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,930
So this dark blue line is actually the actual plotted--

111
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,160
let me just highlight it, this line-- is

112
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,300
the actual plotted amount, and then this black line here

113
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,270
is actually a fitted function.

114
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,680
I just used regression to fit that in.

115
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,630
So you can see what's happening here,

116
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,956
what this shows is that 10% of the products--

117
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:23,720
let's see what that does-- constitute about 50%

118
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,640
of the items sold.

119
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,350
So one out of 10 items constituted

120
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,460
half of all the items sold.

121
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,480
That's pretty amazing because then I look up here,

122
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,800
and I go down here.

123
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,860
50% of the products only constituted 10% of the sales,

124
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,800
from 90% to 100%.

125
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,020
So I've got a critical few and I've got a trivial many here.

126
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,170
And so you might ask yourself, is this unique?

127
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,670
Is this just for that one grocery

128
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,670
store that's in Porter Square?

129
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,860
And the answer would be no.

130
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,400
Let's look at another example, and this is from data

131
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,160
that I collect for the truckload market.

132
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,920
What truckload does, it picks up from one location

133
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,120
and it ships directly to another location.

134
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,190
So it's a full truckload move, and this

135
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,440
is a data set of about five million shipments

136
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,250
over the course of a year across 400,000 lanes.

137
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,940
A lane is simply an origin destination

138
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,650
pairing-- from Chicago to Los Angeles, from Miami to Atlanta.

139
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,480
That's a lane, an origin destination pair.

140
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,330
So if I look at this, on the horizontal axis,

141
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,770
I've got the percent of lanes that I've

142
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,650
included from 0% to 100%, and on the vertical axis,

143
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,830
I've got the percent of the volume included on that lane.

144
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,930
And what this is saying is that 50%

145
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,430
of the volume, 50% of those truckload volumes,

146
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,150
that's 2.5 million shipments, are only

147
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,740
handled on 3% of the lanes.

148
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,320
That's amazing.

149
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,410
3% of 400,000 is about 12,000, so just 12,000 of those lanes

150
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,540
handles half the volume.

151
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,540
And then you could think of it the other way.

152
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,380
Only 3% of the volume is handled by more than almost half

153
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,320
of the lanes, 43%.

154
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,920
So again, we have the case where very few traffic lanes-- origin

155
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,030
destination pairs-- account for the vast majority

156
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,480
of the truckload shipments or the truckload movements.

157
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,160
So again, you have the critical few and the trivial many.

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,140
And why are we talking about this?

159
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,270
Because maybe you want to treat them differently.

160
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,140
You want to manage the high volume lanes differently

161
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,290
than the ones where you have very infrequent shipments.

162
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,820
So is this just for supply chain?

163
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,530
No.

164
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,640
Power laws are everywhere.

165
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,260
It's really interesting, and there's

166
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,280
a lot of new research going on in this, especially

167
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,090
in the internet, in different connections

168
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,590
with social sciences.

169
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,620
But it's been around for a long time,

170
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,920
and it's very common in physical and social systems.

171
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,700
Severity of hurricanes and earthquakes

172
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,100
follow the power law.

173
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,600
Income.

174
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,250
We've all heard of Pareto's law.

175
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,320
Sometimes it's turned into a verb.

176
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,120
When we Pareto a function, we look

177
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,760
for the 20% that constitutes 80% of the activity.

178
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,610
Visits to websites and blogs follow a power law.

179
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,830
The frequency of digits, Benford's law, is interesting.

180
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,790
The most common digit in the table is the number 1,

181
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,170
and it shows up much more frequently

182
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,630
than you would expect.

183
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,620
Frequency of authors cited in literature follows it.

184
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,010
So the first person who found each of these power law

185
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,865
relationships, they get to name a law after them, apparently.

186
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:31,240
There's a whole bunch of these, and if you're ever bored,

187
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,340
look up the power law and you can

188
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,200
see all these different examples where it's been applied.

189
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,730
For us, we'll see it in profitability

190
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,289
of customers and products.

191
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,027
We already saw it in demand, but we're

192
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:44,360
going to see this in everything.

193
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,069
Very few of your customers drive most of your revenue,

194
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,860
and you're going to have a lot of customers

195
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,730
that don't drive that much.

196
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,440
And my favorite is questions from students in class.

197
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,650
There will be very few students that ask most of the questions,

198
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,200
while the vast majority don't say anything,

199
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,080
don't ask any questions.

200
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,590
So you'll see this a lot.

201
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,240
The critical takeaway from this is that with a power law.

202
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,840
If you have a relationship that follows this power law where

203
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,700
you have something like this, you'll

204
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,750
have a critical few, a very important few,

205
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,900
and you'll have over here a trivial many.

206
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,010
And the question is, how do I treat these guys differently

207
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,690
from the ones in the middle, differently

208
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,230
for the ones on the far right?
