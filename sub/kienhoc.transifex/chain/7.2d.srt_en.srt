1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,360
Now, let's see how to calculate the expected units short

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,470
for Normal distribution, for the case where

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,840
the demand is Normally distributed.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,320
So what we're going to do is use this Loss function, this L(Q).

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,220
And again, that's the expected amount

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,570
that the random variable, x, the demand,

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,780
exceeds a given threshold value Q. This is also

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,460
called the expected units short per Replenishment Cycle.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,730
So I show you the two equations here,

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,979
in terms of the discrete case and the continuous case,

11
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:32,520
and we're going to focus in on the Normal distribution, which

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,550
is, again, a continuous variable, obviously.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,140
And what we're going to do is to introduce this Unit Normal Loss

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,970
function.

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,090
So it is a Loss function that was specifically

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,360
designed for the unit Normal.

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,040
And we're going to call that G(k).

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,710
We're going to use a lot of G(k) in the next couple weeks.

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,060
And so G(k) is, essentially, given a k,

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,350
it'll tell you for the unit Normal function, the unit

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,830
Normal distribution, what the expected units short are.

22
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,420
And then, I multiply that by my standard deviation

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,850
of the demand.

24
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,570
And that'll tell me my expected units

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,000
short for my distribution.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,970
So to use this function, G(k), I'm

27
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,860
going to have to transform my distribution

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,110
into the standard Normal distribution or the unit

29
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,380
distribution, where the mean is 0

30
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,020
and the standard deviation is 1.

31
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,610
And so I'm just simply going to transform,

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,855
and it's equal to the Q minus my mean of my distribution divided

33
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:30,938
by the standard deviation.

34
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:38,130


35
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,120
And in spreadsheets, whether it's Excel or LibreOffice,

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,650
the function is just the Norm S inverse of the Critical Ratio

37
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,480
and that will give you the k value.

38
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,630
Now, the unit Normal Loss function seems complicated

39
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,700
and it's always a little confusing for students

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,000
when they first start using it.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,370
What it turns out to be though --

42
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,366
you can look at this G(k) and it's really just

43
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:02,466
the probability density function minus the k times

44
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:03,799
the cumulative density function.

45
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,680


46
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,910
In spreadsheets, I can create this

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,030
with this simple little expression,

48
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,010
whether it's LibreOffice or Excel, so you can plug this

49
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,960
in to the spreadsheet and always calculate

50
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,190
what the G(k) is for a given k.

51
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,000
But I can also use the tables.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,120
So we, in our standard Normal tables

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,050
that we provided you, not only did we give you the probability

54
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,040
that X is less than k, which we used to figure out

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,190
the Critical Ratios, we also gave you a column, G(k),

56
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,950
which is the unit Normal Loss.

57
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,760
So let's do a simple example to illustrate how to use this.

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,620
Suppose that I've got my demand and it's Normally distributed.

59
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,550
Just draw a little picture here.

60
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,460
And the mean is 160.

61
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,530
And my standard deviation is 45 units.

62
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,540
And suppose I ordered a Q, and my Q is 190 units.

63
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,270
So I want to know what is my expected units that I'll

64
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,295
be short for each Replenishment Cycle.

65
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,090
Well, how do I figure this out?

66
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,610
First step, find the k.

67
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,110
I want to transform it.

68
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:22,164
So my k is going to be equal to my Q minus the mean, the mu.

69
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:23,580
And then, it's going to be divided

70
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,850
by the standard deviation.

71
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,190
So 190 minus 160, and divide that by 45,

72
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,420
and I get a k of 0.67.

73
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,600
So then, I look at my table, find 0.67.

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,220
Here we go.

75
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,940
It's right down here.

76
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,910
And I find that my G(k), looking down this column, is 0.1503.

77
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,050
So now, I know for the unit Normal distribution

78
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,690
that it's going to be 0.15 units short or 0.1503.

79
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,950
I multiply that by my standard deviation

80
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,550
of the demand, the sigma, and that gives me 6.76.

81
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,600
So for this simple example, I know

82
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,400
that if my demand is distributed Normally with a mean of 160

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,720
and a standard deviation of 45, and I have 190 units ordered

84
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,329
each time or on hand, then I can expect

85
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,250
to be short 6.76 units each Replenishment Cycle.

86
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,130
So that's how you can calculate using

87
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,940
the tables to find your G(k) or unit Normal Loss

88
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,830
and turn that into expected units short.

89
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,560
Now, let's apply all of these things

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,320
to solve the NFL Jersey problem.
