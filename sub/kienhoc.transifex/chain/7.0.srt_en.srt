00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,954
Hello, welcome back to SC1x, Supply Chain Fundamentals.

2
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:05,370
This week, we're going to continue

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,810
our discussion of inventory.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,780
So we're going to talk about another version of inventory

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,280
management.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,500
We're going to change our assumptions a little bit.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,040
Last time, when we developed the economic order quantity,

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,890
we made some assumptions here, a lot of different assumptions.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,310
But three that are our key first is,

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,620
we made the assumption that the demand was known and constant.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,140
So we assumed it was deterministic.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,800
It was solid.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,660
And we knew what that was going to be.

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,150
Our planning horizon was infinite.

15
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,340
That's why we could take averages.

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,255
We looked at the average inventory level, Q over 2

17
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:43,880
and things like that, because we assumed that the horizon would

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,250
go on forever.

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,270
And for excess demand, didn't apply.

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,620
We didn't have that at all.

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,120
Now what we're going to do is loosen

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,450
some of these assumptions.

23
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,900
So the first one we're going to loosen is this excess demand.

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,580
And I'm going to say, well, what happens

25
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,230
if we allow back orders?

26
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,890
So think about when you order a phone, one of your smartphones.

27
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,680
Many people are willing to wait for that order to come.

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,640
They get on a list.

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,290
So that's a back order, essentially.

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,250
You placed an order.

31
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,458
You didn't get it right away.

32
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,150
But you're willing to wait, as opposed to a lost sale, where

33
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,680
you would walk away.

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,200
So what happens if you allow back orders?

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,500
Well, even if I have constant demand and an infinite horizon,

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,720
we'll see that this changes things.

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,720
And it changes things because now the amount

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,910
of back orders that I'm willing to allow

39
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,970
is a function of two things, the Cost of Excess

40
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,110
and the cost of shortage.

41
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,640
And we'll talk about those later.

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,580
But it's kind of a first step into allowing back orders

43
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,880
or when demand is not satisfied.

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,330
The next thing we're going to do is extend this a little more

45
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,680
and talk about what's known as the Newsvendor or a newsboy

46
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,880
or a single period problem.

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,550
And we're going to do here, the demand

48
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,400
now is going to be random.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,847
So it's variable.

50
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:00,430
We don't know.

51
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,920
We might be able to describe it in the distribution.

52
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,780
But it's a random variable.

53
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,720
Our planning horizon is one period.

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,160
So what does that mean?

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,040
That means it's one day, one week.

56
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,070
I have to produce and make my decision of how much to make

57
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,600
or how much to buy ahead of time.

58
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,310
And I cannot recover during that period.

59
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,934
At the end of the period, I have to get

60
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,070
rid of what I didn't sell.

61
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,600
We'll talk more about that.

62
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,670
And for excess demand, we're going

63
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,860
to assume that we have lost sales.

64
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,980
In other words, if I have my product,

65
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,440
someone and I sell it all.

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,819
Someone else comes in.

67
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,110
I don't get to back order them.

68
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,100
I lose that sale.

69
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,124
So I lose that potential revenue.

70
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:40,790
So this is what we're going to focus on.

71
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,850
And let me give you some flesh around this of how this works.

72
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,470
It's called the Newsvendor problem,

73
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,280
because it mimics what we do when we supply newspapers.

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,800
No one wants to read yesterday's newspaper.

75
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,130
So the idea is like this.

76
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,000
You're a newsboy, a newsgirl, a Newsvendor,

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,240
and you have the paper company, in this case, the Boston Globe.

78
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,640
And you're going to, just like any good supply chain,

79
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,650
place an order.

80
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,360
And you're going to say, I want q newspapers

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,010
that I have to sell that day.

82
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,990
They are going to send you that many.

83
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,090
So I'm going to have this stack of newspapers here

84
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,000
that is going to be Q many.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
And then we assume that you pay them for each of those

86
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,150
that you ordered, regardless of whether you sell them.

87
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,020
Now during the course of the day,

88
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,050
you're going to sell a certain number.

89
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,600
And that's a random variable that we're going to call x.

90
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,930
So I'm going to sell x newspapers during the day.

91
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,430
And the question is, how many should I buy?

92
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,990
What should my Q be?

93
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,940
And the way to think about this is

94
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,820
that there's two situations that could happen.

95
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,800
Situation 1 is where x is less than Q.

96
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,160
And what does that mean?

97
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,080
That means I'm going to have excess.

98
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,850
I'm going to have extra papers at the end.

99
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,810
So think of that cost of excess.

100
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,690
Second situation, when x is greater

101
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,710
than Q. What does that mean?

102
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,780
That means I'm going to be short.

103
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,700
I'm not going to have enough papers.

104
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,230
I'm going to have a shortage.

105
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,500
And so the question is, how do I decide which to do?

106
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,760
And so if I look at the distribution of this demand,

107
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,160
where this is my demand x, the question is,

108
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,680
should I order this many, right?

109
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,820
If that's my distribution?

110
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,280
And I know if I ordered that many, the probability of me

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,230
being short is pretty high, because most

112
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,030
of the distribution is above that.

113
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,710
Well, what if I order this many?

114
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,180
Well, then chances are I'm going to not be short, right?

115
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,680
But I might have a lot of excess,

116
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,240
because it might end up here.

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,280
So what you're seeing is there's a trade off

118
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,461
between the shortage and the excess costs.

119
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,710
And what we're going to end up finding out and showing

120
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,660
you is that, really, what you're trying to do

121
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,290
is maximize your profit.

122
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,150
How do I maximize my profit?

123
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,660
Well, I've got the price that I'm selling it for.

124
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,840
And it's the minimum of either how many customers come in

125
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,730
to sell or how many I ordered.

126
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,450
I can't sell more than I ordered.

127
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,180
I can't sell more than the number

128
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,855
of people who come to buy them, minus the cost.

129
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:08,980
I've got to pay for all of the ones that I ordered,

130
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,200
regardless of how many I sell.

131
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,090
So this is the core problem.

132
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,726
And what we'll see, at the end of the result of the lesson,

133
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:18,350
is something called the critical ratio.

134
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,770
And this is the key takeaway.

135
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,690
And that the critical ratio is essentially

136
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,060
the ratio of the cost of a shortage per unit,

137
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,070
divided by the sum of the cost of the shortage,

138
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,450
plus the cost of the excess.

139
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,280
And what this is telling me is how much of this distribution

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,400
I should cover to maximize the profit.

141
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,460
This area will be equal to the critical ratio, which

142
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,050
is a really cool result.

143
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,350
So essentially, based on the balance of overage an underage,

144
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,970
cost of excess and shortage, it's

145
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,177
going to tell me how much of this distribution

146
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:52,260
I should cover, whether it's a normal distribution

147
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,485
or any other shape.

148
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:55,610
So this is what we're going to cover in this week's

149
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,220
lessons, the Newsvendor problem and dealing with random demand

150
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,660
in a single period.

151
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,077
So watch the videos, go through the recitations,

152
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:05,160
try the quick questions and the practice problems.

153
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,830
Have fun.
