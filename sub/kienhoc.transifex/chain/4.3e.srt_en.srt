1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,880
Let's take a look now at Incremental Quantity Discounts.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,690
So these differ from the All Units Discount

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,910
in that the discount only applies

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,850
to that quantity purchased above whatever that breakpoint

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,050
quantity is, Q1.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,450
But like any discount, it's still

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,330
a trade-off between lower purchase cost and higher

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,532
carrying costs-- because a lower purchase price

9
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:25,740
means that you're probably going to order more, which

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,323
means you're going to have more cycle stock and more inventory

11
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:29,980
holding costs.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,610
So the insight though, that we want

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,050
to bring out from using incremental discounts,

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,040
the way to figure it out is that, you

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,690
can assume once I go above a certain break point,

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,710
all of the costs for the quantity that I bought

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,870
below that breakpoint becomes a fixed cost that we'll call Fi.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,620
The idea is if I'm above a certain break point,

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,300
it doesn't matter how many more I order--

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,370
I have a fixed amount, it won't change the price

21
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,490
that I paid for that first quantity that's

22
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,230
applying to the lower discount level.

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,810
So what this means is whenever I move from one price--

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,150
and this is the c0, this is the base price / unit.

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,270
And I might have a c1 for another discount,

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,750
and a c2 for another discount, where c1 only

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,170
applies if I go above this Q1 quantity break point,

28
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,580
and c2 only applies here if I go above the Q2 level.

29
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,350
And as we can see, we hope that the c0 is always

30
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,120
greater than c1, which is greater than c2--

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,550
that c2 for the higher quantity discount

32
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,200
should always be the lowest price per unit.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,350
But what I'm pointing out here for this fixed cost is,

34
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,480
if I look at the c0, the lowest period where

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,050
I have no discount, my fixed cost-- this is the F0, my fixed

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,250
cost for being in zone 0 where no discount applies, is there.

37
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,440
If I'm in this zone here between Q1 and Q2,

38
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,440
then I look at the price of c1 and I

39
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,785
see that this point is actually a fixed price-- I'm

40
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:07,990
going to call it F1-- because no matter

41
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,900
how much I order, whether it's here,

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,230
or here, or here, the amount that I pay for quantity

43
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,860
Q1 doesn't change, because it's going

44
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,860
to be based off of this amount.

45
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,510
So it doesn't really affect, so we

46
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,820
can treat that as a fixed cost.

47
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,320
For the second zone above Q2, this point

48
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,550
here will be the fixed cost for that.

49
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,100
And I can assume the per price cost, per unit cost,

50
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,071
is going to be the slope of this C2 line.

51
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:37,570
OK.

52
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,130
So what we want to figure out is how

53
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,880
do I figure out those F1 and F2 quantities when

54
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,020
I go to some of the discounts.

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,880
Well, I know this quantity, this whole quantity

56
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,950
here-- because that's simply the rate at which the base

57
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,170
price, c0, moves over a Q1 quantity.

58
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,260
So I know that the total amount is c0 or c0*Q1.

59
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,810
I also know that this quantity on the top

60
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,170
is the same distance, Q1 multiplied by the slope of c1.

61
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,810
So that's c1*Q1.

62
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,370
But what I want to figure out is this distance,

63
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,780
because that's the fixed quantity or the fixed cost

64
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,990
if I'm in zone one where the first discount applies.

65
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,839
And so I just subtract the two: c0*Q1 - c1*Q1,

66
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,380
is just the difference, (c0 - c1)*Q1.

67
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,890


68
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,340
And so therefore, I know what my fixed cost is.

69
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,630
So if I have a quantity that falls within this zone 1

70
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,560
where the d1 applies, and therefore the cost c1 applies,

71
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,010
then I can use c1 as my variable cost.

72
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,840
But then I'm going to add this fixed cost of F1

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,480
into the calculation.

74
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,970
And F1-- the more general form is right here--

75
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,100
and it's simply the fixed cost of the previous one

76
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,110
plus the difference in the two slopes of the variable cost

77
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,540
times whatever that breakpoint quantity is.

78
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,482
And then you're just going to add in that fixed cost

79
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,440
like you would with the c_t-- because it's just

80
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,829
another piece of the fixed cost, because it doesn't change

81
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,610
with the quantity level as long as I'm within that discount

82
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,190
zone.

83
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,870
So the process for doing this is the same as

84
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,182
for the All Units, just a little bit different.

85
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,890
But you're going to go through and you're

86
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,110
going to calculate each of the fixed cost points

87
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,190
for however many discounts you have.

88
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,350
And always remember that F0 = 0.

89
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,670
There is no fixed discount cost when no discount applies.

90
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,870
Then you find the Q* for each range, including that F1 value.

91
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,920
You do that right here.

92
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,530
And if it's within the allowable range,

93
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,460
then you want to calculate what the total relevant cost is.

94
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,700
If you find the Q* and it's not within the allowable range

95
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,110
of the discount, then just ignore it and move to the next

96
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,270
one.

97
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,900
But if I find one that falls within that range,

98
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,010
then all I want to figure out the total relevant cost--

99
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,880
I can use this equation, which is just

100
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,820
saying it's finding an effective cost per unit,

101
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,150
or effective variable cost-- it's taking what the cost /

102
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,260
unit is for the variable, and then taking that fixed cost

103
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,450
and simply dividing the total quantity that falls under that.

104
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,260
And that's determining and it's adding

105
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,180
to that effective per unit cost.

106
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,167
So that's how you handle Incremental Discounts.

107
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:34,667
