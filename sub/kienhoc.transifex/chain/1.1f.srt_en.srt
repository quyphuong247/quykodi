1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,850
So we talked about using ABC analysis

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,650
to segment SKUs, or products.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,540
Now we're going to talk about segmenting supply chains,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,430
and I'm going to talk about two papers.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,280
The first paper was by Marshall Fisher published

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,830
in the late '90s in the Harvard Business Review

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,220
and he said at the heart of it, if you break down

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,270
all the products you have, they fall into one of two camps.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,570
They're either functional, like cans of soup,

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,460
or they're innovative, like this is a smartphone.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,950
And you could think of the different characteristics

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,440
of these two classic types of products differently.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,350
So the demand for these functional products

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,670
are pretty predictable.

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,870
We've been selling soup for 100 years.

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,210
It's pretty stable.

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,510
The life cycle is two years or longer.

18
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,080
You don't introduce that many new things.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,360
The margin is OK, 5% to 20%, variety is not tremendous.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,760
Error at production is pretty low.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,300
Stockout rates, relatively low because you've

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,150
got predictable demand, not going to mark down too much.

23
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,900
And so the lead time for make to order

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,500
is about six months to a year.

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,470
So what you focus on here, the objective,

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,760
then, is to be efficient.

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,490
You want to be very efficient in delivering functional items

28
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,050
through your supply chain.

29
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,690
Opposed to this are these innovative items.

30
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,040
These are ones where the demand is very unpredictable.

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,580
It's a very short life cycle.

32
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,130
Think fashion items, and cellphones and smartphones

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,620
are becoming fashion items.

34
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,660
Very short life cycle.

35
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,350
The margin is much higher, 20% 60%, very, very high variety.

36
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,900
Look at the number of different smartphones that are out there.

37
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,730
Error at production can be quite high, pretty high

38
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,250
stockout rates, and you have a big forced Mark down.

39
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,780
If you're selling a style from last season,

40
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,380
you're going to have to mark it down pretty tremendously.

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,430
And the lead time is very quick for make to order.

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,600
And so for these innovative products,

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,450
you might want to have a different objective

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,060
for your supply chain, and that idea

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,930
is to match supply and demand.

46
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,640
You might be willing to do something that costs a lot

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,660
to make sure you have your demand covered, while over here

48
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,030
for functional items, you want to be very efficient.

49
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,720
So the key takeaway from this paper

50
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,240
is that maybe you want to think about your products

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,440
in terms of how you want to have your supply chain deliver them.

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,250
If they're functional, you might want

53
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,780
to focus in on being more efficient and cost effective.

54
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,867
Over here on the innovative, cost, sure, it's

55
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:32,450
always something you want to consider,

56
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,300
but the big thing is to make sure you don't

57
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,940
miss any demand because there's a big penalty if you miss that.

58
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,190
So this is a classic paper, and it's a nice way

59
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,380
to think about supply chains having

60
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,890
two very different objectives, cost efficient

61
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,580
or matching supply and demand.

62
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,840
Now, a paper by Olafsson, Lee and Deniece

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,850
took it a step further, and they focused in on cases

64
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,420
that they'd been working on with Hewlett Packard and printers.

65
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,930
And so what they did is they said,

66
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,300
OK, let's look at the different functions or activities

67
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,440
that you might have to make a decision on.

68
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,520
And the ones they focused on were location of manufacturing.

69
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,550
Shipping internationally, how do I move things between borders?

70
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,760
Where do I assemble the product?

71
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,770
How do I fulfill?

72
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,480
Where do I fulfill that from?

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,390
And what model do I use for determining

74
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,330
how to stock the inventory?

75
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,740
And for each of these five functions,

76
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,580
I can have a fast, or a high cost solution for that,

77
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,950
I can have an intermediate, or a slow or low cost.

78
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,870
So Marshall Fisher's paper was focusing in

79
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,470
on this fast, high cost.

80
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,710
That's the innovative products, and the functional products

81
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,590
were maybe only slow or low.

82
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,060
But they said it's not all or nothing.

83
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,280
Maybe you want to think about it a little more finer grained.

84
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,850
And so what they did, just filling this out,

85
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,400
is you can look at maybe your manufacturing

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,830
location is on shore.

87
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,040
That means it's in the EU, the European Union, or the U.S.

88
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,880
This is focused on a United States and Europe market.

89
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,510
Down to a near shore, where it's close, and for the US,

90
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,910
it's in Mexico, and maybe it's in Eastern Europe for the EU.

91
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,090
Or offshore, and this could be in the Pacific Rim or somewhere

92
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,640
else further away.

93
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,560
And so for manufacturing location,

94
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,470
these are the options from a very high cost to a low cost

95
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,277
solution.

96
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:22,860
International shipping-- you can think

97
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,570
of the same way-- I can move it by air,

98
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,250
or at the other extreme, I can move it by boat,

99
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,890
and that's the slowest and lowest cost.

100
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,160
Final assembly-- I can assemble onshore,

101
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,710
near shore again, or way offshore,

102
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,450
just following the same thing as the manufacturing location.

103
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,650
Same thing with fulfillment.

104
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,140
Do I fulfill on, near, or offshore?

105
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,000
And then the question, how do I stock?

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,540
Do I build to stock, do I configure to order,

107
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,919
or do I build to order?

108
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,460
Now, we've talked about build or make

109
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,930
to order and build or make to stock,

110
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,060
but what do I mean by configure to order?

111
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,920
Well, that's almost like the sandwich shop

112
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,220
where I have a sandwich that's already made,

113
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,590
but I do a little bit different to it.

114
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,830
I put it on different types of type of bread.

115
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,930
So if you think of electronics, a lot of it

116
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,710
is that final configuration.

117
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,760
Most of the product is put together,

118
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,960
it's like a last minute postponement.

119
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,420
So let's look at some examples.

120
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,780
In the early 1990s, late 1980s, the original ink jet

121
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,720
followed this type of supply chain.

122
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
They were manufacturing in the market on shore,

123
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
they would rail and truck product,

124
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,617
and they would assemble it on shore,

125
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:32,200
they'd fulfill from on shore, and they

126
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,650
were building to stock.

127
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,110
So if you were in Europe, they were building ones

128
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,530
with French, German, and Spanish writing and conditions in each.

129
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,680
And as you would expect, you would end up with too much

130
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,030
of one country's product and too little of another's.

131
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,110
So there was a challenge here because yes, it

132
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,130
was very fast, is it was close, but they were running

133
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,170
into problems in that the different languages

134
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,130
and different power unit needs were having a problem.

135
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,240
They were having too much of one and too little of another.

136
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,290
So what they did-- this is a classic paper by Hau Lee--

137
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,870
is that they used postponement.

138
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,200
So they shifted.

139
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,530
They said, instead of manufacturing near shore,

140
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,690
let's manufacture it where there's a low cost,

141
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,490
and then I'm going to ship things by ocean.

142
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,500
So I'll have the final assembly on shore and the fulfillment

143
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,740
there, but what I'm going to do different

144
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,400
is this configure to order.

145
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,840
So I'm going to make what's known

146
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,970
as vanilla printers over here.

147
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,490
They're going to be the basic printers that don't change.

148
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,310
And then over here, my configuration,

149
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,370
this is where I add the language component, maybe

150
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,190
the different power cord.

151
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,540
If it's a laptop, what they would typically do

152
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,240
is add the different keyboard.

153
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,130
So anything that's configured to the local market

154
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,550
needs, whether it's selling this in France, or Germany,

155
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,840
or Spain, whatever's different, I configure that in the market.

156
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,760
This whole idea of postponement, modularizing the base product

157
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,590
and mass customization at the end is a classic example.

158
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,450
Interestingly, though, it didn't stay this way.

159
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,310
They don't still service it this way.

160
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,630
They've shifted over the last several years

161
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,000
to this model, where they still produce in a low cost

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,160
manufacturing environment, they ship by ocean.

163
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,110
Final assembly, though, now is off shore.

164
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,820
And so they've found that there's a lower cost here,

165
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,750
and what's really driven this is the product itself.

166
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,460
Think about the late 1980s, early 1990s.

167
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,760
The market for home printers was new,

168
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,870
and so you had a lot of volatility of things.

169
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,910
And what's happened over the last 10, 20, 30 years?

170
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,160
Well, it's gotten very mature.

171
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,880
So the number of SKUs are starting to shrink,

172
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,310
the life's going a little longer.

173
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,770
So they're shifting to be more functional rather

174
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,360
than innovative.

175
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,420
Home printers aren't really an innovative space anymore.

176
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,380
So they've shifted to more of a low cost

177
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,860
solution for manufacturing and movement,

178
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,960
and they've moved to the stocking solutions

179
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,340
at the faster, higher cost method.

180
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,050
So this just a simple example, but it

181
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,760
illustrates a couple things.

182
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,360
One is that segmentation is more nuanced than just

183
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,430
one or the other.

184
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,990
It impacts how I do these very different tasks,

185
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,450
or different functions.

186
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,880
Also, it shows that supply chains evolve over time.

187
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,750
As the products change, as the customers change,

188
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,270
the way you service them, your supply chain, will evolve.

189
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,640
So there's no single best practice that lasts forever.

190
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,140
Things change, and as those things change,

191
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,870
your supply chain needs to adjust.
