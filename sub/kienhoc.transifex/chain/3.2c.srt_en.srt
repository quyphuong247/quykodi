1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,580
So how do companies come up with new product ideas

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,524
and launch them?

3
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:05,440
Well, every company is a little bit different,

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,900
but generally, they follow the same type of process.

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,530
And it serves as a funnel, where new ideas come

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,960
in here on the left, and you might have lots of those,

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,090
and I have far fewer products that actually

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,130
get launched into the market.

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,360
Now, to help companies go from these many to these few,

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,790
companies usually set up a series of gates.

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,340
And gates are simply a set of metrics,

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,700
where each new idea needs to pass

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,930
these certain metrics in order to go to the next stage.

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,890
So the way these are set up is they get progressively more

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,510
difficult and more demanding.

16
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,790
And they might be in terms of financial targets,

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,960
in terms of cost, in terms of revenue, profitability,

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,400
the whole size of the market for sales,

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,260
whether it cannibalizes existing products, et cetera.

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,280
So you can think of a series of gates or questions

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,340
that are required for that product or that new idea

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,410
concept to pass before it's allowed

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,000
to go to the next stage of development.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,590
And this is done for two reasons.

25
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,040
One is, you want to make sure that good ideas make it

26
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,270
to the market.

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,494
But second, and probably more importantly,

28
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:07,410
you want to make sure that the bad ideas never

29
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,890
see the light of day.

30
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,970
So you want to separate the wheat from the chaff.

31
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,890
So we can think of, in between these gates,

32
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,360
are what's known as stages.

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,860
This process is also often called a stage-gate process.

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,154
And the number of gates and number of stages

35
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:23,070
differ from companies.

36
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,350
Some have six, some have eight, there's

37
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,020
a whole professional society that looks at this.

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,390
And so this is a really quick overview

39
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,660
of what is essentially almost a discipline.

40
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,710
So you have this first stage here,

41
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,500
which is discovery, idea generation.

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,650
The next stage is a little more detailed.

43
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,250
You try to scope out the size of the market.

44
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,860
Then you might have a stage where

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,890
you're building the business case for your individual firm.

46
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,540
What will the revenues be for this firm?

47
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,540
You might go into development in the next stage,

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,500
where you build a prototype.

49
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,680
You might test and validate this in a pilot study

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,832
in another stage.

51
00:01:56,832 --> 00:01:58,290
And each of these lead, eventually,

52
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,550
to the last stage, which is commercialization and launch.

53
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,160
And so the idea here is that I'm taking an idea,

54
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,890
and I'm really refining it, improving it, and eventually,

55
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,264
commercializing it.

56
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:10,889
Now, if you look at the number of ideas

57
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,490
that come in, studies have shown that out of the 100 ideas

58
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,870
that come in in stage one, about 2/3

59
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,460
make it to that initial scoping, about half

60
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,610
make it to building the business case, about a third to actually

61
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,120
development of some sort of prototype, and about a quarter

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,010
make it out into the market.

63
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,970
So we're talking about forecasting, so why do we care?

64
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,360
Well, the type of forecast will change

65
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,670
based on where you are in this process.

66
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,580
The initial stages are more "total market revenue"

67
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,150
potential.

68
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,130
You're looking, trying to understand how

69
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,894
big is this potential market.

70
00:02:45,894 --> 00:02:47,310
Then you're going to start looking

71
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,160
at what is the potential of sales for this firm,

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,060
for my firm, if I introduce this process, this product?

73
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,950
Then I go to stage four and five.

74
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,700
I'm looking at forecasting unit sales, at the eaches level.

75
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,530
And finally, at the end, I not only

76
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,590
have to forecast my unit sales, but by location,

77
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,770
because I need to know how to deploy this product out

78
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,250
into the market.

79
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,810
So as you can see, as I go through from the stage one

80
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,390
to stage six, from the initial stage of ideas,

81
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,070
I'm going from many ideas to very few final products.

82
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,370
My forecasting process and my forecasting technique

83
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,480
will change.

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,190
And so this is based off of a survey that

85
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,050
was done of about 170 firms and looked at the different methods

86
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,200
that are used.

87
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,170
And as you can see, the different types of methods,

88
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,660
it's widely varying.

89
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,420
And you can see these subjective metrics--

90
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,250
subjective forecasts, rather.

91
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,630
Customer market research, executive opinion,

92
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,180
sales force composites.

93
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,730
They're the most heavily used, and that makes sense

94
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,782
that they're probably used predominantly

95
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:51,740
during the first couple of stages, where you're

96
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,930
trying to get a big sense of whether I should start or even

97
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,510
enter this market.

98
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,940
But they also differ in terms of the product type.

99
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,150
So if it's a new-to-company or new-to-world,

100
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,210
you'd expect to see more of those subjective techniques

101
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,410
as well.

102
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,110
But on average, companies don't use just one,

103
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,510
they use about three different methods.

104
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,120
And it depends on where you are in the stage, as well

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,300
as the type of product that you're trying to forecast for.

106
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,170
It also differs in terms of who you're selling to,

107
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,630
because business-to-business, B2B firms,

108
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,250
tend to use these more qualitative or subjective

109
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,130
forecasting methods than business-to-consumer.

110
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,180
Now, why?

111
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,270
Probably because there's many, many more consumers,

112
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,440
so you have more history that you can rely upon.

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,570
On average, you don't have as many businesses

114
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,300
if you're a B2B firm than if you're a B2C firm,

115
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,290
you have many more consumers that you're dealing with.

116
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,170
And also, they differ in terms of that the forecasting

117
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,630
horizon is a lot longer for the B2B versus the B2C firms.

118
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,396
You have much faster lifecycle for those consumers.

119
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:01,726
But anyway, this gives you a sense

120
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:03,100
of the different types of methods

121
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,440
that are used for forecasting for new products.

122
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,432
Now, what we're going to do next is

123
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,390
go into something that we haven't talked about,

124
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,098
because we've talked about some of these,

125
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:14,080
and we've talked about exponential smoothing,

126
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,990
linear regression, moving average.

127
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,310
We haven't talked about looks-like analysis.

128
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,440
So let's talk about that really quickly,

129
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,340
and then we'll dive in depth to another different type

130
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,240
of technique.

131
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,800
So essentially, what looks-like or analogous forecasting is

132
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,210
just what it sounds like--

133
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,070
you look at something similar that

134
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,630
has been launched in the past.

135
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,360
You look for a comparable product launch.

136
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
You create a month-by-month or week-by-week--

137
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,930
whatever your periods are--

138
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,960
sales record, and you use this percent of total sales

139
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,390
as a guide to the trajectory of what

140
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,610
your sales for your new product launch is going to look like.

141
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,700
And this is similar to using what's

142
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,400
known as comps or comparisons in real estate.

143
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,610
I look at like properties-- the same square footage,

144
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,110
the same location--

145
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,270
and then I use that as a comparison

146
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,850
to see if the property I'm looking at,

147
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,230
if it's in the right ballpark.

148
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,460
So some people talk about using a structured analogy,

149
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,930
and this is simply a refinement of what we're doing up here,

150
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,200
where you create a database of all past launches

151
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,240
and you track the sales over time.

152
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,310
But then you characterize each of the launches

153
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,410
by product characteristics-- the type

154
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,080
of the product, the category, the season that it

155
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,870
was introduced, is it a winter introduction or fall,

156
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,740
the price, the competitor's price, maybe some of the market

157
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,840
demographics that you're targeting,

158
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,120
and then physical characteristics of the product.

159
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,550
This way, when I have a new launch, I can search

160
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,940
and I can query by any of these characteristics

161
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,890
and see, OK, this launch, which was kind of similar to mine,

162
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,650
looked like this.

163
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,590
And they had 30% of their sales in the first two weeks.

164
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,380
I can use that as an estimate.

165
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,020
Now, the only caveat that we put to this

166
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,030
is that you have to avoid--

167
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,270
it's a whole critical how I populate this database.

168
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,570
I have to avoid only including the successful launches.

169
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,680
People try not to remember the ones that were not successful,

170
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,890
but those are very important to make sure that data makes it

171
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,090
into your database.

172
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,380
So this is kind of a quick overview

173
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,780
of looks-like analysis.
