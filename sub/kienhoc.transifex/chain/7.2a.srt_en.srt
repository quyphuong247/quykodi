00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,990
In this lesson we're going to continue

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,180
working with the single period inventory

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,280
model, or the newsvendor model.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,410
Specifically, we're going to look and find out

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,890
how to calculate the expected profitability.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,120
We're going to look a little harder at expected units short.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,701
It's a very valuable concept, and we're

8
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,075
going to be using this a lot when

9
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:20,956
we look at other inventory models.

10
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:22,580
We're going to look at how that applies

11
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,350
to the normal distribution.

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,910
So we're going to look at the unit normal loss function.

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,140
Then we're going to apply all of this to the NFL Jersey problem

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,290
and gain some insights from that.

15
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,700
All right, so let's get started.
