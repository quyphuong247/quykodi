1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,840
The next set of extensions to the EOQ,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,340
or Economic Order Quantity, deal with the volume, or quantity

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,420
discounts, with how much you buy.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,600
So the assumption we're going to loosen

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,770
is going to be this one up here, this discounts.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,750
And so instead of having the purchase price, or the price

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,560
per item, c, be constant, it's going

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,620
to be a function, now, of how much we buy of the Q.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,360
So since the purchase price is a function of Q,

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,460
it is now a relevant decision-- it

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,170
is in that relevant variable for how much I'm going to buy.

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,840
So we need to include that, when we determine the EOQ.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,032
So let's look at the three most common cases.

14
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:41,740
There are many ways you can do discounts,

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,830
but here the three most common.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,139
And so the first is All Units Discount.

17
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:48,430
And this is where, whatever the discount is that you're

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,470
going to give, applies to all the units that you purchase,

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,940
as long as you exceed some break point quantity.

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,070
So along the horizontal axis, here,

21
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,860
I've got the Q, the quantity you're going to order,

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,750
and c is the cost / item, and D is your annual demand.

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,620
And so I put in this Q1 and this Q2, and these are break points.

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,970
So if you buy above Q1, right, you

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,650
get a lower rate cost per item.

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,500
So here, this c0 would be the lowest,

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,190
or it would be the initial price,

28
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,520
and then this c1 would apply if I'm in that break point

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,920
past Q1.

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,200
And cost two, c2, would apply if I'm above that break point, Q2,

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,720
and you'd expect that c0 is greater

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,620
than c1 is greater than c2.

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,740
In other words, you get a lower cost per item as you go up.

34
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,950
And this is very common.

35
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,630
This is the most common in industrial settings, where

36
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,100
you try-- the vendor tries to encourage you to order more,

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,780
then it helps them with their economies of scale.

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,870
The next type that you see a lot in the retail space,

39
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,960
is what's known as an Incremental Discount.

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,860
And this where a discount applies to the c,

41
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,530
only to the quantity that's purchased beyond the break

42
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,120
point.

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,250
So here, I have the same two break points, Q1 and Q2.

44
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,520
But the idea is, if I buy, 1-Q1, so I'm buying this, right,

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,690
and I'm paying that price where that's c0.

46
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,740
As I break over there, I'm still paying

47
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,380
c0 for all the items up to Q1.

48
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,100
Beyond that, every item beyond that, up to break point 2,

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,970
I'm paying c1 as an incremental cost.

50
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,670
So it only applies to the quantities

51
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,380
beyond the break point.

52
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,590
So think of it as if you go to some store

53
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,540
where you're buying some clothes, you might "buy 2,

54
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,090
get 1 (get a third) at half price".

55
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,820
Or those coffee cards where you "buy 11,

56
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,430
you get the 12th for free".

57
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,150
That's an Incremental Discount.

58
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,470
You see that a lot of times in retail situations.

59
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,440
The last one that we're going to talk about

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,470
is a One Time Only Discount, and this

61
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,990
happens in industrial settings.

62
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,620
And the idea is your vendor, whether they're

63
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,990
trying to hit end of quarter, or end of year,

64
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,650
for some reason they're offering you a big discount.

65
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,650
So if my inventory on hand looks like this, and this

66
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,530
is that common sawtooth that we've talked about,

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,350
where this is the cycle stock.

68
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,940
And instead of how much you normally buy, he's saying well,

69
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,150
you know what, if you buy a whole bunch more,

70
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,320
then I'll give you a really good price on it.

71
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,710
So there's no quantity limit.

72
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,870
It's kind of a one time buy, and then you

73
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,100
go back to your normal order frequency.

74
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,110
So we'll talk about how you determine

75
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,080
whether it makes sense to do this one time buy,

76
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,362
and how much you should buy.

77
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:39,070
So these are the three types of discounts

78
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,924
that we're going to discuss.

79
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:41,424
