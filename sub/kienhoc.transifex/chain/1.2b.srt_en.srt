00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,770
OK, we're going to talk about three forecasting truisms.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,030
And a truism is something that's so self-evident and so

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,390
obvious it's too obvious to even mention.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,300
But it's worth mentioning.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,140
So the first truism we're going to go into

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,000
is that forecasts are always wrong.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,490
And you'll always see this whenever someone talks

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,360
about forecasting.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,090
It's the first thing they say.

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,960
Forecasting is especially difficult,

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,680
especially when you talk about the future, is a common quote.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,618
And so why are forecasts always wrong?

13
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:32,409
Well, we can think of demand as essentially

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,970
a continuous variable.

15
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,570
And think back so when you learned all about continuous

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,200
versus discrete variables.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,540
If I have some distribution with a probability of 90,

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,800
then the probability that I will pick something up

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,660
and it'll have a value of 89.62397 is essentially zero.

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,250
So the ability to pick a point out

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,020
of a continuous distribution is very hard.

22
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,920
It almost approaches zero.

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,720
So the idea of having a point forecast, be correct, it's

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,570
very random.

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,120
It never happens.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,910
So yes, forecasts are always wrong.

27
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,300
The other thing to think about is

28
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,120
it every estimate has an error band.

29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,580
So a forecast is just an estimate.

30
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,590
And what you're doing with this estimate,

31
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,090
you're making with a different level

32
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,920
of confidence or degree of confidence.

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,050
So that's that error band that you

34
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,080
think-- it's 89 point whatever plus or minus 2.

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,750
And so you have an idea of what your band is.

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,110
Also, forecasts are highly disaggregated.

37
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,120
Typically in supply chains, you don't

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,890
need to just forecast, say, the number of blue blazers

39
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,524
that will be sold across the country.

40
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:40,315
You need to know the number of blue blazers

41
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:42,520
that are going to be sold in Boston,

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,000
and not just in Boston, but at this store, and not just blue

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,540
blazers at this store, but on this date or this week

44
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,750
of this size.

45
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,585
So you have this highly disaggregated level

46
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:54,680
of forecast.

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,710
Usually it's a SKU, location, time combination forecast.

48
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,270
And as we'll see, as you get more and more disaggregated,

49
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,510
it gets harder and harder to forecast,

50
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,610
leading to your forecast always be wrong.

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,430
Also, things always happen.

52
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,170
Things change.

53
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,170
So the idea that a forecast would always be correct just

54
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,250
doesn't make sense anyway.

55
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,430
So that's the truism.

56
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,581
So what do you do about it?

57
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,080
And we'll talk more about this as we

58
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,610
go through the different lectures.

59
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,760
But essentially, the big point is, don't focus,

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,980
don't fixate on the point value of a forecast.

61
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,150
Think about it as a guide, as a directional guide.

62
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,630
And you want to try to use range forecasts.

63
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,670
You want to get some kind of estimate

64
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,160
not just of what you think the exact point will be,

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,890
but what a range of that will be.

66
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,940
And a good way to do that is to capture

67
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,910
the error of your forecast, because that will naturally

68
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,420
give you a range.

69
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,080
As you capture this over time, you'll be able to say, well,

70
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,600
my forecast is usually correct plus or minus 15%.

71
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,670
So as you get this error forecast,

72
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,860
you can use that for your future forecasting.

73
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,600
And specifically, we'll see in later lectures,

74
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,570
you'll use that error of the forecast to help

75
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,750
set up your safety stock or your buffer capacity for inventory.

76
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,350
So we'll talk more about this.

77
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,640
But the first truism is that forecasts are always wrong.

78
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,820
And it's true.

79
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,990
It's a cliche.

80
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,750
But it's not that planning and forecasting

81
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,960
is a futile activity, it helps you set a potential planning

82
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,510
target.
