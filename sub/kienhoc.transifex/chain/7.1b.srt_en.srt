1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,040
OK, now let's take a closer look at the EOQ

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,250
with planned backorders.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,930
Our notation hasn't changed.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,980
You see we have all the same things.

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,780
The only thing we've added here is the shortage cost, c_s.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,640
And notice the dimensions: it's dollars

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,600
per unit time, which is the same as the excess Holding

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,900
Cost for the c_e, which remember,

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,390
is just the cost of the item (the variable cost)

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,930
* (the carrying or holding charge).

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,810
So what you will see is that the planned backorder problem

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,950
really is just a trade-off between having excess

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,900
or too much inventory, and having too little

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,210
and being short.

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,870
It's really a trade-off -- and this is our lead-in to other

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,870
types of inventory models.

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,030
So what's the problem we're facing?

18
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,040
Well, looking at our inventory chart again, our standard EOQ.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,140
Remember, our policy used to be: when inventory is at zero,

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,150
place your order.

21
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,735
So at each of these time periods,

22
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:56,620
I would place an order for Q. And the question we're raising

23
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,660
is: what happens if I allowed it to go to backorders?

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,489
So I'm allowing the situation to go to a backorder

25
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,950
or to stockout --

26
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,190
and so the questions we're trying to figure out are: 1.

27
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,940
What should my new Q be?

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,930
And then also, how far down should I be willing to go?

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,940
How much backorder, how much stockout

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,010
should I allow to happen?

31
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,200
So if we look at this situation, what we can see is that each

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,450
replenishment cycle -- remember the duration is T for that,

33
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,350
the length or duration of a replenishment cycle --

34
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,890
we can divide that into two: T1, which is the length of time

35
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,800
that I actually have inventory on hand, and T2,

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,220
the length of time of that replenishment cycle where

37
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,630
I'm backordered or stocked out.

38
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,070
So if I know the T1 and T2, I can naturally figure out what

39
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,120
my b is going to be -- and that's the quantity that

40
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,850
I'll be backordered.

41
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,890
And then I can figure out the maximum Inventory On Hand I'll

42
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,970
have, which is simply the order quantity Q minus that backorder

43
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,420
amount: Q - b.

44
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,940
So what we're going to try and figure out is essentially --

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,480
let me see if I can change my pen color here--

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,030
I'm going to look at the area of this triangle,

47
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,530
which is essentially the inventory I have on hand,

48
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,540
and I'm going to multiply that by c_e, the cost of excess.

49
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,640
And I'm going to compare that to this triangle --

50
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,390
I'm going to multiply this with c_s,

51
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,650
because this is going to be the cost of the shortage.

52
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,330
So again, we're trading off excess inventory

53
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,790
versus shortage.

54
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,050
How do I do that?

55
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,380
Total relevant cost equation.

56
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,450
Notice that I have two variables here.

57
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,035
One is the Q, which is the order quantity,

58
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:47,180
and the other is the b, how far I'm

59
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,790
willing to go into backorder.

60
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,060
Similar terms -- I've got the ordering cost:

61
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,440
c_t is cost / order.

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,020
D / Q, again, is the number of orders I will place over

63
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,990
my longer time period -- let's just say it's a year.

64
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,330
Then I've got my inventory Holding cost,

65
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,560
it's going to be c_e, the cost of the excess,

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,710
times the area of that triangle, of this triangle right here.

67
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,240
Let me highlight it again.

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,330
1/2, the base is going to be T1 / T --

69
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,250
it's essentially the percentage of the time

70
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,480
of the replenishment period that I will have inventory on hand,

71
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,140
times the height, Q - b.

72
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,810
Then I'm going to add in the shortage cost,

73
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,110
and that's going to be c_s, that cost of shortage

74
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,590
we talked about, times the area of this triangle.

75
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,750
Let me just highlight it again.

76
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,280
This triangle right in here.

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,510
OK, so it's going to be c_s * 1/2 * (T2/T) {the base} * b

78
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,520
{the height}.

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,170
Now I know by looking at these triangles and remembering back

80
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,900
to geometry that the relationship for the large

81
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,280
triangle, Q/T, is going to be the same as (Q-b)/T1 for this

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,500
triangle that I'm highlighting, and the same for the b / T2

83
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,310
for this small triangle that I highlighted here --

84
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,220
the ratios are all the same.

85
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:16,700
So that means the ratio of T1/T = (Q-b)/Q (just rearranging

86
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:23,475
terms) and T2/T = b/Q. Again, just rearranging terms so I get

87
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:27,750
it into a form that I can use.

88
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,390
So, using these relationships, I look back at my Total Relevant

89
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,680
Cost equation and I can clean it up a little bit.

90
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,830
Wherever I had a T1/T or a T2/T, I'm

91
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,730
just going to replace it with my new quantities.

92
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,340
So the total relevant cost equation is here,

93
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,840
and I can clean it up a little bit,

94
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,880
and so I get this Total Relevant Cost equation

95
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,310
as a function of the order quantity and the amount

96
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,610
I want to backorder.

97
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,290
And you can see the three terms -- the ordering cost,

98
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,610
the second term is the inventory Holding cost,

99
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,640
and the third term is the shortage cost.

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,040
Next video, we'll solve it!
