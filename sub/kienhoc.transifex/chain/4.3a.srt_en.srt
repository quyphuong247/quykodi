1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,730
In this lesson, we're going to make some extensions to the EOQ

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,400
model.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,925
We saw how robust the model is in the previous lesson,

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,300
and now we're going to see how we

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,417
can use this simple, simple model to many different cases.

6
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:14,375
And so if I go back to the assumptions we made,

7
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,410
what we're going to do is loosen some of these assumptions

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,980
to create situations that are a little more realistic.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,850
So the first one we're going to do

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,550
is, we're going to loosen up this whole idea of lead time.

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,550
And we're going to move away from the assumption

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,310
that it's an instantaneous lead time,

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,200
and allow it to be constant, and to have a real positive lead

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,170
time.

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,350
Then we're going to go into discounts.

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,020
And we're going to say, OK, what happens if the purchase

17
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,760
price that I offer for an item is

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,520
a function of how much I order?

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,470
And we're going to look at three different types of discounts,

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,290
all units, incremental, and one-time buy.

21
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,876
And then finally, what we'll do is

22
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:53,250
we'll come back to the lead time,

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,890
and we're going to look at the idea of internally replenishing

24
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,630
products.

25
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,190
Instead of receiving all the products instantaneously

26
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,910
in one big delivery, we're going to assume and see

27
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,530
what the case is, when I'm making

28
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,160
my items as the order comes.

29
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,060
And so I'll be replenishing it incrementally.

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,370
And so these are the three extensions

31
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,790
we're going to make in this lesson.

32
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,530
