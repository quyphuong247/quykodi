1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,720
In this extension to the EOQ, we're

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,570
going to consider if we have finite replenishment.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,590
And so what this means is we're going

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,760
to loosen the assumption on lead time.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,430
If I order Q*, instead of that whole quantity showing up all

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,200
at once, it's going to start coming in increments,

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,470
because I'm making it as I go.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,350
And so once the order is placed, I'm

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,040
going to start making this product in my plant

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,020
on whatever machine I have, and I'm

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,860
going to satisfy the demand out of that,

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,600
until I accumulate enough.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,220
So let's take a look at this and see how this affects things.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,840
So let's take an example where I assume that the production

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,820
rate is P units per time.

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,830
So that's the rate at which I can produce items.

17
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,240
And so I have some questions.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,781
First of which, how long does it take

19
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,700
to produce Q units, whatever Q is.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,730
Well, if I know what my order quantity Q is going to be,

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,380
and I know my rate of production,

22
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,860
then it's simply going to be that total amount divided

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,500
by the rate.

24
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,370
So it's Q/P. So let's think about this for a second.

25
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,200
What happens if P takes the value of infinity?

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,450
If instantaneously it produces-- my machine is so fast,

27
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,540
it makes things almost instantaneously-- well,

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,930
then that means that the production slope line would

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,050
just be a vertical line, and essentially I

30
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,930
would default back to "EOQ with instantaneous delivery".

31
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,930
Now, what do you think the minimum value

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,040
that this rate can be, this production rate?

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,770
Let's suppose if P was less than the demand rate D.

34
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,000
What would that mean?

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,075
Well, that would mean I would never catch up.

36
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:41,367
I start producing it, and the demand is faster than

37
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,700
the rate at which I can produce.

38
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,530
And if that's the case, then I need to make it ahead of time,

39
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,620
and I can't replenish it when the order comes in.

40
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,310
So therefore, I'd have to start making things earlier.

41
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,120
So we know that the bounds, then,

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,830
are going to be between infinity and D, the demand rate.

43
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,720
But let's go on a little further.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,330
And so we look at what the demand slope is.

45
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,260
And it's negative here, because it's showing my inventory

46
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,654
on hand as it depletes over time, based on the demand.

47
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:12,070
And so the question I want to know

48
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,600
is, what is the accumulation rate?

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,780
So as I'm producing it at P and it's going away at slope,

50
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,320
-D, then the accumulation rate is simply the sum of those.

51
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,820
It's going to be the production minus the demand, P

52
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,720
- D. So that's the slope of this line.

53
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,700
And so the next question we want to ask,

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,440
what is the most I'm going to have?

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,260
Because the beauty here is, as I start producing,

56
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,170
I don't hold any inventory.

57
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,654
So I'm producing and satisfying the demand all along here.

58
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:46,070
But I'm not holding any inventory,

59
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,460
therefore I'm not incurring any inventory holding costs

60
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,140
until my machine is going to stop at some point

61
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,320
because I'm going to have enough to satisfy demand.

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,150
That's that maximum inventory point.

63
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,640
What is that going to be?

64
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,530
Well, it's simply going to be this rate,

65
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,040
(P - D), times that time, Q/P.

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,810
And if I clean it up a little bit, I get this term.

67
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,532
And all I did was multiply through and cancel out the Ps.

68
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,490
But it's the same thing, it's just (Q/P)*(P-D).

69
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,720


70
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
And so then the question is, what

71
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,810
is my average inventory on hand.

72
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,640
If I'm producing at this rate P, my demand is at D --

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,640
I'm going to produce Q/P time until I can stop,

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,200
because I've created enough for that replenishment cycle.

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,990
And so that average inventory on hand

76
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:36,040
is simply going to be whatever this height is and over two,

77
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,790
because remember, the replenishment cycle,

78
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,740
we're at an infinite horizon.

79
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,380
So it's just going to be 1/2 base times height.

80
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,510
1/2 of the base, which is one replenishment

81
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,861
cycle, times height, which is my maximum level of inventory.

82
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,985
So my average inventory on hand is (1 - D/P)*(Q/2).

83
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:55,060


84
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,930
So how is this going to change the Q?

85
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,220
Well, we can think about it and because I'm not being charged

86
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,560
in anything for my inventory for this period until I hit that

87
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,330
maximum amount, then you would guess that this will increase

88
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,940
what my Q* is going to be.

89
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,570
So if I just go through and create the total relevant cost

90
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,454
equation, notice that the transaction cost,

91
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:20,870
the ordering cost, doesn't change.

92
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,140
Its still c_t times the number of replenishments or cycles

93
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,370
I expect to have in the course the year, D/Q.

94
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,190
And then here, this is just the holding cost.

95
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,620
So I have h*c, the unit purchase price times the inventory

96
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,820
holding rate.

97
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,900
And then this Q/2, this is just my average quantity on hand:

98
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,970
Q times ((1 - D)/P)/2.

99
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,630


100
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,399
So my economic production quantity--

101
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,940
I'm just going to take a first order derivative for this just

102
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,180
like we did for EOQ-- the only thing that's going to change

103
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,739
is, I have this down to this term.

104
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,280
And if I clean this up a little bit--

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,727
because you see that EOQ is kind of buried in here--

106
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,560
so it's just going to be EOQ / sqrt (1-D/P).

107
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,530


108
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,620
So as we said before, if I look at this values

109
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,510
that the production rate can have,

110
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,900
as it's really, really fast, what's that going to do?

111
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,660
That means this EPQ is going to approach the EOQ that we would

112
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,880
have done, if I wasn't producing things as they were demanded.

113
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,660
As the production rate gets slower,

114
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,520
then this EPQ gets bigger and bigger compared to EOQ,

115
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,540
because what this is saying is, as I produce slower,

116
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,180
there's going to be a larger quantity of the product

117
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,370
that I'm making where I won't incur any inventory holding

118
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,050
costs.

119
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,870
So a slower production rate will increase the EPQ,

120
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,580
and it'll increase that because it's

121
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,040
saying the inventory holding cost is getting lower.

122
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,020
