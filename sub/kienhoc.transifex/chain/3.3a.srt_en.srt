1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,062
In this lesson, we're going to build predictive models.

2
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:05,520
And specifically, we're going to use ordinary least squares

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,570
regression.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,300
Now, this is going to be a very hands on and practical approach

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,660
to this.

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,410
There's a lot of theoretical underpinnings

7
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,950
that we'll touch a little bit upon.

8
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,170
But the main focus is to understand the development

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,210
and analysis of models.

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,820
We'll be using the same example throughout the lesson

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,830
and that is for Duffy Industries.

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,440
So Robin Curtin is the new Transportation VP

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,430
for the company.

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,230
And she's trying to understand what

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,390
rates they should have for their full truckload service.

16
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,390
Now, this is going to be for a new facility they

17
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,920
don't have data for.

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,140
The company uses contract over-the-road trucking

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,510
companies for these TL or full truckload shipments.

20
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,460
Truckload shipments are ones that move from one origin

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,350
to one destination, say a manufacturing plant

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,400
to a distribution center with no intermediate stop offs.

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,222
Now, she only has a snapshot of data

24
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:54,180
showing the cost and some other characteristics

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,990
of about 100 truckload shipments from a different facility.

26
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,070
And so she wants to create a model or models to answer

27
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,370
the following questions.

28
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,850
One, what characteristics are driving my rates

29
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,056
for truckload service?

30
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:08,430
What are the things I can change?

31
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,722
How can I make my rates lower?

32
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:12,930
And the second question is, what rate should I expect

33
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,210
if I open some new lanes?

34
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,640
So we're going to create both a descriptive and predictive

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,950
model.

36
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,410
So if you have the data, and it's

37
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,270
available at the bottom of this video,

38
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,470
you can take a look at it.

39
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,090
And so let me give you a quick summary of what's

40
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,520
in that dataset because we'll be using this, as I said,

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,540
throughout the lesson.

42
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,470
So the first field, all the columns are fields.

43
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,330
Every row is essentially an observation.

44
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,410
So the first field is the ID or the unique identification

45
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,460
of the load.

46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,210
The second column is the cost per load or CPL.

47
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,100
The third is the distance in miles

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,620
of each lane or each shipment.

49
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,900
The lead time is the time from when

50
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,890
the company offered the load to the carrier

51
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,300
and they have to pick it up.

52
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,310
So the longer that lead time is, the more time the carrier has.

53
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,295
If it's a 0, that means it's same day.

54
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:04,320
The next column is trailer length.

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,920
And that's just the length and feet of the trailer.

56
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Then there's the weight.

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,461
That's the weight of the goods that are in the trailer moving

58
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,190
in pounds.

59
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,420
And finally, there's an equipment type,

60
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,600
whether it's a dry van or refrigerated.

61
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,390
Refrigerated just simply has a refrigerator unit on it

62
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,740
that keeps it at a certain temperature.

63
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,550
So these are the first 7 records or observations.

64
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,540
We have 100 in the dataset.

65
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,306
So with any good dataset, what will you do?

66
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:30,180
You'll take some quick statistics, everything

67
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,770
we learned in the previous lessons.

68
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,850
So here I have for the cost per load, distance,

69
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,390
lead time, trailer length, and weight, the summary statistics.

70
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,580
And you see, I kind of went overboard here,

71
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,520
the min, the mode, the median, the mean, the max,

72
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,680
the percentiles, range, the inner quartile range,

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,670
standard deviation.

74
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,890
I went with a sample.

75
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,380
If you did population, it's not dramatically different

76
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,330
because we have so many observations.

77
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,430
And then I also put the correlation down there.

78
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,130
And that correlation is with each of the columns

79
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,500
with the cost per load column.

80
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,530
And so you can look at this and test your data.

81
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,562
Hopefully, you come up with the same numbers.

82
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,520
And as I look at this, there are some questions

83
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,700
that I might have.

84
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,850
What should I do next?

85
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,690
Because I can summarize the data.

86
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,440
And this is great.

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,770
I know on average it's going to cost me about $3,000

88
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,050
a load, $3,132.

89
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,030
The average distance is 1,200 miles.

90
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,200
I give, on average, just under a week of lead time, 5.8 days.

91
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,810
The trailer length really doesn't make sense

92
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,000
because it's either 48 or 53.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,430
So looking at the average really doesn't make sense.

94
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,596
But the average weight is about 26,000 pounds.

95
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:36,720
So that tells me something.

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,350
And I can see the standard deviations.

97
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,840
But what I really want to know is, well,

98
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,410
how does the cost per load impact

99
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,510
and is impacted by these other variables?

100
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,921
How is it influenced by them?

101
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:49,170
Can I develop a descriptive model, where cost per load

102
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,350
is a function of some collection of these variables

103
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,630
to give me a better estimate of what that will be?

104
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,027
Because this can also be used as a predictive model.

105
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,110
So that's what we're going to do for the remainder

106
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,735
of this lesson.

107
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:01,890
We're going to take this data and develop models

108
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,610
from it to help us answer those first questions that Robin had.
