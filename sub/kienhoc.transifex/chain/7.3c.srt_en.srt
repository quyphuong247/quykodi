1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,530
OK, part 1 says the following.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,680
Without using formal analysis, would you

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,630
agree that using average sales in previous semesters,

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,844
that is, 200 units, as the order quantity is the best policy.

5
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:13,010
So what is being asked here?

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,500
Well, there is a suggested policy.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,980
And that suggestion is to order 200 books.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,200
And we want to know, is this a good policy or not?

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,390
So to get to that, let's first put down the parameters

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,810
that we have.

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,390
We have the sales price p, which is

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,070
how much we going to sell the book for during the selling

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,570
season.

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,520
And that's $160.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,404
We also have a cost-- that is how much it costs the bookstore

16
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:36,070
to get the book.

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,270
And that's $100 per book.

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,410
Also, we have a salvage value again called g.

19
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,780
And that salvage value is $60.

20
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,760
That's how much we expect to get for a book

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,750
after the selling season is over.

22
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,870
So these are the key parameters to this problem.

23
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,700
We have a suggested policy.

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,165
And basically we want to know what

25
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:57,954
are the consequences of following this policy?

26
00:00:57,954 --> 00:00:58,870
How do we get to that?

27
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,340
Well, we can compare it to another policy.

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,890
So let's compare it to a policy where we order 1 unit less.

29
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,950
We only look at that last 200th book.

30
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:19,040
Let's compare to a policy where we said Q equal to 199 units.

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,790
And then we just look at is this last 200th book.

32
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,370
Should we order that or not?

33
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,985
So we boil this whole decision down to that last book.

34
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,360
And then we can get an idea about whether we should order

35
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,090
more or order less than 200.

36
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,100
So let's see what we get here.

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,410
Basically, what happens if you look at 200th book,

38
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,959
there are really only two options.

39
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,500
There are two things that can happen,

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,270
two cases, two scenarios.

41
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,120
Either we are going to sell that 200th book or we're not.

42
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,745
Those are two possible cases.

43
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:49,120
So let's look at them separately.

44
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,760
What are the consequences of each of these different cases.

45
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,700
Let's say the demand is greater than or equal to Q.

46
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,840
What does that mean?

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,897
It means that there's going to be more demand than what

48
00:01:58,897 --> 00:01:59,480
we have books.

49
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,522
So we're going to sell the book.

50
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,480
There's more demand than what we have in stock.

51
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,760
We are going to sell everything that we have in stock.

52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,610
What does it mean to order that 200th book?

53
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,860
Well, it means we're going to get an extra profit.

54
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,940
How much are we going to get in extra profit?

55
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,480
We're going to get $160, which is

56
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,380
what we sell it for the revenues minus the cost, $100.

57
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:27,190
So we're going to get $60 extra profit for that 200th book.

58
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,670
That's one of the cases.

59
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,010
The other case is-- so let's look at the case

60
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,150
where demand is less than Q. What does that mean?

61
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,230
It means that we're not selling that last book.

62
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,500
So instead of getting extra profit, what we're getting

63
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,294
is having one extra book at the end

64
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:43,710
of the semester sitting in a store

65
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,230
that we have to get rid of.

66
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,940
How much extra cost does that mean?

67
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,690
Well, we have the purchase price of the book

68
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,010
or what the store buys it for $100.

69
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,460
And then we get some revenue.

70
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,660
We get that $60 of salvage value.

71
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,300
So we end up with $40 extra cost.

72
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,580
Not as good.

73
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,560
So really, what does this tell us?

74
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,860
This is with that policy.

75
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,540
This is the difference between ordering 200 books

76
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,760
versus ordering 199 books.

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,690
Really, buying the 200th book-- by placing that extra book

78
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,930
order-- we're making a bet.

79
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,070
If that bet is successful, we're going

80
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,302
to get $60 in extra profit.

81
00:03:26,302 --> 00:03:27,760
If we're missing on that bet, we're

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,990
going to bring $40 of extra cost.

83
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,700
So that is sort of the core decision

84
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,020
that we're facing here.

85
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,162
We have to make a bet.

86
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:36,870
And there are two different possibilities

87
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,250
on what we can end up with.

88
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,730
So what we want to know is: is ordering that 200th book a good

89
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,420
bet or not?

90
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,310
How do we determine if it's a good bet?

91
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,320
Well, we look at expectation-- the expected profit of it.

92
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,830
So in order to do that, let's think

93
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,400
about the probabilities of these two different scenarios.

94
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,590
And let's just for sake of argument

95
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,812
say that there is a 0.5 probability for each

96
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:00,520
of the scenarios.

97
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,811
There's a 50% chance that we're going to sell the book.

98
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:05,720
There's a 50% chance that we're not going to sell the book.

99
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,820
What does that mean?

100
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,800
It means there's a 0.5 probability of gaining $60.

101
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,920
There is a 0.5 probability of incurring $40.

102
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,420
So the expectation is positive --

103
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,930
it would make sense to buy that 200th book if there's a 50%

104
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,630
probability for each of the scenarios.

105
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,773
So let's just think about when there

106
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:33,700
is a 50% chance of selling that book and not selling the book.

107
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,600
That's when you're at the mean.

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,170
At the mean, the probability of selling the book

109
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,020
and not selling book are equal.

110
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,710
We have the same probability mass on both sides of the mean.

111
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,430
So really, what we want to do here--

112
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,660
we want to keep increasing.

113
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,220
We want to go a little bit above the mean,

114
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,160
because if you look at this, by adding a 201st book,

115
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,490
we can have the same argument.

116
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,600
We know that this probability over here

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,660
is going to be slightly lower, because there's

118
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,520
a slightly smaller chance of selling that last book if we

119
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,660
add one more book.

120
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,920
If you add a 202nd book, this is going to be even lower.

121
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,830
But we want to keep on adding books

122
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,730
until this probability is actually 0.4,

123
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,480
because at 0.4 it means that this probability is

124
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,810
going to be 0.6.

125
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,590
And that means that the expectation is zero.

126
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,760
So once we've added that book that gives you

127
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,970
these probabilities, adding more books

128
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,500
is not going to bring us an additional expected profit

129
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,190
that's greater than zero.

130
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,520
So this is what we're looking at.

131
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,480
And we know that at the mean there's a 50% probability.

132
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,910
So we want to keep increasing above the mean

133
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,260
until we reach this probability.

134
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,600
Now, do we know whether the 200 is the mean or not?

135
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,120
That's the question here, because if 200

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,470
was the mean demand, it means that we want to go above 200.

137
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,620
Let's think about the information that we have.

138
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,670
What information do we have?

139
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,920
If you look at sales, we can look

140
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,820
at the frequency of the sales.

141
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,790
We know there's a minimum 100 sales.

142
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,380
There's a maximum of 200 sales, the book sales in a season.

143
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,260
And there's an average of 200.

144
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,740
So if you draw the graph like this,

145
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,960
it looks something like that.

146
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,920
So we know that the average sales are 200.

147
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,410
We just said if the mean demand is also 200,

148
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,600
we definitely want to order more than 200 books.

149
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,220
So do we know if mean demand is 200 based on this?

150
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,710
Well, we have to be careful because sales are not

151
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,070
the same as demand.

152
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,140
Why?

153
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,750
Because sales are censored upwards.

154
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,740
What do I mean by that?

155
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,160
Well, think of any time in the past where we sold 250 books.

156
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,360
Do we know from the information that we sold these 250 books

157
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,330
because the demand was exactly 250

158
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,840
or because we just didn't have more

159
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,850
than 250 books in our store?

160
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,000
We don't know that.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,580
So we have to be careful.

162
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,020
Just based on information that we have,

163
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,660
we could have the demand curve.

164
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,840
Like if we look at the PDF of demand, the Probability Density

165
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,140
Function of demand, we might have a tail above turned 250.

166
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,900
If that is the case, it means that the mean

167
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,300
of sales to average sales is less

168
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:23,729
than the mean of the demand.

169
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,020
In either case, we know that it's going to be less than

170
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,060
or equal.

171
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,430
So we set it if mean demand was 200,

172
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,500
we wanted to order more than 200.

173
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,790
Now, we know that mean demand is at least 200.

174
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,410
So we know we want to order at least 200 and then some.

175
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,260
So the answer to the question is that we

176
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,450
want Q star to be greater than-- we

177
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,740
want it to be greater than 200.

178
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,108
