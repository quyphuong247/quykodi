1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,380
The last type of quantity discount I want to talk about

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,660
is the One Time Buy discount.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,410
And the situation is this.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,160
You're already buying stuff from a vendor,

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,260
let's say, and you're buying in a certain amount,

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,760
and you've already figured this out.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,070
You got your Q*, and you got that familiar saw tooth pattern

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,570
going.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,945
But they come to you and say, you

10
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:22,220
know what, if you order an extra special amount of whatever that

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,270
is, I'm not saying how much you have to order,

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,790
but you will get it at a much lower rate.

13
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,330
And so the question is, should you

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,590
take advantage of this offer, this one time deal?

15
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,440
And the reason why this is interesting

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,120
is that this changes the analysis a little bit.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,210
One, the unit price is now part of the relevant cost.

18
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,230
But also, we're trying to compare two things.

19
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,550
We're comparing what is normally done with our regular Q*

20
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:55,420
we've already figured out, to this larger period when I buy

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,160
Qg.

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,540
So this changes from an infinite planning horizon to finite.

23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,570
So all that I really care about is

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,600
what happens over this time frame.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,370
And what is this time frame?

26
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,610
Well it's simply going to be equal to whatever amount I buy

27
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,760
at that discount, Qg, divided by my Demand rate --

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,020
because whatever I buy for Qg, it's going to take me D units /

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,780
time.

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,680
That's what my demand is going to be.

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,170
And that's how it gets depleted.

32
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,711
So we're going to try to figure out--

33
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:27,210
is it better to stick with my normal quantity,

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,460
or go for this Qg amount, and how much should that Qg be.

35
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,510
And we're going to do that by comparing what the rate should

36
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,850
be, the total cost for those.

37
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,900
So we're switching from an infinite planning horizon

38
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,330
to something finite.

39
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,290
And the time period is again the cycle length

40
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,910
that it would take to deplete whatever quantity Qg I decide

41
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,830
to get.

42
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,910
So let's look at this.

43
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,420
How do we figure this out?

44
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,940
Well like anything, we're just going to do a comparison.

45
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,730
So what's the cost, the total relevant cost,

46
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,840
going to be for the normal one, if I

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,800
stick with what I'm doing now?

48
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,620
Well we have to switch to a finite time right?

49
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,890
So I have to specify what my cycle time is, and I'm

50
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,660
going to multiply that by my previous relevant cost

51
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,220
plus my purchase cost.

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,340
So I know my purchase cost for that time is going to be (c*D)

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,900
multiplied by the cycle time-- because I'm only lasting this

54
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,490
long.

55
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,970
So you can see this is cancelled straight out.

56
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,880
Really, it's going to be c*Qg, that quantity that I purchase.

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,440
And then this is the total relevant cost

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,800
for that same quantity for this amount of time, this cycle

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,960
time.

60
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,830
OK, so we have this.

61
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,750
And now I want to find the savings.

62
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,370
So this first term is the total relevant cost

63
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,880
if I stick with what I'm doing.

64
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,580
It's just what I did right up here.

65
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,260
So this first term is the cost if I stay with what I'm doing.

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,180
This second term though, is my total relevant cost

67
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,360
for that special price.

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,502
So what would that be?

69
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:00,960
Well you've got the purchase cost, because I'm figuring out

70
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,580
how much I'm going to buy, Qg.

71
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,350
So that's the purchase cost.

72
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,740
Then I've got the inventory holding cost,

73
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,450
and that's this, my cost / item times my inventory holding

74
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,790
rate.

75
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,990
This Qg/2 is just my average inventory over that time.

76
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,030
But I've got to multiply it by the cycle time

77
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,000
because I'm finite.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,700
I'm with a finite period of time now.

79
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,970
It's not assumed infinite, going on forever.

80
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,370
And then the last term is the ordering cost.

81
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,960
I only order once, so c_t -- it's one order.

82
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,140
So this is my total savings equation.

83
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,150
What do I want to do?

84
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,830
I want to find which Qg maximizes this.

85
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm maximizing my savings.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
So to find the extreme point, I take first derivative,

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,100
set it equal to zero, and I'm going to solve for Qg.

88
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,450
And then just to be sure, what I'm going to do

89
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,530
is take a second derivative and make sure

90
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,210
that it is always less than zero to make

91
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,270
sure it's going to be a global maximum.

92
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,847
And you can see just taking a derivative of this term

93
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:04,930
is pretty straightforward.

94
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,390
You only end up with this term.

95
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,640
And you can see from here it's going to be -2*h*c_g/2D,

96
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
and because h is positive, c_g has to be positive,

97
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,000
and D has to be positive-- it's a negative number.

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,110
Therefore, it will always be a global maximum--

99
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,610
because this will always be less than zero.

100
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,950
So all I'm going to do now is solve for this Qg.

101
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,190
And the optimal quantity is going to be--

102
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,960
I'm just rearranging here, and I get to this--

103
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,260
the Q* is going to be equal to this relationship.

104
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,040
And cleaning up a little bit, I get it down to this form.

105
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,860
So how much do I want to buy if I'm given this discount-- well,

106
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,420
you can guess it's going to depend on how big of a discount

107
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,230
they give you for the cost.

108
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,900
And that's going to really dictate it.

109
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,400
But let's look at some extreme points.

110
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,940
What happens if c_g = c?

111
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,210
In other words, the discount is zero.

112
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,612
It's not really a good deal, it's the same exact price.

113
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:02,570
What's going to happen?

114
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,290
Well this term will go to zero: c - c_g = 0.

115
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,750
And then these terms will cancel out.

116
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,420
So if the quantity discount price

117
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,210
is the same as the normal price, you're

118
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,240
going to order as much as you normally do.

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,970
It doesn't change.

120
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,330
But as you see, as c_g gets smaller and smaller--

121
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,740
what's that going to do?

122
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,290
Well as c_g gets smaller on the denominator,

123
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,280
it's going to make this whole term bigger.

124
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,040
And as the c_g gets smaller, the gap gets bigger.

125
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,880
And so I'm going to order a little more.

126
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,970
So it'll always increase, and it's really

127
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,750
a function of what the discount price is going to be.

128
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,847
