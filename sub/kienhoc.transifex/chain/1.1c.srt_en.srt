1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,940
So now let's talk about Segmentation.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,110
Segmentation is the process by which a firm determines which

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,380
products flow through which channels

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,410
or which supply chains, because in reality, no firm operates

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,660
a single supply chain.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,440
They have multiple supply chains based on the customer needs,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,520
the type of the products, and even the type

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,470
of the supplier that provides the products for that item.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,540
So there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all supply chain,

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,720
and a corollary to this is there's no single best practice

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,650
in how to, say, do forecasting or single best practice on how

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,410
to do inventory management.

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,410
It all depends on the conditions of the product that you're

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,590
selling, the customer you're serving,

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,450
and the suppliers who are serving you.

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,480
All these different combinations make it

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,930
so that you'll have different supply chains.

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,120
And so firms will naturally segment their products,

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,070
customers, and suppliers so that they can treat them in a better

20
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,890
manner, whether it's more efficiently, more

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,610
effectively, whatever.

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,400
So segmentation only makes sense if you're

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,309
going to do something different in the different products

24
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:09,350
that you're segmenting or the different customers

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,869
that you're segmenting.

26
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,660
You have to do something different in terms

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,950
of how you buy it, how you make it, how you move it, store it,

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,800
how you forecast it, or how you sell it.

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,210
So you can think of all the functions in the supply chain

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,800
we talked about, and if I have different segments,

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,930
then I'm going to want to be doing something

32
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,380
different between the different products.

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,160
So for example, in our sandwich shop example,

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,740
my forecasting and demand planning for the ready-to-eat

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,520
sandwiches will be very different from the forecasting

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,720
I'll be using for my components for those one-of-a-kind,

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,610
engineered sandwiches.

38
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,460
You can also think of the inventory planning

39
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,100
will be different in that case.

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,510
But in larger, more real supply chains,

41
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,490
you'll have all these different processes

42
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,750
that you might do differently.

43
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,310
So the question is, how do I treat these different products

44
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,960
differently, and what do I do?

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,280
Well, let's look at an example.

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,260
This is from an internet-based retailer,

47
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,380
and here are two simple examples.

48
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,050
On the left, I have a baseball, and this

49
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,240
is a sport that's played in the United States.

50
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,740
It's a national pastime.

51
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,790
It's mainly played in the summer.

52
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,100
Then to the right, I've got a hockey puck, which

53
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,640
is used in ice hockey, and this is a game that's typically

54
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,490
played in the winter when the ponds and lakes freeze so you

55
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,110
can actually skate on them, and it's used in hockey games.

56
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,065
So if I look at these two products,

57
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:33,940
they have very different demands,

58
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,930
but they're also very similar in some aspects.

59
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,570
They're similar in that they're both sports related,

60
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,140
they're generally a low dollar item, a couple dollars each,

61
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,730
and they have a very small profile.

62
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,340
They're not big products.

63
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,370
However, the big difference is when their demand differs

64
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,242
because you can imagine that what I do in the summer

65
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:55,200
will be different than what I do in the winter,

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,590
and that might be how we want to segment.

67
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,250
So let's look at the supply chain here,

68
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,090
and this is, again, for a distribution out.

69
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,790
So the question I want to focus on

70
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,340
is, where do I store my baseballs and my hockey pucks?

71
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,240
I have some options.

72
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,420
I can keep them in my national distribution center

73
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,010
or I can keep them in my series of fulfillment centers

74
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,970
here because product goes from the distribution center

75
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,051
to the fulfillment centers, and then

76
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:23,550
from the fulfillment centers, that's

77
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,630
where I satisfy each of the customers' demands.

78
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,370
So this fulfillment center up here

79
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,710
satisfies the customers in this area,

80
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,220
this second one takes care of these, and so forth.

81
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,850
So the question is, where do I put my baseballs

82
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,350
and where do I put my hockey pucks?

83
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,600
So in the summer, you'd probably do something like this.

84
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,820
You'd keep your baseballs close to the customers.

85
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,680
Why?

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,770
Because as you have faster demand,

87
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,090
you want to be able to replenish that quickly.

88
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,940
So if people want a baseball and it's in the summer,

89
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,770
then it's very fast response, so I'm pushing them forward.

90
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,650
Now, the downside of that is that I'm

91
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,080
going to have inventory stocked at three locations.

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,300
So I'm going to have a higher level of inventory

93
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,334
for baseballs in the summer, as opposed to these hockey

94
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,750
pucks, which are going to be in less demand in the summer,

95
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,502
and I'm going to keep them at the DC.

96
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,210
Again, because I'm doing a trade-off now,

97
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,019
I have a lower inventory level, but it takes a little longer

98
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,060
for me to satisfy demand, but I don't have too much demand

99
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,020
for hockey pucks in the summer.

100
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,610
Now, in the winter, it all switches.

101
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,117
And I move forward my hockey pucks

102
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:31,950
because I'm going to have greater demand now

103
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,820
in the winter for these, and I move my baseballs.

104
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,810
I start stocking them here in the DC.

105
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,190
So this is a simple example of how

106
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,180
I can segment two seemingly similar products based

107
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,250
on their seasonality over the course of a year.

108
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,320
And the key underlying factor here is velocity.

109
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,440
So in this case, how am I segmenting?

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,500
Well, it's really product velocity.

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,310
Items that move faster, I move them up here.

112
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,150
I move them closer to the customer.

113
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,510
Items that are slower, I move them back.

114
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,210
This is a common approach and we'll see this more and more,

115
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,510
but this is just one example of how I can segment.

116
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,540
And here, I'm really segmenting on speed.

117
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,220
And it just so happens the speed, or velocity,

118
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,030
of the items changes.

119
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,715
Very high volume here for the baseball in the summer, as

120
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:20,090
opposed to the hockey puck, which

121
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,140
has higher volume in the winter.

122
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,960
So what are some rules of thumb when I segment?

123
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,880
Well, it's not a science necessarily.

124
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,040
There are rules of thumb.

125
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,590
Let me just list out four that kind of make sense.

126
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,790
The first is that in whatever segment

127
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,400
I create of my products, there has to be something similar.

128
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,680
So in the previous example, let's say

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
I'm going to go by speed.

130
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,250
All the things that go high volume in the summer-- I might

131
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,870
put beach chairs, towels, and lawn mowers--

132
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,300
treat them all the same because they have a higher

133
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,100
velocity in the summer as opposed to snow shovels, hockey

134
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,954
pucks, hockey sticks, things that sell more in the winter.

135
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,370
So I want to be able to treat them

136
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,770
the same within the segment, and between the segments

137
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,765
or across the segments, they want to be different.

138
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,140
I want to do something different.

139
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,430
So they have to be homogeneous within, heterogeneous between,

140
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,990
or across.

141
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,940
There has to be enough critical mass.

142
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,300
I don't want to have a segment of one SKU.

143
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,649
It has to be big enough to make it worthwhile to manage

144
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,440
separately because that's what we're doing.

145
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,450
We're finding a different way to manage each of these items.

146
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,580
And it has to be pragmatic.

147
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,520
I have to make it easy, useful, and something

148
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,070
I can communicate to people actually doing the work.

149
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,570
So there's a bunch of different ways

150
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,190
I can segment my customers or suppliers,

151
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,760
and you can think of a classic one is by order size or volume.

152
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,130
So if I have some small nano store kind of customers

153
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,020
and they order things at a case or a pallet at a time,

154
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,110
I might treat them differently than customers

155
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,990
that order a full truckload.

156
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,510
So I will manage those very differently.

157
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,040
And you can also think about lead time requirements.

158
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,090
Maybe I have demanding customers that have a very short lead

159
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,590
time and other customers that have a very long lead time.

160
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,030
For example, if I'm selling tires, I'm a tire manufacturer,

161
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,350
I might be servicing two types of customers,

162
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,810
original equipment manufacturers, OEMs,

163
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,280
that need a very fast lead time to get

164
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,310
these tires to the plants so they can put them

165
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,380
on automobiles and not shut the production line down.

166
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,790
But I'm also servicing distribution centers

167
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,040
for the aftermarket, and that's a much slower supply chain.

168
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,290
You don't need to be as quick.

169
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,064
So you will segment those customers

170
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:35,730
very differently because their lead time

171
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,690
requirements are very different.

172
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,180
And so we'll talk more about that later in the course,

173
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,080
but what we're going to focus on for the rest of this lesson

174
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,100
is segmenting products.

175
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,220
And there are three main dimensions

176
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,860
that we can segment on-- the physical characteristics,

177
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,460
the demand characteristics, and the supply characteristics.

178
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,340
By physical characteristics, I mean things

179
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,290
like the value, the cost it is to you, the size, the density,

180
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,020
all those types of things.

181
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,910
Demand characteristics, I'm going

182
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,340
to focus in on the sales volume.

183
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,160
That's the velocity, the speed, the volatility of those sales,

184
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,414
maybe the duration of the selling time.

185
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:15,330
And then I also want to think about the supply

186
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,000
characteristics, things like the availability,

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,970
the location, the reliability.

188
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,700
So these are the type of things that I

189
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,990
might want to think about when I segment.

190
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,130
What we'll do next is look at what

191
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,980
the distribution of these Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs,

192
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,200
typically looks like.
