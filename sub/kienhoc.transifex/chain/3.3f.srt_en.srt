1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,009
OK, now let's look at a second model,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,650
and I'm going to try and see if weight has an influence.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,640
So I'm going to say my model takes the form of beta 0

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,590
plus beta 1 times distance.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to keep that in, because it was so strong.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,750
Plus beta 2 times weight.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,214
And weight is in pounds.

8
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:20,130
So if I look at this, let's start from the top

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,261
and work down.

10
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:23,760
My r squared, I'm just going to go straight to my adjusted r

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,760
squared, because that's all that really matters.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,532
You see how the gap is a little bigger

13
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:28,740
from the r squared this time.

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,920
That's because I have an additional independent variable

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,670
added to the model.

16
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,900
So we see that we're still explaining 82% of the model.

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,030
It's still pretty good.

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,140
I get my standard error.

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,070
I can look at my sum of the squares.

20
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,160
Let's look at the individual coefficients.

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,880
So I can look and see for the intercept

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,810
it's a little higher than it was before 1,354.

23
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,990
And the distance 1.538 per mile.

24
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,280
And I get a weight as a negative, negative 0.003.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,850
So what does this mean?

26
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,680
This means for every pound I add to my weight,

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,780
the model is saying I take off-- well,

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,650
let's say every 10 pounds, I take off $0.03 per load.

29
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,110
So it's saying there's a negative relationship.

30
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,190
Let's look real quick at the p values.

31
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,590
So for both the intercept, that's a very strong p value.

32
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,510
And same thing with the distance.

33
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,230
Look at this one for the weight. b2, that's quite poor.

34
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,730
So it's only a 46% probability that I would

35
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,150
reject the null hypothesis.

36
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,260
So I would not reject the null hypothesis here

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,220
that b2 would be equal to 0.

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,324
So I would probably not accept this model because of that.

39
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:46,740
Another way to look at it look at,

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,560
look at the confidence intervals.

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,890
Notice that for the b2, the lower confidence interval

42
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,250
is negative and the upper confidence interval

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,240
is positive.

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,400
So that means 0 is within my bounds, my 95% confidence

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,660
intervals.

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,570
That's kind of crazy.

47
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,290
So I don't think this model is going to make much sense.

48
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,600
But let's talk about it a little more,

49
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,520
starting with the model interpretation.

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,380
82%, still really good.

51
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,820
It's a strong model.

52
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,200
It's predicting a lot.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,290
It's actually explaining a lot of the variability.

54
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,790
However, notice that while the r squared itself improved,

55
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,670
because in the previous model, remember for model one,

56
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,740
this was a 0.818.

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,870
But the adjusted r squared actually

58
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,430
went down from 0.816 to 0.815.

59
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,670
So this is why we have the adjusted r squared.

60
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,490
It corrects for just throwing in those additional independent

61
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,482
variables.

62
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:45,840


63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,210
So then we look at the individual coefficients,

64
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,890
the beta 0 and beta 1.

65
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,640
They're still looking solid.

66
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,470
Good p values.

67
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,440
They make sense in terms of magnitude and sine.

68
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
However, b2 doesn't make sense, right?

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,910
Why would more weight cost less?

70
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,060
Doesn't make sense.

71
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,230
Has a poor p value.

72
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,590
So I would probably not continue with this model.

73
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,580
But you explored.

74
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,490
You try to see, OK, does weight have an effect?

75
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,750
OK, so next we'll look at some other factors.
