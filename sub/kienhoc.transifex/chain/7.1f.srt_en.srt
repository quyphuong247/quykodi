1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,570
Now, let's develop a formal way for solving for the Single

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,340
Period Inventory Problem by using marginal analysis.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,580
So if you remember from our last video,

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,350
we looked at this profitability curve,

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,760
where, again, the horizontal axis is the Q,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,640
and the vertical axis is the profitability.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,890
And we said there were two regions.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,760
Regions here to the left is when I ordered too little,

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,220
and that means I might be short some products.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,810
And to the right is when I ordered too much,

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,690
and there's a higher probability I'll have excess.

12
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,660
And so what we want to do is figure out how can I find that

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,020
Q*.

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,380
So for Single Period Problems we have two costs.

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,110
We have this Excess Cost.

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,080
And this happens when the demand is less than what I wanted,

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,500
than Q. And so this means I have too much product.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,849
And so for this is going to be, when

19
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,300
I have too much laying around, I have Excess.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,200
Then I've also got the Shortage Cost, when the demand is

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,440
greater than Q for whatever I pick,

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,510
and that's having too little product,

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,730
and I'm not going to have enough there.

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,010
So what do I want to do?

25
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,810
Well, I've got a continuous distribution of demand.

26
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,360
So I'm going to be able to find what is the Expected Excess

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,830
Costs for the Qth unit.

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,965
This is the marginal cost, that next unit

29
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,090
that's going to be ordered.

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,350
Well, what is that going to be?

31
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,462
It's going to be equal to that cost of being excess.

32
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,670
And we already figured out what that's going to be --

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,850
it's the cost of having an extra one times the probability that

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,870
my demand is less than or equal to Q.

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,850
So that's the Expected Excess Cost for that Qth order.

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,120
And I can do the same thing for the shortage cost of the Qth

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,950
order.

38
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,730
That's Q_s times 1 minus that probability.

39
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,560
And so what I have here are the two costs, the marginal costs,

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,440
for having too little and having too much.

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,350
And, you know, if my Excess Cost is less than my Shortage Cost,

42
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,914
I'm just going to increase my Q. How much am I

43
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,420
going to increase my Q?

44
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,270
Well, I'm going to increase it until they're equal,

45
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,440
because, essentially, I'm going to climb the hill,

46
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,140
climb it up until the slope is 0.

47
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,030
Think back to calculus.

48
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,670
And so where the marginal costs are the same,

49
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,372
that's where my maximum is going to be.

50
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:31,580
So let's look at this in terms of the marginal costs.

51
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,871
So what I have here is a chart.

52
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:36,990
Again, the horizontal axis is the Q.

53
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,610
And this is the marginal cost per jersey:

54
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,560
that's the vertical axis.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,590
And so if I look at this blue line, which is the Excess Cost:

56
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,440
this is the marginal increase, or the marginal cost,

57
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,790
for being excess.

58
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,240
So if I only order 10, and, remember, my distribution here

59
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,585
was distributed normally with the demand of 32,

60
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:04,020
with the standard deviation of 11.

61
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,810
We're in units of thousands -- 32,000 units with the standard

62
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,140
deviation of 11,000.

63
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,740
If I ordered 10,000 units here, then the probability

64
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,370
that I'm going to have excess is pretty low.

65
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,180
That means there would have to be

66
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,750
9,999 units demanded or less, right?

67
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,780
So it'd be pretty low.

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,580
As I get up and order a higher amount,

69
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,200
if I order 60,000 units, the probability

70
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,250
of me getting excess, of having excess jerseys lying around,

71
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,470
gets pretty high, and so the marginal cost increases.

72
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,040
And you see how it changes and it's not linear.

73
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,470
And that's a reflection of the underlying normal distribution.

74
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,850
I can also plot in red these Shortage Costs.

75
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,380
And again, we can look, if I ordered only 10,000 jerseys,

76
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,460
when my expected amount is 32,000,

77
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,679
then I'm going to have a pretty high marginal cost,

78
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,220
because I expect it to be very short.

79
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,290
I'm going to be short a bunch if I expect on average 32,000

80
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,270
and I only order 10,000.

81
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,580
But at the other extreme, if I order 60,000,

82
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,790
then chances are I'm not going to be short anymore.

83
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,060
And so you see that these two marginal costs

84
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,550
work in opposite directions.

85
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,200
And when are they equal?

86
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,060
Well, that's our optimal Q, because when they're

87
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,899
equal to each other, then that means

88
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,920
I'm at the maximum of that profit curve.

89
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,220
And so that tells me my Q*.

90
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,460
So let's see this formally.

91
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,770
So we already developed this equation.

92
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,180
This is the marginal cost for excess.

93
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,157
And this is the marginal cost for being short.

94
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:40,990
We're going to set them equal to each other.

95
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,740
And I'm just going to let you look at the algebra.

96
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,720
We're going to clean it up a little bit

97
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,390
and turn into this relationship, where

98
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,060
the probability of the demand being less or equal to Q,

99
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,900
my order quantity, is going to be

100
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,220
equal to this relationship of c_s the shortage cost,

101
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,470
over the sum of the excess cost and the shortage cost.

102
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,630
Hopefully, this looks really familiar to you.

103
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,640
It's the same critical ratio we saw in the EOQ problem

104
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,390
with Planned Backorders.

105
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,250
It's just a ratio of shortage over the total of the Excess

106
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,217
and Shortage Cost.

107
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:15,550
So let's see if we can talk about that just a little bit

108
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,510
more.

109
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,110
Think of it like a seesaw.

110
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,800
And on the one end, I've got my cost of being excess.

111
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,050
And at my other end, sitting at the other end of the seesaw

112
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,510
is the cost of being short.

113
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,500
And so the question is where do I

114
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,310
put the fulcrum to make it balanced?

115
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,650
We can think of this distance from the fulcrum

116
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,970
to c_e as being equal to the Critical Ratio, which

117
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:53,030
is c_s / (c_e + c_s), just this term, right?

118
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:59,660
So if one case, what if c_e = c_s, where will the fulcrum be?

119
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,480
Right in the middle, right in the middle,

120
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,090
as you have half and half.

121
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,690
But what happens if say, c_s is equal to twice as much as c_e,

122
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,800
so much Shortage Cost is twice as much

123
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,590
as if I have Excess Cost.

124
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,540
Well, what's our critical ratio going to be?

125
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,730
I can just plug this in.

126
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,580
So it's 2c_e / 3 c_e, it's going to mean

127
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,160
that the critical ratio is 2/3.

128
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,540
So what's going to happen to that fulcrum?

129
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,930
It's going to move 2/3 of the way there, so my fulcrum here.

130
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,970
Because what happened?

131
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,710
This got twice as heavy, this became the big guy,

132
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,450
sitting in there's a little guy half the size over here.

133
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:47,780
So as my c_s gets bigger, my cost of being short,

134
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,680
my Critical Ratio gets bigger, and it moves closer to that.

135
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,320
So just like a seesaw, you could look at the other way

136
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,090
if c_e get got really big in proportion to c_s,

137
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,200
then the fulcrum would move the other way.

138
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,920
So you can think of it as just a balance.

139
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,780
Where's the balance between the two?

140
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,040
Now, if I look at the left side of this equation,

141
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,340
the probability x is less than or equal to Q,

142
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,230
you should be able to remember what that is,

143
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,220
thinking back to our beloved normal curve.

144
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,160
That's my best estimation of a normal curve.

145
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,620
And I've got some mean demand here.

146
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,370
Then what I'm saying is this probability

147
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,790
that x is less than or equal to Q

148
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,970
is simply this area under the curve, where this is Q.

149
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,790
And so this is that.

150
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,140
So what happens as the Critical Ratio --

151
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,820
right here I said this is the example,

152
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,170
where the Cost of Shortage is equal to twice the Cost

153
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:45,920
of Excess.

154
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,550
So the Critical Ratio is 2/3.

155
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,240
As this Critical Ratio gets bigger, what happens?

156
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,030
This Q is going to have to get bigger,

157
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,120
because I have to cover -- let's see -- this amount.

158
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,000
I would have to make that amount of the probability out there

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,650
is equal to 2/3.

160
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,090
So the lesson here is as the Critical Ratio

161
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,440
gets bigger, which means the Cost of Shortage is increasing,

162
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,460
then I've got to cover more of my demand distribution.

163
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,450
That's all that means.

164
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,050
We're looking at normal curve now,

165
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,300
but we'll look at other distributions later.

166
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,690
All it means is a need to cover that percentage

167
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,060
or that probability of that demand happening to be optimal.

168
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,174
So now let's apply this analysis the NFL jersey problem.

169
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:31,674
