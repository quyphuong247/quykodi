1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,067
So let's do an example.

2
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:03,650
Make sure you understand the concepts,

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,210
go through some mechanics.

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,360
So here's a random part, part number VMI1984.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,730
And we want to develop monthly forecasts, in pallets,

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,079
for this item, VMI1984.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,710
And it seems that the item has an upward trend.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,180
So there's a trend here and the level.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,320
And looking at past year's data, you've

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,260
determined that you're going to use an alpha 0.25, a beta 0.1.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,360
And your estimate level, a hat 0,

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,350
in January, which is time 0, right?--

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,970
Is 28 pallets per month.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,420
So that's your most recent estimate of what the level is.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,710
And your most recent estimate of the trend is 1.35.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,330
So you're assuming an upward trend

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,550
of 1.35 additional pallets each month.

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,910
So what do we want to do?

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,980
Well using exponential smoothing, Holt's method,

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,450
which means we're going to look at a level and a trend,

21
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,930
we want to estimate the forecast for February.

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,040
And so this is easy.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,900
You're just going to plug and chug here.

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,360
Because my x hat j comma f, which

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,960
is the forecast in January, at the end of January,

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,040
for February, is going to equal to my estimated level

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,480
in January plus 1, one month, times the estimated

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,820
slope of the trend, which is the b hat in January.

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,880
So I give you all this.

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,380
Right?

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,300
My estimated alpha is 28, gave that to you up here.

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,330
I'm going one month in the future,

33
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,090
and I'm going to do my estimated trend

34
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,970
in January, which is 1.35.

35
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,875
So I'm just adding them together, and I get 29.35.

36
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:45,600
All right.

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,610
I'm going to clean this up.

38
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,700
Now what we want to do is say, OK, it's the end of February.

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,230
And demand came in, it was 27 pallets.

40
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,710
So now, what's your forecast going to be for March?

41
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,370
Now we could do this by hand again,

42
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,911
but we're going to use a spreadsheet.

43
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:04,810
Now I know in real life, when you go work for a company,

44
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,880
you're probably not going to be doing your actual forecasting

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,300
using a spreadsheet.

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,680
But we're going to use them in this class,

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,250
because it helps you understand the mechanics and the concepts

48
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,380
a lot better.

49
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,330
And it's easier than doing everything by hand,

50
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,820
by pencil and paper.

51
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,760
And it helps you see some other aspects of it as well.

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,775
So here's a spreadsheet.

53
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:28,340
And again, this is in the resources link for this video.

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,730
And this is the spreadsheet.

55
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,170
And you see I've got columns A, B, C, all the way to H,

56
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,330
and rows 1 through 6.

57
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,830
My alpha value of 0.25 is in cell B1.

58
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,230
My beta value of 0.1 is in cell B2.

59
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,720
So what do I have here?

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,730
Well each of the columns is a different value.

61
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,740
So the column B is the t's, the time period, 0 and 1.

62
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,910
It does list two here, we'll show more in a second.

63
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,770
x(t) is the actual demand in time period t.

64
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,450
So this is the 27 units that appeared-- 27 pallets, rather--

65
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,610
that showed up in February.

66
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,290
Column D is the estimate of the level at that time, t.

67
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,840
You see the 28 and the 1.35 from what I gave you in the problem.

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,600
And then the x hat, t comma t plus 1,

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
is the next period forecast.

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,850
And we just figured that out, 29.35.

71
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,290
But we wanted to figure out was this term in F6.

72
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,880
So how do I figure that out?

73
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,800
Well first, this 29.35, like I said,

74
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,300
it just came from adding the estimated level, which

75
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,200
is in cell D5, plus the estimated

76
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,070
trend of one period in E5.

77
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,940
That should be pretty obvious.

78
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,040
But to find the forecast in March,

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,550
I want to add together the estimated level in February

80
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,895
plus the estimated trend in February.

81
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:54,250
How am I going to do that?

82
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,490
Well I'm going to update.

83
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,000
My updating equation for the a term

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,120
is going to be alpha, which is in cell B1.

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,620
Right?

86
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,850
It is 0.25 times my most recent observation,

87
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,820
which is in cell C6, which is this 27,

88
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,720
plus 1 minus alpha times F5.

89
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,730
What's in F5?

90
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,980
My most recent forecast, this 29.35.

91
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,810
So that's what the 28.76 is.

92
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,100
It's the linear combination of those two numbers,

93
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,920
the new information and the old information.

94
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,830
My update for my trend is the same type of thing.

95
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,840
I'm going to take my beta, which is in cell B2.

96
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,530
So it's beta times my most recent trend estimate,

97
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,850
in D6-- that's that 28.76-- minus my most

98
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,100
recent before that estimate of the level,

99
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,280
which was up here in cell D5.

100
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,070
So 28.76 minus 28 is 0.76.

101
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,430
That's my new estimate of the trend.

102
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,430
So it's lower than what I had estimated in January, which

103
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,360
I had estimated before to 1.35, which

104
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,700
is shown right here in cell E5.

105
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,770
So I'm going to take that new estimate, the D6 minus D5,

106
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,520
and multiply that by my beta, and add

107
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,310
1 minus beta times that value in E5,

108
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,340
which is my most recent estimate of the trend.

109
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,620
So it goes straight forward.

110
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,590
And so my forecast for March, sitting in February,

111
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,130
is what's here in cell F6, 30.05.

112
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,010
So again, it's very mechanical.

113
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,300
You take the new information, multiply it

114
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,230
by the alpha or the beta, add in the old information,

115
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,200
multiply it by 1 minus the alpha or the 1 minus the beta,

116
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,135
add the estimate for the level in the trend,

117
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:40,080
and that's your forecast.

118
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,110
Now what about my error term?

119
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,780
Well that's over here in cell G6.

120
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,800
So what is this saying?

121
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,640
This is saying in February my error term

122
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,290
is going to be equal to what I actually

123
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,230
had demanded in February, which is 27, in cell C6, minus

124
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,460
what I estimated to happen sitting in January,

125
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,590
which is this 29.35, sitting up here in cell F5.

126
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:13,870
So 27 minus 29.35 means my error is 2.35, or negative 2.35.

127
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,650
Column H, I just square it.

128
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,150
Right?

129
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,160
Square error, because that's one of the metrics

130
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,610
that we're going to look at.

131
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,370
So this is pretty straightforward.

132
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,350
But now let's suppose I want to go a step further.

133
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,650
And for the same item, for the same demand,

134
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,820
I want to build a spreadsheet for the next month

135
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,930
estimates for the next eight months.

136
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,240
So everything's the same here.

137
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,990
I've got my alpha term, my beta term.

138
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,840
I've still got my t period 0, 1 through all the way to 9.

139
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,510
I've got column C tells me my actual demand,

140
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,530
and then column D gives you my current estimate of my level.

141
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,650
And column E gives you my current estimate of my trend.

142
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,540
And now obviously if I'm sitting in March,

143
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,220
and I'm making estimates here, I don't know all of this stuff.

144
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,610
Because that hasn't happened yet.

145
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,430
But what I'm showing here in this spreadsheet

146
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,610
is at the end of these nine months.

147
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,250
So here, in column C, is the actual demand.

148
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,700
And then these values in column F

149
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,900
are my next month's forecasts.

150
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,410
So sitting in, let's say, June, right?

151
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,990
My forecast for July is going to be 35.29.

152
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,000
That's the x hat t, June, for t plus 1, July.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,650
So that's my estimate for 35.29.

154
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,590
All right.

155
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,920
Now one of the things that we're going to do

156
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,610
is look at the quality of the forecast.

157
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,110
Because remember, we don't want to do just a point forecast.

158
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,320
We always want to track what my error is,

159
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,060
to give some kind of sense of the range

160
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,650
or the variability of my forecast.

161
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,740
We'll be using this lot when we talk about inventory.

162
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,180
So if I look at the mean square error-- remember that's

163
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,850
just the sum of the error terms divided by n--

164
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,790
I want to pick one.

165
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,770
But which one do I pick?

166
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,350
So how far back do I do?

167
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,590
Do I go back to most recent one?

168
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,840
It's not clear how I'm going to find this mean square error

169
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,480
for all of my terms, because it might

170
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,690
change every time I get a new month.

171
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,480
So what you might want to do is use, believe it or not,

172
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,920
a smoothing method to find out a nice calm level

173
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,430
of what a mean square error is.

174
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,010
And so you can use this in your other forecasting,

175
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,350
or in your other inventory planning models.

176
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,279
So let me show you what this means.

177
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,820
We're going to keep a current running

178
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,539
update of the mean square error.

179
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,110
And that's what's shown in column I,

180
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,947
and I'll explain that in a second.

181
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:40,530
And we're using exponential smoothing,

182
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,650
because it's our friend.

183
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,260
OK.

184
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,250
We're going to select an omega-- and that's my smoothing term.

185
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,246
And omega is between 0 and 1.

186
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:50,620
Again, we're just going to do a linear combination of two

187
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,490
values.

188
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,220
And you guessed it, my mean square error in time, t,

189
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,680
is going to be equal to omega times my most

190
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,490
recent estimate of the error, which

191
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:08,110
is my most recent forecast, xt, minus x hat t minus 1t, which

192
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,370
is my most recent forecast.

193
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,540
This is also known as the most recent error term.

194
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,900
And I'm squaring that.

195
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,450
So it's omega times the most recent error term squared--

196
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,730
that's the new information-- plus 1

197
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,540
minus omega times my most recent forecast, or estimate,

198
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,340
of the mean square error.

199
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,540
So let me show you what this looks like for the October

200
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,630
estimates for the mean square error.

201
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,960
And what this is saying here is this 4.52

202
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,050
is simply the linear combination between this H1-- cell

203
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,720
H1 is my omega value, and I picked the 0.05--

204
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,830
and that's going to be multiplied by the value in C14,

205
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,250
which is my most recent value that showed up,

206
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,620
my most recent demand observation,

207
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,230
minus what's in F13, which is right here,

208
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,610
which is my most recent forecast of that.

209
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,800
So I forecasted 37.10, 36 showed up.

210
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,660
So that's going to be what?

211
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,840
1.1 squared multiplied by that omega term,

212
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,010
again that 0.05, add to that 1 minus omega, times what?--

213
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,090
This term, my most recent estimate

214
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,150
of the mean square error.

215
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,740
So in this case, what we're doing here, is again,

216
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,090
we're using smoothing.

217
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,330
And we're putting a very low value on it, on the omega.

218
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,180
Why?

219
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,380
Because we want a calm forecast here.

220
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,760
We want a calm estimate of the mean square error.

221
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,880
We'll be using this mean square error of the forecast a lot

222
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,005
in a couple lectures, in a couple lessons.

223
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,380
But I just wanted to show you how

224
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,552
you can use exponential smoothing

225
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:44,760
in many different situations.

226
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,910
And we'll use it again in the next video as well.

227
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,050
But this tells you some of the mechanics

228
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,590
of how to do forecast within a spreadsheet.

229
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,950
And whether you have a more sophisticated package,

230
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,510
at the heart of it, it's doing the same calculations.
