1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,170
So let's talk about segmentation within supply chains.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,680
The most common way that segmentation

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,600
is done for products, is using something called an ABC

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,280
Analysis, and it does not stand for Activity Based Costing.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,590
That's a whole another technique.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,150
But ABC simply are the categories that you create.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,965
You created an A category, a B category, and a C category,

8
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:23,230
and it's called ABC Analysis.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,560
So when you segment, you want to find the class A items.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,250
These are the important few.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,662
And these are the very few high impact items.

12
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:33,120
These are the ones you want to spend most of your attention

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,820
on, because they matter the most.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,570
And you expect exceptions to be made on these products.

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,900
So you might not have a standard process.

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,400
You want to treat these differently.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,794
These are high touch.

18
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:46,960
Then you've got the B items.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,335
These are the ones in the middle.

20
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:50,630
We'll spend a lot of time on B items

21
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,530
when we talk about inventory.

22
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,150
These have moderate impact.

23
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,050
And the reason why we spend time on them

24
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,080
is because we'll talk about different ways we

25
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,410
can automate the control.

26
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,200
Because we'll set up different policies that you can use.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,090
Now the rules can also be used for A,

28
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,780
so you develop these policies for B

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,280
and then you tweak them a little bit, for a for example.

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,319
But the important thing is that A items

31
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,610
are treated a little different.

32
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,940
They're the critical ones.

33
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,350
You want to automate for those B items.

34
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,352
And the C items, the trivial many.

35
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:22,060
There's a bunch of things you want to do.

36
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,250
You might want to reduce the amount of time

37
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,260
that you spend on them.

38
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,210
You might want to actually try to remove

39
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,834
some of those C items, that long tail.

40
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,250
But you want to make sure that you

41
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,952
don't spend too much time on them.

42
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,910
And you make the control systems and everything

43
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,900
as simple as possible.

44
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,010
And so there's a lot of grouping and categorizing,

45
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,150
and we'll talk more about this when we get into inventory.

46
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,290
So the important thing, we talk about ABC, and it's widespread.

47
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,730
When you go and talk some about ABC Analysis,

48
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,540
everyone knows what you're talking about.

49
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,600
But there's two things I want to bring up.

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,750
One is the categories are arbitrary.

51
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,610
What you call an A item, could maybe could be partially

52
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,270
a B or B plus.

53
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,160
So there's a lot of arbitrariness to this.

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,600
So we're coming up with general rules.

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,130
The second thing is, items don't stop at the C level.

56
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,400
You might have class D, E, F, double F, triple F.

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,920
When you think about the spare parts industry,

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,320
they might have items that move one spare part sells

59
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,620
every fifth year or even longer.

60
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,640
Because they might have tractors in the field

61
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,680
that have been in the field for 50 years.

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,450
And so we usually talk about ABC,

63
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,625
but some industries have much longer tails.

64
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,250
And they manage those very differently.

65
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,300
Especially, like I said, the spare parts industry.

66
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,340
So how do we do this?

67
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,610
It's a very simple process.

68
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,550
I have all my parts.

69
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,260
And this is a simple example with a number of SKUs.

70
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,210
And here are the Part IDs in the first column.

71
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,530
The second column I have the individual price or c_i.

72
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,080
That's the cost to me of each of the items.

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
And you can see it ranges from what, about $25 a part,

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,460
down to about a quarter.

75
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,490
The annual demand-- that's D_i --

76
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,740
the annual demand for each product and you can see how

77
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,980
that varies.

78
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,800
And what I created for this fourth column,

79
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,550
I just multiplied the Price times the Annual Demand,

80
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,440
because that gives me Annual Value.

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,300
Typically, for ABC Analysis, the thing that drives it

82
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,930
is the value.

83
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,200
The annual value that that product

84
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,470
brings, whether it's the total cost or the total revenue.

85
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,310
In any case, it's two functions.

86
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,150
One is the cost of each item and the demand.

87
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,210
So the product, c times D drives how I'm going to value these.

88
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,530
Think back to the baseball and the hockey puck.

89
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,070
Right?

90
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,820
What we were focused on the c were relatively the same.

91
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,020
Couple bucks each for a puck versus a baseball.

92
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,350
But the Ds, the Ds changed.

93
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,330
That's the demand.

94
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,500
And so you can think of instead of annual demand,

95
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,170
maybe monthly demand -- you might change that.

96
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,110
But any case, at the end of the day,

97
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,070
I've got this annual value for each of my items.

98
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,780
So what I've done is I've found it for each item,

99
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,240
and now I'm going to sort this.

100
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,780
And I'm going to categorize it.

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,010
So this is, you see 20 SKUs, a little over 4,000 units,

102
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,940
in total of $22,000 in price.

103
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,011
So I just blow this out.

104
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:18,510
Right?

105
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,630
And I've sorted, on this column, the Annual Value.

106
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,520
So now I have part 55K2 is the highest Annual Value.

107
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,130
And I do a new column.

108
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,530
This is cumulative, so it just sums up

109
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,400
to the cumulative value of all the products.

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,320
And then I just take a percent of it.

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:45,140
So 8,347 divided by total value, 21,984, means 38%.

112
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,900
And then here, 13,544 divided by 21,984 gives me 62%.

113
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,010
So I found percent Annual Value.

114
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,200
So what do I do with this?

115
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,370
Well, I'm ready to categorize.

116
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,430
So I pick the top 20% of the SKUs, roughly 80% of the value.

117
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,380
I'm going to pick the next that that give me about 15%

118
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,570
of the value, and then the C items that give me the rest.

119
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,150
So you see why it's a little bit arbitrary, but what's common,

120
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,360
firms really look for this 80-20.

121
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,340
They sometimes they call it the 80-20 Rule.

122
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,010
It isn't always there, but for this case,

123
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,610
it's just an example.

124
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,910
So I break it up.

125
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,090
And so then if I put it in again, the same chart that I

126
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,340
used for the grocery store example, the percent

127
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,686
of the SKUs and the percent of the Annual Value,

128
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:31,810
I just have the same thing.

129
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,230
I have the critical few.

130
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,750
The important few.

131
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,610
The A items here.

132
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,950
I've got the C items for all the ones over here,

133
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,260
and I'm going to treat them differently.

134
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,860
And then the B items in the middle.

135
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,110
Right?

136
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,890
So this is a good way to start for segmentation.

137
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,870
Every company does some form of this,

138
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,480
but they don't always stop there.

139
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,820
For example, I might want to look

140
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,700
at the variability of demand.

141
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,530
And that's where I got here on the vertical axis here.

142
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,600
Demand variability.

143
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,070
Why would that matter?

144
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,800
Because I'm going to do my A, B and C Analysis, right?

145
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,670
Just like we did on the previous slide.

146
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,040
But variability of demand might matter.

147
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,160
For example, let's say I sell 250 items

148
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,690
in the course of a year.

149
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,770
It would probably matter if I sold all 250

150
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,030
in one day or versus I sold one item every day

151
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,160
over the 250 workdays.

152
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,590
So having steady state, one every day, versus all the

153
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,900
demand on one day.

154
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,920
That's very different.

155
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,450
So they'd have very different demand variability,

156
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,320
and maybe I want to treat those high variability

157
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,480
items differently than my steady state low variability.

158
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,590
And so here's just one approach that different companies

159
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,290
use: first thing they do the segmentation by ABC.

160
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,560
But then they also look at the variability,

161
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,800
and they create a cut off.

162
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,150
And usually it's coefficient of variation,

163
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,430
which is the standard deviation of the demand over the mean,

164
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,434
or the average.

165
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,100
And you have some cut off there, and you

166
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,820
identify whether it's a high variability

167
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,870
or a low variability item.

168
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,910
And then you can think of three big categories,

169
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,550
how you would manage them.

170
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,590
For these ones in the top right, these are the volatile.

171
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,720
I'm going to use very sophisticated techniques,

172
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,960
frequently review them, and spend a lot of time on them.

173
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,980
Now the ones down here in the lower right,

174
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,040
these stable products.

175
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,770
I can automate some of those practices, less frequent

176
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,490
reviews, and maybe use some manage by exception.

177
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,869
So these would be the high, critical high value ones,

178
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,410
that I really spend a lot of time on.

179
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,760
These one's, a little less.

180
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,430
And then these ones, the C items,

181
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,840
whether they're low or high variability,

182
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,170
I'm going to be as simple as possible.

183
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,460
Very infrequent.

184
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,310
But what we've done here is introduce

185
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,750
other ways of categorizing.

186
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,570
Because as I said, segmentation is

187
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,900
more of an art than a science.

188
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,990
There's not pure rules for it.

189
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,090
It's kind of arbitrary at some point.

190
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,829
But the key point is to break the products in segments

191
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,120
that you can treat differently.

192
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,900
You're going to take a different action.

193
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,490
I'm going to manage these red products differently

194
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,380
than from these tan products differently

195
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,930
from these green products.

196
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,340
If I treated them all the same, then why bother segmenting.

197
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,450
So you always segment for a purpose.
