https://youtu.be/MMUl7rl5PzE

1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,180
So we introduced the six different types of new product

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,900
categories and now we have to ask the question, so what?

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,144
Why does it matter?

4
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:09,560
Well, it matters because we want to treat them differently

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,374
and they have different characteristics.

6
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:13,040
Here are the different types of products

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,850
that we introduced, the new to world, new to company, the line

8
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,410
extensions and product improvements.

9
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,826
And remember, the difference there

10
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:21,990
is line extensions complement the existing products.

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,270
Product improvements replace those existing products.

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,420
And then the last two, product repositioning

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,490
and cost reductions.

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,240
In the marketplace, the percent of introductions

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,280
range and they vary differently.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,360
This came from multiple sources, so that's

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,210
why there's a range of these values.

18
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,830
But generally, we're looking at 20% to 30% on new to company,

19
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,910
new to world, those highly innovative products

20
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,284
that have never been there before

21
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:47,130
or are new to the company.

22
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,420
About half or a little over half, almost to two thirds,

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,100
are extensions of existing products or improvements

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,610
of existing products.

25
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,300
And then you have the remaining 15% to almost 20%

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,320
that are product repositioning or cost reductions.

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,065
So you can see that the lion's share falls within extensions

28
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:09,509
and improvements of existing products.

29
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:12,050
Now, we have different accuracy of the forecasting for these,

30
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,780
as you would expect.

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,854
As you would probably expect, the hardest to forecast

32
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:19,520
are the new to world and new to company.

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,850
What I have here is the forecast accuracy, which is just 1

34
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,310
minus the MAPE, the Mean Absolute Percent Error.

35
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,150
You can see the worst are these new to world or new to company

36
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,120
because you don't have much history.

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,380
And you can see the best are the cost reductions,

38
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,030
and that makes sense because we'd think that we already

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,060
have the product, we know how it behaves at one price.

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,700
We should have at least a little bit

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,200
of insight into how it will behave if I change that price.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,890
And you can see how they fall accordingly.

43
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,290
As I move from more innovative up here, new to world,

44
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,750
new to market, down to the more established

45
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,600
or existing products, my forecast accuracy improves,

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,564
and that makes sense.

47
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,980
We can also look at the length of time it takes to launch,

48
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,340
and we'll talk more about the new product launch

49
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,230
process in a second.

50
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,710
The new to world and new to company take the most time.

51
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,530
As you can see, it gets less and less time

52
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,520
involved as I move down.

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,060
And then success rate.

54
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,810
This might be surprising to some people

55
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,170
because usually you hear only one in 20 products

56
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,580
are successful.

57
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,820
Actually, the success rate is much higher than people think.

58
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,660
It depends how it's measured, and success

59
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,590
is measured in the eye of the beholder.

60
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,350
This is based off of some studies that

61
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,030
have looked at how companies deem success,

62
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,260
and the criteria is generally being in the market still

63
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,450
generating positive revenue after two years.

64
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,450
So it's still out there.

65
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,935
It wasn't pulled out after six months or a year.

66
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:45,310
And you can see the new to world,

67
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,690
new to company products, roughly 40% to 60% success rate.

68
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,320
And as you would expect, as I move down

69
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,430
to these repositioning and cost reductions,

70
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,830
it gets a little bit higher.

71
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,700
But overall, they're fairly successful.

72
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,410
So the idea that only one out of every 20 products

73
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,470
are successful is not really true.

74
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,430
The studies don't bear that out.

75
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,235
We see that they differ in terms of how accurate I can forecast

76
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:15,880
them and all those other things, but still, why do I care?

77
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,960
Well, let's put this into a different framework.

78
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,820
This framework comes from Ken Kahn in his book,

79
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,560
and he says when we look at new products,

80
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,890
we want to look at the product-market mix

81
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,935
because a new product, the technology

82
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:32,140
is either new or current, or the market is either a new market

83
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,810
or established in the existing or current market.

84
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,990
So you can overlay the different product types here,

85
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,710
and you can think of the new to company and new to world

86
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,420
as both a new technology and new market.

87
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,770
You can think of line extensions as being a new technology.

88
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,190
I'm adding a flavor or adding something to it,

89
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,405
but I'm staying in the same market,

90
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:57,310
so I'm staying in the current market.

91
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,880
Product repositionings.

92
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,810
I'm staying with the current technology.

93
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,880
Think of Bayer Aspirin.

94
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,710
It didn't change, but I go to a new market, the stroke

95
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,200
prevention and heart care.

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,020
And then the least innovative, or the least new,

97
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,024
is cost reductions and product improvements

98
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:16,940
where I'm staying with the current technology,

99
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,540
modifying it slightly, and I'm staying in my current market.

100
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,770
I'm not going after a new market.

101
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,250
So you have how the different products overlay,

102
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,380
but they're introduced for different reasons.

103
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,060
The strategies differ.

104
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,450
So if I introduce something to a new market and new technology,

105
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,810
what am I doing?

106
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,647
I'm trying to get into a whole new unrelated business.

107
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,230
I'm expanding.

108
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,790
I'm diversifying.

109
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,230
This is what Apple did when it introduced or jumped

110
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,820
into the phone space and jumped into the portable music space.

111
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,640
It's diversifying its market.

112
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,325
It's trying to get into new industries.

113
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:54,450


114
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,740
Up here when I introduce a line extension,

115
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,320
I'm trying to diversify my portfolio.

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,930
I'm staying in my current market,

117
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,020
but I'm trying to get more people

118
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,510
to use my products within that same market.

119
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,820
This is where flavors get added and things like that.

120
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,541
I'm adding another flavor that someone might be interested in.

121
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,640
In the market development, what I'm

122
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,300
really focused on is expanding my sales volume.

123
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,680
I'm repositioning into new markets.

124
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,014
And finally, in this top left quadrant is market penetration.

125
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:29,180
What am I really doing here?

126
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,620
I'm increasing market share.

127
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,240
I'm reducing my price to increase

128
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,700
market share for my current market

129
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,570
with my current technology.

130
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,260
Each of these strategies differ based

131
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,850
on the mix of product in market and they

132
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,650
need a different type of forecasting.

133
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,780
Starting up here in the top left where

134
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,910
I have existing technology in an existing market,

135
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,870
you can think that my forecasting approach

136
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,810
would be the most quantitative.

137
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,880
I'd look at similar situations using time series analysis,

138
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,451
regression, other models because I have a lot of history

139
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,700
because I've been operating in this market for a while

140
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,010
so I kind of know how they behave,

141
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,380
and I've been offering with this technology,

142
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,100
so I have some history there.

143
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,430
When I get into line extensions, the approach

144
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,750
here is to look for similar things.

145
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,660
I introduced a blueberry flavor.

146
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,500
Maybe I want to see how the cranberry

147
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,730
flavor did previously.

148
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,690
I've got some previous experience of looks

149
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,250
like analysis or analogous forecasting.

150
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,125
I can look at similar things and maybe make an extension

151
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,940
and extrapolate how that behaved to how this new product will

152
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,750
behave.

153
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,070
When I get down here to market development,

154
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm really looking at, how do I understand this new market?

155
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,870
My forecasting will focus on larger trends,

156
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,780
how those customers and how that market behaves,

157
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,414
to understand that specific new market

158
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,330
environment because that's the big difference.

159
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,840
I'm going to a new marketplace so I need to understand that.

160
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,720
And then finally, for diversification,

161
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,620
when I'm talking new to company or new to world products,

162
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,770
the forecasting approach is very ephemeral.

163
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,000
It's more scenario planning and understanding

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,480
driving factors and uncertainties.

165
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,880
So you can think as I move from this top left down

166
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,680
to this top right, I move from more objective metrics,

167
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,520
hardcore analytics, to much more subjective ones down here.

168
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,900
Now, I'm not saying that down here when

169
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,750
I introduce new products to the world,

170
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,634
that I don't have some rigorous analytics,

171
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,050
but you don't have as much history

172
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,230
so you're doing some more subjective kind of work, as

173
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,787
opposed to up here for market penetration,

174
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:43,370
where I have some history to work with

175
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,840
and I'm going to mind that.

176
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,092
One last question to finish up this video

177
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:50,800
is to ask the question, why do firms even

178
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,787
launch new products in the first place?

179
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:53,995
This is a very easy question.

180
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:56,070
It's because that's where all the money is.

181
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,500
Companies earn between 20% and 48% of their revenue

182
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,430
from new products launched within the last two years.

183
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,150
Profit anywhere from 20% to 50%, depending on the industry.

184
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,180
If you look at different industries,

185
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,760
for fast moving consumer goods, things

186
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,410
that go through grocery stores, their revenue and their profit

187
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,040
is roughly around 24% driven by products

188
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,770
introduced in the last two years.

189
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,600
You can see that this is pretty significant for many.

190
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,880
If you look at technology, it's almost half of revenue

191
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,600
and 44% of profit driven by products

192
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,390
introduced in the last two years.

193
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,909
These numbers are only going up.

194
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,030
These numbers are about eight to 10 years old,

195
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,340
so you can imagine that it's increasing

196
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,230
because as we observed, product life cycle is shortening.

197
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,190
People are introducing new products,

198
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,580
and it's not because the products

199
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,860
are breaking or falling apart.

200
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,780
It's because these products are unable to maintain

201
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,270
their pricing, so you see dramatic price drops.

202
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,490
If you look at chips going into phones,

203
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,010
you see the dramatic price drop there over a very short period

204
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,980
of time.

205
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,500
Most products will continue to drop,

206
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,450
and therefore when that price drops,

207
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,490
a new product needs to get introduced.

208
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,900
This is why firms launch new products.

209
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,390
The next thing we'll talk about is how do firms

210
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,080
go about introducing new products.
