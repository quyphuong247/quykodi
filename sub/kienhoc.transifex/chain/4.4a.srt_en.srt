Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,150
Welcome to inventory management and deterministic demand

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,520
recitation session.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,210
Let's try to do a quick recap on what we have learned so far.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,140
So we began our topic on inventory

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,059
with a general introduction into inventory management.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,140
We tried to understand some of the assumptions

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,280
that we make in coming up with an inventory policy.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,480
And what is an inventory policy?

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,710
What it is, is how much to order and when.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,270
And then we realized that this could be complex.

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,850
In lesson two, EOQ was introduced.

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,960
And I hope by now we understand what EOQ does.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,370
And what it does is tries to balance between the variable

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,130
and the fixed cost.

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,340
And it's a good starting point to begin.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,470
In lesson three, we dig a little bit deeper.

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,350
We lose some of the initial assumptions that we made.

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,240
We introduced the notion of nonzero need times

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,230
and introduced discount-- three different type

21
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,520
of discount settings.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,930
And then, finally, we went into finite replenishment systems.

23
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,540
What we will do now in this recitation session

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,340
is try to reinforce some of these concepts

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,860
that we have learned so far.

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,480
And we will do this by going over some problem solutions

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,800
step by step.

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,630
And hopefully you'll find this very helpful.

29
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,430
So let's get into our first problem.

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,980


31
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,520
So let's look into the problem.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,380
You have been hired by the MIT Coop

33
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,220
to help them improve their supply chain operations.

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,930
The Coop manager has asked you to look

35
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,180
into managing one of their wildly popular pamphlets

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,060
on student life.

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,120
The demand for this pamphlet is exceptionally stable.

38
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,970
What it means is virtually no variability.

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,450
Annually, the Coop sells about 5,000 of these pamphlets.

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,560
And it sells them for $10 per copy.

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,950
The Coop orders these pamphlets in batches

42
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,810
of 500 units at a time.

43
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,150
And it costs the Coop $100 to place a single order.

44
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,310
You also find that the Coop is paying the publisher

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,370
$2 per copy and the inventory holding

46
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,380
cost is $0.28 per dollar inventory per year.
