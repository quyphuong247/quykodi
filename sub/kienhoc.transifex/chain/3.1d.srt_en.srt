1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,625
So now let's include seasonality in a model

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:05,530
that includes both level and trend.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,720
So this is sometimes called the Holt-Winter method

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,409
or Holt-Winter model.

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,450
And what we're going to have is an additive trend

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,550
in a multiplicative seasonality.

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,290
So I assume that I have some kind of standard level, this a,

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,520
plus some generally persistent trend, b,

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,800
and then there's some seasonality.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,860
And my underlying model is simply

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,020
going to be that the demanded time period, t, is

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,020
equal to the level plus the trend times

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,870
t, the number of trends that I've had so far,

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,990
and that sum is going to be multiplied

15
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,150
by F sub t, the seasonality index for that period.

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,190
And I'm adding in my error term.

17
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,700
And that, again, is identical and independently distributed

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,290
with a mean of 0 and some variance.

19
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,680
The forecasting model will follow this.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,670
So x hat for time period t, forecasting for time

21
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,860
period, t plus tau-- so I'm going tau units

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,410
into the future-- is going to be equal to the estimated

23
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,426
level I had at time t plus the number of units

24
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:06,050
I'm going forward in the future, number

25
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,620
of time periods, tau, times the estimate b

26
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,400
hat t, which is the estimate of the level at time t.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I'm going to multiply that sum times the seasonality

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,620
of the most recent similar period.

29
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,010
That's f hat t plus tau minus p.

30
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,930
So I have three patterns-- level, trend, and seasonality--

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,370
so I have three updating equations.

32
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,750
The first one should look very familiar.

33
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,560
It's the same one that we had for the double exponential

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,870
smoothing model in the last video.

35
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,310
The estimated level at time period t,

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,400
is at the end of time period t, equals alpha times

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,370
the new information.

38
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,190
And the new information is the new demand

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,970
that occurred, x sub t, divided by the most recent seasonality

40
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,850
for that time period t, f hat t minus p.

41
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,060
So I'm going p units of time back

42
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,490
to the most recent relevant time period.

43
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,470
I'm going to add 1 minus alpha times the old information.

44
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,310
The old information for the level

45
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,680
is the estimate of a hat t minus 1, plus b hat t minus 1.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,790
So it's the estimates of the last period

47
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,250
for the level and the trend.

48
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,630


49
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,910
The updating equation for the trend

50
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,780
is going to be identical to what we did in the Holt model.

51
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,180
So again, it's beta hat t equals, or b hat t,

52
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,330
equals beta times the new information--

53
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,900
which is the newly estimated level that we just

54
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,540
did-- minus the estimate of the level from the time period

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,200
before.

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,560
So this is my best estimate if there's a new trend.

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,760
Plus 1 minus beta times b hat t minus 1,

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,610
which is the estimate I had from the previous time

59
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,260
period for the level.

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,410
Excuse me, for the trend.

61
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,800
Finally, we have the seasonality update.

62
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,070
That's f hat t, and that's equal to gamma times xt over a hat t.

63
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,270
And what are we doing here?

64
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,170
We're deleveling.

65
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,260
I'm taking the actual demand and dividing it

66
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,210
by the estimate of the level.

67
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,720
So this is giving me an indication

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,490
if the seasonality is changed.

69
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,240
Plus 1 minus gamma, times f hat t minus p.

70
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,180
It's the seasonal term for the most recent similar time

71
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,490
period.

72
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,670
So let's look at an example.

73
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,430
We're still in our sandwich shop.

74
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,930
And now we're looking at the bagels,

75
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,890
and they have an additive trend and we

76
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,800
think a multiplicative seasonality.

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,010
Day of week, so there's five time periods

78
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,360
in our seasonality, so p equals five.

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,080
And so now it's Friday, time period 104.

80
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,290
And we've estimated that the level estimated at that time

81
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,570
period, 104, is about 121 bagels.

82
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,076
So on average, we sell about 121 bagels a day.

83
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,700
And we've noticed that we have a trend,

84
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,020
we're increasing sales of about 0.3 bagels per day.

85
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,190
Linear and it's positive.

86
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,770
So at the end of a week, we're selling about 1.5

87
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,870
more bagels a week-- just 5 times 0.3.

88
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,840
So the current seasonality factors are shown to the right,

89
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,180
in that little table.

90
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,600
And the smoothing factors are alpha is 0.1, beta is 0.08,

91
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,420
and gamma is 0.05.

92
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,105
So my forecast for Monday, so that's x hat 104, Friday, 4,

93
00:04:12,105 --> 00:04:15,120
105 is for Monday.

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,130
It's one business day forward.

95
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,870
So I'm just going to plug and chug here,

96
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,470
and it's going to be equal to the recent estimate

97
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,100
of the level, which is 121.

98
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,080
I gave that to you.

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,810
Plus 0.3, is my most recent estimate

100
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,850
of the trend, multiplied by my most recent estimate of what

101
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,020
Monday seasonality is like, 0.5.

102
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,270
And that gives me an estimate of 60.7.

103
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,510
So now, let's suppose that in fact at the end of Monday,

104
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,250
it was a banner day for bagels.

105
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,120
We sold 76.

106
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,170
Big day.

107
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,390
So now I want to know what do I forecast

108
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,490
for demand for Tuesday, in time 106?

109
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,760
Now because it went up, that means

110
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,160
my seasonality might be increased, right?

111
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,350
So I'm going to take that new information into account.

112
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,310
So I did this in a spreadsheet.

113
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,290
This should look familiar to you by now.

114
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,200
Cell C1 is the alpha, the beta's in C2,

115
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,320
and the gamma's in cell C3.

116
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,990
And so my estimate for the level is down here in cell D11,

117
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,290
and it's simply alpha times the new demand divided

118
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,040
by the most recent seasonality, which is F6-- because remember,

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,710
I'm finding the estimate for the level in time period 105

120
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,850
for period for Monday, so that's why I'm dividing it

121
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,920
by a Monday seasonality-- plus 1 minus alpha times

122
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,280
the most recent estimates for the level

123
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,240
and the trend, D10 and E10.

124
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,320
And my estimate for the trend is going

125
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,190
to be beta, up here in cell C2, times the most recent estimates

126
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,250
of the level, D11 and D10, plus 1 minus beta, times my most

127
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,860
recent estimate of the trend itself, which is in cell E10

128
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,040
right here.

129
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,370
Then the last thing I do is my seasonality.

130
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,090
And that's simply going to be equal to the gamma

131
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,890
times the ratio of the C11, which is the most recent demand

132
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,100
that I have, divided by my level,

133
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,490
my most recent estimate of the level, D11, which I just did.

134
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,920
Plus 1 minus gamma times my most recent estimate

135
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,330
of that relevant time period's seasonality,

136
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,530
which is F6, which is the last Monday.

137
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,030
Because remember, this is telling me

138
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,660
that the new Monday estimate of seasonality

139
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,180
has gone up a little bit.

140
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:31,680
Right?

141
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,430
Because I had such a big banner day, it might be noise,

142
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,710
but it might also be an indicator

143
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,350
that I have more seasonality.

144
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,410
That maybe Mondays are picking up and I need to adjust those.

145
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,380
So then I can find my estimate for Tuesday off of this, right?

146
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,790
So it's just going to be the D11, which

147
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,480
is the estimate for level, plus 1 tau-- I've only

148
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,320
gone one period ahead-- times my new estimate

149
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,730
of the trend, which is 0.5.

150
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,020
And for this, I'm going to multiply it by F7.

151
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,790
Why is that?

152
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,500
Because this is a forecast, or a prediction, or an estimate,

153
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,480
for Tuesday.

154
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,870
So I'm going to the Tuesday.

155
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,110
So what I've done is I've taken the estimate of the level,

156
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,160
added the trend, multiplied by what

157
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,500
I expect to sell on a Tuesday-- which is a 0.75--

158
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,230
and that will give you my forecast for Tuesday, 93.7.
