1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,590
So let's talk about how we handle uncertainty.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,030
Because there's a lot of uncertainty in supply chains.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,890
There's a lot of variability in demand.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,620
There's a lot of variability in the lead time or transit time.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,900
There's a lot of variability in manufacturing or processing

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,380
yields as well as time.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,710
So there's uncertainty and variability all over the place.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,250
So because it occurs in all aspects of the supply chain,

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,794
we can't just manage or plan to the average or the mean.

10
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,210
That's not going to be sufficient.

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,110
So what we want to do is understand how that varies.

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,530
How does the demand distribution look?

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,010
How does the distribution lead time look?

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,730
We're going to use three families of distributions,

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,560
generally, throughout this course.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,330
The first one is our old friend, the Normal Distribution,

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,800
we'll use a lot.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
We'll explain why a little later for each of the cases

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,350
where we use it.

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,080
But we should be very familiar with this.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,700
It's the symmetric bell-shaped curve

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,640
where you've got two parameters, mu which is the average,

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
and the sigma which is the standard deviation.

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,569
So I'll say that I'm normally distributed with a mean of mu

25
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,580
and the standard deviation of sigma.

26
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,210
This is for a continuous variable

27
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,840
that goes from negative infinity to positive infinity.

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,160
And it's symmetric.

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,750
It's symmetric around the mean.

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,120
So that means that there's an even amount on the right side

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,490
as the left side.

32
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,480
The mean, the median, and the mode are all the same value.

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,090
And this is most commonly used.

34
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,440
Whether that's good or bad, we'll talk more about that.

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,620
Then there's the Log-normal distribution.

36
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,320
A little more interesting in that it's skewed right

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,830
and that the mean and the median are not the same.

38
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,850
There's this long tail over here on the right.

39
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,860
So it's continuous greater than 0.

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,230
So that's one real strong attribute

41
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,110
of the Log-normal distribution is that you

42
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,540
can't have negative values.

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,380
It's less commonly used.

44
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,685
We will start using it later on in the course when

45
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,470
we talk about transportation.

46
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,710
Because transportation, as anyone

47
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,337
who's waited for a plane or a bus knows,

48
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,170
you might have this average but you can have

49
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,449
some really long wait times.

50
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,200
So you get this log-normal distribution.

51
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,904
So we'll talk more about this a little later.

52
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:16,820
Then the third distribution we're going to use

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,630
is the Poisson Distribution.

54
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,780
And this has a single parameter, lambda.

55
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,410
We'll say things are distributed Poisson with a lambda.

56
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,730
The lambda is actually the mean and the variance.

57
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,070
And this is discrete.

58
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,440
That's why we use it.

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,030
That's one great benefit of it is

60
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,170
that it's a discrete distribution as opposed

61
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,430
to continuous.

62
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,040
It's also only positive numbers or non-zero, non-negative

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,980
numbers, rather.

64
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,600
So it's greater than equal to 0.

65
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,520
That's great for items with low values.

66
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,940
So if I have demand of 1.6 items per week, then

67
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,940
maybe it matters.

68
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,315
And I have low values there, then

69
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:56,310
I want to have a discrete distribution.

70
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,660
So we're going to spend most of our time with the Normal

71
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,844
and with the Poisson.

72
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:02,760
And later on we'll spend time with Log-normal.

73
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,220
But let's talk about the normal and the Poisson next.

74
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,010
So the Normal distribution looks something like this.

75
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,700
This is the PDF up here in the top right corner.

76
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,230
You see it charted here.

77
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,150
The mean is this mu.

78
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,220
So you see it's symmetric around the mean.

79
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,760
The horizontal axis here is the random variable x or x0.

80
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,460
And the vertical axis is the probability.

81
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,890
That's the fx(x0), the PDF.

82
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,800
So again, we said it's distributed normally

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,970
with a mean of mu and a standard deviation of sigma.

84
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,460
So if I pick a point, let's say this value of x,

85
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,020
and it's going to be equal to the mu, the average,

86
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,060
plus a certain number of standard deviations

87
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,940
over to the right, that's k times sigma x.

88
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,510
So let's say I pick this point.

89
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,650
Then by doing that, I can find two probabilities.

90
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,650
The area under the curve to the left

91
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,980
of that that's highlighted in that blue hash mark, that's

92
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,280
the probability that the random variable x is

93
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,210
going to be less than this value, which is mu plus k sigma

94
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,420
x.

95
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,310
The area under the curve to the right, that's

96
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,310
highlighted in red, this is equal to the probability

97
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,519
of x is going to be greater than that value, mu plus k sigma x.

98
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,380
You can see just by looking at it,

99
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,670
the total probability has to be equal to 1.

100
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,170
So the area in the red is equal to 1 minus the area

101
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,650
in the blue and vice versa.

102
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,860
Because they have to add up to 1.

103
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,550
This will become critical when we

104
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,960
start talking about demand distributions, when

105
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,220
we want to know, how big do I make this value

106
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,140
to guarantee that, 90% of the time, my demand

107
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,190
won't be stocked out.

108
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,800
So I can do this-- I can find these values using

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,140
spreadsheets.

110
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,380
So here are the two functions, the norm inverse

111
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,040
and norm distribution function.

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
I list the parameters there.

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,500
But what we typically do is we use the unit normal table.

114
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,750
This is where I transform the normal distribution to one

115
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,840
that's known as the unit normal or standard normal.

116
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,020
That is a normal distribution with a mean of 0

117
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,480
and a standard deviation of 1.

118
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,990
How do I transform it?

119
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,710
Well, I create these k values.

120
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,280
Some books call them z values.

121
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,030
It doesn't matter.

122
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,290
Same thing.

123
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,550
All I do is I take that random variable, x, subtract off

124
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,600
the mean and divide by the standard deviation.

125
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,800
That transforms my normal distribution

126
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,530
to this unit normal which is down here in the lower right.

127
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,950
You can see the PDF and if you want to pause, you look at it.

128
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,250
The PDF is just the same as the one in the upper right

129
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,800
corner except with the values of mu equals 0 and sigma equals 1.

130
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,210
So what's beautiful about this unit normal?

131
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,210
It applies to any normal distribution.

132
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,270
So I can use this if I pick a value now, let's call it k.

133
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,100
This is going to be a value of the random variable that's

134
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,240
now u0 for the unit normal.

135
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,460
Then the same thing applies.

136
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,300
I look at the probability under this unit normal curve.

137
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,020
That's what's in the red here.

138
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,280
This is the probability that my u, my demand,

139
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,950
is greater than equal to that k.

140
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,130
To the left, in the blue hash mark,

141
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,680
under the area under the curve there,

142
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,710
is the probability my demand will be less than that value k.

143
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,080
So the beautiful thing about the unit normal,

144
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,320
no matter what my distribution is,

145
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,820
because this could be anything.

146
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,500
This could be 1,000, 600, 200, whatever.

147
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,760
These can take an infinite number of forms.

148
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,630
I can always transform them to this beautiful unit normal.

149
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,480


150
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,600
In spreadsheets, it's the same functions

151
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,450
except I use this s for standard.

152
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,570
So NORMSINV of the probability will give me that k value.

153
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,310
And NORMSDIST, if you put the k value in,

154
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,870
will give you the probability.

155
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,080
It gives you the cumulative probability

156
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,390
in this area in the blue here, the probability

157
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,320
that unit normal is less than k.

158
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,990
Now I can also use these standard tables,

159
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,070
which is really nice.

160
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,240
These are attached to this video.

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,270
So the idea here is, if I pick a k value here, let's

162
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,700
say 0.55, then I know that the probability that my u will be

163
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,490
less than equal to k is 70.8%.

164
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,460
And so you'll use these tables a lot.

165
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,210
Hopefully you're familiar with those.

166
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,585
Do some of the practice problems.

167
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:30,120
We'll take you through those.

168
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,620
But you can use the unit normal tables.

169
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,890
That's why using the unit normal is so helpful.

170
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,970
The other thing to think about with the normal distribution

171
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,560
is how it's shaped.

172
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,580
So it's symmetric.

173
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,930
So if I look at the mean plus or minus 1 standard deviation,

174
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,890
I'm going to capture 68% of that total distribution.

175
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,630
If I add 2 standard deviations, that's

176
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,030
covering 95.5%, 3 standard deviations, 99.7%.

177
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,250
You can see what captures.

178
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,410
So the idea is that it's symmetric around the mu.

179
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,830
You can see how it's distributed.

180
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,600
We'll use this a lot, especially the unit normal.

181
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,560
Now let's talk about the Poisson.

182
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,880
So again, a single parameter.

183
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,740
Essentially, it's the probability

184
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,950
that x events occur within a time period.

185
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,840
The single parameter, lambda, is both the mean and the variance.

186
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,380
Here is the probability mass function.

187
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,640
Again, it's a discrete function.

188
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,110
So for x0 equals 0, 1, 2, the probability

189
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:41,440
that that event happens, the P_x0 is equal to this equation:

190
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,520
e to the negative lambda times lambda to the negative x0

191
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,640
divided by combinatorial of x0.

192
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,940
You can see the cumulative distribution as well

193
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,930
and simply the summation of all those

194
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,200
values up to that value of x0.

195
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,920
If I plot these, in here I'm showing

196
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,750
that I plotted three of the values

197
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,410
where these are all lambdas.

198
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,130
The green is a lambda of 2.2.

199
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,390
The yellow is a lambda of 4.

200
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,330
And the blue is a lambda of 8.

201
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,600
If you look at these, what's happening is,

202
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,110
as lambda gets bigger, it gets more symmetric.

203
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,400
It starts approaching a discrete version

204
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,650
of the normal distribution.

205
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,540
So I'm going to highlight, now, these green,

206
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,780
you see how they fall out and then the blue.

207
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,420
You can see that as the lambda gets bigger,

208
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,000
it gets a little more symmetric.

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,260
So in spreadsheets, it's a straight Poisson function

210
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,730
where I put in that x0, the value I'm

211
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,510
trying to find the probability of,

212
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,130
the lambda, which is the mean of the distribution.

213
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,610
Then I can either use a flag of 0 or 1.

214
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,340
A 0 gives me my PMF, the probability

215
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,860
of that value, x0 occurring.

216
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,620
The cumulative function F(x0), if I put the flag to 1,

217
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,530
that tells me the cumulative probability

218
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,210
that my value is less than that x0.

219
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,420
Also we give you tables.

220
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,790
So the tables are set up similar to the normal tables in that

221
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,260
every column is for a lambda.

222
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,950
We only did certain lambdas here.

223
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,400
We couldn't do every single one.

224
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,950
There is no-- sadly, no unit standard Poisson table.

225
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,870
Then each row is the cumulative function of a given x0.

226
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,860
So for example, let's say I have a distribution where

227
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,050
the lambda of the Poisson is 1.

228
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,800
I want to find the probability, the cumulative probability,

229
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,340
that I will have three or less observations over that time

230
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,080
period.

231
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,660
So I go from 3 to here.

232
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,690
The probability that I'll have 3 or less

233
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,560
is going to be equal to 98%, 98.101.

234
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,690
So this is telling me my cumulative probability

235
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,310
of getting 3 or less observations.

236
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,020
So for the same lambda distribution,

237
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,100
if I want to see the probability that I

238
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,040
get no observation showing up, no demand showing up,

239
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,290
that happens 36.78% of the time.

240
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,320
OK, so this is the Normal and the Poisson distribution.

241
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,720
We put a bunch of problems in the practice session.

242
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,809
So get comfortable with these.

243
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,600
You should be very familiar and comfortable

244
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,540
with both Normal distribution and the Poisson.
