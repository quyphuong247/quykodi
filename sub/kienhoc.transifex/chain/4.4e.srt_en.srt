1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,600
Now that we understand Bob and Sally's approach,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,550
let's try to further this.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,130
We do see that Bob's approach does slightly

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,030
better than Sally's approach.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,610
So what Bob is suggesting is a new ordering price,

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,920
cost of transaction of $25 per order.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,650
And why don't we try to come up with our new EOQ using

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,430
this ordering value, and can we do that?

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,590
Well, we have all these values.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,530
We have the c_t, have the demand,

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,640
and we have done a few times the cost

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,230
of having excess inventory.

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,550
So let's substitute these values,

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:01:01,070
which is 2 times 25 times 5,000, divided by 0.56.

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:10,990
And this gives us a new EOQ value of 668 units.

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,490
Now that we have this new EOQ, let's go ahead

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,970
and calculate the new total cost.

18
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,780
And what would that be?

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,900
Once again, purchase cost plus ordering

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,700
cost plus holding cost.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,490
So has there been any change in the purchase cost

22
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,700
with Bob's approach and using EOQ?

23
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,680
Well, nothing changes because the purchase price

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,250
remains the same, and our demand, or the total buy

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,720
for that year remains the same.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,080
So the purchase cost stil remains $10,000.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,120
How about ordering cost?

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,560
Does that change?

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,240
Well, we have a new ordering valuable of $25,

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
and the number of orders throughout the year

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,270
also changes because the new value is 668.

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,680
So this gives us a value of $187.

33
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,900
How about holding cost?

34
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,520
Does that change?

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,160
Well, holding cost is, again, c_e times average inventory

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,900
on hand.

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,530
c_e is c times h, and the c doesn't change.

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,390
The h doesn't change, however the value of average inventory

39
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,400
on hand is now 668 by 2.

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,540
So this also gives us a value of $187.

41
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,080
So now that we have purchase cost,

42
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,030
we have the ordering cost and the holding cost,

43
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,530
can we calculate the total cost?

44
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,230
Of course, if you add these three values up,

45
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,610
we get a total cost of $10,374.

46
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,490
And this is better than the previous two approaches,

47
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,390
and even better than the first approach.

48
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,990
And we see that this total cost so far

49
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,900
is the least than the previous three approaches.

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,105
And one we have here, let's also try

51
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:20,340
to come up with the order frequency,

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,170
because we were asked to do so.

53
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,740
So what is the order of frequency?

54
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,040
Well, you know our new EOQ is 668.

55
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,160
The demand remains at 5,000.

56
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:41,650
This equates to 0.13 years, or roughly seventh years.

57
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,430
It should be 6.95, or roughly seven weeks.

58
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,510


59
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:55,400
Which means-- well, let's use the power of two rule.

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,750
OK?

61
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,855
So the power of two rule, and let's try to round this up.

62
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:04,580


63
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:12,900
The next value after 7 is 8, so this comes to eight weeks.

64
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,380
So basically, one order of every eight weeks.

65
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,730
Now, what we have on the next slide

66
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,450
is a comparison chart for all these various approaches

67
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,610
we went through.

68
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,870
And what you can see is that Bob's suggestion

69
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,270
to use the ordering price and stay with the Q of 500

70
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,190
is better than Sally's suggestion of using

71
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,380
the EOQ with the higher ordering price, which

72
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,470
was the initial ordering price of $100.

73
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,010
And the final solution, which was the fourth one,

74
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,550
is the best of all, where we use the lower ordering

75
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,560
price and the EOQ approach.
