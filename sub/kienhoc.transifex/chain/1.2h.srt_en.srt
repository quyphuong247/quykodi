1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,580
OK, let's go over the key points from this lesson.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,040
The first one is the forecasting is a means not

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,530
an end by itself.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,570
It's part of a larger demand shaping,

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,590
demand planning, demand management process.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,580
And it's not just being forecasting

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,350
for forecasting sake.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,080
It's being used for a purpose, whether it's

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,840
to plan your inventory, plan your capacity,

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,310
plan your operations.

11
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,040
But it's part of a larger process.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,873
And it's important to remember that whenever

13
00:00:27,873 --> 00:00:30,400
you do any kind of forecasting.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,396
Then we talked about three truisms.

15
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:33,770
And the interesting thing-- these

16
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,250
are always fun to talk about.

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,970
But what's more interesting is what are the implications.

18
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,440
So first, we talked about that all forecasts are wrong.

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,490
This is true.

20
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,491
But what does this mean?

21
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:44,990
Well, this means you should probably

22
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,210
think about range forecasts.

23
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,840
Get at a range of possible values that you're estimating.

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,710
And also look at the error terms.

25
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,620
Capture your forecast errors, because that'll

26
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,910
help you create a more robust forecast.

27
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,350
The second truism is that aggregated forecasts

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,910
are more accurate.

29
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,209
And the idea here is that yes, you

30
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,720
want to aggregate over SKUs, over time, over locations

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,930
wherever possible.

32
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,980
And this is the idea of risk pooling, where

33
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,140
if I pool different things together,

34
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,000
I can share and minimize the overall risk

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,910
and the overall coefficient of variation.

36
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,870
And then the third one was that shorter horizon forecasts

37
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,990
are more accurate than longer horizon.

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,200
It's easier to predict tomorrow's temperature

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,070
than a year from tomorrow.

40
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,830
And this suggests the idea of postponement.

41
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,160
I want to move that point of final customization

42
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,190
as close to the final point of consumption as possible.

43
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,750
Because then I'm predicting my forecasts

44
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,650
over a much shorter horizon.

45
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,620
So all three of these truisms, while they're

46
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,880
fun to talk about, have direct implications

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,830
of how you want to manage your operations.

48
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,420
Then we went into different approaches for forecasting.

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,260
We talked about subjective and objective approaches.

50
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,870
On the subjective side, we looked

51
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,590
at judgemental approaches.

52
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,580
And these are the idea where someone, somewhere knows

53
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,290
what the forecast is, what the actual demand is going to be.

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,950
And our job is to try to extract that from as many people

55
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,620
and find out what the real answer is.

56
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,910
Then we talked about experimental.

57
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,490
Another subjective approach, and this

58
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,680
is where you test on a small sample

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,540
and you extrapolate to the larger market.

60
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,240
We talked about two objective approaches, causal analysis,

61
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,650
and this is where we think there's an underlying driving

62
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,900
factor for demand that we can capture and measure ahead

63
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,730
of time.

64
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,250
And I use that as a proxy to forecast demand.

65
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,800
Then we talked about time series,

66
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,240
which is very different.

67
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,810
It's a black box approach.

68
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,050
And then we look at past history and we look at patterns.

69
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,960
And we try to find what patterns exist and use those patterns

70
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,680
to predict the future.

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,080
So all four of these approaches are used.

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,250
They're all valid.

73
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,710
In fact, most companies use a combination of these.

74
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,540
You don't just use one type.

75
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,070
You use a wide range that gives you more information.

76
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,960
So while we'll talk about them individually,

77
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,650
you should think about when you use,

78
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,440
when you're developing for forecasting any kind of models,

79
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,280
you want to look at all of these approaches,

80
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,889
because they're all valid in different situations.

81
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:17,430
And finally, we wrapped up by talking

82
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,360
about forecasting metrics.

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,140
And the idea that we first talked about

84
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,050
was the idea of accuracy and bias and how those trade off.

85
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,860
You need to capture both bias and accuracy.

86
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,760
And then we talked about three metrics--

87
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,230
the mean absolute deviation, root mean square

88
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,567
error, and the mean absolute percent error,

89
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,400
and some other ones.

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,690
But these are the three common ones.

91
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,900
So we'll be using all these different metrics

92
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,750
when we talk about the different forecasting methods.

93
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,697
And for the rest of the lecture going forward,

94
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,530
we'll start using these different techniques

95
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,889
and approaches.

96
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:51,180
So if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions,

97
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,470
please use the discussion.
