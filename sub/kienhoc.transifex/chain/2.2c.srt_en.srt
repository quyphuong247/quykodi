1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,900
So let's look at exponential smoothing now with a trend.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,590
We're looking for that trend pattern.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,189
Remember a trend is just a persistent pattern, either

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,730
in a positive or a negative direction over time.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,500
It can be linear.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,910
It can be nonlinear.

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,270
So let's say I have this case where here the first column is

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,030
my time periods, t.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,890
And xt is simply the demand that actually happened at that time.

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,010
So if I was going to look at this,

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,790
this is the actual observations.

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,180
And if I was going to do a next period forecast,

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,440
so I'm sitting in time one.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,960
What's my forecast for time two and so forth?

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,670
If I did exponential smoothing with an alpha of 0.3,

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,530
that's this column the third column.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,270
This is what those forecasts would look like.

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,670
And, again, I just assumed that the very first observation

19
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,496
was the forecast just to get the process started.

20
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:54,870
And you can see what happens here

21
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,030
is that the exponential smoothing it

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,440
increases over time.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,660
And this is a simple exponential smoothing.

24
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,019
But it never catches up.

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,180
And if I do a moving average of three,

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,560
that's this fourth column here.

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,710
And you can check the math here if you want.

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,260
And all it's doing is taking the average of the three latest

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,160
observations for the forecast for the next period.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,079
You can see that also lags.

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,620
And you can see it's a little closer.

32
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,900
That's just between the alpha and the moving average number

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,580
that I use would determine which one is closer to that.

34
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,610
But in either case, they will never catch up.

35
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,080
Moving average and simple exponential smoothing always

36
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,900
will lag if there's a trend in the demand data.

37
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,660
Because they're only looking at history

38
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,930
to find a stationary level.

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,940
In both cases their explanatory underlying model

40
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,190
is that it's a level plus some noise.

41
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,350
And all they're trying to do is say, OK, there's

42
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,670
some new information.

43
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,730
That must be noise.

44
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,160
Should I adjust my level?

45
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,300
They never proactively look for a trend.

46
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,370
And what we need to do is capture

47
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,250
a trend or some other kind of factor

48
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,830
whether it's a seasonality or something else.

49
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,660
So for this model we're going to look

50
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,990
at including both level and trend.

51
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,750
And this is often referred to as Holt's method, initially

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,470
developed it.

53
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,180
And we're going to use two smoothing constants: Alpha,

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,180
which we're very comfortable with by now for the level,

55
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,890
and beta will be used for the trend.

56
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,450
And both alpha has to be between 0 and 1

57
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,950
as does beta- has to be between 0 and 1.

58
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,220
So again, we're looking at a level and a trend.

59
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,540
So if I look at the underlying model

60
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,620
it's a little bit different from what we've seen in the past.

61
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,650
I'm saying that the demand in xt is

62
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,390
going to be a function of some level

63
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,050
plus some trend times the number of time periods t.

64
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,800
So b is an incremental increase, or decrease,

65
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,230
in time period t times the number of time periods.

66
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,190
It's just the slope, right.

67
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,080
So just over here.

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,804
Look at the picture.

69
00:02:57,804 --> 00:03:00,220
And then I'm going to add to that some kind of error term.

70
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,980
There's always a little bit of randomness or noise.

71
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,200
And, again, I'm assuming my error terms are independently

72
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,720
and identically distributed with a mean of 0,

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,500
not biased, and some variance.

74
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,240
So what's my forecasting model?

75
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,500
Well my forecast, that's the x hat,

76
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,930
sitting in time t for time t plus tau.

77
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,380
Now this is not necessarily a next period model.

78
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,060
It's t plus tau periods in the future.

79
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,980
Tau could be 1, 2, 3, whatever.

80
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,700
It's going to be equal to my estimate of what the level is

81
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,780
sitting in time t plus the estimate of what I think

82
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,930
the trend is going to be, that's the b hat sub

83
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,270
t, times the number of time periods I'm going forward, tau.

84
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,550
So this is the forecasting model.

85
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,470
So every period then I'm going to update it.

86
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,455
So I have to create these updating procedures or updating

87
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:54,955
formulas.

88
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:58,240


89
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,980
So that's what these formulas are.

90
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,070
Now the first one should look very familiar.

91
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,430
So both of these, the alpha hat sub t and then b hat sub t,

92
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,800
are estimates of the level, that's the a term.

93
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,110
And the b term is the trend components

94
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,410
at the end of time period t.

95
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,810
So when I have a hat t that's my estimate for what the level is

96
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,246
knowing what's already happened in time t.

97
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:27,370
So it's at the end of the day, the end of the week,

98
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,740
the end the month, whatever.

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,590
So we would have to forecast, or we

100
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,380
have to update, each of those for our forecast.

101
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,540
So if I look at the first one for a this

102
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,485
should be very familiar to you guys.

103
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:40,860
Because it's the same thing as we

104
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,160
did for simple exponential smoothing.

105
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,080
It's alpha times the most recent actual observation--

106
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,890
not a forecast, the observation, there's

107
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:54,520
no hat-- plus 1 minus alpha, times this term alpha hat

108
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,080
t minus 1 plus beta hat t minus 1.

109
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,160
And what is that?

110
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,200
That's just the most recent forecast.

111
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,420
That's x hat t minus 1t.

112
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,050
So it's the same thing.

113
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,540
So you can see that this is just the same equation,

114
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,040
this first updating procedure for the a term,

115
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,810
is the same as what we had for simple exponential smoothing.

116
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,850
Now the second term, the b updating,

117
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,430
is a little different.

118
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,640
But it really follows the same principle.

119
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,780
So you've got this beta smoothing factor.

120
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,060
And so I'm going to multiply the first term, which

121
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,130
is the new information by beta, and the old information by 1

122
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,990
minus beta.

123
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,430
So again it's a linear combination.

124
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,590
And what's the new information?

125
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,880
Well the new trend, how do I know what the new trend is?

126
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,250
Well here's one way to think about it.

127
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,930
I estimated what I think the new level is, right.

128
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,260
I just did that up here.

129
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,000
So that minus what my most recent estimate of the level

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,780
is.

131
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,170
So if I'm saying that last time I

132
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,810
estimated the level is about 100 units of demand for period.

133
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,860
And then this time I estimate those levels 110.

134
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,940
So 110 minus 100 means my level went up

135
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,030
10 units in one time period.

136
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,320
So that's some new information suggesting

137
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,360
I might have a new trend, a trend of 10 units

138
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,920
increase in demand for every time period.

139
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,850
That's the new information.

140
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,970
So for the trend, the new information,

141
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,400
is the difference in the most recent level estimates.

142
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,520
Now what's the old information?

143
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,190
The old information is my most recent estimate

144
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,390
for what the trend is, b hat t minus 1.

145
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,900
So it's the estimate of what I did in the last period.

146
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,420
So in both cases-- it's like double exponential

147
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,480
smoothing-- I take the new observation

148
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,920
to help me set the level compared to the latest

149
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,050
forecast.

150
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,010
And for the b term I take what the new estimate

151
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,780
of what the trend is going to be,

152
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,310
which is just the difference between the most recent levels

153
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,290
that I estimated.

154
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,300
And I'm going to add one minus beta of the old trend

155
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,049
that I had historically.

156
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:08,340
So, again, it's the same thing.

157
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,290
It's the new and the old, new and the old.

158
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,130
You just make a linear waiting between those.

159
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,540
So let's look at a simple example

160
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,030
to get the mechanics down.

161
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,010
So this is the forecasting model up here at the top.

162
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,230
Nothing has changed.

163
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,550
We have the two updating procedures one for the level

164
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,430
term and the second one for the b term, which is the trend.

165
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,750
And let's suppose we're in time 101, time period 101,

166
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,117
whatever that is.

167
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:35,200
Let's say I'm doing weeks.

168
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,840
And in week 101 that's where I'm sitting.

169
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,070
And I've got an alpha of 0.3 and a beta of 0.1.

170
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,700
And I want to forecast the demand for t equals 102.

171
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,170
So that's sitting here, right.

172
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,810
I want to forecast for what the demand is

173
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,930
going to be in period 102.

174
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,580
So it's the next time period.

175
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,860
So how am I going to do that?

176
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,750
Let's focus in on this part A first.

177
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,332
Then we'll talk about this part B.

178
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:04,540
Well, I just want to go down.

179
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,717
And first thing I want to do is estimate the a term.

180
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:09,050
What's my estimate of the level?

181
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,980
Because I have some new information.

182
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,170
So I'm going to estimate the demand for t equals 102.

183
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,630
And so first I'm going to find that estimate

184
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,660
of the level in 101.

185
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,730
So I want to find this term.

186
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,590
How do I do that?

187
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,160
Well, I just use my updating procedure.

188
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,620
So my updating procedure is going

189
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,130
to be, the alpha hat for period 101

190
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,799
is going to be equal to my alpha,

191
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,230
0.3, times my most recent observation, which

192
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:42,309
was in period 101, which is 95, plus 1 minus alpha, which

193
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:46,180
is 0.7, times my most recent forecast, which is just

194
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,440
the sum of my most recent estimate for the level

195
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,400
and the trend, alpha hat 100 beta b hat 100,

196
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,880
which is just 90 and 8.5, which is the same thing as my most

197
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,860
recent forecast yesterday for today, 98.5.

198
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,820
So what I'm doing is essentially I'm

199
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,080
taking a weighted average between the new information,

200
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,320
95, and the old information, which is 98.5.

201
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,280
So I know it's going to be somewhere between those two

202
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,690
numbers, somewhere between 95-- my new information-- and 98.5.

203
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,480
So this is saying that it's probably

204
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,930
going to be a little less than 98.5.

205
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,000
Makes sense.

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,109
And so that comes out to be 97.5.

207
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:34,150
Now what do I want to do?

208
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,360
I want to find my update, or my estimate, for the b term,

209
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,440
for the trend, for period 101.

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,440
So now I want to find this term.

211
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,170
What is that?

212
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,010
Well, I'm just going to use this updating formula again.

213
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,290
I'm going to use one for the b or the trend term.

214
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,020
It's going to be beta, which we gave you was 0.1, right,

215
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,260
times the difference in the estimated levels.

216
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,870
So my estimated level for 101, I just did that.

217
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,330
It was 97.5, right.

218
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,760
Just did it right here.

219
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,500
And I want to subtract off my most recent estimate, which

220
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,650
was in time period 100, which was this 90.

221
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,370
So 97.5 minus 90.

222
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,450
I see an estimate that the trend is 7.5 units per time period.

223
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,660
That's my new estimate, new information coming in.

224
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,580
I'm going to add to that 0.9, which

225
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,510
is 1 minus beta, times what my old estimate of the trend

226
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,970
is, which is this term, right 8.5.

227
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,670
So actually, it looks like my trend-- the new information--

228
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,390
is saying my trend is a little lower

229
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,130
than what it was previously.

230
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:45,250
So the weighted average of this, 0.1 times 7.5, plus 0.9 times

231
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,600
8.5, is about 8.4.

232
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,560
So how do I find the forecast?

233
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,874
I just add them together.

234
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,040
Right, so add them together.

235
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,636
I get 105.9.

236
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:59,940
97.5, which is my level, plus one period forward-- so 1 times

237
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,670
8.4-- pretty much gives me 105.9.

238
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,470
OK, now let's say I'm sitting again in time 101.

239
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,050
But I want to forecast for time period

240
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,470
110, which is nine time periods in advance.

241
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,190
How do I figure that out?

242
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,160
Well this is actually really easy.

243
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,470
So what does tau mean?

244
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,180
Remember this is my forecasting model up here in the top right.

245
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,160
And I'm saying that my forecast sitting

246
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,430
in time t for time t plus tau is going

247
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,370
to be my most recent estimate of the level plus tau

248
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,550
times what?-- My most recent estimate of the trend.

249
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,860
So that's simply going to be 97.5-- that's

250
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,810
my most recent estimate of the level-- plus 9 periods of time,

251
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,480
times my most recent estimate of the slope, or the trend,

252
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,670
of 8.4.

253
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,340
And that comes out to be 173.1.

254
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,400
So hopefully you understand the mechanics

255
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,390
of how this all works.

256
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,348
And it's really simple.

257
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:01,620
You just use these two updating procedures.

258
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,620
And the alpha and the beta are telling you

259
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,800
how much of the new information to use

260
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,690
and how much of the old information to use.
