00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,950
In this lesson, we'll introduce some of the key concepts

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,360
that we're going to use throughout the remainder

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,910
of this course, and in fact, you'll

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,930
probably end up using a lot of these concepts

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,220
throughout your entire supply chain management career.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,960
So specifically, we're going to talk about three big items.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,520
First, we're going to talk about Push versus Pull Systems.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,260
This is just a way to categorize different systems,

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,890
and these can be inventory systems, forecasting,

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,720
supply chains-- it doesn't matter-- any kind of system

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,100
as to whether it's push or pull.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,560
Then we'll move on to Segmentation Strategies.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,730
Segmentation Strategies are one of the key tools

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,517
that you will need to help you run a supply chain.

15
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:40,850
We're going to talk about different ways you can segment

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,270
your different products as well as segment

17
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,770
the different types of supply chains

18
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,580
that you have within your firm or within your organization,

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,710
because segmentation is the way that you'll

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,530
be able to customize the processes that you have

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,440
to fit the products, the customers, and the suppliers

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,890
that you're working with.

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,100
And finally, we'll wrap up this lecture

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,660
with handling uncertainty.

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,290
We'll just talk about different ways

26
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,350
that we will work with uncertainty and variability

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,760
in demand and Lead Time and all those other things.
