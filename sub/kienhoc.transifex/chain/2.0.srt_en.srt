00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,355
Welcome to week two of SC1x.

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:03,980
And what we're going to do in this week

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,810
is we're going to dive into forecasting a little deeper.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,770
And the keyword for this week is time series.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,460
So we're going to use different time series techniques to do

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,480
better forecasting.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,400
So this is our second week where we started

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,117
talking about forecasting.

9
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:21,700
So the first thing you want to realize

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,616
when you look at demand, because that's really

11
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:25,250
what we're going to be forecasting,

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,220
the assumption here for time series

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,020
is that they follow patterns.

14
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,252
And there are certain patterns that are out there,

15
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:33,710
and there are four patterns that we're going to talk about.

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,160
The first one is level that we call

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,740
a, and that just assumes that there's some level,

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,680
there's some base level of demand.

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,750
The next is known as trend, and this is a persistent change

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,660
in demand over time.

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,550
Now, it can be this is a positive trend.

22
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,540
I could also have a negative trend.

23
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,880
It doesn't matter.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,830
But it's persistent and it's linear.

25
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,900
It's a linear trend.

26
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,050
Then another pattern that we see is

27
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,239
something called seasonality, and this

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,930
is where you see a repeating pattern over time.

29
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,290
And we call this-- we use the letter f for this.

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,040
Different seasons.

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,670
Now, we say seasonality, but that doesn't mean it's spring,

32
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,290
summer, fall, winter.

33
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,850
It could be, but it could be the months of the year.

34
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,520
It could be days of the week have

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,960
their different seasonality.

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,670
It could be hours of the day that

37
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,020
have different seasonality.

38
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,290
So it's just over any time a repeating pattern, not

39
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,220
necessarily a year.

40
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,295
And then the last one we'll talking about is randomness.

41
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,670
And we're going to call that-- it's really an error term,

42
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,930
and we'll talk about that.

43
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,910
But we know from our previous classes

44
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,930
that's just where you have some kind of random nature here.

45
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,220
So we have these four patterns, really these three patterns,

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,640
that we're going to focus on.

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,015
And what we're going to do is try

48
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:52,909
to fit those to make some forecasts.

49
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:54,700
And the way we're going to make a forecast,

50
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,310
the way we're going to milk that, is we're going to say,

51
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,070
my forecast for demand-- that's what the little hat is-- it

52
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,260
means it's an estimate or a forecast sitting in time period

53
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,590
t-- that's today-- making my forecast for t

54
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,880
plus one-- that means tomorrow or the next period--

55
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,626
and we want to find what that is.

56
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:16,000
And we're going to find that it's

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,940
a function of all those different patterns-- the level,

58
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,720
the trend, the seasonality, the error, and a bunch

59
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,340
of other things.

60
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,476
So we're going to use different functional forms,

61
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:30,850
different models, and we're going

62
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,683
to make different assumptions, and that will

63
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:35,530
allow us to make forecasts.

64
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,679
OK, so let's start with the simplest models.

65
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,220
We'll talk more about these in class,

66
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,900
but the simplest ones-- first one is known as a cumulative.

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,240
And in a cumulative model, my forecast

68
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,210
sitting in today for the next period,

69
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,760
t plus 1-- t, t plus 1-- is equal to all the other demands

70
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,770
where x is the random variable of demand that

71
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,770
happens in that period, so xi is the demand that

72
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,050
happened in period i.

73
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,790
So for the cumulative, I'm going to sum those all up from i

74
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,750
equals 1 to my current period, t, today.

75
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,390
So I'm going all the way back to today,

76
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,290
and I'm going to divide that by t.

77
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,850
That should look very familiar.

78
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,660
It's an average.

79
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,118
That's all that the cumulative is doing-- saying everything

80
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:22,150
in the past matters equally, and I'm going to take half of that.

81
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,650
I'm going to take an average of that.

82
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,110
Now, at the opposite extreme is the naive.

83
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,460
And for naive, we say that the estimate sitting

84
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,060
in today for the demand for the next period

85
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,320
is going to be equal to what happened today.

86
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,770
So this is just the opposite.

87
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,340
This is what was last is next.

88
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,590
What happens tomorrow is what happened today.

89
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,690
So this uses no history.

90
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,490
This uses all the history.

91
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,260
So you can see these are kind of bookends

92
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,014
at how you can do forecasting.

93
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,680
And now there's one that's in the middle

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
here that's called a moving average,

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,350
which, as you would expect, makes a lot of sense.

96
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,570
And what do we do here?

97
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,360
Instead of going all the way back to the beginning of time,

98
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,850
I go back m periods.

99
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,350
How far back do I go?

100
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,330
And I only go from equals t minus m up to t.

101
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,089
So I might go back a moving average of four periods.

102
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,279
I go back four, and I do the average of those four

103
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,000
or average of 12.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,850
So moving average is kind of something

105
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,965
in between these two extremes.

106
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,590
Now, we're going to spend a lot of time

107
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,950
on this last one known as exponential smoothing

108
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,860
because this really makes it interesting because this does

109
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,850
a lot of interesting stuff.

110
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,820
So if I look at cumulative and naive forecasts,

111
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,110
let's think about how it weights the older observations.

112
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,230
So in this chart down here, I've got on the vertical axis

113
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,400
the weight of each observation, and these are periods of time

114
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,090
as I go back in time.

115
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,680
This is today, t. t minus 1 is last period, two periods ago,

116
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,190
three periods ago, four periods ago, and so forth.

117
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,940
So if I look at the cumulative, it

118
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,300
treats each of these the same.

119
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm just going to take an average of every observation.

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,490
Now, if I look at the naive, if I do the naive, what does

121
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,300
it do?

122
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,300
It treats the one, the most recent, 100%

123
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,220
and the rest of them at 0.

124
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,900
So you can kind of see where they're different.

125
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,630
But the question you might be asking

126
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,960
is, why do I treat something like this cumulative one

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,420
four periods ago with the same weight as yesterday?

128
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,940
Shouldn't yesterday or last period count more?

129
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,610
Isn't the more recent information more important

130
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,360
to me?

131
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
And that's what exponential smoothing does.

132
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,280
It essentially says the weight is a function of how recent

133
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,660
that data is.

134
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,396
And so it uses this smoothing function--

135
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:46,770
and we'll talk about this in the lectures and derive it--

136
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,600
it's actually a geometric smoothing,

137
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,550
but we call it exponential smoothing.

138
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,500
And so what this ends up being is

139
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,480
that my forecast sitting for today for the time period

140
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,150
t plus-- I'm going to go tau-- that

141
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,420
means tau periods in the future-- one, two,

142
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,520
three-- so I could forecast tomorrow and tau

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,850
would be one, or two, or three-- it's forecasting how far I

144
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,032
want to go in the future.

145
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:11,490
And we're saying that's going to be

146
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,010
equal to the smoothing factor.

147
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,650
We're going to call it alpha.

148
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,000
And we're going to multiply that by my information

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,670
that I have most recent, my most recent observation of demand,

150
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,720
plus 1 minus that alpha times what?

151
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,510
My most recent forecast, and that's x-hat t minus 1 of t.

152
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,310
What did I forecast yesterday for today?

153
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,370
What I'm doing here-- let me just highlight this

154
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,650
because this is really critical--

155
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,970
I'm creating a balance between the new information

156
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,064
and the old information.

157
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:52,730
And so that's what exponential smoothing

158
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,070
does that these other methods do not.

159
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,540
It treats the age of the observation of the data

160
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,470
differently.

161
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,570
And so exponential smoothing is widely used.

162
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,010
It's in all of the packages, so I

163
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,551
want to make sure you understand this

164
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,930
very well because you're able to not only weight it

165
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,410
according to age, you're able to incorporate all these trends.

166
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,744
For this week, we'll just start with level and trend.

167
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:16,160
But in the next weeks, we'll start

168
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,304
adding in seasonality and other things.

169
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,720
All right, so this is what we're going to cover this week.

170
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,720
It's a lot of stuff diving deep into forecasting.

171
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,870
So watch the videos, do the recitations,

172
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,650
work the quick questions of practice problems.
