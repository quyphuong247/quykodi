1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,040
OK, so we saw how sensitive the EOQ was to changes in Q,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,705
changes in D, the cost per item, the cost per transaction

3
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:11,592
order, all the different input variables.

4
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:12,925
And we found it was very robust.

5
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,840
It was very insensitive.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,249
The thing that we didn't look at yet was time.

7
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:19,040
So let's take a look at that because that's

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,760
kind of a special case.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,780
So the question is why is it different.

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,100
Well because the time is when we're

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,890
going to have to do something.

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,886
So you want to make sure it's practical.

13
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:30,510
That's a critical thing with everything

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,910
we do with inventory theory anything with supply chain.

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,910
It's more important to come with something that actually gets

16
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,010
executed than something that might be theoretically optimal.

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,860
We want to make sure that we can actually implement it.

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,360
So for T, we want to make sure the time is

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,600
something practical.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,600
In our previous example, we found

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,800
that the order cycle time is 73 days.

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,990
So it would be very hard to expect someone every 73 days

23
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,375
to place an order for something.

24
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,750
So what you want to do is come up

25
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,249
with something that's a little more practical, a little more

26
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,050
reasonable.

27
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,510
Also, this has the added benefit of being

28
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,000
able to aggregate things.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,833
Because remember, everything we've looked at

30
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,020
is one item at a time.

31
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,160
But if I have multiple items, maybe I

32
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,300
want to aggregate them to common order schedules.

33
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,710
And so this is another way to do that.

34
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,350
And so looking at the previous example--

35
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,850
and this should be very familiar to you at this point--

36
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,380
the Q* is 400 units.

37
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,620
We found our total relevant cost of $5,000 per year.

38
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,000
And we found our T* to be 0.2 years or 73 days or 10.4 weeks,

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,560
nothing of which is very practical.

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,270
Based on the equation that we developed before,

41
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,900
I can really find quite simply what

42
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,700
the change in the total relevant costs

43
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,330
will be if I pick a different T compared to the optimal T.

44
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,080
I'll give you two examples here if I do things weekly and then

45
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,790
monthly, and all I'm doing here is substituting in knowing

46
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:01,060
the T* is just = Q*/D. And so therefore Q* = D times T*.

47
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,240


48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,910
I just carry it through, plug it in, and it's the Q / Q*

49
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,169
and the D's cancel out.

50
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,460
So it's pretty straightforward.

51
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,710
You could figure these out, check my math.

52
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,830
But we want to do something a little bit different,

53
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,660
and what we want to do here is use something

54
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,700
called the power of two policies.

55
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,204
This is a very clever, clever heuristic

56
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:26,787
and essentially what we're going to do

57
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:29,360
is we're going to pick a base time period,

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,750
whether it's a day or a week or a month.

59
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,200
And I'm only going to order in powers of two of that.

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,740
And so powers of two, 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 of whether it's a day,

61
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,340
week, or month.

62
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,720
The nice thing about this, it sounds a little strange,

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,180
but it guarantees that the total relevant costs

64
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,510
will be within 6% of optimal.

65
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,870
That's pretty amazing.

66
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,750
So let's spend more time and go into details of how this works.

67
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,640
So essentially what you're going to do is whatever your T* is

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,420
I'm going to pick a k so that that T* falls between 2^k

69
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,740
and 2^(k+1).

70
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,430
So here I have 2^0.

71
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,870
That's if my base period is a week.

72
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,120
So I'm saying a base period is one week,

73
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,910
then this 2^0 would mean I'm ordering once a week.

74
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,530
2^1 means I'm ordering every two weeks.

75
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,810
2^2 every four weeks, every eight weeks, every 16 weeks,

76
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,880
and so on.

77
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,100
And so I want to pick the k where my T* falls in between

78
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,750
those.

79
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,010
So in the example that we did before,

80
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:42,130
where our T* was 10.4 weeks, we would pick k = 3 because it

81
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,850
falls within that.

82
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,830
And so is it optimal?

83
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,890
No, but it's within 6%.

84
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,480
So let me go through and explain why this is so.

85
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,970
Because it's really interesting to understand how this works.

86
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,620
So here's my time and suppose I've got--

87
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,590
so these are all 2^k-- my k is based off a week,

88
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,910
so my base time is a week.

89
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,830
And I know that this could be a T. As I say,

90
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:19,170
k is equal to, just for the example here, k = 3.

91
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,650
So this would be every 8 weeks, and this would be 2^(k+1), 3+1,

92
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,430
or 2^4 or 16 weeks, which is the same thing as 2T.

93
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,830
So 8 and 16, this is 2T.

94
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,110
And so the question is, let's say T* falls somewhere within

95
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,610
this time period, where's the worst possible case where it

96
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,670
could fall?

97
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,080
And you could guess if you think about it a little bit,

98
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,140
the worst possible case is if it falls right in the middle.

99
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,830
T* is right there, and the middle would be defined

100
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,400
as where the error from this side,

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,730
coming from the T = the error coming from this side.

102
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,960
So the point where those two are equal to each other is

103
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,300
the worst possible error, because if T* is close to this

104
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,200
T or close to this 2T, then going there would be even less.

105
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,500
So the worst possible case is where

106
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,420
those errors are equal to each other.

107
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,660
Now what's interesting and important to realize

108
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,310
is that the point where those errors are the same

109
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,350
is not the middle between 8 and 16, because 8 and 16,

110
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,520
the average of that would be 12.

111
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,720
So the middle there would be 12.

112
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,050
When in fact, for those errors to be equal to each other,

113
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,940
what we'll see, is that it's actually where 2^(k+1.5),

114
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,750
in this case 2^3.5, which if you calculate this through really

115
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,780
quickly, comes up to be 11.3.

116
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,670
So it's not that is in between the T and the 2T,

117
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,930
it's where the errors are the same.

118
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,670
So how are we going to figure this out?

119
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,960
Well the best way to do this is to set of our equations.

120
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,090
Let me just erase this stuff, make it a little easier to see.

121
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,410
So what I'm doing is I'm sending the error from the left--

122
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:15,160
that's this, the T over the T* and the T over the T* here--

123
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,440
and then this is the error from the right.

124
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,800
And again, this 2T over the T*, and then the T* over 2T.

125
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,220
So where these two errors are the same,

126
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,580
that's the worst possible case.

127
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,514
So where is that?

128
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,930
Well all I'm going to do is set these equal to each other,

129
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,180
and they'll cancel out the halves,

130
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,570
going to bring all the terms with the T* on to the right,

131
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,440
and everything with the 2T on the bottom to the left,

132
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,080
and just use some simple algebra, clean it up,

133
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,240
until I get these relationships.

134
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,650
The T/T* = sqrt(1/2) and take the inverse of that,

135
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,420
and obviously T*/T over = sqrt(2).

136
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,560
So now I'm going to take those terms

137
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,180
and just put it right back into our equation that we had

138
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,310
for finding any kind of sensitivity for EOQ,

139
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,740
and you see it comes out to be one half times one

140
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,000
over the square root of two plus square root of two over one,

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,390
and that turns out to be 6%.

142
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,720
Amazing, isn't it?

143
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,410
So the idea here is if I pick the power of two intervals,

144
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,750
it's guaranteed to be within 6% of the total relevant cost

145
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,760
compared to the optimal interval.

146
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,090
So the process you do to use this in practice

147
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,280
is very straightforward.

148
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,650
Find the T*.

149
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,530
Find that optimally from EOQ.

150
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,850
Pick your base time period, a day, a week,

151
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,100
whatever it's going to be.

152
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,490
And then you find the lowest value of k that satisfies that.

153
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,470
And so you know the T*.

154
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,180
You do T*/sqrt(2).

155
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,770
And sqrt(2 times T*), and you find 2^k times your base time

156
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,600
period, whether it's a day or week or a month,

157
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,094
that falls between those.

158
00:07:56,094 --> 00:07:57,760
And then that's what you use, and you're

159
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,140
guaranteed to stay within 6% of the ratio

160
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,620
of the relevant costs.

161
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,360
So let's do an example.

162
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,390
Because it seems complicated, but to use

163
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,780
it is actually very quite simple.

164
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,266
So here's a different example.

165
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:13,640
I know you're getting bored with the one I've been using.

166
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,460
So my demands now 25,000 units per year.

167
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,809
My cost replacement is $750 per order.

168
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:22,350
You see the cost of the product is a little lower than it was

169
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,850
before, $25.50, and my holding cost is 15% per year.

170
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:33,970
So what I want you to do is figure out Q*, figure out T*,

171
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,620
and figure out what your total relevant cost is.

172
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,740
OK, pause the video.

173
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,549
Figure these out, and when you're ready,

174
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,470
and you've got numbers, then start it again.

175
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,020


176
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,555
OK, I've assumed that you've actually done the calculation.

177
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:51,430
So let me just show you what the calculations

178
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,200
what I came up with.

179
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,080
And if your numbers don't match these,

180
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,680
pause the video, go back, and try again.

181
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Try to figure these out.

182
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,520
This is straight EOQ, and you should

183
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,500
be able to get these numbers.

184
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,100
What I really want to do is answer this question.

185
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,850
Suppose I don't order of things every 0.125 years.

186
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,950
I want to find something a little more reasonable.

187
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,300
What should I do?

188
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,970
Well let's go and say, OK, my base period

189
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,760
is going to be a week.

190
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,220
Because I order things generally on a weekly basis.

191
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,250
So what is my T* going to be.

192
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,820
Well my T* is going to be equal to 52,

193
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,460
because there's 52 weeks in a year, times 0.125.

194
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:40,770
And that comes out to be 6.5 weeks per order.

195
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,910
There we go.

196
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,370
So what I want to do now is I want

197
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,914
to find the balance for that.

198
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:48,080
And so remember we said I wanted to find T*/sqrt(2).

199
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,300


200
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,850
And what does that equal to?

201
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,810
That's equal to 4.6.

202
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,320
You can check my math.

203
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,030
6.5/sqrt(2), root of which is 1.414, is 4.6.

204
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:13,100
And then I want to find the ratio of T* times sqrt(2).

205
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,290
And what's that equal to?

206
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,620
That's equal to 9.2.

207
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,230
So I want to find some term of 2^k that falls between those.

208
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,110
So I know 2^0 is 1.

209
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,210
2^1 is 2.

210
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,740
2^2 is 4.

211
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,730
2^3 is 8.

212
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,170
8 falls between that.

213
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,370
So I'm going to use 8, which means my k = 3.

214
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,420
So what does this mean?

215
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm going to order 8 times per year.

216
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,200
So that's going to be the same thing as

217
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:53,240
equal to a 0.1538 years per order.

218
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,580
I just multiplied by 52.

219
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,480
8 / 52 will give you this.

220
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,115
And so what will my order quantity

221
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:03,570
be, because if I'm ordering that frequently,

222
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,030
my Q is going to change.

223
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,210
Remember Q is just T times D. So my T we just figured out

224
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:22,680
is 0.1538, and I multiply this by my demand, which is 25,000.

225
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:34,070
And for this I get my new Q = 3,846.

226
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,140
OK, so that's what my new Q is going to be.

227
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,560
But let's make sure we're doing things correctly.

228
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,710
So let's find out what our real error is.

229
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,710
So I want to go and look at my total relevant cost from the T

230
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,750
that I picked and compare that to the total relevant cost

231
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,630
for what the T* is.

232
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:03,980
And this is just going to be the 1/2 times 8 / 6.5 + 6.5 / 8,

233
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,780
because remember, I decided to do every 8 weeks and the T* was

234
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,790
every 6.5 weeks.

235
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,320
And if you crunch this out it comes to about 2%.

236
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,780
Let's say I don't trust the formula.

237
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,800
Let's just figure it out the long way.

238
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,500
TRC for the total relevant cost for the T

239
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,210
is going to be equal to what?

240
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:31,890
Well I've got my order cost, $750 per order, times 25,000

241
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:38,325
is my demand, and my Q we said was 3846.

242
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,940
And I'm going to add in my inventory holding

243
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,110
cost, which is 25.5 times 15%.

244
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,510
That's my c times my h times my Q,

245
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:56,630
3846, divided by 2 because it's the average inventory on hand.

246
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:03,020
This comes out to be 12230.

247
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,280
All right, so now we already figured out--

248
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,960
this is my total relevant cost for T--

249
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,260
we already figured out the total relevant cost for T* --

250
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,840
remember you did this earlier-- was 11976.

251
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,830
So I just divide those two, this'll be my ratio,

252
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,670
and it comes out to be 1.02.

253
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,270
So it matches.

254
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,250
So by doing a power of two, I'm staying within 6% worst case

255
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,930
of the ratio of the cost to the optimal costs.

256
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,543
