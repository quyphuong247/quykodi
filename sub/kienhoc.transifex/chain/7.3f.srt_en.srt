1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,390
So for part four we have the following.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,970
Suppose demand is still uniformly distributed

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,480
with mean 0 and max 300.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,980
If the manager wants the probability

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,410
of having excess inventory at the end of the semester

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,886
to be less than 20%, how many books should then be ordered?

7
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:17,010
So what are we facing here?

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,930
We have a manager, and clearly she

9
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,020
wants to avoid having books left at the semester.

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,790
Whatever she orders before the semester,

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,590
she wants to be able to sell that during the semester.

12
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,050
So she doesn't want to go through the hassle of having

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,740
to salvage those books.

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,730
It could be by having some kind of promotion

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,330
or having some other type of campaign

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,810
in order to solve whatever is left

17
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,080
at the end of the semester.

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,490
She wants to avoid that.

19
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,020
And what they're saying is that they

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,320
want the probability of this happening to be less than 20%.

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,350
So let's think about this.

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,150
This is a uniformly distributed demand.

23
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,380
So if we were to order the average,

24
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,460
that means we're going to order 150.

25
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,830
If we do that, we know that the probability that the demand is

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,710
less than what ordered is 50%.

27
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,577
So the probability that there's going to be a stockout is 50%

28
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:13,910
and the probability there's going to be excess inventory

29
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,410
is 50%.

30
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,100


31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,890
With the probability of excess inventory being 50%,

32
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,760
that's too high.

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,020
We want a probability of ending inventory left to be 20%.

34
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,700
So ordering 150, average demand, is

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,810
too much-- we have to lower it.

36
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,300
The question is, how much lower than 150 should we order?

37
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:42,800
Well, we want the probability of the demand to be less than Q,

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,580
because when the demand is less than Q,

39
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,930
it means that we have excess inventory.

40
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,520
So you actually don't want it to be equal to,

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,970
you want it to be less than 20%, or less than 0.2.

42
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,200
When is this the case?

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Well, what is this?

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,270
This is really f of Q, the cumulative distribution

45
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,070
function.

46
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,810
We want this to be less than 0.2.

47
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,310
The cumulative distribution function

48
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,460
for a uniform distribution, we found

49
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,950
that in a previous problem.

50
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,095
In part three we saw that this is equal to Q divided by 300.

51
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:22,320
We want Q divided by 300 to be less than 0.2,

52
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,870
which means that we need a Q, whatever Q we order,

53
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,650
has to be less than 60.

54
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,560
So we saw that a Q equal to 150 is too much.

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,730
Really, in order to make sure that the probability of having

56
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,750
excess inventory at the end of the semester is less than 0.2,

57
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,560
we have to order less than 60 units.

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,800
OK, so that's it.

59
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,470
I hope going through these problems and the solutions

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,480
with you helped you think about how the distribution of demand

61
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,370
impacts the solution for single period inventory

62
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,090
type of models.

63
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,807
And I hope you find it insightful.

64
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:01,140
Thank you so much for listening.

65
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,810
If you any questions or comments,

66
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,230
just use the discussion forum that you find

67
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,440
after these video segments.

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,140
Good luck.
