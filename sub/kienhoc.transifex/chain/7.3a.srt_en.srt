00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,290
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,180
Welcome to this recitation session

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,010
on inventory management.

4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,450
My name is Fredrik Eng Larsson.

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,650
And in this video, we're going to talk about stock

6
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,447
outs and single-period models.

7
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:13,030
During the session, I'm going to spend

8
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,600
most of the time going through one of the problems

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,600
that you have in your problem set for this week.

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,270
I'm going to show you how to think about when you solve it,

11
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,570
how to actually solve it.

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,210
And then we're going to say something about the insights

13
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,600
to the solutions.

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,100
Before we get there though, I wanted

15
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,420
to say something about single-period models

16
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,710
and what makes something a single-period model

17
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,770
and a little bit about how it's different from the EOQ model

18
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,540
that you've seen in the past.

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,050
So as you heard during the lecture,

20
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,750
this is a very popular model or framework really.

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,850
And you can think of it as a stepping stone for much more

22
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,780
complicated inventory models.

23
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,830
Why is this so useful as a framework?

24
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,820
Well, it's useful because it's addressing

25
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,800
a fundamental trade-off that you find when you make decisions

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,260
under uncertainty.

27
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,130
It tells us how to trade off the costs of ordering or producing

28
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,680
too little of something versus the cost of ordering or making

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,400
too much of something.

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,990
So it's balancing that trade-off when

31
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,770
we have to make a decision about how much to order or produce

32
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,647
without knowing how much we're going to sell.

33
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:17,480
We can think of this in terms of a timeline.

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,340
So here's a timeline, where we have time on the axis

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,070
here, and time is progressing as we move towards the right hand

36
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,310
side of the screen.

37
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,400
And what makes something at one-period model

38
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,310
are two characteristics.

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,990
First of all, we have a well-defined selling season

40
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,200
or sales period.

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,470
So we have some kind of start, and we have some kind of end.

42
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,040
And really, what's crucial here is at the end,

43
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,920
we can no longer sell the product at full price.

44
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,160
So somehow, the product becomes obsolete at the end

45
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,840
of the selling season.

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,820
That is the first key characteristic

47
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,720
of a single-period model.

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,090
The second key characteristic is that during this selling

49
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,260
season, we cannot replenish our inventory.

50
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,220
So if we're looking at a store, that means we cannot replenish

51
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,547
the store shelves during the selling season.

52
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:05,380
And if we're looking at a central warehouse,

53
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,979
it means we cannot replenish the inventory of the warehouse

54
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,520
during the selling season.

55
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,970
When is this the case?

56
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,710
Well, maybe more commonly than you would think.

57
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,410
And the key, sort of the most common context where

58
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,570
this is described and often referred to

59
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,900
is when you sell newspapers.

60
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,307
And it's sometimes referred to as a newsvendor type of model.

61
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,140
For newspapers, you have a very well-defined

62
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,412
and a very short selling season, because the newspapers that you

63
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:33,120
have in the morning, they're more or less

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,532
obsolete-- I mean, before the afternoon even.

65
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,990
Somewhere around lunch, you may not

66
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,680
be able to sell the newspapers anymore,

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,050
because the news are old.

68
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,882
So you have a very short, very well-defined selling season.

69
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:46,340
And you have to make a decision about how much to replenish

70
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,700
for that selling season, because basically once you're

71
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,464
standing in the-- the vendor is selling the papers,

72
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:53,130
there's no time or it's not economically

73
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,910
feasible to replenish the papers as the day progresses.

74
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,590
So that'll be one case.

75
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,030
Another case is when you have a long lead time.

76
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,800
So you can think of seasonal goods--

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,040
sports items or some fashion goods--

78
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,100
that are sold only during a short season of the year.

79
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,430
Many times, these goods have to be produced well

80
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,352
in advance in big batches somewhere far away.

81
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:15,060
That means that you have a very long lead

82
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,700
time from the time you place a production order until you're

83
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,320
able to sell the goods.

84
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,870
So when this lead time is much longer than the selling season,

85
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,700
that also means it's impossible to replenish during the selling

86
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,560
season.

87
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,330
So these are the two key characteristics

88
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,560
that make something a single-period model.

89
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,540
And basically, the decision that you're trying to find

90
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,350
is the quantity decision.

91
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,070
So before the selling season, you

92
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,580
have to make a decision about how much to make,

93
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,065
how much to order.

94
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,440
And you have to make the decision

95
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,140
without knowing how much you're going to sell

96
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,360
during the selling season.

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,320
So essentially, it's a model that

98
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,640
tells you how to place a bet.

99
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,960
You have to make a bet about how much you're

100
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,990
going to sell during the selling season.

101
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,430
And if you bet more, there's going to be some consequences.

102
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,170
If you bet less, there's going to be some other consequences.

103
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,290
So this model, like I said, it tells you

104
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,590
how to balance that trade-off.

105
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,730
And this is what makes these type

106
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,980
of models so useful as a framework for more

107
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,780
complicated models also.

108
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,900
So today, we're going to look at one of those decisions.

109
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,331
We make a quantity decision.

110
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,539
And you can think of, compared to an EOQ model, where

111
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,740
you have a timing decision and you decide when to order

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,370
and how much to order, now for this type of model,

113
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,550
we only make a decision about how much to order.

114
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,260
So it's a quantity decision.

115
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,510
And today, we're going to look at one context

116
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,380
where this is the decision that you have to make.

117
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,080
OK, let's get started.
