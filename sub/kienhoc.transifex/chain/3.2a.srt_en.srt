00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,580
In this lesson, we're going to wrap up our forecasting module

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,460
by talking about some special cases or special techniques

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,400
that you might use or might come across in your forecasting

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,960
career.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,780
So the first thing we're going to cover is causal analysis.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,730
Now, we've seen this technique before.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,220
We're going to use ordinary least squares regression.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,560
And the whole idea between causal analysis

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,590
is that unlike exponential smoothing, where

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,330
it's a black box, where we assume there are these patterns

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,980
we don't quite know why, for causal analysis,

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,130
we assume that we have some understanding of what

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,060
causes that demand.

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,850
And so we're going to use regression

15
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,020
to try to develop a descriptive and predictive model

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,617
base of demand based on those explanatory variables.

17
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:44,950
Then we're going to move into new product introductions.

18
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,242
This is a huge area.

19
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:47,950
We're going to spend a couple of segments

20
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,658
on this, because it's really interesting.

21
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:51,220
And you'll see this a lot, especially

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,610
if you go in the high tech or in the fast consumer packaged

23
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,930
goods industries.

24
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,790
The whole idea is how do I introduce,

25
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,990
or how do I forecast the demand, for a product with no history.

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,989
Then we'll talk about another special case, kind

27
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,980
of on the other end, and that is with intermittent demand.

28
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,030
What do I mean here?

29
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,250
This is where demand is very irregular.

30
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,320
It's sparse.

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,642
And so think of spare parts.

32
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:18,350
You don't know you're going to need them.

33
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,000
So the demand is not this constant, nice distribution.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,100
It's very intermittent.

35
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,180
And we'll discuss a way of being able to smooth that out

36
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,220
for forecasting purposes.

37
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,560
And then finally, we'll just wrap up the module

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,450
and I'll give some wrap up points

39
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,960
for forecasting in general.
