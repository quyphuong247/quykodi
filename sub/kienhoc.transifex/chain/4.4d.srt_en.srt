1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,110
Let's try to understand Sally's approach a little bit better.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,820
So Sally is suggesting we go with the EOQ model.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,030
So again, a quick recap.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,850
What's the formula for our EOQ or Q*?

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,500


6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,840
So this is the square root of 2 times the transaction

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,000
cost times the demand, over the cost

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,310
of having excess inventory.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,190
Do we have these numbers?

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,369
Yes, we do.

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,270
And how do we move?

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,810
2 times c_t is 100.

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,210
Our annual demand is 5,000.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,980
Divided by c_e, which we can calculate from c times h ,

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:56,260
which was $2 per unit, times h was given to us as 0.28.

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:08,640
So this gives us a value of 1 million divided by 0.56.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:18,090
And if you solve this, we'll get a value of 1,336 units.

18
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,460
OK, so now that we have our EOQ number, the unit of 1,336,

19
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,490
let's try and calculate the total cost using this EOQ.

20
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,800
Once again, we will calculate the purchase cost,

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,840
plus ordering cost, plus holding cost.

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,110
So what is our purchase cost?

23
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,550
Well, nothing has changed here, so we start at 2 per item

24
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:56,480
and we order of 5,000 units in a year, so this gives us 10,000.

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,980
OK.

26
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,490
What about the ordering cost?

27
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,630
Is this effective with an EOQ?

28
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,340
Yes, it is.

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,280
So the ordering cost is still 100 per order.

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,780
However, the number of orders we will make

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,830
will change, because this time it's 5,000

32
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,000
divided by 1,336 and not 500.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,950
So this gives us a value of $374.

34
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,620
What about the holding cost?

35
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,400
Will this be affected with an EOQ?

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,330
Yes.

37
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,480
And the formula is c_e, cost of excess inventory,

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,550
times the average inventory on hand.

39
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,780
So we have done this before.

40
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,600
We have calculated c_e to be 0.56.

41
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,510
The average inventory, however, is Q/2,

42
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,450
and this time our Q is 1,336, divided by 2.

43
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,290
And this again gives us, coincidentally,

44
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,410
a value of $334.

45
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,130
So if we have the purchase cost, the ordering cost,

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,600
and the holding cost, can we calculate the total cost?

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,100
Yes.

48
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,620
We just add these three up, and this should give you

49
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,590
a value of $10,748.

50
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,040
Well, while we are here, can we also

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,985
calculate the order frequency?

52
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:21,550


53
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,190
I think we were asked in the question about the order

54
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,180
frequency.

55
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,530
Yes.

56
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:37,490
So we order 5,000 units in batches of 1,336.

57
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,680
This gives a value of 3.74.

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,620
Let's round it off to 4.

59
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,810
What it means is roughly 4 times in a year,

60
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:56,440
or one order every three months.

61
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,710
This becomes our order frequency.

62
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,880
Let's now try to understand Bob's approach.

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,830
Bob doesn't suggest we change Q. So when we don't change Q,

64
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,270
would our total cost be different?

65
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,680
Let's calculate.

66
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,279
Again, this total cost will have a purchase cost component,

67
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,380
an ordering cost component, and a holding cost component.

68
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,530
Let's see which of these three is impacted

69
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,660
with Bob's suggestion, which is to put down

70
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,780
the ordering cost or the setup cost from more than 100 to 25.

71
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:46,680
So the purchase cost still is at $2 per unit, times 5,000 units

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,356
that we sell, or the Coop sells in a year.

73
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,170
Right.

74
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,590
So this gives us a value of $10,000.

75
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,591
I think this is the same as the first case, in part A.

76
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,840
So this is your purchase cost.

77
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,930
What about the ordering cost?

78
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,590
Is this impacted?

79
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,150
Well, the ordering price per unit

80
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,280
is now 25, in Bob's suggested approach.

81
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,980
But the number of orders still remains the same,

82
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:24,390
5,000 divided by 500, which gives me a total value of $250.

83
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,885
What about holding cost?

84
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:27,670
Will this change?

85
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,410
Well, what's the c_e?

86
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:41,088
c_e is C times h , and our C is again $2, our h was 0.28.

87
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:45,160
And this goes with average inventory on hand,

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,340
which is 500, divided by 2.

89
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,080
So this doesn't change.

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,020
We still get the old 140.

91
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,210
Can we calculate the total cost now?

92
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,040
Yes.

93
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,900
Add these three numbers up.

94
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,450
And what we get is a total cost of $10,390.

95
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:11,140
And yes, this is a little bit cheaper than Sally's solution.

96
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,800
How about order frequency?

97
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,970
Can we calculate the order frequency here?

98
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,930
Sure.

99
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:25,350
So we know the demand is 5,000 units in a year.

100
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:32,110
And we are in batches of 500, so we end up ordering 10 times

101
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:41,150
per year, one order every 1.2 months.

102
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,920
So this is the same as part A. Nothing changed here.

103
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,440
OK, so let's now move on to the next part, which is can we do

104
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,352
even better than Bob or Sally.

105
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:52,810
Between Bob and Sally, it does look

106
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,510
like Bob's approach is better.

107
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,680
But let's think a little bit more.

108
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,030
What else can we do to yet do better than Bob

109
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,290
and what Sally is suggesting.

110
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,012
