1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,795
All right, let's start building models.

2
00:00:01,795 --> 00:00:04,010
And our first model is going to be the simplest.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,880
We're going to say that the cost per load

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,080
is going to be a function of just the distance.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,710
So our functional form will be cost per load

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,390
equals beta 0, the fixed cost, plus beta 1 times distance,

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,280
where beta 1 is the variable cost per mile.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,610
So we will get output such as this.

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,260
If you run the same model, you'll get the same numbers.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,960
Maybe in a different format and in a different sequence,

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,710
but you should get exactly the same numbers

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,240
if you run a regression model of this form.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,240
So lets go through the results, the output,

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,950
and then we'll talk about it.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,970
First thing you can notice is the r squared of .818,

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,190
or 82%, roughly.

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,230
And then the adjusted r squared right beneath it

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,790
is just a little smaller.

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,490
It will always be smaller than the r squared,

20
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,500
because you're correcting for the number

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,940
of independent variables that you have in the model.

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,570
And so we look at this, and what we can interpret this as saying

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,069
is that I'm explaining about 82% of the variability of cost

24
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,020
per load with distance.

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,460
That's phenomenally high.

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,450
That's great.

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,460
I also have the standard error of the model

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,900
that we can use later.

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,730
And I have the residual sum of squares

30
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,470
and the total sum of squares.

31
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,150
Now, if I take the ratio of those, put the RSS over TSS,

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,751
subtract that from 1, I will get the r squared.

33
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:26,250
Remember?

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,170
That's all that we're explaining here

35
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,934
is the Residual Sum of Squares divided

36
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,100
by the Total Sum of Squares.

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,560
How much am I explaining?

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,300
And then the bottom table shows, for each

39
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,460
of the coefficients, certain output information.

40
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,180
So I have for the intercept and distance

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,130
the coefficient or the estimated value,

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,415
the standard error for that estimate, the t stat, the p

43
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:49,980
value-- remember, for the hypothesis test

44
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,470
that the value is equal to 0 with the alternative hypothesis

45
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,480
is that it is not equal to 0, so therefore a lower value,

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,050
a lower p value means you can more strongly reject

47
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,960
the hypothesis, the null hypothesis of 0.

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,139
So you're looking for that really low p value--

49
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,850
then I also have the 95% lower and upper confidence intervals

50
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,260
for each of the coefficients.

51
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,340
So what can I do with this?

52
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,980
How should I interpret this?

53
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,427
Well, one thing you can do is have your estimation model,

54
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:25,260
because that's what you've figured out here.

55
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,490
By using the coefficients, I can now plug them in.

56
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,920
My estimate for beta 0 is 1,282, and my estimate for beta 1

57
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,960
is 1.532.

58
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,500
So we can say, if I went to predict or estimate

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,310
what the cost per load will be for a shipment

60
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,200
of a certain distance, is going to be

61
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,410
$1,282 plus $1.532 times the distance

62
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,234
of that length of haul.

63
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:54,900
So that's great.

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,670
That's how we can use this model.

65
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,102
But let's talk a little more how we interpret it.

66
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:00,810
I always like to look at the big picture,

67
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,650
and then get down to the parameters.

68
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,580
So on the big picture, always look at the adjusted r squared.

69
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,370
And what we're saying is we're explaining about 82%

70
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,770
of the total variation in cost per load.

71
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,610
That's phenomenal.

72
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,090
That's a very strong model.

73
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,550
Now in practice, you might see lower ones.

74
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,930
Especially for some research areas,

75
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,890
you'll see very low correlations sometimes.

76
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,770
Now, if I look at the independent variables,

77
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,960
both the beta 0 and the beta 1 terms

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,860
seem to make sense both in terms of magnitude and sign.

79
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,140
Now, for example, if the distance coefficient, that b1,

80
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,220
if that was negative, that would be saying,

81
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,740
the further I drive, the less it costs.

82
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,310
So that wouldn't make sense.

83
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,590
So you always try to look for does the sign make sense

84
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,190
and does the magnitude make sense?

85
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,990
Because you always want to go in, in my opinion,

86
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,620
with some kind of hypothesis how you think the relationship

87
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,340
will be.

88
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,800
And you're either going to validate or invalidate

89
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,970
your hypothesis.

90
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,050
So both of these variables, though, are very strong.

91
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,020
So all I need to do is look at that p value there.

92
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:10,320
And so this is telling me that it's significant at the .01%.

93
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,160
That's exceptionally strong.

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,250
So I always look at the p value.

95
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,040
It's nice to know the standard error and the t stat,

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
but really you're going to use the p-value.

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
So this is the first model.

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,310
And the next question we have, though,

99
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,970
is, OK, where do we go from here?

100
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,500
How can we improve it?

101
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,440
What potential additions can I make?

102
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,580
Does the equipment type matter?

103
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,810
Should I include lead time?

104
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,670
Does that have an effect?

105
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,294
Does the trailer length have an effect?

106
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:35,640
How does the weight influence?

107
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,010
Is there some kind of cross-effect?

108
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,900
Is there a non-linear relationship

109
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,880
with the distance or the weight?

110
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,650
All these different things are questions

111
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,100
you can test using regression models.

112
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,380
It's important, though, that you be logical

113
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,240
in your approach and your exploration.

114
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,570
Like I said, I think it's important to have some kind

115
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,220
of a hypothesis going in.

116
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,090
I'm not a fan, personally, of kitchen sink modeling

117
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,800
where you put everything in and see what sticks.

118
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
That's another set of techniques,

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
and we'll talk about those in later courses.

120
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,480
But for regression, it's very important,

121
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,320
I think, to understand some of the underlying

122
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,520
properties of the system you're trying to model.
