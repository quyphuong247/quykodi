1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,060
So let's look at the first question.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,520
What are the annual purchase, holding, order, and total cost

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,740
for the current policy?

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,620
How frequently does the Coop place its order?

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,580
Let's look into the information that

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,920
has been given on the first line of the problem statement

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,080
that I read out to you, which is, the Coop sells

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,740
5,000 units annually.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,560
What does that imply?

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,750
Well, we can assume that these 5,000

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,620
units are the annual demand.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,550
And it orders in batches of 500 units.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,750
So what is this 500?

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,600
Well, this becomes our Q. And the Coop

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,140
pays a price of $2 per unit.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,640
Well this becomes our purchase or variable cost.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,920
In order to place an order, the Coop

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:02,610
pays $100, which means this $100 is our cost of transaction,

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,200
or the ordering price.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,110
What else?

21
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,720
Well, we see, the holding charge, or the carrying cost,

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:20,470
has also been given as $0.28 per dollar of inventory per year.

23
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,410
There's also, interestingly, a selling price and the Coop

24
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,860
sells for $10 per unit.

25
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,270
Well, does this selling price matter or impact in any way

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,270
the inventory policy?

27
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,630
The answer is not.

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,390
So this is something that's not relevant.

29
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,660
We can ignore it- So this has no impact on the inventory policy.

30
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,310
Quick recap.

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,770
So what's the formula or how do we calculate the total cost?

32
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,970
The total cost is the purchase cost,

33
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,090
plus the ordering cost, plus the holding cost,

34
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,020
plus the shortage cost.

35
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,260
Well, demand has been fairly stable.

36
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,540
No variations.

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,419
And for this problem, let's assume

38
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,880
there is no shortage cost.

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,660
So in the next few slides, let's go ahead and calculate

40
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,710
the purchase cost, the ordering cost, and the holding cost.

41
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,230
Let's calculate the purchase cost here.

42
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,690
What has been given to us is the purchase price

43
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,935
per unit item, or c, is $2.

44
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:34,300


45
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,190
So what are the number of units that we are buying in a year?

46
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:46,910
So number of units purchased in a year, this number

47
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,990
has been given to us in the problem as 5,000.

48
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,040
Pretty straightforward.

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,070
So 5,000 units.

50
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,810
Every unit costs $2.

51
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,340
So total purchase cost then becomes

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:13,280
5,000 units times $2 per unit, which gives us $10,000.

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,660
So this is our annual total purchase cost.

54
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,290
Let's move onto the ordering cost.

55
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,580
So what has been given to us is the cost of transaction.

56
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,630
Or to place a single order, it cost dollar $100

57
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,020
to place an order.

58
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,220
How many orders do we need in a year?

59
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,540
How do we calculate that?

60
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,760
Well, we know the demand is 5,000.

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,970
The order in batches of 500.

62
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:54,330
This gives us number of orders as 5,000 divided by 500 is 10.

63
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:01,580
So the total ordering cost then becomes 10 times number

64
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:09,100
$100, which is equal to 1,000.

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,360
Pretty straight forward.

66
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,390
Let's try to calculate the holding cost now.

67
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:22,600
So what is the cost of holding excess inventory, or c_e?

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,850
Let's try to do the units first.

69
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:32,780
So we know this is dollars per unit per time, $1 per unit time

70
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,750
as we call it.

71
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,350
And how did we get here?

72
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,960
We get it by c h , where c is you purchase or variable cost,

73
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,760
and h is the holding charge.

74
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:51,470
So we know that c has been given to us as $2 per unit,

75
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:59,900
and h has been given to us as $0.28 per dollar

76
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,670
inventory per year.

77
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:20,540
So our c_e then becomes $0.56 per unit time.

78
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,750
OK?

79
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,770
So let's move on.

80
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,800
And this c_e or c_h is the cost of holding excess inventory.

81
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,810
How much of this inventory are we holding?

82
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,860
So quick recap.

83
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,120
If you recall the sawtooth model that we did,

84
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,620
the sawtooth graph that we did, and using that we calculated

85
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,730
the average inventory on hold.

86
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,650
And how much was that?

87
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,820
Well, if Q is our order quantity,

88
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,030
average inventory on hold becomes Q/2 units.

89
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,360
So now that we know that Q has been given to us as 500,

90
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,940
we can calculate Q / 2, which is our average inventory on hold.

91
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,700
If you know this, can we calculate

92
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,700
the total annual holding cost?

93
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,900
Yes.

94
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,260
Should be straightforward.

95
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,640
So let's calculate the total annual holding

96
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:31,110
cost, which now becomes c_e times inventory on hold, which

97
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:42,730
is-- you have your $0.56 units per time

98
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:48,350
times your average inventory-- 250 units.

99
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:59,880
And this gives us $140 per time- time being in year,

100
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,080
we get our annual holding cost for this item.

101
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,040
So now that we have the purchase cost,

102
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,280
the ordering cost, and the holding cost,

103
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,090
let's calculate the total cost, which again,

104
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,940
is pretty straightforward.

105
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,140
Purchase cost plus ordering cost plus holding cost,

106
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,810
and we have these numbers now, which

107
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:31,390
is 10,000 plus ordering cost we calculated as 1,000,

108
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,780
plus the holding cost, we just came out to be 140.

109
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:42,440
This gives us $11,140.

110
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,940
OK.

111
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,360
So that's the total cost for the year.

112
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,190
And the last question that we had was,

113
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,210
what is the order frequency?

114
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,960
I think we have already calculated this.

115
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,950
And let me do it one more time.

116
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:07,380
So we are aware that we make 10 orders in a year.

117
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:14,260
Or we want to say 10 orders every 12 months.

118
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:22,650
And then surely this means is one order every 1.2 month.

119
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,100
And that's our order frequency.

120
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,007
