1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's look at our second forecasting truism

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,820
and that's that aggregated forecasts are more accurate

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,190
then disaggregated forecasts.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,350
And this makes sense.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,680
But when we talk about aggregation,

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,820
we talk about aggregating the forecast by SKU.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,850
Look at the forecast for one type of product.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,800
Or time.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,790
Look for things or certain period of time.

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,270
A week, a month, a year.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,440
Or a location.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,220
And so how I aggregate these things together

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,820
might improve my forecast accuracy.

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,259
So to look at this, we're going to use a metric,

15
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,390
and we're going to call it Coefficient of Variation

16
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,230
is a very good metric to look at.

17
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,350
It's simply defined as the standard deviation

18
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,490
over the mean.

19
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,010
Right?

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,660
So it's getting a sense of the spread of the distribution

21
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,910
divided by the central tendency, the mean or the average.

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,520
It's a relative measure of volatility or uncertainty

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,390
in any kind of distribution.

24
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,320
And this CV, obviously if you look at the definition here,

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,760
it can't be negative.

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,260
Right?

27
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,870
It can't really be zero.

28
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,860
That would be kind of very strange.

29
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,900
So generally, it's a positive number.

30
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,230
And a higher CV indicates higher volatility.

31
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,250
If you approach a 0.5 or approach 1,

32
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,170
that means your standard deviation

33
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,700
is as big is your average.

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,580
That gets very volatile.

35
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,130
So if I have two products here, the red product

36
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,640
and the blue product-- let me just erase these things.

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,140
There we go.

38
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,550
You can see if I had to forecast one of these,

39
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,270
if I got to pick which product I want to forecast,

40
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,130
the blue or the red, I think we would all pick the blue.

41
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,491
Because it's probably going to be right around 100.

42
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:34,990
Right?

43
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,679
That blue line.

44
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,470
If this is the daily demand on the vertical

45
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,970
axis, and you can see the time along the horizontal.

46
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,850
Obviously, not much volatility there,

47
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,850
as opposed to the red one, which has its swings between being

48
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,020
almost a zero up to 200 units.

49
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,020
So you can see the CV here, if I look at the red,

50
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,560
the mean is 100, and the standard deviation is 45 units.

51
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,340
Then the coefficient of variation

52
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,420
is simply 45, overall 100, or 0.45.

53
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,600
And the blue, the mean is the same.

54
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,120
So they have the same average, but the standard deviation

55
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,800
is only one.

56
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,560
So it's CV, its coefficient of variation is 0.01.

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,190
So as you would guess the higher the CV,

58
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,720
the harder it is to forecast.

59
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,320
Or the less accurate your forecast is going to be,

60
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,580
because there's that much more volatility.

61
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,990
So it's a good metric.

62
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,130
And we're going to use CV as a proxy

63
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,580
to see if this aggregation actually

64
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,710
improves the accuracy of forecasts.

65
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,890
So let's go back to our sandwich shop.

66
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,730
And of course our sandwich shop, in addition

67
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,580
to selling sandwiches, sells a lot of coffee.

68
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,560
And the coffees always have lids.

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
So here I've got three types of coffees,

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,350
and they all have their own paper cups.

71
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,000
The large ones over here have a demand of cups per day,

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,010
about 80.

73
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,950
It's normally distributed, with a standard deviation of 30.

74
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,450
Right?

75
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,283
That's what this is.

76
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:58,550
So the CV, you can do the math, is 0.38.

77
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,790
For the mediums, I give you the average demand.

78
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,590
You sell a lot more of these- 450 a day.

79
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,910
Standard deviation of 210, and your CV is 0.47.

80
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,240
And then a small ones sell about 250.

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,130
And you can see the standard deviation of 110,

82
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,040
and the CV of 0.44.

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,660
So I've got these three cups.

84
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,669
And you assume each one has its own lid that's unique to it.

85
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:21,960
Let me just draw the lids here.

86
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,010
There we go.

87
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,060
And so what I have on the bottom of the chart

88
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,650
is the distribution over a-- let's see

89
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,820
what is that-- about a year time frame.

90
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,810
And so you see the high volatility ones,

91
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,010
the mediums are the biggest sellers,

92
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,840
have the highest volatility than the smalls.

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,930
And then the larges are pretty stable,

94
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,030
but we don't sell as many of those.

95
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,900
So you can look at the volatility here,

96
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,210
but then the question comes: What if I create a common lid?

97
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,290
So instead of having a lid for each one of them,

98
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,720
of the cups that's unique, I have one that fits all of them.

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,280
So it's only one lid that fits for all three.

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,850
What will that do?

101
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,640
Well I can look at now the distribution

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,320
of that common lid.

103
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,480
And it's going to be a combination of all three

104
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,610
of those distributions.

105
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,480
So if I look at the mean, or the expected value,

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,220
that's just going to be the sum of the expected value of each

107
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,019
of the three cups, or 780.

108
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,430
And the standard deviation of demand for that common lid

109
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,530
is going to be the square root of the sum of the variances.

110
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,830
So check my math.

111
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,010
But it should be correct.

112
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,410
So you'll get that the lids, the common lids

113
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,040
are distributed with an average, or expectation, of 780 units

114
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,090
per day, with a standard deviation of 239

115
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,420
And look what happens to my CV.

116
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,370
It goes down to 0.31.

117
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,940
It's lower than any of the individual ones.

118
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,062
Why is that?

119
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:50,020
And so here's what you see for the distribution

120
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,840
of the common lids.

121
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,770
And what's happening here is something

122
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,980
known as risk pooling.

123
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,100
I'm reducing the amount of total variability

124
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,300
because we assume that if some of the volatility of the large

125
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,310
are offset by some of the swings in the demand in the small,

126
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,520
and in the medium.

127
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,380
And so these peaks and valleys of the individual ones

128
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,040
offset each other.

129
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,020
And that's the idea here with risk pooling.

130
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,060
It's also a great example, a very, very simple example

131
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,730
that you see every day and don't think

132
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,640
about of modularity, or parts commonality.

133
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,600
This is something that's really a major issue

134
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,860
for any manufactured product.

135
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,420
Engineers will try to design a product uniquely.

136
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,640
And so you might have a product where

137
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,850
the bolts, or some component is unique to that,

138
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,970
but it could be common across many different items.

139
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,670
So the idea of having common parts,

140
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,300
or common components across different products,

141
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,890
reduces the variability of that common product,

142
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,561
and makes it easier to forecast.

143
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,810
It does a lot of other things.

144
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,850
We'll talk when we talk about inventory.

145
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,500
But you can think about it reducing the variability.

146
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,730
And when you reduce the variability,

147
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,780
good things happen.

148
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,280
Right?

149
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,650
It's easier to forecast, and actually turns out

150
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,210
you need less Safety Stock inventory.

151
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,100
And we'll talk about that later down the road.

152
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,150
But the big point I want to get here

153
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,120
is if I aggregate by SKUs, by doing again,

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,950
that modularity or common parts, then I

155
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,930
will reduce my variability.

156
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,800
And that's reduced by seeing the coefficient of variation.

157
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,100
But I could also aggregate by time.

158
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,400
So here I've got my daily demand for that common lid.

159
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,400
And we said, remember its average was 780 units per day,

160
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,260
standard deviation of 239, and I had

161
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,260
a coefficient of variation of 0.31.

162
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,580
But instead of daily demand, because maybe

163
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,290
I don't need daily demand.

164
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,520
What about weekly demand?

165
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,240
So if I aggregate by week, and what I did is I took the data,

166
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,530
and saw how the demand differed week to week.

167
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,900
And you can see that the coefficient of variation

168
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,630
goes down.

169
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,390
And then if I say, well forget week,

170
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,110
I can do with his monthly.

171
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,857
Maybe I want monthly forecast.

172
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:02,690
And you can see the coefficient of variation

173
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,730
goes down even further to 0.06.

174
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,760
Now you might say well, yeah it goes down relatively,

175
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,490
but look at it, it's 21,000 units here,

176
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,310
and here it's only 6,000 or 5458,

177
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,110
so it's a higher absolute amount.

178
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,790
But what we care about is the volatility.

179
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,600
The relative volatility.

180
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,330
So by aggregating from daily to weekly to monthly,

181
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,210
my forecast accuracy will go up.

182
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,940
Your longer range forecasts will always be more accurate.

183
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,520
Because you again, you're balancing out,

184
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,350
and you're smoothing out over a longer period of time.

185
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,470
In practice though you need to make sure that the time bucket

186
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,930
that you use, whether it's your daily, weekly, or monthly,

187
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,900
we need to make sure that it matches what your situation is.

188
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,290
I remember doing a project several years ago,

189
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,320
where a manufacturer was dealing with a retailer.

190
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,140
And the manufacturer dealt on weekly time buckets,

191
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,650
and the retailer dealt in monthly.

192
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,487
And so they had to divide their product.

193
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,570
And so what they would say, they take their demand

194
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,322
from the retailer and they divide it by 4.

195
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,780
So they would assume that there was

196
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,800
equal distribution in each of the weeks.

197
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,080
And so you need to make sure that your time buckets match

198
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,210
with your different members of your supply chain.

199
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,030
But you want to make your forecasting match that.

200
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,650
So if I can only order lids once a month perhaps.

201
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,290
Then why do I want to manage it with a daily demand.

202
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,830
Maybe I'm OK with managing it at a monthly level.

203
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,830
So you want to make it match the situation.

204
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,351
We'll talk more about that later on.

205
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,809
The third area I want to talk about for aggregation though,

206
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,475
is by location.

207
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:43,100
And so what we have here, let's suppose

208
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,860
we have three sandwich shops now.

209
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,000
And we said that the weekly demand for that common lid,

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,590
remember this hasn't changed, CV of 0.12--

211
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,340
again this is the weekly demand, so it's not daily anymore.

212
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,269
I kept it weekly.

213
00:08:58,269 --> 00:08:59,310
It doesn't really matter.

214
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,150
The same effect would happen if I do daily or monthly.

215
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,880
And so there are my three stores.

216
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,550
And so if I wanted to manage the lids separately at each,

217
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,040
you would see the CV would be 0.12.

218
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,890
But if I combined to this central,

219
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,190
this common Distribution Center here, then my weekly demand

220
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,970
would actually drop.

221
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,980
Or the CV would drop to 0.07.

222
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,740
Why?

223
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,840
Well it's the same thing as aggregating over SKUs,

224
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,450
or aggregated over time.

225
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,440
What I'm doing now is I'm combining

226
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,235
the variability of these three distinct stores,

227
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:33,860
and they're going to offset each other.

228
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,560
Because I'm assuming that they're independent.

229
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,610
So the coefficient of variation is

230
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,330
reduced as we aggregate SKUs over time,

231
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,290
over SKUs, or over locations.

232
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,690
And we can capture this mathematically.

233
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,860
If we assume that each of the individual stores or it

234
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,030
could be to the individual SKUs or each

235
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,910
of the individual weeks.

236
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,080
If they have the same distribution,

237
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,450
that's the CV of the individual, whether it's

238
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,430
a SKU, a time, or a location.

239
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,120
Then if I aggregate them, if I aggregate n of them,

240
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,890
then we can see that the mean increases what,

241
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,780
by a factor of n.

242
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,770
So if I go from one to two, and this two, my mean doubles.

243
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,480
If I go from one to three, my mean triples.

244
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,240
Because it's the sum of all three of them.

245
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,590
The standard deviation though increases at a slower rate.

246
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,500
It increases at square root of n.

247
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,260
Because it's the sum of the variances.

248
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,080
So therefore, it's a square root of n

249
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,050
for the standard deviation.

250
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,420
So by looking at that, and just cleaning it up,

251
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,040
carry through the square root of n,

252
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,420
we get this great relationship.

253
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,060
That if I have an aggregated CV, it's

254
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,850
going to be equal to the individual coefficient

255
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,170
of variations of each of the individual locations, or SKUs,

256
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,940
or times divided by the square root of n, where

257
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,850
n is the number of ones that I'm aggregating.
