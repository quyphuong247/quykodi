1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,570
OK.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,220
So let's look at how we normalize seasonality indices.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,860
So remember from our example, we just estimated the seasonality

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,210
for the next Monday, time period 105,

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,260
and it came out to be 0.506.

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,660
I expanded all the indices out to three decimal places

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,920
just to make it a little easier.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,750
You noticed that previously, our sum was to five,

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,280
because it added to P. Now, my most recent ones don't.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,490
They add up to 5.006.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,520
So I'm a little high.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,970
What does that mean?

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,630
Well, what happens if I ignore this?

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,130
So what?

15
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,250
0.006, that's no big deal.

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,250
Who cares?

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,230
Well, what's going to happen over time

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,600
is that it's going to keep building up.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,580
And so at some point, it's not going to sum up to P.

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,372
It's not going to average out to one.

21
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:52,080
That means I'm going to introduce a bias.

22
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,080
In this case if it keeps creeping up,

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,680
it'll be a positive bias, but it could just as easily

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,200
be a negative bias.

25
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,900
But you can't ignore it, because it'll keep building over time.

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,230
You always need to update your parameters.

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,670
So what we need to do is update or normalize them.

28
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,400
So what are we going to do?

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,270
Well, we have our old factors, so the next factor

30
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,670
I'm going to use is going to be Tuesdays.

31
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,940
This 0.750.

32
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,250
So how am I going to modify that?

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,640
Well, I take the old values, and when I multiply them by P,

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,710
in this case, remember that's five, divided

35
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,880
by the sum of the old, which is what we just did.

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,770
And that's 5.006-- 5.006.

37
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,080
So that's going to be a number slightly less than 1.

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,170
So what does this mean?

39
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,930
I'm going to multiply them all, each of these seasonality

40
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,420
factors by that number.

41
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,270
I'm normalizing it.

42
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,640
And what will that do?

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,920
That'll make the sum go back to 5.

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,110
So if I look at all of these.

45
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,230
These are my old ones, the ones I currently

46
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,520
did to include the new Monday one that I just estimated,

47
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,820
then I modify them by the p over some of the old seasonality

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,949
indexes or 5 over 5.006, and I got this.

49
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,845
So each one is reduced by about 0.001.

50
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:14,470
So I know it's a little bit of rounding

51
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,710
in there at the third decimal place, but the sum is 5.

52
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,240
So I'm evened out again.

53
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,740
I sum up to P, the number of periods, I average to 1.

54
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,420
I'm not introducing any bias anymore.

55
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,560
So this is a pain to do in spreadsheets to be honest.

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,470
It's a lot of bookkeeping.

57
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,880
So it's tricky to maintain this in a spreadsheet,

58
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,540
but it's important to know that this has to happen.

59
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,280
So if you're using a more sophisticated tool,

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,900
you should understand what happens to these seasonality

61
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,110
factors and how they update them and just make sure

62
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,350
that it's being done.

63
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,760
And you can always check and see,

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,400
are the seasonality factors drifting?

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,010
So this is just to make sure you understand the bookkeeping

66
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,750
and understand how the updating process needs to go.
