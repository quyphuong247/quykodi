1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,030
In this lesson, we want to look at the cost involved

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,030
with managing inventory, and we'll

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,100
use these to develop a total cost equation.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,180
So I want to focus in on what's known as the relevant costs,

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,400
and these are the costs that are critical to the decision being

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,720
made and are things that are controllable by us.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,330
But I'll explain more about that in a second.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,790
There are four basic components to this total cost,

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,040
or this total relevant costs, and the four stated components

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,050
are first, the purchase price.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,540
That's the unit value, the cost per item when I buy it.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,800
Then the next is the ordering cost,

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,030
and this is also known as the set up cost.

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,090
This is the cost it takes to actually place an order.

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,620
Then there's the holding cost, and this is also

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,990
known as the carrying cost.

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,830
And it's the cost that it takes me to actually hold inventory,

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,210
not the value of the inventory itself,

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,630
but the cost that it takes to actually keep

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,535
that inventory there.

21
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:57,660
And we'll talk more about each of these, of course,

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,540
in a second.

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,630
And the final category is the shortage cost.

24
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,800
And these are the costs that are incurred if I stock out

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,680
or if I don't have enough demand-- or supply, rather,

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,410
to satisfy demand.

27
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,730
And so, we'll look at each of these,

28
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,610
and we'll also talk about what makes each of these costs

29
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,070
relevant to the decision we're making.

30
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,950
And again, the key dimensions of this

31
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,260
are one, if it's controllable by us, the decision maker,

32
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,676
and if it actually applies to the decision being made.

33
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:28,550
Before we dive into the details, because I'll

34
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,383
talk about each one of these four components

35
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:34,240
in greater detail, I want to make a note about nomenclature.

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,080
Unfortunately, textbooks in this area,

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,900
whether it's in logistics, inventory management, or supply

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,070
chain management, they differ in the nomenclature

39
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,840
they use to describe these costs as well as many other factors

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,070
within the supply chain space.

41
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,240
So just brace yourself for that.

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,940
I try to use nomenclature that is common with most

43
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,470
of the sources, but there is no one set of common nomenclature.

44
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,130
People use different variables for the purchase price,

45
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,780
the order price, the holding cost,

46
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,155
and all those different things.

47
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:06,030
So let's get started.

48
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,570
Let's talk about the first category, the purchase cost.

49
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,325
We're going to use the variable c here to annotate this.

50
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:14,700
And the units are going to be dollars per item or dollars

51
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,890
per unit.

52
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,510
And you can think of what this contains.

53
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,100
It's the total cost for acquiring the product.

54
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,210
And it's the variable cost, so this

55
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,420
is a variable with respect to the quantity.

56
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,310
It's the dollars per unit, per item, not a fixed cost.

57
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,730
So how do we determine this?

58
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,650
Well it depends.

59
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,960
If I'm buying it, this product, from some vendor,

60
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,820
from some third party, it'll be that purchase price, the amount

61
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,800
it costs for me to have that delivered to my location.

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,810
If I'm making it myself, it's more

63
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,674
of a transfer cost, a manufacturing cost,

64
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:50,840
then it's a little trickier.

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,550
I have to engineer that and figure out

66
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,120
what that fully loaded cost is.

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,510
That takes a little more work to find out

68
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,840
what that cost would be.

69
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,010
And when is it relevant?

70
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,290
Well, the purchase price is relevant

71
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,010
if the purchase price differs with the amount or the quantity

72
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,080
that I buy or it changes based on the timing that I make that.

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,860
And so this becomes more important a little later.

74
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,360
But the idea of the relevance is when this cost, the purchase

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,981
cost, becomes relevant to the decision we're trying to make.

76
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:20,480
OK.

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,900
The next category of cost is the ordering costs.

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,980
And we're going to use c sub t for this,

79
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,180
for the transactional cost, and the units

80
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,830
are dollars per order.

81
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,750
So whether I order 10 or 100 or 200 of an item,

82
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,560
this is that fixed cost per that order.

83
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,490
It doesn't change with respect to the volume being ordered.

84
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,300
So what does this contain?

85
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,870
It's all those costs that it takes to place an order,

86
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,470
to receive it, and to process that order.

87
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,670
It's all the processing activities, the invoicing,

88
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,370
auditing, the labor it takes to do

89
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,270
that-- all the different costs it takes to place an order.

90
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,880
In manufacturing, this is known as the set up cost

91
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,070
for a run, how much time and what the cost is

92
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,520
to get a machine ready to go to make a run of a certain item.

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,030
So how do we determine this number?

94
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,270
Well, it's a little tricky.

95
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,210
It's not as easy as the purchase price, which

96
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,917
is pretty clear and easy to measure.

97
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,625
Sometimes I have to do workflow analysis.

98
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,339
I have to try to engineer what this cost is.

99
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,540
One way that is common is I look over

100
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,450
the course of, say, six months to a year,

101
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,720
and I sum up all the administrative and other costs

102
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,865
like the labor costs and divide by the total orders that

103
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:34,330
are processed with those total costs.

104
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,330
And then, as you can see, it's sometimes a tricky number

105
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,290
to get.

106
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,580
What is that order or fixed set up cost?

107
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,260
But you need it and it's relevant whenever it exists

108
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,235
and it's nontrivial.

109
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:49,350
And we'll talk more about that in a little while.

110
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,420
The third category, though, is the holding costs.

111
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,610
And these are the costs that are incurred by having inventory

112
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,670
on hand, not necessarily the total cost

113
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,400
of the inventory, because I've already

114
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,540
paid for that with that purchase price, the first term we talked

115
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,720
about, this is the cost that is incurred by actually having

116
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,850
the inventory hanging around.

117
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,170
So we look at c which is. remember, the unit price

118
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,280
for the purchase and I use this h, which you can think

119
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,050
of as the holding ratio.

120
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,670
And this is essentially a percentage over time,

121
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,270
so I might have something that the holding cost is

122
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,490
25% per year, and so then the holding or carrying costs,

123
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,820
which we're going to use as c_e, is

124
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,660
going to be the price of the item times that h,

125
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,770
or that percentage, and that gives me

126
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,040
the cost per unit per time.

127
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,760
And so what does this contain?

128
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,580
This contains a lot of things.

129
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,950
It's all those costs that are required to hold inventory.

130
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,890
So it could be the storage cost if I have a warehouse.

131
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,249
It might be the amount of space I need.

132
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:53,790
If something takes up a lot of space,

133
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,040
it's going to cost me more.

134
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,740
So I might think, if it's storage,

135
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,650
that I want to actually have it as dollars

136
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,700
per square foot of each item.

137
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,180
Then you can think of this whole service costs.

138
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,250
And these are insurance, taxes.

139
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,650
And here I think, well, maybe, the holding cost of this

140
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,520
will increase as the value of the product increases.

141
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,190
And then you have risk costs, where maybe an item gets

142
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,090
lost, stolen-- we call that shrinkage-- damage,

143
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,104
goes obsolete, it perishes for whatever reason.

144
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,020
And for there, I might think, well, maybe it's

145
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,140
just dollar per item.

146
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,290
And then the fourth category is the capital cost,

147
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,870
because every dollar I put in holding inventory

148
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,420
is the dollar I'm not using somewhere else.

149
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,690
So you can think of it as an investment.

150
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,630
And so, in this case, you can think of it

151
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,690
as a dollar-for-dollar inventory or the cost of capital.

152
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,690
Sometimes it's known as a hurdle rate,

153
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,070
that a company needs to have their investment be

154
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,540
above a certain rate of return in order to justify it.

155
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,950
So out of all these different terms,

156
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,690
you also have different units.

157
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,810
And why do we end up with just doing it dollar per unit time?

158
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,820
Well what we find is this number is typically given to you.

159
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,180
It's set by management.

160
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,600
And as we'll see later on, this is really

161
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,580
a lever that is used to see how much the company values

162
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,870
having inventory.

163
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,370
And so it's usually set by management,

164
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,230
but it's worth seeing if some of these secondary aspects,

165
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,440
the warehousing space or these other things dominate,

166
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,830
because typically what happens is this hurdle rate

167
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,820
or this cost of capital dominates the other factors.

168
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,420
So that's why we kind of use those units.

169
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,360
And so at the end of the day, the holding cost

170
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,500
is essentially that variable cost per item

171
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,400
that it costs me to have that item

172
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,300
for a certain length of time.

173
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,590
And this is relevant whenever I'm holding inventory

174
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,330
for any period of time.

175
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,120
So that's carrying cost or the holding cost.

176
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,200
Let me go into the last or the fourth category,

177
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,280
and these are shortage or stock-out costs.

178
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,500
And we're going to use c sub s for shortage or stock-out.

179
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,280
And the units here-- again these are

180
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,600
tough because they could be many different things.

181
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,640
It depends how I think my costs accrue.

182
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,630
So it could be dollar per unit, so every item that I'm short,

183
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,130
I'm going to be charged a certain amount.

184
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,250
It could be dollar per unit per time.

185
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,100
So maybe if I'm short something, but I'm

186
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,747
only stocked-out for a week versus a month, that's

187
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:19,830
going to cost differently.

188
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,850
So maybe it's the period of time.

189
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,430
Or sometimes, if it doesn't matter how many I stock-out,

190
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,770
but if I get an order in and if anything

191
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,850
is short from what I ordered, I incurred cost.

192
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,409
So there's many different ways to measure stock-out costs

193
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,970
or shortage costs.

194
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,440
And so what does it contain?

195
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,980
Well, a bunch of different things.

196
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,809
It depends on how I want to look at it.

197
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,460
For backorders, these are those items

198
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,790
where customers will wait to get them.

199
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,130
So think of high-end smart phones.

200
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,700
When the new ones come on, or when books get launched,

201
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,251
instead of being published, people will sign up for them

202
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,750
and they will order them and they'll

203
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,900
be on backorder until the product actually arrives.

204
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,630
That's one case.

205
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,080
Another case is you have this lost sales, where

206
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,960
the customer will just go somewhere else.

207
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,400
So if you don't have the toothpaste they're looking for,

208
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
they'll just go down the street to another store

209
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,520
and buy it there.

210
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,020
Then there's another cost that could

211
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,910
occur where the customer goes away and goes away forever.

212
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,390
They get fed up with you not having the product they want,

213
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,070
so they end up going somewhere else and forever.

214
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,110
It's not just that individual sale you lose,

215
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,850
it's that whole stream of revenue

216
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,162
from that one customer forever and ever.

217
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:32,120
And then finally it could be a disruption cost,

218
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,170
where it holds up the production line.

219
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,720
So there could be costs not just for the lost time

220
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,950
and labor for those people working on the line.

221
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,960
If you have a product that's feeding into a line

222
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,520
and it's not there, the whole line might have to go down,

223
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,490
but also maybe incurred cost for bringing it back up on line.

224
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,970
And so this can be a very huge cost in some manufacturing

225
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,000
situations.

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,090
So you have all these different types of costs,

227
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,680
so this is a really squishy and hard number to get.

228
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,360
And so one way you can do it is you engineer the cost

229
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,490
and you try to figure out, OK, if I'm short,

230
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,190
here's exactly what happens.

231
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,940
And there's a lot of studies to try to look at this.

232
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,330
Typically what people do, what most companies do,

233
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,600
is they assume some service level.

234
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,655
They say I want to make sure I don't stock out more than,

235
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:22,910
I don't know, 1% of the time for order cycles.

236
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,030
Or my fill rate has to be a certain amount.

237
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,710
And so you set a service level, and as we'll show later on,

238
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,590
that implicitly determines what your cost of a stock-out is.

239
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,920
But costs of stock-out are a very tricky thing

240
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,340
to do because it's based on the consumer or the customer's

241
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,360
behavior.

242
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,910
And so you can't really put the price on it

243
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,160
unless you know what their behavior's going to be.

244
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,330
And when is it relevant?

245
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,380
Whenever there's uncertainty in demand,

246
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,160
replenishment time, anything where you could potentially

247
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,970
stock-out.

248
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,860
So these are the total relevant costs,

249
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,790
and the next step is to use these

250
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,370
to develop different models for inventory policy

251
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,320
that we'll now use to develop the different policies

252
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,940
that we'll be playing with for the rest of the course.

253
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,962
