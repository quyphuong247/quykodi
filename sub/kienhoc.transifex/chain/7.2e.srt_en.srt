1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,910
OK, let's put it all together now and solve the NFL Jersey

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,140
problem.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,750
Remember our situation here: We're

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,530
selling NFL replica jerseys.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,970
We have an eight week period where we can sell them.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,600
The expected demand during that time

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,400
is Normally distributed with a mean of 32,000

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,740
and a standard deviation of 11,000.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,300
I buy the jerseys for $10.90 each.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,860
I sell them for $24 a jersey.

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,660
And I want to know how many units to buy.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,720
We looked at two different cases and the cases

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,840
differed whether I assumed a Salvage Value of 0

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,550
or Salvage Value of $7 a jersey.

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,905
In each case, the Critical Ratio was determined by the price

16
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:48,880
minus the cost over the price minus that salvage value g And

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,680
so we found what the Q* would be.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,570
And as expected, if I have a Salvage Value,

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,820
my Q is going to be bigger.

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,570
In this case, it's 40,149 compared

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,200
to 33,267 without that Salvage Value.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,970
OK, so what is the expected profit for each case?

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,310
So we're going to use this expected profit equation

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,640
that we were just talking about.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,620
And here it is: and there are three terms for this,

26
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,300
and so let's calculate each of the terms for each

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,850
of the cases.

28
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,330
So this first term is just the expected demand, the EE[x],

29
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,630
expected demand over that period.

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,590
And you notice that it's the same for each of the two cases,

31
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,490
because how much I order the Salvage Value doesn't

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,460
change the demand over that time.

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,360
And the only difference is what I multiply it by: p minus g;

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,530
24 minus 0 for case one, 24 minus 7, or 17, for case two.

35
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,640
And you can see I get $768,000 for case one

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,720
and $544,000 for case two.

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,100
OK, let's go to the second term.

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,500
And now this differs for each of the two cases

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,530
because the Q's differ.

40
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,130
And I'm going to multiply each of them

41
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,410
by c minus its corresponding g.

42
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:09,046
And you can see the values I get, $362,610 for case one,

43
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:13,490
$156,581 for case two.

44
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,380
Now let's get to the third term and for this,

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,990
we're going to have to focus in on this expected units short.

46
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,310
So we're going to use this unit Normal loss

47
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,730
function, this G(k), to find the expected units short because we

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,930
have a Normal distribution.

49
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,630
So let's focus a little more into that.

50
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,880
So we're going to be looking at this third term.

51
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,660
And how are we going to find this expected units short?

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,820
We're going to transform our Demand Distribution

53
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,750
into a standard unit Normal by subtracting off the mean

54
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,140
and dividing by the standard deviation.

55
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,180
We're going to look up and calculate the G(k) for that k

56
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,750
that we just determined.

57
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,660
We're going to multiply that G(k)

58
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,700
times the standard deviation of our demand to transform it back

59
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,444
into units for our distribution.

60
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,110
And then we're just going to multiply it

61
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,100
by this term to find the value of the third term

62
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,920
of the profitability equation.

63
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,370
So for the first case, we know the Q* is 33,267.

64
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,240
We can find the k, just a straight transformation.

65
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,890
Take that 33,267, subtract off the mu,

66
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,350
or the mean of the Normal distribution divided

67
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,860
by the standard deviation.

68
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,170
I get 0.115.

69
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,430
I can calculate in a spreadsheet what

70
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,270
that means in terms of the G(k).

71
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,270
It'll give me a G(k) of 0.3441.

72
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,300
Check the math.

73
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,810
Play along at home.

74
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,620
But let's also look at the standard Normal table,

75
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,160
because this will make us do some interpolation, something

76
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,530
that people don't do as much these days.

77
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,070
So here's my table: You should be very familiar with this.

78
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:51,380
I've got a k of 0.115, so I want to find my G(0.115).

79
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,740
And I know it's going to fall between these two values.

80
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,290
And so what do I do?

81
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,680
Well, I know that the k, 0.115, is

82
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,350
right in the middle between 0.11 and 0.12.

83
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,840
So I can probably find the G(k) that's

84
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,600
right in the middle of these two values, the 0.3464

85
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,670
and the 0.3418.

86
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,890
So this is interpolating.

87
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,700
I take half that distance and it's going to be 0.023

88
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,160
and then I can either add that to the 0.3418

89
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,020
or subtract it off of the 0.3464.

90
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,530
And so I'm just going to add it onto the lower one.

91
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,760
And I get 0.3441, which is the same thing

92
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,230
I got by using the formula in a spreadsheet.

93
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,160
OK, so I have my G(k).

94
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,720
The next step is to find my expected units short.

95
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,950
And now I'm just transforming it back

96
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,260
into my distribution instead of the unit Normal distribution.

97
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,370
So I'm multiplying it by my sigma, my standard deviation

98
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,540
of the demand.

99
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,850
And so it's telling me I can expect

100
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,980
to be short 3,785 jerseys each eight week

101
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,490
planning sales period.

102
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:05,140
So multiplying it by this (p-g+B) term gives me 90,840.

103
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,600
So case two, with my higher Q* , with my Salvage Value of $7

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,550
a jersey.

105
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,450
Follow the exact same steps and you

106
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,400
can see what it goes down to.

107
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,480
Check the math at home.

108
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,980
Make sure you come up with my same numbers.

109
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,880
And again, for finding your G(k),

110
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,680
you can use either a table or you can use a spreadsheet.

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,150
So let's put it all together.

112
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,140
Here's my expected profit equation with the three terms

113
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,830
that we just talked about and I calculated them

114
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,890
both for the case where I have no Salvage

115
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,550
Value and the case where my Salvage Value was $7 a jersey.

116
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,860
And then here in the last column,

117
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,640
you see what the expected profit is.

118
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,060
And that's simply the sum of the first term

119
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,900
minus the second and third terms.

120
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,060
So what you should notice here is

121
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,130
that the profitability for the second case where

122
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,270
I have a Salvage Value of $7 a jersey is about $50,000

123
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,780
more than the expected profit when I don't have that.

124
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,960
That seems to make sense, but let's look a little deeper

125
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,130
and let's expand this profit equation,

126
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,980
as I had done previously, into these four terms.

127
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,510
And so this term that I'm highlighting,

128
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:22,300
the EE{x}-E[US] is actually the expected units that I sell

129
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,630
at the full price.

130
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,290
This term that I'm highlighting here,

131
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:36,440
the Q-EQ-E{x}-E[US] is the expected number of units I sell

132
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,070
at a discount.

133
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,530
What's interesting is, as I add a Salvage Value of $7 a unit,

134
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,964
notice the expected demand doesn't change, right?

135
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:47,130
Because that doesn't change.

136
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,800
But what changes is the amount that I order.

137
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,490
And as I order more, not only will I

138
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,375
be able to sell some at discount, 9,614 jerseys more

139
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,150
at discount than I would have at the case

140
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,610
where I don't allow it, but the amount

141
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,610
that I sell at full price goes up

142
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,600
by a little over 2,000 jerseys.

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,490
So by having the Salvage Value, what does that do?

144
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,760
That increases my Q because the downside

145
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,270
is much lower for having more inventory.

146
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,450
So having excess inventory doesn't cost me as much,

147
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,400
so therefore I'm going to order a little more.

148
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,260
If I order a little more, then I'm

149
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,120
going to be able to capture more of that demand

150
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,500
that I'll be able to sell at full price.

151
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,100
So having Salvage Value, not only does that

152
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,640
increase the number of units I can

153
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,310
sell at a discount at that Salvage Value of $7 per jersey,

154
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,390
it also increases the amount of demand

155
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,170
that I capture for selling at that full price.
