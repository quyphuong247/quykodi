1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,010
So, part three-- suppose demand is instead uniformly

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,370
distributed with mean 0 and max 300.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,270
What is the optimal order quantity?

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,670
So in the previous problem, we thought

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,094
that the demand distribution was normally distributed

6
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:21,260
looking something like this.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,280
So we thought that different outcomes

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,200
had different probabilities.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,370
Now we're saying this is not the case.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,810
Instead, we think that demand, as long as it's anywhere

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,850
between 0 and 300, any the outcome is equally probable.

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,440
So it could be 52.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,730
It could be 159.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,570
It could be 3.

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,740
Any outcome between 0 and 300 are equally probable.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,410
This is what we're saying.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,210
So the question is-- we're changing this assumption,

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:52,710
right?

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,110
So how does this change in assumption impact our solution?

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,350
Well, remember from the previous problem

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,850
where it said that the solution that we have,

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,310
Q star equal to the inverse at a critical ratio, which

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,700
we found to be 0.6.

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,370
This solution is independent of the distribution.

25
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,550
So this was the first time-- once we

26
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,370
started evaluating this, that was

27
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,110
the first time that the distribution came

28
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,440
into the picture at all.

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,650
Before that, we just looked at calculus

30
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,900
without thinking about which type of distribution

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,960
we were looking at.

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,970
It was not until we used a spreadsheet software of choice

33
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,530
that we really had to evaluate using a specific distribution.

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,950
And in the previous exercise, that distribution

35
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,730
was a normal distribution.

36
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,470
Now, we're looking at a uniform distribution.

37
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,860
So really, this is still the optimal solution.

38
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,420
The only thing that's changed is this f.

39
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,840
So let's think about this f, the cumulative distribution

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,350
function for uniform distribution.

41
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,550
If we think of it in a general form,

42
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,920
it can be written like this.

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,290
x minus a divided by b minus a.

44
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,240
a will be the minimum and b is the maximum.

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,630
So really, what it's saying in our case

46
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,330
is that the cumulative distribution

47
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,600
function is equal to x minus 0 divided by 300 minus 0.

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,860
So really, x divided by 300.

49
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,620
So this is our cumulative distribution function.

50
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,000
We can show it graphically like this.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,180
If we have x on the x-axis and we have the cumulative

52
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,610
on the y-axis, we know it's going to go between 0 and 1.

53
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,150
And down here, there's going to be no probability of any event

54
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,470
until we reach 0.

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,270
Once we reach 0, there's going to be

56
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,041
equal probability of all outcomes until we reach 300.

57
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,040
And after that, we reached our full probability,

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,200
because there's no probability of anything above 300.

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,900
We want to take the inverse.

60
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,650
So we have some kind of critical ratio, 0.6.

61
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:01,090
We want to take the inverse and see what Q star we end up with.

62
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,200
We know that the expression for this cumulative distribution

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,530
function is given by this, in our case.

64
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,100
So really, now we want to use this information in order

65
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,020
to find Q star.

66
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,600
So since Q star is equal to the inverse at 0.6,

67
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,580
it really means that f of Q star is equal to 0.6.

68
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,620
That's the same thing.

69
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,730
We know that f of q star, that is what we have over here.

70
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,230
We just plug in q star divided by 300 is equal to 0.6.

71
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,680
So what does that give us?

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,660
It gives us that the optimal order quantity, q star,

73
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,760
is equal to 180.

74
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,560
That's our solution.
