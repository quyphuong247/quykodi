https://youtu.be/PcILSUry7Bk

1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,800
So demand for most products happens over time.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,340
So naturally, we can think of demand forecasting

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,320
using time series analysis.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,920
And remember, what we're doing here is looking for patterns.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,400
So one of the best ways to look for patterns

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,530
is, because we're all human, is visualization tools.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,400
And so as I said before, the best thing you can do with data

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,060
is to map it out, graph it.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,840
Because visually, we can pick things

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,220
up much faster lot of times then a computer can pick up a trend.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,710
So what I'm showing here is sales

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,430
by month for a low cost food item.

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,030
And it's for North American Demand.

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,010
So on my horizontal axis is the time

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,210
from December, 2009 all the way up to fall just

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,840
before, I think goes to November, 2012.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,940
So about three years worth of data here.

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,900
And on the vertical axis is the number of units sold.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,720
And you can see it peaks to just over 11 million

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,480
up here in the summer of 2012.

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,810
So if you look at this, you see an obvious trend.

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,640
You see some kind of seasons-- it looks like during the summer

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,200
I might have some peak times right here in the summer,

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,560
here in the summer, here in the summer.

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,570
And conversely, it's kind of low in the winter.

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,440
So you can kind of see that there's some kind of patterns

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,910
here, some kind of seasonality.

28
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,360
And just because these follow this season, summer and winter,

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,670
seasonality isn't just restricted

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,852
to the four seasons of the year.

31
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,060
But let's go a little deeper.

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,730
Let's look at it now by week.

33
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,770
And so all that I've done is broken up and each point,

34
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,710
it's connected by a line, but each point

35
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,570
is the amount of sales nationally per week.

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,470
And you see there's even more volatility

37
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,180
and you would expect this because I'm disaggregating.

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,960
Remember in our last lesson, we talked about how you aggregate,

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,990
it kind of smooths things over.

40
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,260
Well as I disaggregate, you see the volatility.

41
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,090
And then even more so if I go by day.

42
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,210
And so not only do we see this seasonality-- let me just

43
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,320
highlight it over the course of a year, this is three years--

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,160
but you can also see that there's some kind of volatility

45
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,470
or seasonality maybe within a week,

46
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,670
that there seems to be a weekly pattern.

47
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,830
And this is something we can explore further.

48
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,630
But the point here, using visualization tools really

49
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,010
helps you spot something quickly,

50
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,480
and especially for patterns.

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,807
So if I break this into a bar chart, this is the same data.

52
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,390
And what I've done here is I've broken

53
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,110
into four quarters; Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.

54
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,850
And you can see the months that fall

55
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,460
with that and then the total units sold.

56
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,420
Looking at this, it's obvious there's some kind of pattern.

57
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,000
We sell a lot in the summer, spring and summer months,

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,730
in this time.

59
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,850
And we don't sell too much here and a little bit

60
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,284
in the early spring, late winter, a little bit more.

61
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:46,700
But you can see there's definitely

62
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,970
seasonal differences here.

63
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,470
But also as we said earlier, there

64
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,740
seems to be some seasonality here within the week.

65
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,400
So if I look at day of week, and all I

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,370
did was classify all the sales on a Monday, Tuesday,

67
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,840
Wednesday, and so forth, obviously the weekends

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,720
they don't do much.

69
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,510
Because this data is actually not at the retail store,

70
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,800
it's what is shipped out to the retail stores

71
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,770
from the manufacturing plant.

72
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,240
So you can see that there's definitely

73
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,900
very little demand on the weekends.

74
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,640
In fact, you could probably just knock those out.

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,570
But then you could see that on Friday there's

76
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,290
much lower demand then on a Monday or a Tuesday.

77
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,050
So there is seasonality both across the year by month

78
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,450
or quarter and within the week.

79
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,170
So this is very important because we

80
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,190
can use this to forecast.

81
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,600
Because the whole purpose of looking at patterns in the past

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,910
is to see how they'll project to the future.

83
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,650
So here's my same data.

84
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,860
And remember, this is just the past three years.

85
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,280
We're assuming I'm in November, 2012,

86
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,150
and what I want to figure out is what does the future look like?

87
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,020
What is it going to look like, because I

88
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,940
want to use my patterns in the past, the seasonality,

89
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,150
to predict and estimate what my pattern will be in the future.

90
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,730
Two things I want to point out.

91
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,120
First, notice that there's a range here.

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,710
Remember how we talked about how the importance of a range.

93
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,266
It's a very big range, but still, it

94
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,140
gives you an idea of the level of confidence.

95
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,450
You should always try to include that in a forecast.

96
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,829
The other thing is-- and this is just a very quick estimation

97
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,160
that was done-- is that they're estimating, with this model,

98
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,260
that in the spring and summer of 2013,

99
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,780
it's not going to be as high of a peak as here in summer of 12.

100
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,690
You can see it kind of levels out,

101
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,720
it's kind of taking not quite the average,

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,510
but it's balancing between those two.

103
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,400
And we'll talk more about that.

104
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,080
Because what this forecast is saying,

105
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,820
is that yes, this peak in 2012, it was there,

106
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,350
but it doesn't mean that I'm going

107
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,240
to go up to here in the next time.

108
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,820
So you can see here that the forecast,

109
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,410
and we'll see this more and more when we go into time series,

110
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,940
is bouncing off new information with some

111
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,890
of the old information.

112
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,980
So what will we talk about in this lecture?

113
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,276
Well, we're going to talk about time series components,

114
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:06,150
those patterns we're going to be looking for.

115
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,525
Then we're going to talk about three types of forecasting

116
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:12,200
methods; cumulative forecast, naive forecast, and moving

117
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,440
average forecast.

118
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,200
This kind of sets the stage for all the other forecasting

119
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,140
methods that we're going to work with.

120
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,040
So let's get started.
