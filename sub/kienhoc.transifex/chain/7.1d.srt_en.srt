1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,240
So now let's extend what we've learned

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,970
in working with the Planned Backorder situation

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,420
with Deterministic Demand to the case where

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,070
we have Probabilistic or Stochastic Demand.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,210
And we're going to focus initially on the simplest

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,960
model, and that is the Newsvendor problem

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,070
or the Single Period Inventory Model.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,220
So let's start and look at our assumptions.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,870
So for the Single Period Models we're going to develop here,

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,920
we made a couple changes on the assumptions.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,250
The first is the demand.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,030
Instead of constant and known demand, we are now variable

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,380
and it's random.

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,950
Because we have random demand, there's

15
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,620
going to be a higher probability that I

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,920
might have excess demand.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,210
I'll be short.

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,030
So what will we do with those short cases?

19
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,260
Well, we'll have lost orders.

20
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,990
And then finally, the big change we're

21
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,520
making for this model, this Single Period,

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,710
is we're moving away from an infinite planning

23
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,840
horizon to one where it's a Single Period.

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,940
So my planning is going to be for one selling period where I

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,310
need to make a decision for how much to order ahead of time

26
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,650
and I cannot replenish within that time period.

27
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,920
So this is what's known as the Newsvendor problem.

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,910
And so let's expand on this by working through an example.

29
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,810
This example is based off of a thesis from 2004.

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,290
And what the situation is, there's

31
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,080
a company that's called Reebok, and in 2002, they

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,000
gained the sole rights to sell replica NFL jerseys.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,480
These are things, jerseys that are sold to fans in the United

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,030
States, the National Football League, or NFL,

35
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,250
is one of the most popular sports.

36
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,860
It's a professional sport; it's American football;

37
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,040
there's 32 teams; each team has about 50 players and fans

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,690
of one of these teams; they like to buy the jerseys to show

39
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,820
that they're a member of that team.

40
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,432
And so here is the picture, and this

41
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:55,930
is Tom Brady of the New England Patriots

42
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,940
and you see his jersey number 12.

43
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,790
Well, people would like to go by a number 12 New England

44
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,740
Patriots jersey with Brady written on the back.

45
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,340
All the jerseys have unique names and numbers

46
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,300
so there's a higher number of SKUs.

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,960
And the way these things are sold: there's a peak time,

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,390
and it's right at the end of summer

49
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,220
before the fall season starts, and it's about eight weeks.

50
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,780
And that's where the majority of the jerseys are sold.

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,680
Now, when they have these jerseys made,

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,180
it's made from a contract manufacturer

53
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,540
and it takes about 12 to 16 weeks

54
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,550
to complete that order because it's done overseas.

55
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,350
So, you see the problem here is that they

56
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,020
have to place an order 16 weeks out

57
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,580
and they only have an eight week period to sell.

58
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,600
So therefore, this is a Single Period Problem.

59
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,590
And so the issue is that Reebok has to commit to an order

60
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,670
to the quantity for each player for each team ahead of time

61
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,670
while the actual demand that arises during that eight week

62
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,390
selling period is totally uncertain,

63
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,010
so they can't react within the selling period.

64
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,790
If one of the jerseys starts selling really well,

65
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,480
they can't suddenly order more or vice versa.

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,940
They can't lower an order during that selling period.

67
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,580
And so the question that Reebok has

68
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,580
is, how many of these jerseys of each player should they order?

69
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,410
Now this might sound like a really specialized problem,

70
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,040
but it isn't.

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,670
This problem is very common; it's not unique.

72
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,440
It's called the Newsvendor problem because it originally

73
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,060
arose from the idea of someone who sells newspapers,

74
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,300
where every day they would go and buy

75
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,840
a certain number of newspapers from the plant

76
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,360
and sell them on the street.

77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,720
At the end of the day, any extra newspapers they had,

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,780
they would have to eat them or throw them away.

79
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,490
They couldn't sell the papers tomorrow.

80
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,080
No one wants to buy yesterday's newspaper.

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,839
And also during the day, if there

82
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,380
are more people wanting their papers,

83
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,900
they couldn't replenish.

84
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,050
So the Newsvendor problem is essentially the classic Single

85
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,820
Period Inventory Problem.

86
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,020
And the way you can classify these is any time where you

87
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,665
have a firm who has to make a bet on how much they order,

88
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:08,670
a Q*, over a certain fixed Single Period where they

89
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,520
can't be replenished and there's uncertain demand during that

90
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,740
period.

91
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,260
So let me give you some more data here for this problem.

92
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,950


93
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,800
The cost of the jersey that Reebok had to pay was about

94
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,630
$10.90.

95
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,050
They sold them to retail outlets for about $24 a jersey.

96
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,540
And they forecasted the demand over the eight weeks

97
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,350
selling period to be about 32,000 jerseys.

98
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,640
This is for Tom Brady's jerseys, with a standard deviation

99
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,510
of 11,000.

100
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,980
And they noticed that it was Normally distributed.

101
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,320
So what they wanted to do was to find the Q*, right,

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,500
the order quantity that would maximize their profit.

103
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,520
Notice this is different from everything we've done with EOQ.

104
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,930
With EOQ we're looking to minimize cost.

105
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,200
Here we're maximizing profit.

106
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,820
And what's our profit function?

107
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,070
Well, it's simply going to be this p, the purchase price,

108
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,790
times the minimum of either the amount of demand that shows up

109
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,960
or the q, the amount that I ordered.

110
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,950
I can't sell any more than I ordered

111
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,360
and I can't sell any more than what's demanded.

112
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
So the minimum of those two quantities

113
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,474
will be the amount that I can sell.

114
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:17,890
And then I'm going to subtract off

115
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,500
of that the cost times the q, which

116
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,220
is the amount of that I'm ordering.

117
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,150
Now the challenge is, we don't know

118
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,750
what this x is, it's a random variable.

119
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,250
That's the trick.

120
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,952
So how do I determine the best policy?

121
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:31,910
Well, what we're going to do in the next couple

122
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,610
videos is show two different ways.

123
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,300
I'll start off with a data table then

124
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,130
we'll go into marginal analysis.

125
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,205
So let's get started with a data table next.

126
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:40,705
