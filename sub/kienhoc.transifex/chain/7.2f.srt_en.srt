1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,050
So what are the key points from this lesson?

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,530
Well, there are two of them.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,390
And the first one is the whole idea

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,220
of being able to calculate the expected profitability.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,630
And it all rests upon a couple concepts.

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,690
The first is that we can calculate the expected units

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,480
that we're going to be able to sell.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,800
And that's calculated by looking at the expected demand

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,600
and subtracting out the expected units short.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,720
And we use that same equation when

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,350
we determine the number of units that we expect

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,400
to be sold at a Salvage Value if we allow a Salvage Value g.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,540
And the second thing is kind of tied to this.

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,570
And that's the idea of the whole expected units short.

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,760
It's usually a new concept to students,

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,500
and it's a hard one to get used to.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,124
So you should work through the problems

18
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:45,250
to make sure you get a really good understanding.

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,810
And the big thing that I think you take away is that the Loss

20
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,250
function is -- it's simply an expectation.

21
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,870
You're finding an expected value where there's --

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,090
it's a discrete case or a continuous case --

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,330
and you can tabulate the loss function for any distribution.

24
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,160
And what we did is we tabulated it for the Normal distribution.

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,600
And so we found the Unit Normal Loss

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,920
function is g_k, which we will use

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,620
a lot of in future lectures, and you

28
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,940
can calculate it using the table,

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,990
or you can use a spreadsheet.

30
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,110
So those are the two big key points,

31
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,180
but there's some even bigger takeaways

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,190
that you might not have noticed.

33
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,750
So what I have here is the demand distribution

34
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,930
for our jerseys and let's take the case

35
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:35,300
where we allowed a Salvage Value of $7 per jersey per unit.

36
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,150
And I found that my Q* here was equal to, if I'm not mistaken,

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,530
40,149.

38
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,810
So here's my demand distribution and my expected value

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,740
is 32,000 jerseys.

40
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,120
And we ordered just over 40,000.

41
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
So let me just draw that up.

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,970
This was our Q* for the case 2 that we solved.

43
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,440
And so what I can say here, is that for any demand that is

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:11,500
less than Q*, this is when the probability of my demand is

45
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,460
less than Q, any time this happens, I am in stock.

46
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,110
I have enough jerseys for the expected demand.

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,150
I'm probably not going to run out.

48
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,640
Now, to the right, when the demand is higher than Q* ,

49
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,580
this is where the probability of my demand is greater than Q.

50
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,090
And here, this is where I am stocked out.

51
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,360
I will have a stockout.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,265
And so we've calculated this, but thinking about it

53
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,620
a little more, what we've actually figured out

54
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,920
is how frequently this will happen.

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,340
Because remember, to figure this out,

56
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,340
the probability that the demand is less than Q, what is that?

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,820
That's the Critical Ratio that we determined.

58
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,380
And that is the area under this part of the probability

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,000
distribution.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,260
So we know that this was equal to 77%

61
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,570
because that was what our Critical Ratio was.

62
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,770
So we're saying that 77% of the time, I'll

63
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,660
have enough inventory.

64
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,890
What this tells us conversely, on this side of the curve,

65
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,890
this is the probability that I'm going to stock out.

66
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,570
And it's going to be equal to 1 minus this Critical Ratio

67
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:37,050
or the probability that I don't, so 1 - 0.77 in this case.

68
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,020
So it's 23%.

69
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:48,350
So by picking a Q* of 40,149, this is saying that 77%

70
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,840
of the time I'll have enough inventory.

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,770
But 23% of the time, I will stock out.

72
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,520
How many units will I expect to stock out?

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,600
That's the expected units short.

74
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,550
So what we've done is calculated two levels of service,

75
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,310
and we're going to be using these

76
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,240
in all the other inventory models that we

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,430
create in future lectures.

78
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,530
These are the two big takeaways --

79
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,490
the idea that we can now calculate the Level of Service,

80
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,740
both in terms of the probability of stocking out at all,

81
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,030
and then the expected units, number of units,

82
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,440
that I'm going to stock out.

83
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,014
OK, so that's it for this lecture.

84
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:28,180
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions,

85
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,250
I encourage you to use the discussion.
