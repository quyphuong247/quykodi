1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,100
In this lesson, I want to introduce inventory management.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,710
We're going to discuss why we hold inventory,

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,760
the purpose for having an inventory,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,120
and talk about different ways to classify it.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,860
This kind of sets the stage for how

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,820
we will develop inventory policies

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,600
in the next lecture or two.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,060
So let's get started.

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,070
First, why do we hold inventory?

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,040
There are many reasons.

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,770
Let me just go through a couple of them.

12
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,400
And now, I will use as an example, that sandwich

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,260
shop we talked about before where

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,640
I have a bunch of raw materials, whether it's lettuce, meats,

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,660
and then I bake my bread, and I combine them into sandwiches,

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,050
and I deliver those to customers who want sandwiches.

17
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,140
And so why would a sandwich shop want to hold any inventory?

18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,270
Well, one reason is to cover process time.

19
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,430
I don't want to have to bake a loaf of bread

20
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,330
every time someone orders a sandwich.

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,500
It takes too long.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,770
Longer than someone would be willing to wait

23
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,020
for a sandwich, most likely, so I will probably

24
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,190
bake this bread ahead of time.

25
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,020
And therefore, I'll have to have an inventory of baked bread

26
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,230
ready for me to use.

27
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,310
And I do that to cover the long process

28
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,940
time it takes to bake bread.

29
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,400
Another reason is to decouple processes or allow a process

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,580
to be uncoupled.

31
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,660
So in addition to baking bread, I also

32
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,170
have to have someone to slice tomatoes, maybe slice the meat,

33
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,090
in order to combine them to put onto my sandwich.

34
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,190
Well, I might want to have some inventory of sliced tomatoes

35
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,710
and sliced meat so I don't have to go to that person

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,310
to ask them to slice it every time I need it.

37
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,260
So this way, I'm uncoupled from the guy slicing

38
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,614
the tomatoes and the person who slices the meat,

39
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:35,030
and all those different processes,

40
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,410
the individual processes, that it take to make a sandwich.

41
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,150
By having inventory in between those, I decouple them.

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,290
So I can slice a bunch of them up ahead of time

43
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,980
and have them ready, and maybe use that same person

44
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,040
to slice the meat instead of doing it one at a time.

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,800
In order to make that happen, I've

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,880
got to have inventory to allow that decoupling to happen.

47
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,010
Another big group of reasons are the idea

48
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,970
of anticipation or speculation.

49
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,440
They're somewhat related.

50
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,210
Think about anticipation in my sandwich shop.

51
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,690
I know there's going to be a big surge for sandwiches

52
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,930
around lunch time, so I'm going to make

53
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,380
finished good ahead of time.

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,010
I'm going to make sandwiches in the morning, ready for when

55
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,730
that surge comes, so I don't have

56
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:21,170
to peak my processing when that peak demand comes in for lunch.

57
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,402
Speculation is a little bit different.

58
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:24,860
And the idea, here, is that I might

59
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,740
want to buy some things ahead of time

60
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,550
because I think the price of it will increase later on.

61
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,970
So I'm going to buy it now while it's low.

62
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,930
This happens a lot in commodities,

63
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,400
like copper or tin, where people will

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,790
try to buy these things ahead of time

65
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,200
before the price increases.

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,150
They're speculating that the price is going to increase.

67
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,760
Another big category is the idea of minimizing your control

68
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,470
costs.

69
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,500
Every time I place an order, that costs time and money.

70
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,220
And so, maybe, I want to figure out better ways

71
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,110
to aggregate my orders so that it costs less time

72
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,460
to control them, to place those orders.

73
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,530
And if I do that, maybe I'm only placing my orders for bread

74
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,530
every two days instead of every day, or every time

75
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,860
I need a new loaf.

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,530
Well, as I do that, I've got to have more inventory

77
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,250
to cover the time in between those deliveries.

78
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,370
So it's another reason to have inventory

79
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,560
to allow me to minimize my control costs.

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,170
And then the last big category is uncertainties.

81
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,940
If I have uncertainty, then maybe

82
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,030
I want to have a little extra inventory to buffer that.

83
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,910
So we know all about demand uncertainty

84
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,490
when we looked at forecasting.

85
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,475
I might have a predicted forecast where

86
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:34,940
I'd expect demand to be, but I know it's going to be wrong,

87
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,120
so maybe I want a little bit of extra inventory

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,530
so I don't run out.

89
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,810
Well, the same thing applies to the supply side.

90
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,280
If I have a supplier who's not that consistent,

91
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,789
maybe their delivery times are not

92
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,830
that consistent-- sometimes it comes on a Monday,

93
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,740
sometimes on a Wednesday-- then maybe I

94
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,460
want to have a little extra supply just in case

95
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,800
they run a little late, so I don't run out.

96
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,300
So just as you buffer for demand uncertainty,

97
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,556
you can also buffer supply uncertainty.

98
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,930
And then you can also think about

99
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,630
your own internal processing uncertainties.

100
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,790
Suppose that when I bake my bread,

101
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,262
every hundredth time I bake bread, I burn the batch.

102
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:13,720
So therefore, I might want to have a little extra inventory

103
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,769
in case I burn a batch of bread, so I have some standing by.

104
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,950
So all of these deal with buffering against uncertainty.

105
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,576
So these are some reasons why we hold inventory.

106
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:27,200
Now, let's look at the types of decisions we are going to make.

107
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,658
And you can really break these down

108
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:31,610
at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels.

109
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,540
Let me explain each in turn.

110
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,430
At the strategic level, these are

111
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,850
things you make a decision for a one, two,

112
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,540
three years out, your longer-term decisions.

113
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,610
These are not decisions you make every day,

114
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,410
they're longer-term decisions.

115
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,350
And they might be things, such as,

116
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,720
what are the potential alternatives for me

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
to hold inventory?

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,990
So for example, maybe I just want

119
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,240
to have very, very, very fast transportation instead

120
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,634
of having a bunch of inventory.

121
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,300
Therefore, if someone demands something,

122
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,174
I just ship it to them really quickly instead

123
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:05,580
of having extra inventory there to be able to satisfy them.

124
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,990
It's a classic trade-off, a classic alternative

125
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,570
to having inventory, something you

126
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,890
want to make it a longer-term decision.

127
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,440
Also, you might want to look at how the supply chain

128
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,790
or how the product is designed.

129
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,000
Is it designed with the supply chain in mind?

130
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
How are you going to ship things and how are you

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,870
going to store them.

132
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,960
At the tactical level-- and these

133
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,580
are decisions made within a year,

134
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,340
say, within a month, a quarter, or a year-- then

135
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,300
these are known as deployment decisions.

136
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,320
And which items specifically should I carry as inventory

137
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,100
and where should I place them?

138
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,475
This is especially important when

139
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:38,990
I'm launching a new product where

140
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,130
I want to know where they should be held.

141
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,100
And so this is in anticipation of the uncertainty

142
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,480
of what the demand will materialize.

143
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,870
Also, what form should I keep them in?

144
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,340
Maybe, if I have, say, a smartphone that I'm selling,

145
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,830
and I have different colored shells,

146
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,630
maybe I want to keep the internal components separate

147
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,870
from the different colored shells at the store

148
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,890
so I can always add them on, and so I

149
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,270
don't have pre-packaged red ones, orange ones,

150
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,430
or blue ones.

151
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,190
I want to decide at that point of purchase

152
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,290
which one to put on.

153
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,795
And in that case, I'd be storing.

154
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:16,910
I'd have inventory-- my core components and my shells,

155
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,400
and I would manage those a little separately.

156
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,640
And then the last level is what's

157
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,400
known as the operational level.

158
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,970
And these are decisions that I make

159
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,550
at the daily, weekly, monthly level.

160
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,190
And there are three big questions

161
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,710
I want to make to determine my replenishment.

162
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,820
The first is how often should I be checking my inventory

163
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,380
status?

164
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,860
Should I always be looking at it?

165
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,595
Should I only check it once a week?

166
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:40,470
Once every two weeks?

167
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,920
So how frequently should I check?

168
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Then the next question is when should I place an order?

169
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,519
How do I know when to place the order?

170
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,060
Even though I'm checking every week, do I place it every week

171
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,890
or do I wait for some trigger to happen?

172
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,620
And then the last question is how much should I order?

173
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,730
How large should my replenishment be?

174
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,080
And these three questions combined

175
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,160
determine what's known as our inventory policy.

176
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,910
And this is where we're going to focus a lot of our time

177
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,430
over the next several lessons.

178
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,410
Because these replenishment decisions

179
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,050
are critical to how a supply chain is set up.

180
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,900
OK, next I want to talk about classification of inventory.

181
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,550
Because this is a critical component

182
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,470
because different people in your organization

183
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,810
will view inventory differently.

184
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,210
The first type of classification that you see

185
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,060
are known as financial or accounting categories.

186
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,100
And if I go back to my sandwich shop,

187
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,960
if I walked into a sandwich shop,

188
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,890
I'd be able to identify what the raw materials were--

189
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,080
the tomatoes, the heads of lettuce.

190
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,390
I'd be able to identify the work in process or the components.

191
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,220
This is where they have been-- the tomatoes are sliced,

192
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,510
the bread is sliced.

193
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,550
Things are partially put together.

194
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,390
And I could point to the finished goods--

195
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,150
the sandwiches themselves.

196
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,670
Well the idea, here, is these financial categories

197
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,180
all look at the added value.

198
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,460
So as I add value to them, they change

199
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,380
into their accounting category.

200
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,320
And this makes sense for accounting

201
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,695
because this is how you're trying

202
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:05,880
to account for your costs.

203
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,900
But one thing that these accounting categories do not do

204
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,200
is they don't track opportunity costs.

205
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,980
And they really don't help determine

206
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,287
how I want to manage my inventory.

207
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,870
And that's why we're going to focus in

208
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,820
on what's known as functional roles.

209
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,910
And these functional roles are the ways

210
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,560
that inventories are used.

211
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,190
And so I'm just going to introduce three of them.

212
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,930
And I'm going to do that through the use of this inventory

213
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,430
chart.

214
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,030
And this inventory chart, we'll be seeing a lot of these.

215
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,370
On the horizontal axis is the time.

216
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,740
So this is just the passage of time.

217
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,110
And on the vertical axis-- this is just the amount of inventory

218
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,289
I have.

219
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,850
And so the first category is cycle stock.

220
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,155
And cycle stock is simply the amount of inventory

221
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:52,030
I have in between my deliveries or my replenishments.

222
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,870
This is known as the cycle.

223
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,690
Oops, that's not a very straight line.

224
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,320
But this is the cycle time.

225
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,940
So the cycle stock is all of this inventory.

226
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,690
Let me just color it in.

227
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,380
So that's the amount of my cycle stock, the amount of inventory

228
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,510
I expect to deplete over the course

229
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,670
of my replenishment cycle.

230
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,940
Now, cycle stock, you'll see, kind of sits

231
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,590
on top of what's known as safety stock.

232
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,240
Safety stock is the inventory that I

233
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,620
have that to cover or buffer against the uncertainties,

234
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,920
whether it's demand uncertainty, supply uncertainty, processing

235
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,560
uncertainty-- it doesn't matter.

236
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,490
So it's the amount of safety stock.

237
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,430
And you can see that the cycle stock

238
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,200
floats on the safety stock.

239
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,610
And then there's a third category

240
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,620
called pipeline inventory.

241
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,270
And this is the inventory where I've place the order,

242
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,800
but it hasn't arrived yet.

243
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,190
And so it's in the pipeline.

244
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,220
It's on the truck.

245
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,360
It's being processed.

246
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,750
It hasn't arrived yet.

247
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,640
And so these are the three major categories there

248
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,790
we're going to deal with.

249
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,992
How do they differ from the financial ones?

250
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:53,200
Well, like I said, we could go into the sandwich shop

251
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,310
and point to each of these, the raw materials, the WIP,

252
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,300
the components of finished goods.

253
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,700
I can't go into the sandwich shop

254
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,660
and point, oh, that tomato is cycle stock

255
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,510
and that tomato is safety stock.

256
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,050
It doesn't work that way.

257
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,020
These are the way it's used, but I can't clearly

258
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,930
tag each item to say which one they are, whether it's

259
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,200
cycle or safety, because it's how they're being used.

260
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,020
And so this is the area that we're going to use.

261
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,930
We're going to focus on these functional categories

262
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,260
because that's how we manage inventory.

263
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,240
And we're going to use what's known as a total cost equation

264
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,260
to determine policies to try to minimize our total inventory

265
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,810
cost.

266
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,811
