00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,360
In this lesson we're going to expand

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,250
our discussion of inventory models

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,940
to where we allow there to be stockouts, or shortages.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,180
We're going to eventually focus in on single period models.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,380
But initially, I want to first look back at the simple EOQ

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,600
model we developed in the last lesson,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
but this time allow a certain assumption to be loosened --

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,550
that is, that we allow planned backorders, at some cost.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,750
And this fundamental change in assumptions

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,700
will help lead us in to how we can handle uncertainty

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,780
in demand.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,837
So let's look at our list of assumptions.

13
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:35,170
And so now we want to come up with a list of assumptions

14
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,950
for planned backorders.

15
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,060
So I'm going to allow you to have backordered demand,

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,950
but it's going to be at some certain cost.

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,320
So the only assumption that we're loosening

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,270
is that there can be excess demand, because before, we

19
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,079
assumed that there would be none.

20
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,620
And we're going to assume that if there is any excess demand,

21
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,245
then we're going to assume that those orders are backordered --

22
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:59,250
that we still will deliver them.

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,230
So what we determined in the last lesson is this simple

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,375
saw-tooth diagram, and we figured out and showed ways

25
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,280
to determine Q*, the optimal order quantity,

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,190
the Economic Order Quantity, and T*,

27
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,390
which is just the order frequency.

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,310
So the question is: Is it better to do this and order

29
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,720
when our inventory level is zero, right?

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,470
When Inventory On Hand is zero, you order Q*.

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,490
Or if we allow inventory to go negative,

32
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,185
so there will be backorders, does

33
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:33,420
it make sense to order at this point?

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,900
And we're going to call this quantity b.

35
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,260
And so the idea here is that I have this amount of inventory,

36
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,000
which we know, and is treated as C_e, that excess inventory.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,890
But I'm introducing this amount, and we're

38
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,682
going to call this C_s, or the shortage cost.

39
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:55,640
And so the question we're trying to figure out,

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,120
if I allow it to go negative, and it costs me a little bit

41
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,919
to be out of stock, but does the optimal quantity make sense

42
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,460
to go negative, or is it always going

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,389
to be to make sure you always have inventory on hand?

44
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,350
And so before we dive into the math, what I want to do

45
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,270
is test your intuition.

46
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,640
So on the next question, the little problem,

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,520
I want you to answer the question:

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,860
What do you think will happen to Q* and T* if we allow

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,760
for planned backorders, at some cost,

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,580
that C_s that I talked about?
