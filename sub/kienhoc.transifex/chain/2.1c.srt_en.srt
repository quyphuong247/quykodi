1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,100
So now we're going to develop some time series models.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,470
And the two models we're going to do first,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,150
are the cumulative and naive forecasts.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,730
We'll explain why in a second.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,020
So developing any kind of time series models--

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,520
let's understand where we're going to use these.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,872
And for supply chain, the predominant use

8
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:21,490
of series analysis is for forecasting the product demand

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,450
of a mature product at the SKU level

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,200
over a short time horizon, whether that's weeks, months,

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,850
quarters, a year, where the demand of items is independent.

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,410
Critical pieces here are it's mature.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,550
That means I have history.

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,020
I have something I can use.

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,250
It's at the SKU level.

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,270
So that means it's very disaggregated.

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,230
It's a short time horizon.

18
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,060
So I'm not looking at a very long period of analysis.

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,970
And the demand for items is independent,

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,320
which means that I can model them separately.

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,215
I don't need to understand the demand of another product that

22
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:56,390
is a complement or a substitute.

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,270
Later on, we will loosen some of these assumptions

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,170
for other types of forecasting.

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,470
For example, new products-- you don't

26
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,360
have history for a new product launch.

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,990
You might want to look at a whole series of items.

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,670
You might want to look for a very long time horizon.

29
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,950
I might be looking at 5, 10 years out.

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,607
So as these things change, your model will change.

31
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,190
But for right now, we're going to stay

32
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,415
with the traditional time series model looking

33
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:25,990
at mature product, SKU level, short time

34
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,570
horizon, with independent products.

35
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,370
So we're going to be using our four main trends here-- level,

36
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,220
trend, seasonality, and error, our four patterns.

37
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,760
OK, so what's the procedure?

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,800
Straightforward.

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,400
First, you pick a model for the demand pattern over time.

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,070
You estimate and calibrate the parameters for the model.

41
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,960
You use those parameters to predict or estimate the future.

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,710
And then the critical step, step four,

43
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,200
which is often ignored in many companies,

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,860
is to review the model performance

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,620
and adjust the parameters and model accordingly.

46
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,380
These forecasts are living, so you should always

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,250
check and make sure the parameters still make sense.

48
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,730
OK, so we're going to develop two models, like I said,

49
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,520
the cumulative and the naive model.

50
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,510
And where they differ, they differ on a basic assumption.

51
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,800
And this basic assumption is how important

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,680
is the history, how much do you value the historical data.

53
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,240
And there's two extreme assumptions.

54
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,076
One is I treat them all very importantly.

55
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:27,950
And the other is, they're not that important,

56
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,390
they're not important at all.

57
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,973
And so let's start with the first one.

58
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:32,460
This is the cumulative forecast.

59
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,230
So in each of these cases, I'm looking at a level demand.

60
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,640
So you can also call this a stationary demand.

61
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,960
So we assume the only pattern here is a level.

62
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,760
And so the demand for period t, xt,

63
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,360
is going to be equal to the level,

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,245
a, plus some error term, some randomness.

65
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:51,600
It's going up and down.

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,570
And we assume that random term is identically

67
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,350
and independently distributed with a mean of 0

68
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,690
and some variance.

69
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,820
Now, why do we assume that the mean is zero?

70
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,010
Well, what if it wasn't?

71
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,520
What if I said the mean of the error was 10?

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,940
Well, that means I'm just biased 10.

73
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,760
I'm always going to be positively biased.

74
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,280
So the mean of your errors should always be zero,

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,462
because if not, I'm biased either positively

76
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:18,045
or negatively.

77
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:20,680


78
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,335
Let me just clean that up.

79
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,210
So this is our model.

80
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,320
And why it's called a cumulative model is because what

81
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,890
our forecasting model's going to be,

82
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,030
it's going to be saying that x hat-- and x hat

83
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:37,510
is the forecast of demand made at time t-- for time t plus 1.

84
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,900
Now, to generalize this, I have it down here.

85
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,040
It's x hat t comma t plus tau.

86
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,000
And that simply is the forecast made at the end of period t

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,460
for the demand in period t plus tau, where tau is one, two,

88
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,230
three, four, whatever time periods in the future.

89
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,860
So this forecasting model right here is for the next period.

90
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,910
We'll do a lot of these analysis for next period model.

91
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,240
So I'm sitting in today forecasting for tomorrow.

92
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,900
I'm sitting in this month forecasting for next month.

93
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,640
And that's simply going to be for the cumulative model

94
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,530
the sum of all the demands divided

95
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,760
by the number of periods.

96
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,810
So it's going to find the mean or the average.

97
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,720
So I'm saying that all history matters equally.

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,740
Makes sense.

99
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,214
Now let's go to the other extreme.

100
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,880
Let's say history doesn't matter at all.

101
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,640
This is known as the naive forecast.

102
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,610
And so what we assume here is that the most

103
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,850
recent observation dictates the next.

104
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,630
This is sometimes called the random walk or last is next.

105
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,700
So we have the same kind of level forecast,

106
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
but what we're saying is, the underlying model

107
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,150
is, my demand in period t is going

108
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,625
to be equal to my demand that actually happened yesterday

109
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,350
in t minus 1, plus some error term, some randomness.

110
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,280
So the only thing that's going to change

111
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,320
is some of that random term.

112
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,160
So again, my error term is distributed

113
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,230
with a mean of 0 and some variance.

114
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,760
And so my forecasting model is much simpler.

115
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,600
The forecast of demand for sitting in today for tomorrow,

116
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,630
t plus 1, is equal to the demand today.

117
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,630
So I'm assuming that what happens

118
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,070
tomorrow is what happened today.

119
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,030
That's my forecast.

120
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,905
Now, I know it won't be exactly, because I've

121
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,160
got that error term that's going to put some noise around it.

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,340
But the difference in the forecasting models,

123
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,070
or the cumulative model, assumes it's

124
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,740
going to be the average of everything I've seen so far.

125
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,530
I'm creating all the history equally.

126
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,104
Versus the naive model, all that matters is yesterday.

127
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:42,020
What happened last period, that's what I think

128
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,200
is going to happen next period.

129
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,020
So let's see what these look like.

130
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,660
So here's some data we have.

131
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,640
And in this first column here in the table,

132
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,230
it's just the time period from 1 to 10.

133
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,370
xt is the demand at that period, t.

134
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,360
So in period four, we had 96 units actually demanded.

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,474
And over to the right, I have the chart

136
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:04,890
that's showing where that happens.

137
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,180
So what would be my forecast if I'm sitting here at t

138
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,710
and I want to predict the demand in the next period?

139
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,000
So that would be x hat 10 comma 11, because tau in this case

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,780
would be 1.

141
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,130
So this is a next period forecast.

142
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,470
So what would it be?

143
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,290
Well, for the naive, it's going to be what actually

144
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,090
happened this most recent period.

145
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,300
So what happened in period 10?

146
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,200
Well, 96.

147
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,820
So that's my forecast for the next period.

148
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,440
For the cumulative, it's a little more complicated,

149
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,960
a little more intensive.

150
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,820
I go and I sum the average.

151
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,130
And if I sum these up-- and you can check my math--

152
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,170
the sum here is going to be equal to 995.

153
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,050
Divide that by 10, 10 observations, and you get 99.5.

154
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,925
So this is my cumulative forecast.

155
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:55,680


156
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,600
So this is very simple math.

157
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,960
But if I want to look instead of doing just for that period,

158
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,340
suppose I wanted to create a series of next period

159
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,370
forecasts.

160
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,657
So let's see what it would look like if I was in period one

161
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:10,740
and I didn't know anything else that was happening

162
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,100
and I'm making my forecast for period two.

163
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,680
Then in period two, for period three.

164
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,590
And in the period three, for period four.

165
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,330
What would that look like?

166
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,680
Well, that's what this chart is.

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,650
So again, the first column is just the time period.

168
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,850
The xt column is just the demand in time period t.

169
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,940
The third column in green is the cumulative forecast

170
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,410
at that time for the next period.

171
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,390
And then the red, the fourth column,

172
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,710
is the same thing for the naive forecast.

173
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,900
So let's look at period 10.

174
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,480
So in period 10, my actual demand was 96.

175
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,800
And my forecast in period 10 for period 11 under cumulative

176
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,150
is 99.5.

177
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:58,790
My naive forecast, x hat 10 in period 10 for period 11, is 96.

178
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,180
And that's in that row at the bottom.

179
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,020
So I can chart these as well.

180
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,507
And this is the same thing.

181
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:06,590
This is the actual demand.

182
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,220
I just drew a line on it so it would be easier to see.

183
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,360
And here's the naive forecast.

184
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,870
And this is, again, the next period.

185
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,000
So this is the forecast made at the end

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,060
of each period for the next period.

187
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,500
And it's almost like you have double vision,

188
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,060
because all it did is what?

189
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,150
Shifted by one.

190
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,860
It just shifted to the right by one,

191
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,334
because it's a naive forecast.

192
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:27,000
It's saying whatever happened yesterday,

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,325
yeah that's what's going to happen tomorrow.

194
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:30,700
Now let's look at the cumulative.

195
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,070
This is in the green.

196
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,640
And you can see it evens out, because as I

197
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,440
add more information in, it takes a bigger

198
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,380
swing to move that, because I'm taking the average at each

199
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,760
of these points.

200
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,180
Now, the only thing that you might be puzzled at

201
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,870
is what did I do here.

202
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,170
And for the first period, just for simplicity,

203
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,310
I assumed that the forecast for each were the actual, just

204
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,060
to get it started.

205
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,460
We'll talk more about how you initialize forecasts.

206
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,180
But for right now, just assume I made

207
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,380
an assumption of what it was.

208
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,730
But looking at this chart here at the bottom,

209
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,030
you see some big things.

210
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,540
And this is kind of the crux of a lot of forecasting

211
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,830
trade-offs.

212
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,040
You look at the difference between the red

213
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,930
or the naive forecast and the green

214
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,050
or the cumulative forecast, and you

215
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,000
can see that the cumulative forecast, the green one,

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,600
is very calm.

217
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,610
It's going to even things out.

218
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,930
While the naive one is very volatile, very nervous,

219
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,620
because it's going to reflect any change in the underlying

220
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,810
demand.

221
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,540
And so this trade off between calm and nervousness

222
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,124
will be common across all the forecasting that we do.

223
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:37,540
And you might say, well, obviously

224
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,990
the calm one is better.

225
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,390
But you have to look at the downside for that.

226
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,610
Naive models are much more responsive to a change

227
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,960
then the cumulative model.

228
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,290
The cumulative model will always be slower

229
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,240
to respond to any changes.

230
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,890
And that's a key feature.

231
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,970
So this trade off between the cumulative

232
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,610
using all the data that you have,

233
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,750
all the history, and the naive forecast,

234
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,070
only using the most recent, is at the core, the most basic

235
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,280
trade off in forecasting.

236
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,044
And we'll see this in more refined formats later.

237
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:07,210
But at the core of it, this is what it's getting at.

238
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,150
How much information do I want to use?
