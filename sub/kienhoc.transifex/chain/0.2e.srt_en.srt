00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,470
In this segment I want to provide some quick tips

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,950
on responding to numerical problems.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,010
Most of the SCX courses are quantitative in nature,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,010
so most of the problems will require numerical responses.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,840
So here's some quick rules.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,730
Use a period symbol, the dot, to designate a decimal point, not

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,860
a comma.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,930
Never enter commas or any other notation to separate thousands.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,850
If your answer is 12340, enter that in 1-2-3-4-0,

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,580
not 12 comma 3, 4, 0.

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,090
We don't need the separator there.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,090
Never enter currency or percentage signs.

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,140
Just enter the raw number.

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,760
We'll always allow some tolerance for these answers.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,640
So, for example, if the answer is 12340,

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,490
we might allow a number as low as 12330 and as high as 12350.

17
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,440
We'll always have a little bit of tolerance range in there.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,330
And if it's a multi-part problem,

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,930
it's very important that you check the solution

20
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,140
of the previous problem.

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,470
So for example, let's say part B of a problem

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,209
uses the answer in part A. So you

23
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,620
might put a number in for part A, you get it correct.

24
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,900
Always look at the explanation to see

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,460
if you are on the-- you know, you

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,230
might have been at the very end of the range of the tolerance.

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,110
We'll tell you a new number to use

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,580
that's the dead, correct answer, because then that will

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,000
limit the error propagation.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,780
You should use that number going forward.

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,551
So even if you got part A right in that example,

32
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:29,050
you should still check and make sure

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,490
that we're telling you to use that number or a slightly

34
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,854
different number.

35
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:34,770
And we'll always give you guidance on how many

36
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,520
decimal places to use, or the number of significant digits.

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,340
So the general rule for rounding--

38
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,300
and in this example I'm rounding to an integer with no decimal

39
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,070
places.

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,120
And I have it here in terms of x.

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,650
So x could be 7.

42
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,180
So let's just write 7 in wherever ldx is.

43
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,600
So let's say you're numerical answer comes out

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,070
and it's between 7.0 and 7.49999,

45
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,900
and we're being asked to round this to no decimal places.

46
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,070
I would round down.

47
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,889
If the answer's between 7.5000 up to 7.999,

48
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,740
I would round up to 8.

49
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,230
So the break point is 5.0.

50
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:22,890
So if it's 0 to 4.999, round down, 5.0 up to 9.999,

51
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,380
round up.

52
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,130
All right.

53
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,450
So let's give some examples here.

54
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,840
So here's a simple question.

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,250
What's the area of a circle?

56
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,620
I give you a radius of 5.62 miles.

57
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,250
We all know that the area is pi r squared,

58
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,330
and pi has an infinite number of decimal places.

59
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,720
It does not influence our significant digits though.

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,000
Our significant digits here are 5.62,

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,550
so we really have three significant digits.

62
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,880
So the answer from your calculator, from a spreadsheet,

63
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,240
will be 99.225235196.

64
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,530
That's probably not what you're going to enter.

65
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,580
So if we're to ask you to say hey, round to the nearest

66
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,210
integer, then you would enter 99.

67
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,340
Because 2, right, is less than 5.

68
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,290
Now what if I say to the nearest one decimal place?

69
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,480
Well in that case, it would be 99.2,

70
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,130
because again, the second decimal place 2 is less than 5.

71
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,430
What if I say round to the nearest two decimal places?

72
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,030
In that case, I'm looking here-- 5, it's higher,

73
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,610
it's 5.0, right?

74
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,130
So I'm going to make it 99.23.

75
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,610
I would round that up because it's 0.225.

76
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,040
If I say round to the nearest three decimal places,

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,827
then it's 99.225 because the fourth decimal place is a 2.

78
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,160
So this should be pretty simple.

79
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,490
Sometimes I'll tell you to round up or down.

80
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,850
So if I say round up to the nearest integer,

81
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,760
you would say 100, because going up,

82
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,690
100 is the next closest integer to 99 point whatever.

83
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,470
I could also say round down to the nearest integer.

84
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,780
And then I would just go down to 99.

85
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,550
So these are simple rules.

86
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,570
When in doubt, just think it through, and just remember

87
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,610
the rounding rule.
