1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,140
One way to classify supply chain processes

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,150
is as either a Push or a Pull System.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,900
To illustrate this, let's look at a simple example.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,980
Here at MIT in Kendall Square, we

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,270
have a sandwich shop that's close by to our building.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,432
We go there a lot.

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,390
And one of the things I've found over the years

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,950
is you can learn almost everything about logistics

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,870
and supply chain from a sandwich shop.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,300
So we're going to use a very simple example here,

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,970
and I'm sure you have a similar type of store or restaurant

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,660
right by you.

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,250
The idea is you've got this sandwich shop,

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,100
and this is a picture of someone making sandwiches by hand.

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,240
And you see someone is cutting the bread here,

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,160
and they've got some tomatoes ready, and some lettuce.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,240
Some things are pre-prepared, and they're

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,540
making them on demand.

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,980
As someone comes in, they order a sandwich, and they make it.

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,280
So I went in a little while ago and looked

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,480
in at the different types of sandwiches that they can make.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,130
So if you figure a sandwich consists of some kind of bread,

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,780
some kind of protein, whether meat or something,

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,360
some kind of spread, and some toppings.

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,130
In this store, they had 18 different breads,

26
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,090
six different types of protein-- turkey,

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,680
chicken, and things like that-- different types of spread,

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,911
whether it's mayonnaise, tomato, whatever,

29
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:14,410
and different toppings, whether it's

30
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,950
lettuce, tomato, all those different things.

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,255
And if you combine those, that's 21,600 unique sandwiches

32
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:23,630
that can be made, and that's only

33
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,150
considering if I only have one topping.

34
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,950
If I allow you to have two toppings,

35
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,960
like lettuce and tomato, then that goes up to over 400,000.

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,610
And if you look at it, the real, total number,

37
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,650
if I look at any combination, exceeds a million.

38
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,210
So you have all these different types of sandwiches.

39
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,751
Now obviously, they're not going to have all these sandwiches

40
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:44,300
pre-made and just waiting for you,

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,710
but sometimes, someone might want to come in and not

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,570
wait for someone to make a sandwich.

43
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,929
They might want to come here to this little area

44
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:52,720
where you can see some pre-made sandwiches.

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,370
Let me circle them right down here.

46
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,170
They might want to come in and just get something and go

47
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,910
because, while having them custom-made is great

48
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,340
because you can have any one of 21,600 unique sandwiches made,

49
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,450
sometimes you don't want to wait that long.

50
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,240
So what I've got here are two very different processes

51
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,930
for satisfying the demand for a sandwich.

52
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,320
And so we give formal names to these.

53
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,920
So the idea of a Make-to-Order is this example up here,

54
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,460
where I actually make the product once it's been ordered.

55
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,240
So I'm doing it once someone has placed an order of demand.

56
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,130
That's when I make it.

57
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,800
Now over here, in this case where I have the pre-made ones,

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,090
I made those to stock, or to inventory.

59
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,430
Now, you might ask yourself, how many do I make?

60
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,326
How do I know how many of these kind of sandwiches to make?

61
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,450
Well, that's the challenge.

62
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,991
You're making it to stock, it's based

63
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:44,940
on a forecast, versus making it by order,

64
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,120
you're actually making it on actual demand

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,820
that someone is requesting.

66
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,650
And then you've got this third category, engineer to order,

67
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,360
where you're not making a traditional product.

68
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,510
You might engineer something a little bit different

69
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,260
for that customer.

70
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,950
When they come in, they order something special off menu.

71
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,480
So let's continue with this analogy,

72
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,980
and let's formalize some of these ideas, what

73
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,020
a Push versus a Pull is.

74
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,130
So a push system-- and this is essentially

75
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,250
where you had the pre-ordered sandwiches--

76
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,290
is where the execution-- in this case, making a sandwich--

77
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,780
is performed in anticipation of an order.

78
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,040
So what does that mean?

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
That means I'm making my inventory based

80
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,810
on a forecast, what I expect or anticipate to come in.

81
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,450
It's proactive.

82
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,560
So it's being done ahead of time and it's

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,690
based on a projected need or demand.

84
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,700
You can contrast this with a pull system,

85
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,370
and this is where I make the sandwich to order.

86
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,310
Someone comes in, and in response to that order,

87
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,850
I make the sandwich.

88
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,300
Demand is known because someone actually placed the order,

89
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,000
it's known with certainty, and it's reactive.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,560
I only do this when?

91
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,280
When they come in, and then I have

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,350
to start the whole process.

93
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,650
So when you look at supply chains,

94
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,580
there are very, very, very few that are all push or all pull.

95
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,820
We'll talk more about that in a second.

96
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,990
But the idea is that you usually have a combination of them.

97
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,820
And the point where your supply chain

98
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,940
changes from being a push to a pull

99
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,020
is sometimes called the push/pull boundary,

100
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,930
or the push/pull point.

101
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,480
And it's the place where you're done doing inventory

102
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,610
based on a forecast and you're switching it to actual demand.

103
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,200
So let's continue on with our example,

104
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,220
and let's talk about three sandwiches.

105
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,740
I made these up, but these are pretty representative.

106
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,010
So this first one is a pre-made sandwich, a ready made turkey

107
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,510
wrap.

108
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,000
You see it in its nice little plastic casing there.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,850
They make these ahead of time the night before or the morning

110
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,280
before because they know they expect some demand.

111
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,950
Then there's some signature ham sandwiches that they only make

112
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,750
to order when someone comes in, and then I created an engineer

113
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,660
to order one, a Dagwood sandwich,

114
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,060
one-of-a-kind that they make if someone comes

115
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,170
in and they've got to give special directions.

116
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,380
So let's look how these three types of sandwiches

117
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,000
flow through.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,460
Well, any one of these sandwiches

119
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,070
has three main steps.

120
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,470
One, you're going to buy some raw materials,

121
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,870
then you're going to prepare the components, whether it's

122
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,510
you're pre-slicing tomato, precooking the chicken,

123
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,425
whatever.

124
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:14,050
And then you're going to assemble them,

125
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,480
and then I'm going to sell them.

126
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,690
And so the question is, how do each of these

127
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,720
get accomplished for these three sandwiches?

128
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,800
Well, for each one, for buying raw materials,

129
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,383
you're not going to wait until someone

130
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:26,962
comes in the door to order your ham.

131
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:28,670
You're going to order that ahead of time.

132
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,470
So all three of these-- the ready-made,

133
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,639
the signature sandwich, and the one-of-a-kind sandwich--

134
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,180
you're going to order those raw materials ahead of time based

135
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,330
on some kind of forecast.

136
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,050
You're pushing.

137
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,900
You're going to order those ahead of time.

138
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,660
What about preparing the components?

139
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,630
Well, for most of them, for the ready-made and the signature

140
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,570
ham one, you're going to do that ahead of time as well.

141
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,570
You can prepare and precook some of the materials, the bread

142
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,110
and things, but for this one of a kind,

143
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,750
you might have to start doing a pull.

144
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,139
You might not prepare all the components

145
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:01,680
until they order because it might not

146
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,624
be a standard thing that you do.

147
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:06,040
So you might have a strange ingredient that you don't even

148
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,030
touch until they do that one-of-a-kind order.

149
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,604
Final assembly, it gets even more differentiated

150
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:14,020
in that the ready made one, you're

151
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,270
going to do that ahead of time.

152
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,811
Remember, these are the ones I'm going to stock ahead of time

153
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:22,570
to have ready to take, someone can grab from the cooler.

154
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,570
The signature ones, I'm not going to assemble it

155
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,452
until someone has actually placed the order.

156
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,160
And then down here for the one-of-a-kind,

157
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,640
of course I'm not going to assemble it until

158
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,430
someone's placed that order for that one-of-a-kind sandwich.

159
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,864
And then selling it, that's a pull as well.

160
00:06:35,864 --> 00:06:37,280
I don't actually collect the money

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,150
until someone is actually there.

162
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,960
So if I look at these, you can see where the push/pull point

163
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,010
is for each one of these types of sandwiches.

164
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,920
And so we can ask some questions, though,

165
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,360
because here it is, I've got a sandwich shop.

166
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,200
Simple operations, three products, and they're

167
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,070
all sandwiches of some sort, but I've

168
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,070
got three very different supply chains.

169
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,570
And so you might ask yourself, which

170
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,020
is the fastest for the customer?

171
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Which one will give me the product the fastest?

172
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,134
And I think we'd all agree it's this top one because all

173
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:10,550
I need to do, I don't have to wait

174
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,090
for any of these processing times.

175
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,960
It takes time to assemble, it takes time

176
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,530
to prepare the components.

177
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,080
It takes time, of course, to buy the raw materials.

178
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,550
So this one would be the fastest, the top one.

179
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,800
Then you ask the question, which is the hardest to forecast?

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,930
And again, it's probably going to be this top one, because I'm

181
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,260
making all these decisions-- not just the raw material to buy,

182
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,690
how much flour and how much ham, how many components to prepare.

183
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,690
I might precook the meat, I might slice the tomatoes,

184
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,690
but I'm going to pre-assemble and put them

185
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,440
in these nice little plastic cases.

186
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,410
So I'm doing all of that ahead of time.

187
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,470
I've got to forecast each type of sandwich specifically.

188
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,020
That's going to be tough.

189
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,780
And then you might wonder, which process

190
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,630
gives me the most variety?

191
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,980
Certainly, it's going to be these bottom two.

192
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,880
Probably this one gives me the most efficient way

193
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,980
of giving a lot of variety because what I'm doing

194
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,520
is I'm postponing the final customization until I know

195
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,410
exactly what the customer wants.

196
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,620
So I'm postponing the final assembly in this case.

197
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,170
By doing that, I'm keeping most of my products

198
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,170
in this component or raw material form,

199
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,150
and I'm only using them when they

200
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,390
get requested because, like any sandwich shop I've been to,

201
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,410
I'm sure you've noticed there's only so many ingredients.

202
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,659
It's how they get combined that increases

203
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,220
the number that you can have.

204
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,309
So this is the simple example of three sandwiches,

205
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,020
but let's think about it just a little bit more.

206
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,360
What about pure systems?

207
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,430
What about a pure push system?

208
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,160
This happens.

209
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,850
You have pure push systems where things go all the way through.

210
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,170
You've got to base your inventory

211
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,950
on a forecast all the way through.

212
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,400
And you can think that it leads to higher inventory levels

213
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,108
because you're making a guess-- and we'll

214
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:00,340
talk better ways to make that guess--

215
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,810
on what your demand is going to be.

216
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,350
So it's based on a forecast, so you're naturally

217
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,346
going to have higher inventory levels.

218
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,220
You're going to have potential spoilage, too.

219
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,130
If you forecast too much, you might

220
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,730
have too much that you expected, it doesn't materialize.

221
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,700
But you will have faster cycle time because by pushing it,

222
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,760
having it ready, then the customer,

223
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,870
especially in the sandwich shop example,

224
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,200
can come right in and grab it.

225
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,570
Now, for pure pull systems, these are very rare.

226
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,440
These are unicorns.

227
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,630
In class when I ask this, some people

228
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,730
come up with bizarre examples, but it's very, very hard

229
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,140
to find a product that doesn't get

230
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,480
started to be even thought about until someone requests it.

231
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,310
So maybe some engineer to order ones

232
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,850
that are very, very, very unique, or maybe

233
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,260
if you get water out of a stream that's already there.

234
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,230
But if you start thinking about a pull system, the sandwich

235
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,630
shop, for example, you've got to start baking the bread.

236
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,180
No one starts baking the bread when someone places an order.

237
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,410
Usually, you'll have a combination of the two.

238
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,260
You might have pure push, but generally it's a mix.

239
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,460
And you always look for that push/pull point,

240
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,000
and one of the things that you try to do

241
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
is push that push/pull point further upstream.

242
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,380
You want to get it further away from the customer.

243
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,450
And the idea is you're going to push the undifferentiated,

244
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,030
or raw product, or the work in process, the components,

245
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,960
push those to a forecast, and you

246
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,510
want to pull the finished product as much as possible.

247
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,690
Some of the benefits here of having this mixed system where

248
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,780
you have a push/pull point, one is the idea of postponement,

249
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,900
and this is the process that allows

250
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,320
for efficient mass customization.

251
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,070
And so I don't do the final assembly,

252
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,662
the final customization until as late as possible.

253
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:48,370
Think about putting a smartphone together

254
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,210
with different colored cases.

255
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,890
I could have them all manufactured

256
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,040
in the plant with each of the colors,

257
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,390
but then I'd have to predict and forecast how many of each

258
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,530
color are going to be sold.

259
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,520
Instead, maybe I want to segment those out and assemble those

260
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,920
at the dealership.

261
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,250
And so the idea is you postpone the final customization.

262
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,910
And then it also does something else,

263
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,451
and we'll see this in our next couple

264
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,510
lectures when we talk about forecasting.

265
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,820
By pooling these products, these components,

266
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,135
or these aggregate components that

267
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:24,480
are used in multiple items, I'm aggregating demand.

268
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,400
By aggregating demand, my forecast accuracy

269
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,137
improves because I have more products to balance them over.

270
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,720
It's a law of large numbers, and we'll

271
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,120
talk much more about this.

272
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,350
But the idea of pooling products improves my forecasting

273
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,270
because I'm forecasting over a wider range of final products.

274
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,749
So the key principles from here is-- I love this phrase.

275
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,540
What you want to do is you want to maximize

276
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,080
the external variety with minimal internal variety.

277
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,130
What does that mean?

278
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,140
That means I want to have as many sandwiches that people

279
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,530
can take, I want to sell as many possible combinations,

280
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,670
with the minimal number of raw components and sub-assemblies.

281
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,170
So I want to make sure I can have

282
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,677
all these different combinations and find clever ways to be

283
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:11,510
able to deliver that with the minimum amount

284
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,610
of internal variety.

285
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,780
Another concept that you might hear is the whole idea of RAP,

286
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,320
Raw As Possible.

287
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,720
Keep your in process inventory as raw as possible.

288
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,870
What does that mean?

289
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,970
That means you don't do final assembly.

290
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,210
You push that back as far as possible.

291
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,620
So this was Push and Pull Systems,

292
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,700
and we're going to talk more about these as we go.

293
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,720
Maybe the next step that we want to talk about

294
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,870
is how do you determine which product

295
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,470
will go in which type of process.
