1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,200
Let's talk now about the different assumptions

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,570
we have to make when we develop inventory replenishment models.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,720
Because as you can guess, depending on the situation,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,830
you might have a different type of policy.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,060
And you might have to use a different type of model.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,510
So it really all depends on the situation or the environment

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,020
that you're facing.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,076
So when we develop a replenishment model,

9
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,700
we have to think what the objective is.

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,250
And the objective is to find an optimal policy

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,700
for managing the inventory.

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,470
So the whole purpose for developing

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,750
a replenishment model is to develop a policy

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,950
that the decision maker can use.

15
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,240
And so we can think of a policy as consisting

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,910
of two big pieces.

17
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,200
One is how much they're going to order.

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,410
And this is always called Q. And so the quantity

19
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,750
that I'm going to order.

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,950
But then the next big component is when do we order.

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,470
And so we can think of it as being a time based decision.

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,600
So I order every t time units.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,350
I order once a week, once every 17 days, once every hour,

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,290
whatever that time unit is.

25
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,970
Or I can think about a quantity level.

26
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,570
I order a replenishment when my inventory is below 200 units

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,727
or it's below 1,000 units.

28
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:12,810
And there are other ways you can think about this.

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,530
You could even think about combinations

30
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,300
of these, where every week I check and if the inventory is

31
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,510
below a certain level, then I place an order.

32
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,820
So the policy is essentially going

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,700
to tell me how much to order and when I should do it.

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,580
It's a set of rules or instructions for a decision

35
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,500
maker to make.

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,910
And that's really all we're going to focus on.

37
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,060
But as you will see, it gets complex,

38
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,830
because the situations can be very, very different depending

39
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,490
on what your environment is.

40
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,757
So let's go over this big list of assumptions.

41
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:45,590
So this is kind of daunting, but let me just

42
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,324
go over them individually.

43
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:48,990
So the first set of assumptions you make

44
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,890
and probably the most critical is the demand.

45
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,310
So if I look at the demand, there

46
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,610
are many different ways you can think about it.

47
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,945
Is it constant demand?

48
00:01:56,945 --> 00:02:00,160
Is it mainly staying roughly steady state the same?

49
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,840
Or is it highly variable?

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,590
Do we know what the demand's going to be, or is at random?

51
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,320
Is there are a variable size to it?

52
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,520
Is it stochastic?

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,162
And is that demand continuous or does it come in discrete lumps?

54
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:16,370
And so we can think of these different ways of demand

55
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,990
can manifest itself.

56
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,930
And each one of these will dictate a slightly different

57
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,590
way of coming up with an inventory policy.

58
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,927
Then we look at lead time.

59
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,510
This is the time it takes when I place

60
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,394
the order to when it arrives.

61
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:30,560
Initially we're going to make this simple assumption

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,670
that it's instantaneous.

63
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,970
It just shows up right away, which isn't very realistic.

64
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,027
But we'll use that as a starting point.

65
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:38,610
But we can also think of the lead time

66
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,290
as being a constant amount-- it always

67
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,580
takes seven days to come-- or some kind of variable amount.

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,810
It's in between seven and 10 days depending.

69
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,700
And so it can be either deterministic or stochastic,

70
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,330
you know whether I always know what it's going to be

71
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,656
or it might change and has a distribution.

72
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,030
And we can even look at the case,

73
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,110
and we will a little later, whether your lead time isn't

74
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,050
something being delivered to you but you're replenishing it

75
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:04,600
yourself.

76
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,630
So you're making it yourself as your replenishing,

77
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,480
you're fulfilling your demand.

78
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,115
So it's kind of internally replenished.

79
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:14,120
So we'll talk more about that.

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,960
We also look at the dependence of items.

81
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,789
Does each item that you're managing the inventory for,

82
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:19,830
are they all independent?

83
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,454
Doe they have no bearing on each other?

84
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:22,890
Or are they slightly correlated?

85
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,670
So that if I am holding more inventory of type A,

86
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,540
maybe I need more of type B. And so are they correlated at all

87
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,750
or even are the indentured?

88
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,880
And this means that if I, for example, want

89
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,780
to order a bicycle, if I want to have a bicycle inventory,

90
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,810
I know I'm going to need two wheels.

91
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,380
And so they're kind of indentured.

92
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,860
And we'll talk more about that when we talk about MRP systems.

93
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,410
Next big distinction or the assumption I have to make

94
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,790
is my review time.

95
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,300
Am I constantly watching my inventory level?

96
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,200
That's a continuous policy.

97
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,280
Or do I only check it periodically?

98
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,820
And so we'll talk more about this,

99
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,640
what a periodic system is.

100
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,670
But again, a big different distinction

101
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,720
in how you develop those models.

102
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,830
The number of locations, am I managing just one inventory

103
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,830
location?

104
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,730
Or are there multiple, separate locations?

105
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,720
Or is it a multi echelon situation,

106
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,089
where one inventory in one location

107
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,779
is feeding into another set of locations?

108
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,310
So they're tied together, that one flows to the other.

109
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,610
And so that's a very different situation versus one location.

110
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,985
So that's another assumption we're going to have to make.

111
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:31,609
Then we also have to make an assumption

112
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:32,680
on the capacity we have.

113
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Do we have unlimited capacity?

114
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,190
Or do we have some kind of constraint on how much

115
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,270
I can process, or how much I can hold?

116
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,770
We have to make some kind of assumptions on the discounts.

117
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,360
If I buy a certain quantity, do I get a reduced rate,

118
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
or does it not matter?

119
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,430
And so I can think of different types of discounts

120
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,471
whether it's all units, whether it's incremental,

121
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,110
or whether it's a one time buy.

122
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,800
And we'll talk more about these in another few lectures.

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,520
I also have to make an assumption what

124
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,110
happens to excess demand.

125
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,990
The first assumption we're going to make

126
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,990
is that nothing happens.

127
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,210
So you can't have it.

128
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,950
There will not be a shortage.

129
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,050
But we can also make assumptions you know if all the orders are

130
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,600
back ordered, if you lose the orders, their substitution.

131
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,240
So there's a whole lot of assumptions

132
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,246
you can make on what happens when you have stock outs.

133
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:21,620
You also need to make assumptions

134
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,540
on the perishability.

135
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,500
So think of a fresh fruit, highly perishable,

136
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,140
so you can't plan on holding it for a year,

137
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,290
because it will perish over time.

138
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,690
So we can make assumptions there.

139
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,090
Some assumption could be that there is no perishability

140
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,530
that the product are, say, bricks,

141
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,410
and they really don't perish over time.

142
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,580
They're pretty good.

143
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,330
Or we could make assumption that they perish uniform with time

144
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,330
or some kind of non-linear function.

145
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,320
And each of these affects the type

146
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,850
of model, the type of policy we want to enact.

147
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,100
Another set of assumptions is how far are we planning.

148
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,510
We'll talk a little later about single period models

149
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,260
where you're going to try to determine how much inventory

150
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,360
to hold for just one selling period,

151
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,400
think of selling newspapers each day.

152
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,840
You can't sell yesterday's newspaper tomorrow.

153
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,960
It doesn't make sense.

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,455
So it's a single period.

155
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:12,580
You might want to think about finite periods, where

156
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,575
I'm planning say over the next 12 months for a manufacturing

157
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,630
run.

158
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,970
Or you can look at infinite planning horizon.

159
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,240
This is where you think you hit a steady state.

160
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,390
And so you're going to plan for a continuous steady state

161
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,759
infinite window.

162
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,050
And we'll talk more about that.

163
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,425
That will be our first assumption

164
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,687
we make in the next lesson.

165
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:33,770
We also need to make assumptions on how many items

166
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,320
are we actually managing.

167
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,600
Is it just one at a time that we're managing or do

168
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,240
we need to find a way to manage multiple items at one time?

169
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,730
And then finally, what's the form of the product?

170
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,030
Is it a single stage product that we're trying to manage,

171
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,740
or is it multi stage, in other words other components that

172
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,080
are being put together?

173
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,040
And so as you could imagine, it gets much more complicated

174
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,340
as you move from a single stage kind of product

175
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,320
to this multi stage.

176
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,660
This is a big laundry list.

177
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't expect you to understand all of them.

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,500
But this kind of lays the road map

179
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,580
of how we're going to dive in and develop more and more

180
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,950
complex inventory models to create policies that

181
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,320
can be used for many different situations.

182
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,639
So that finishes up this first lesson.

183
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,430
And so if you have any questions, comments,

184
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,580
or suggestions, I encourage you to use the discussion.

185
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,245
