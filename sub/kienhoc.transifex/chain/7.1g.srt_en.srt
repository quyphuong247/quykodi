1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,990
So, let's solve the NFL jersey problem.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,520
So remember the data that we had.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,740
We knew the cost per jersey was $10.90.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,910
The selling price was $24.00 a jersey,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,860
and the expected value was 32,000,

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,040
with a standard deviation of 11,000.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,400
And we assumed it was distributed normally

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,220
for that eight week selling period.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,630
So the solution -- remember, when we did marginal analysis,

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,090
we're going to try to figure out the cost of the short

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,119
and the cost of the excess to come up with a Critical Ratio.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,240
So, if I have a shortage, what is my cost?

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,540
Well, that's one jersey I could have sold, so I lose my margin.

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,860
Which is just the selling price minus the cost --

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,772
24 minus 10.90 comes out to $13.10.

16
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:48,230
Then, I want to look for what is the cost if I have excess,

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,950
if I have an inventory of a jersey that I didn't sell?

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,000
And what do I lose?

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,750
The price that I paid for it, the $10.90.

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,840
So, I want to come up with my Critical Ratio, which

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,190
is going to be equal to the c_s, the cost of the Shortage, which

22
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,720
is p - c.

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,920
Divide that by the sum of the Cost of the Excess

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,050
and the Cost of the Shortage, which is c + p - c.

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:20,310
Which simplifies just to (p - c) / p.

26
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,660
So, this becomes my Critical Ratio

27
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,800
which, if I just look at the numbers, do the math,

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,370
comes out to 0.546.

29
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,110
So, this means that I want to cover

30
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,350
54.6% of the demand distribution.

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,900
So, I want to find a Q, such that the probability that x

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,850
is less than that, where x is the demand that is realized,

33
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,920
is equal to a 0.546.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,240
How do I do this?

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,020
Couple of ways.

36
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,210
First, I can use a normal table, or I can use a spreadsheet.

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,800
So, let's use the normal table.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,350
And you have this as an attachment to the unit.

39
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,860
And so I have the standard unit normal table

40
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,880
here that we've been using before,

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,620
where the first column is the k value.

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,280
And then I have the probability that x is less than k

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,330
in the second column.

44
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,660
The third column is a unit normal loss function,

45
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,020
which we'll talk about in future talks.

46
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,700
And this repeats for all different values of k.

47
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,390
So, if I want to find the probability of x being less

48
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,900
than Q where it's equal to 0.546, so what do I do?

49
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,960
Well, I look down the second column to 0.546.

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,540
I see that it's going to fall between these two values.

51
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,770
So my k is going to be somewhere between 0.11 and 0.12.

52
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,890
If I interpolate between that, it's roughly 2/3

53
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,550
in, or almost halfway in between.

54
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,510
And it turns out that it would come out to be that k = 0.115,

55
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,220
right in the middle, between those.

56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,970
So, now I know this.

57
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,100
I recall that k is equal -- This is a normalization,

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,810
where I take the Q that I'm trying to find minus the mean

59
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,690
of the distribution, divided by the standard deviation.

60
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,730
And so, what I want to find is the Q that gives this to me.

61
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,550
So, I just solve for Q, and it turns out

62
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,659
that that comes out to be 33,267 units.

63
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,950
So, this is how you can find it using the normal table.

64
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,580
Again, I just start with the probability

65
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,770
that I need to cover, which is the Critical Ratio.

66
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,910
I can also do this in Excel, using

67
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,740
this norm-inverse function that we've talked about previously,

68
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,500
with three input terms: the Critical Ratio,

69
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,630
the mean of the distribution, the standard deviation

70
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,290
of the distribution, right?

71
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,590
And that will return the exact same value.

72
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,350
This is the Profit-Maximizing Quantity that I would order,

73
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,160
the Q*, that would maximize my total profit for that eight

74
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,210
week period.

75
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,180
But what if I can sell those leftover jerseys at a discount?

76
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,190
Because it's kind of unrealistic if I have extra jerseys

77
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,630
I just throw them away.

78
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,410
Maybe I can sell them, but at a lower rate.

79
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,520
So, what that's known is Salvage Value.

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,240
So, let's consider two other costs here.

81
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,220
The first is this Salvage Value.

82
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,072
So, suppose that if I sell a jersey:

83
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,780
I don't sell it in the eight week period,

84
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,900
but if I sell it later, I can get a little value for it.

85
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,610
Not as much as I normally would, but it's a discounted version

86
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,130
amount.

87
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,390
So, there's some Salvage Value to it.

88
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,670
Then I can also think of another cost,

89
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,970
a B, which is a penalty for not satisfying the demand,

90
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,740
over and above the lost profit.

91
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,450
Let's say, I see there's a loss of customer goodwill

92
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,500
and I could put a dollar value on that.

93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,100
That would be the B. So, every item that I'm short, I get

94
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,900
dinged another B that I get charged for that.

95
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,490
So, if we think of those, then I can

96
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,650
create and look at my cost of being short.

97
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,220
So, it's the loss of the margin, p - c.

98
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,510
But I also lose that B, that penalty

99
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,420
for not satisfying demand.

100
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,795
And my cost of excess is going to be the c, right? --

101
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:59,910
how much I paid for it.

102
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,580
But I subtract off this g, this Salvage Value,

103
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,900
because I don't lose as much anymore --

104
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,030
because I can get some of that money back by selling it

105
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,550
at a discount.

106
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,310
So, if I carry the math out, I come up

107
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,080
with another equation for the Critical Ratio.

108
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,830
But the important thing is to always think

109
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,920
of this in terms of, what is my Cost of a Shortage, what

110
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,420
is my Cost of Excess, and then just do the ratio.

111
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,930
So, let's look at this in the case

112
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,570
where I have a Salvage Value.

113
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,990
So, let's look at our problem again.

114
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,090
And all this information is the same.

115
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,840
Jerseys cost me $10.90, the selling price is $24.00

116
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,580
a jersey.

117
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,640
My forecast demand is 32,000 with a standard deviation

118
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,860
of 11,000.

119
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,830
But now the only difference is, if I don't sell my jerseys

120
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,466
within that eight week period, I can discount them and I can

121
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,430
sell them for $7.00 a jersey.

122
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,720
What does this do?

123
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,420
Well, I can look at my Cost of Shortage and my Cost of Excess,

124
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,160
as we just showed on the previous slide.

125
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,380
And it comes out to $13.10 for the Cost of Shortage,

126
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,270
and $3.90 for the Cost of Excess.

127
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,310
So, my Critical Ratio becomes 0.771.

128
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,650
So, what is this saying?

129
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,870
This is saying that I should order

130
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,520
Q that covers 77.1% of the probability distribution.

131
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,250
Notice that my Q is a lot bigger.

132
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,470
I can cover more of the demand here.

133
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,520
And so I want to select a Q where the probability of x

134
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,112
is less than Q is equal to that 0.771.

135
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:34,070
And again, I can solve that with a normal table

136
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,050
in the spreadsheet.

137
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,508
You might want to look at the table

138
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:38,180
to see if you get the same number.

139
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,310
But you end up with a Q* of 40.149, or 40,149 units.

140
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,490
This is the Profit-Maximizing Quantity.

141
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,800
So, we're using the same principles.

142
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,390
All we're doing now is adding in this other term, this discount.

143
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,050
And we can find out what the Critical Ratio is.

144
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,990
Notice that this is a lot bigger than our previous value, which

145
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,600
was what?

146
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,990
33,849.

147
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,290
By having this discount, this Salvage Value, that means I'm

148
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,490
willing to buy a little more.

149
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,910
I can buy a lot more because the risk of having too much went

150
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,360
way down because of that discount.

151
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,550
So, we figured out how to find the Optimal Quantity.

152
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,610
What we haven't figured out yet is

153
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,960
how do I determine the profitability.

154
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,100
And that's what we'll do in the next lesson.

155
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,600
So, let's wrap this lesson up, and then do some problems.

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,440
And then come back and we'll learn

157
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,210
how to determine the profitability

158
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,900
of these situations.

159
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,763
