Do people that use credit cards in making
routine payments

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,440
differ in the way they make purchase evaluations
than people that routinely

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
use checks?

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,780
That was a question that I was trying to address
in a paper that I published

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,920
in 2001 in the Journal of Consumer Research.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,679
That paper had two experiments of which we'll
focus

7
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,390
on one in this module.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,500
The goal, as I said, of that paper was to
test whether the routine use of

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,410
credit cards influences future spending and
to identify the

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,660
mechanisms that underlie these differences.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,780
In this particular experiment, study one,
consumers who paid for past

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,620
expenses by credit cards will be more likely
to purchase an additional

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,800
discretionary product as compared with consumers
who paid for the same

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,890
expense by check, all other things being held
constant, was the

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,130
hypothesis that I was looking to test.

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,070
This was a lab experiment in which participants
made hypothetical

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,510
decisions in a hypothetical context.

18
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:08,670
The experiment used three factors each of
which had two levels.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,729
The first was payment mechanism in which participants
were either in a

20
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:17,960
credit card condition or a check condition.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,460
The second factor was feedback.

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,970
Some participants were given a running total
of the cumulative expenses to

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:30,219
date as they made payments while others were
not.

24
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:34,850
And finally, the third factor was a credit
limit.

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,289
All participants were told that they had a
credit card.

26
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:43,280
In one set of conditions they were told that
the credit limit was $3,000,

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,289
in a second set that it was $8,000.

28
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:52,429
160 students at a university participated
in this experiment.

29
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:57,140
And they were randomly assigned to a total
of eight conditions that were

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,500
formed by completely crossing two payment
conditions with two feedback

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,979
conditions with two credit limit conditions
for a total of eight

32
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,880
different experimental conditions.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,010
All participants were asked to imagine that
they had a job that

34
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,880
paid $3,000 a month.

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,310
They had bank accounts as well as a credit
card with a given limit.

36
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,540
And then, every participant was shown 30 index
cards with expenses that they

37
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,610
would incur in a typical month.

38
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,930
Now, the idea behind this experiment was to
simply recreate the mechanics

39
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,250
of payment that an individual would go through
in a given month over the

40
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,850
space of 30 days in a lab setting where the
same process took about an

41
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,300
hour or an hour and a half.

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,470
So then, participants saw each index card.

43
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,610
They actually made "payments," in inverted
quotes, for 12 of these

44
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,270
expenses either by writing 12 checks or by
signing 12 credit card receipts.

45
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,820
And I'll show you exactly what these stimulus
look like in a minute.

46
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,770
At the end of this entire process--
about an hour, hour and a half--

47
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,590
participants answered the final question,
which contained the

48
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,960
dependent variable.

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:24,020
They were given some information on a box
CD set by a favorite artist with a

50
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,430
specific price and a whole bunch of attributes.

51
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,210
And they were asked to indicate on a ten-point
scale whether, in fact, they

52
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,460
would make this purchase given all of the
other expenses that they have

53
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,090
incurred in this month.

54
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,100
Here's what the average index card looked
like.

55
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,890
For example, in this particular case, on March
9 the participant had a

56
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:55,310
telephone bill of $100.72, which was either
paid by check or by credit

57
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,600
card, depending on which condition they were
in.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,310
And then, they had a cash purchase of coffee
and bagel for breakfast, which

59
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,260
was paid by cash.

60
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,180
And of course, that was not part of the manipulation.

61
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,640
If, in fact, the participant was in the check
condition, they would then

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,300
see a check like this one.

63
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,150
And they would actually need to complete the
check after seeing this

64
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:24,810
index card by filling up the name of the payee,
there, putting in a date,

65
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:36,110
writing down the full amount in numbers, as
well as words--

66
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,169
obviously in better handwriting than this.

67
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:44,090
And they would sign it and drop it in the
box.

68
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,949
If in fact, they were in a credit card condition,
they would see a

69
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,900
counterfoil pretty much that you would see
when you pay

70
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,000
by credit card anyway.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,249
That was all they did in this case, was they
had to sign.

72
00:04:57,249 --> 00:05:02,050
And then, they had to put this in the box
along with the other stimulus.

73
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,939
Keep in mind, every participant either paid
for everything by check or

74
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,460
everything by credit card.

75
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,740
The data were analyzed by ANOVA (analysis
of variance) comparing the

76
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,439
mean across all of the conditions that we
talked about.

77
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,159
And we found that purchase intentions varied
as a function of payment

78
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:24,760
mechanism, credit limit, as well as feedback.

79
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,360
We found a significant main effect of payment
mechanism, feedback, and

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
credit limit.

81
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,490
In other words, people were more likely on
average to make a purchase

82
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,999
in the credit card condition than the check
condition.

83
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:46,199
They were less likely to make a purchase when
they received feedback.

84
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,870
And they were more likely to make a purchase
when they had a high credit

85
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,569
limit as compared to a low one.

86
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:58,629
However, these main effects were qualified
by two-way interactions.

87
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,860
Let's focus for a minute on the first one
of them--

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,789
a payment mechanism by feedback interaction.

89
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:12,360
So if you look at the graph on the right-hand
panel over here.

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,440
Here is what you'll see.

91
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,509
Let's first look at the line down here.

92
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:24,380
This line represents the case where the credit
limit was $3,000, and there

93
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,750
was feedback provided to both the check and
the credit card users.

94
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,349
It turns out under those circumstances, the
difference between

95
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:37,430
the check and the credit card was really low,
and, in fact, it was

96
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,559
statistically not significant.

97
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:43,559
But let's compare that with the green line
here.

98
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:48,419
This is the case where there was no feedback.

99
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,990
And the credit limit was high.

100
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,819
And under those substances, you'll see that
there is a dramatic difference

101
00:06:54,819 --> 00:07:00,550
between the purchase intention for check and
the purchase intention for

102
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,900
credit cards.

103
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:08,949
Now if you go from this green line to one
of these lines here, where in fact

104
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:17,039
you now have the same level of credit limit
but you provide feedback, you

105
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,599
notice that the purchase intention declines.

106
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,199
And when you go from that condition down here
where now, you not only

107
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,509
provide feedback, but also reduce the credit
limit, we get down to our

108
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,339
condition here, which is not significantly
different.

109
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:37,969
So in somewhat we concluded with this research
was that there were two

110
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:42,629
factors that seemed to be driving the effect
of credit cards over checks.

111
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,729
One was the fact that there was something
going on

112
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,039
with the credit limit.

113
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,279
The second was the fact that credit cards
didn't give people feedback

114
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,439
because they were--
unlike checks where you wrote down the number,

115
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,229
the opportunity to rehearse
the price paid was very low for credit cards.

116
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,889
So in fact, our conclusion was simple.

117
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,419
Paying for a series of past expenses with
a credit card verses check

118
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,039
increased the purchase intention for an additional
discretionary product.
