00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,040
https://youtu.be/zKMkCdMipt8
Let's imagine you've gone ahead and done an
experiment.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,750
You've put people in different conditions.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,550
You've measured some outcome variables.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,260
And now, it's time to analyze the data.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,460
As we said earlier, there are two ways in
which you analyze

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,210
experimental data.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,571
One is called an analysis of variance.

8
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:27,190
The second one is regression.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,690
What we'll do in the next segment is to see
how we can interpret the

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,140
results of experiments.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,870
In order to do that, I want to keep going
back to the experiment that we

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,420
talked about earlier, Gourville's experiment
on the

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,920
pennies-a-day phenomena.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,300
Remember the first experiment we talked about.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,030
In this experiment, people were either exposed
to a $350 a year or a

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,789
dollar-a-day frame.

17
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,489
Here's what Gourville found.

18
00:00:54,489 --> 00:01:01,969
He found that when people saw the same amount
expressed as dollars a day,

19
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,230
they were much more willing to donate then
when they saw

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,230
the aggregate frame.

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,680
And in fact, what you'll see is that the green
bar, in this case

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,550
representing pennies-a-day, is taller than
the grey bar.

23
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,680
That is an example of what we call a main
effect.

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,850
In this case, one factor, which is the framing
of the payment, has a main

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,270
effect, consistent effect on the outcome,
which in this case is

26
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,930
willingness to donate.

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,480
Now, let's look at a second experiment that
we talked about.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,790
In this case, we had a fully crossed experiment.

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,750
We looked at pennies-a-day framing versus
aggregate framing.

30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,580
But we did that under two conditions, under
a low-amount condition and a

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,930
high-amount condition.

32
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,180
Here's what you see in terms of the results.

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,370
On the left-hand side we see the data for
their low-amount condition.

34
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,640
And what you see here is a replication of
the first study, namely, people in

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,710
the pennies-a-day condition actually were
much more willing to donate than

36
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,370
people in the aggregate condition.

37
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,610
Let's look at the right-hand side panel.

38
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,200
That's the panel where the amounts were high.

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,890
And notice what happens there.

40
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,510
In that condition, we see a reversal of the
basic effect.

41
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,820
In other words, we find that people who saw
the pennies-a-day condition,

42
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,550
actually, were less likely to donate than
people who saw

43
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,550
the aggregate condition.

44
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,850
So if you look at the big picture, this is
what is happening.

45
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:34,250
The effect of one variable, in this case the
pennies-a-day framing, on the

46
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,750
willingness to donate changes as a function
of the presence of a second

47
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,380
variable, in this case whether the amount
is high or low.

48
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,270
Every time you have a situation where the
effect of one variable on the

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,570
final outcome changes as a function of the
presence of a second variable,

50
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,390
we're going to call that an interaction effect.

51
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,550
So once again, a main effect is when a given
variable has a consistent effect

52
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,160
on the outcome variable.

53
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,630
An interaction effect is when the effect of
variable one changes as a

54
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,350
function of the presence or absence of a second
variable.

55
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,230
Let's think through the notion of interaction
effects a bit more closely.

56
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,660
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
and hypothesize three imaginary

57
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,880
experiments that John Gourville could have
done in his study on

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,200
pennies-a-day.

59
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,520
Here's the first one.

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,600
Let's imagine we take one condition, which
is the pennies-a-day framing

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,780
versus a second condition, which is the aggregate
framing.

62
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,150
Now, we replicate this experiment in a second
product context.

63
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,940
So what we now have is a fully-crossed design,
two products times two levels

64
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,060
of price framing.

65
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,319
In this context we might see results that
look like that.

66
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,489
On the left-hand side, you see that for product
one the pennies-a-day

67
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,890
results in a greater willingness to donate
than the aggregate.

68
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,520
On the right-hand side for product two, we
see the same exact effect.

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,840
In this case, there is no attraction effect
but simply a strong main effect

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,310
of the way in which you frame the amount,
pennies-a-day versus aggregate.

71
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,000
Here's a second situation.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,569
This is really not hypothetical, but it is
basically a graph drawn from the

73
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,419
experiment that we talked about earlier.

74
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,770
Shows that when the amount is low, pennies-a-day
dominates.

75
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,780
When the amount is high, the aggregate frame
dominates.

76
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,940
In this case, the presence of the second variable
has reversed the

77
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,720
original effect resulting in an interaction
effect.

78
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,550
Here's a third kind.

79
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,211
Let's imagine that this experiment was done,
not so much with amounts, but

80
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:48,900
with two different kinds of people.

81
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,750
For example, let's say in one condition we
showed people who were

82
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,510
monthly-wage earners and put them into conditions.

83
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,690
The aggregate was a pennies-a-day.

84
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,830
In a second group, we took people that were
daily-wage earners and then

85
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,190
again, did the same thing all over again with
them.

86
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,120
Here's a simple theoretical prediction.

87
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,380
If people are earning wages on a daily basis,
they are much more likely to

88
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,450
compute the daily impact of an aggregate product
anyways.

89
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,330
And therefore, for those people, we expect
that there would be no

90
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,180
difference between framing as pennies-a-day
verses framing as an

91
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,180
aggregate expense.

92
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,880
In fact, this is what our results might show
us.

93
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,300
And the last panel for monthly-wage earners,
we would replicate the

94
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,580
earlier finding.

95
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,120
Pennies-a-day does better than aggregate.

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,410
But on the right panel, what we would find
is that there is no difference

97
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,040
between the two types of price framing.

98
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,260
This is an interaction effect, but one in
which the effect--

99
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,100
in which the basic effect disappears when
you introduce a second variable.

100
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,570
So there are many ways in which you would
get interaction effects.

101
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,190
An effect would be stronger or weaker as a
result of a second variable.

102
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,690
Or it could completely reverse and finally
even be eliminated as the

103
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,110
second variable is introduced into the experiment.

104
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,430
Let's finally end by looking at how you would
interpret regression

105
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,250
coefficients if you use regression to analyze
your experimental data.

106
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,920
Remember that in the regression setting, your
final output is an

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:29,550
equation that might look something like Y
is some constant a plus b1

108
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,130
multiplied by the first variable plus b2 multiplied
by the second variable

109
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,120
and so on and so forth.

110
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,760
Every time you run a regression model, the
first thing to keep in mind is

111
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,350
that if the model shows you that certain coefficients
are not

112
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,240
statistically significant, you would need
not consider them in your

113
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,860
interpretation of the results.

114
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,320
When you read a paper, you will typically
find that statistically

115
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,350
significant coefficients have an asterisks
or a star

116
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,699
marked next to them.

117
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,850
The ones that are not significant do not have
an asterisks or a star.

118
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,840
The second thing that you need to keep in
mind is to look at how we think

119
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,580
about capturing interaction effects in a regression
setting.

120
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,430
ANOVA does it by simply looking at each of
the two factors as separate

121
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,380
independent factors when it runs its model.

122
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,070
In a regression setting, let's imagine you
have two variables, x1 and x2.

123
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,100
How do I capture the interaction between the
two?

124
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,350
Here's what I do.

125
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,670
I would normally model Y as a function of
a plus b1 times x1

126
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,170
plus b2 times x2.

127
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,460
And then, I would simply multiply x1 and x2
and give it a separate

128
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,080
coefficient of its own, in this case, b3.

129
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,800
And if you ran a model like this and came
up with a regression coefficient

130
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,680
which was significant in b3, then you would
say that you had a significant

131
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,860
interaction effect in a regression sense.
