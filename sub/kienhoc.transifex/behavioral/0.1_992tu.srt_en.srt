Welcome to BE101x, Behavioral Economics in
Action.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,200
I want to emphasize the importance of the
title of this course,

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,910
in particular the last two words in action.

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,880
But before I do that, let me quickly introduce
myself.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,320
My name is Dilip Soman, and I'm going to be
the instructor for BE101x,

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,090
this year on edX.

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,270
We've all of been exposed to the notion of
behavioral economics.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,870
Perhaps most of you have read books like these,
Dan Ariely's book on predictably

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,220
irrational, Dick Thaler's book on nudging,
Chip Heath's book on being decisive, and Daniel

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,850
Kahneman's work
on thinking fast and thinking slow.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,610
A lot of the work has gone on to explain how
people make decisions,

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,710
and in particular, focusing on the kinds of
errors

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,910
that they make in their decision making.

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,450
We've all been exposed to the fact that human
beings are

15
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:04,699
not rational, we make systematic mistakes,
that we act in ways in which are contrary

16
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,680
to our own self interests.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,580
But in this course, we want us to go one step
further.

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,369
We want us to ask the important question,
so what?

19
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,240
Now, before I go on and talk about the course
itself,

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,880
let me tell you a little bit about the work
that's happening here

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,890
at the Rotman School, that supports the course
and in fact the cluster

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,960
of activities surrounding the course.

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,549
I'm part of a research cluster called Behavioral
Economics in Action,

24
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,249
and that's where the course gets its name
from.

25
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:36,009
And what the research cluster does, is it
takes the principles of behavioral economics,

26
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,140
of decision making,
and applies them to real world situations,

27
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,759
in the world of policy,
in the world of social welfare, and in the

28
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,280
world of business.

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,530
Our work focuses on taking learnings from
the behavioral lab,

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,450
from theory, and applying them to help people
make

31
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,659
better decisions, one step at a time.

32
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:58,450
And you'll hear a lot about that research
and that approach

33
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,329
in the rest of this course.

34
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,499
BE101x is going to be divided into three separate
chunks.

35
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:07,880
In the first module, we'll cover the basic
principles

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,690
of behavioral economics.

37
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,150
We'll look at why people are irrational, what
are some of the principles that underlie that

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,650
irrationality,
and we'll also talk about some phenomena that

39
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,670
had to do with the way
in which people think about money and time,

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,720
and how they manage both those resources.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,820
We'll then talk about methods of behavioral
economics.

42
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,290
And finally, we'll end up with applications
of behavioral economics

43
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,370
to real world situations.

44
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,440
We have three principal methods that we're
going to use to communicate with you.

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,230
The first is videos.

46
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,820
You'll see videos that come in two formats,
there are videos like this one, where I'm

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,280
standing up and lecturing,
but there are other videos where I'm actually

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,750
going to work with the slide deck and go through
more intricate examples

49
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,650
and more complex information, by following
along with the PowerPoint

50
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,090
slide.

51
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,870
The second set of materials we'll use, are
text materials

52
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,750
that you'll see on HTML.

53
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,970
We'll have two kinds of materials there, there'll
be abridged versions of articles, as well

54
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,230
as simple bullet point
summaries of some of the lectures that you've

55
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,230
heard before.

56
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,080
And at the end of each subunit, you'll see
small informative quizzes.

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,510
These are not quizzes that are meant to test
you,

58
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,330
they are simply meant to make sure that you've
grasped the basic ideas that we've just covered,

59
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,260
in the most recent module.

60
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,610
And finally, at the end of each week, we'll
have a debate.

61
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,220
What you'll see at the end of each week, is
a video that contains the opinions of four

62
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,650
to five academics,
policymakers, or business people on a particular

63
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,330
debate topic.

64
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,570
Once you've heard the video, you'll see a
link directing you

65
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,260
to a polling station, where you can express
your opinion,

66
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,170
in terms of which side of the debate you would
like to support.

67
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,630
And secondly, to make your own comments on
a discussion board.

68
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,170
Use the debate arena wisely.

69
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,530
It is perhaps the most interesting element
of this course,

70
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,200
because in that arena, you'll hear from a
number of my colleagues,

71
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,500
both from the University of Toronto, and from
outside.

72
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,650
People that I worked with, and people that
are generally working in the area of choice

73
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,180
architecture and behavioral economics.

74
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,250
And you'll get to hear their opinions on some
of these leading issues.

75
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,970
You'll also get a chance to interact with
your fellow students

76
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,720
in this edX course.

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,500
Before I end the segment, I want to give you
a brief introduction

78
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,100
of my own background and my history.

79
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,580
And perhaps the best way of doing that is
to show you these four maps, that tell you

80
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,840
where I come from.

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
I grew up in India.

82
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
I lived in India for a number of years.

83
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,169
I did my undergrad in engineering, followed
by a degree in management.

84
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:41,129
After that, I worked in sales and advertising
for a brief period of time,

85
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,000
before moving to the United States, where
I got a degree in behavioral sciences at the

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,030
University of Chicago.

87
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,710
I taught in the US for a few years, before
moving

88
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,560
to Hong Kong, where I taught at the Hong Kong
University of Science

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,930
and Technology, until 2003.

90
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,750
After, which I've been in Canada for the past
10 years,

91
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,280
teaching at the University of Toronto.

92
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,539
Over the past 20 years I have spent in academia,
I have worked in four different countries,

93
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,159
I've taught at multiple levels, but at the
end of the day my research

94
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:13,669
interests are captured by the following simple
question,

95
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,780
why do people do things that we think they
should do,

96
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,210
and in fact, that they think they should do,
but yet they do do.

97
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,770
And b, what can I do to help them make what
they think

98
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,520
is the right choice for them.

99
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,169
And that's what I want you to take away from
this course.
