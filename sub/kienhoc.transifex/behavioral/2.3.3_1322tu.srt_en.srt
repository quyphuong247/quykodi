What does the story of SS and LL tell us?

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,090
It tells us, in simplicity, that when we make
choices that are in the

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,820
future, we make wise choices.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,310
When we make those same choices today, we
tend to make impulsive ones.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,550
Think about it as having two entities within
us-- a planner and a doer.

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,300
The planner looks forward.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,390
He sees the LL being bigger than SS.

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,960
The impulsive guy, the doer, actually falls
in the lapse zone.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,300
And so the idea behind self control devices
is can we think about ways in

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,260
which the planner can trick the doer, and
make sure that they don't fall

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,320
prey into a lapse zone?

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,420
And that's essentially the heart of self control
devices.

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,510
So when we ask people about whether they want
to work hard or not, when

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,610
they look into the future, the answer is yes.

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,360
Do you want to save more?

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,020
Yes, but not today.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,399
I'll save more tomorrow.

18
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,120
So a simple strategy for getting people to
do what is good for them is

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,450
to get them to pre-commit to doing something
for the future, and then

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,220
figuring out a locking mechanism to make sure
that they

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,920
follow through on that.

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,220
There could be a number of different kinds
of locking mechanisms.

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,770
The first one could be a contract.

24
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,430
You commit to saving more tomorrow, and if
you do not meet those savings

25
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,680
targets, you pay an economic penalty.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,000
Or it could be a social contract.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,900
Here's an example of a company that uses social
contracts in a very

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,080
interesting way.

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,659
It's called stickk.com, and it was invented
by, among others, a professor

30
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,990
of economics at Yale--
Dean Karlan.

31
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,100
Here's how it works.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,240
Let's say there is a behavior that you want
to engage in that you've been

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
struggling with.

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,380
You've been meaning to learn the piano, or
you've been

35
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,380
meaning to lose weight.

36
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,000
You been meaning to read thesis and you've
struggled to do it.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
You can go up there, and actually make a public
proclamation of what it is

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,200
that you want to do.

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,050
The site is going to help you find a judge--
this is somebody who's going to monitor your

40
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,680
progress--
and you can also set up your own cheering

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
groups.

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,040
But here's the interesting part.

43
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,120
It asks you to wager an amount of money that
you believe that that thing

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,010
is important to you.

45
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,260
So you're going to say to yourself, I want
to lose five pounds, and if I

46
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,870
don't lose five pounds, I'm willing to give
up $400.

47
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,870
You commit.

48
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,950
You send them a check.

49
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,849
And what happens if you do not meet your target
group?

50
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:33,200
There's two things--
one, stickk.com could donate the money that

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,290
you just gave them to a charity,
not of your choice, but a charity that they

52
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,019
believe is going to be something
that you hate.

53
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:45,569
And so people are motivated to actually not
lose that money to a

54
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,530
cause that they don't trust.

55
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,420
The other thing that happens is, if you fail
to meet your goal, stickk.com

56
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,550
or other devices like that can actually post
to your Facebook or

57
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,170
Twitter timeline so that all of your friends
know that you set off trying

58
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,680
to lose weight, and you failed.

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,580
And that can be a very powerful social motivator.

60
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,849
So it's an interesting example of a contract
that has both economic

61
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,690
consequences as well as social consequences.

62
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,100
The other locking mechanism that can be used
is designing a product, or

63
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,870
designing a service, where people, in fact,
almost forget that

64
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,290
they are in a contract.

65
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,350
Dick Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi came up with
an interesting program called

66
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,519
Save More Tomorrow.

67
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,879
The idea was simple.

68
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,310
Today you're committed to setting aside some
percent of future salary

69
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,690
increases into a separate mental account.

70
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,720
And by the virtue of the fact that it was
a separate mental account, people

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,450
never saw that extra money being aside.

72
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,610
But here's the interesting part.

73
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,970
A lot of people actually forgot that they
were in the program.

74
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,900
And when their salaries went up, what they
noticed was the separate account

75
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,650
where the savings kept going up, but they
just did not keep track of the

76
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,189
fact that they were in the program.

77
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,569
They never saw the cash, and, as a result,
they couldn't

78
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:07,490
do much about it.

79
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,860
The third way in which you can exert a locking
mechanism is by peer pressure.

80
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,650
A number of interesting examples of product
categories that could involve--

81
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,890
in the savings domain, for example-- piggy
banks, or savings boxes, that

82
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,530
can only be opened by two keys.

83
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,130
Let's say you keep one key and I keep one.

84
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,160
And if I have to dip into my savings, the
only way I can get to that savings

85
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,380
is to ask you to provide your key.

86
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,700
And the fact that I'm going to actually expose
my lack of self

87
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,910
control to you can be a powerful motivator
in encouraging

88
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,500
people to save more.

89
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,710
So these are just some example of how you
can lock people into a behavior

90
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,180
that they have committed to doing in the future.

91
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,169
Here's another interesting example of an invention
of an intervention that

92
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:55,040
is designed to exert self control.

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,210
This one comes from Gmail, and the product
is called

94
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,530
Google Goggles by Gmail.

95
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,720
Simple idea--
if you're an undergraduate student or you're

96
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,330
someone who loves drinking on a
Friday night, chances are good that you will

97
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,100
send an email that you wish
you hadn't sent at that point in time.

98
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,240
And so what you can do is you can impose a
lock on your self.

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,830
And here's the way the lock works.

100
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,880
You can tell Goggle when you plan to be drunk,
or you can tell Google when

101
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,620
you plan to be stressed.

102
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,039
And what Google will then do is, if you try
and send an email in that

103
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,190
window, it's going to make you solve a bunch
of math problems--

104
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,980
like this one, here.

105
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,300
And unless you get all the math problems correct,
it will not send

106
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,590
your email.

107
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,690
So again what's happening here is you've got
a planner who knows that

108
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,320
you might end up sending risky emails at a
given point in time, and the

109
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,740
planner imposes a cost-- a lock--
on the door, a classic example of self control.

110
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,889
So when we think about the notion of self
control, you can think about it

111
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:57,560
as a conflict between willpower and desire.

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,590
Think of these as two entities fighting each
other.

113
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,639
We've got a bunch of strategies that you can
use to reduce the desire or to

114
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,199
increase the willpower.

115
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,710
How do I reduce desire?

116
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,310
Avoidance--
people take long walks just to avoid the cake

117
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,100
shop on the way to work.

118
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,470
If you don't see it, you're not going to fall
in the lapse zone.

119
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,460
You could distract yourself, or you could
substitute that substance that

120
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,680
you are addicted to, that you fall prey to,
with some other activity.

121
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,990
A lot of people will chew gum every time they
feel

122
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,460
like smoking a cigarette.

123
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,979
And that's a simple act of substitution.

124
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,600
How do I increase willpower?

125
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,900
And we've already looked at a number of these
strategies.

126
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,069
Pre-commit--
if you can pre-commit, and design a locking

127
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,110
mechanism, that's a great way
of increasing willpower.

128
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,139
Or every time you fall prey in a particular
situation where you're

129
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,810
tempted to buy a product, you can impose a
decision point kind of an

130
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,020
intervention.

131
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,770
We saw last week a hypothetical example of
someone swiping a card, and

132
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,800
then being prompted, "do you really want to
buy this product?"

133
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,650
Finally, you could use budgets.

134
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,759
You could use jars.

135
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,680
You could tell yourself, I'm only going to
spend $200 on a given product

136
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
in a given month.

137
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,880
You open the jar.

138
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,650
If there's no money in there, then you've
blown your budget, and that

139
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,410
acts as a wonderful self control device.
