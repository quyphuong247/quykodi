Hello, and welcome to the BE101x Introductions
ZeeMap.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,630
This is a quick introduction on how to use
this tool.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,429
Please use it to pin the location where you're
studying from in the world,

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:19,040
and give us a little bit of information about
yourself.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,570
You've already been given the link to the
website.

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,980
From the website, to add your information,
go to the top left corner

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,090
to the Additions menu item.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,980
Under the Additions menu, choose the Add Marker
simple tab.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,980
It'll bring a pop-up box where you can add
your name

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,512
and username you feel comfortable sharing;
your location-- please again choose a location

11
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:49,350
you feel comfortable sharing.

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,420
If you wish not to use your home address,
use a local landmark or perhaps a school you

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,520
studied from.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,420
And then in your description, give a little
bit about yourself.

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,100
To save time I'm just going to place this,
but yours can be much more interesting.

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,570
If you wish, you can add a photo.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,110
And you can change the marker.

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,250
The marker default is red.

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:16,090
After you've entered your information, you
can preview to see what it looks like.

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,760
Here it is here.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,030
And when you're happy, click Submit.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,450
You'll be given the chance to make edits.

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:31,080
So save the URL if you wish, click OK, and
when you're done, click Close.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,110
And there you are.

25
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,080
Everyone else with this, if you want to see
somebody's place,

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,230
just click on the tag and the information
will pop up.

27
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,810
We hope you enjoy this process and we look
forward to meeting all of you.

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,170
Enjoy.
