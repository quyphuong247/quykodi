00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:09,610
https://youtu.be/JylcR8n5r10
Remember again that there are four steps to
the process of

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,559
designing a nudge.

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,390
Mapping the context, selecting a nudge, identifying
a specific lever to

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,880
execute the nudge, and finally, the process
of designing and iterating

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,700
through experimentation.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,250
We've talked about the first two, and at the
end of those two stages, what

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,279
you've now got is a diagram that represents
decision making over time,

8
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,750
as well as a set of nudges that you could
potentially

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,170
implement at each stage.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,260
It's now time to think about specific ways
in which we can implement those

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,010
nudging strategies.

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,751
And what you see here is a list of common
levers that we use in

13
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,950
implementing some of those nudging strategies.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,080
Let's start with a simple lever, automatic
processes.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,260
Suppose you get people to automatically enroll
in organ donation

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,100
programs, or in retirement savings programs.

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,629
It just removes one step from the process,
because now they don't need

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,950
to open accounts.

19
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,110
They're already part of the process.

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,110
So that's a very powerful, simple nudging
strategy.

21
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,880
Second strategy, defaults.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,020
We've talked a lot about defaults in an earlier
session.

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,060
Changing the default changes the way in which
people make choices.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,110
Defaults are potentially interesting, because
every decision that we make,

25
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,060
be it buying a sandwich, enrolling in this
class, choosing to read the book,

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,869
everything has a default.

27
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,570
The default for the nudge book is to not read
it, but you've got to do

28
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,189
something to go out and get it.

29
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,090
The default for a sandwich, or a cafeteria
experience is to buy the

30
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,700
standard meal, and then move away.

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,479
And in many situations, people often waste
the default.

32
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,799
We don't know where defaults come from.

33
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,450
Could we somehow tinker around with the defaults
to steer people along

34
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,509
that decision path?

35
00:01:55,509 --> 00:02:00,090
Framing of information is another big potential
nudging strategy.

36
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,640
We've talked about the fact that framing information
as losses has a

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,590
much bigger impact than framing the same information
as a gain.

38
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,820
If you tell people that they should upgrade
to energy efficient appliances

39
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,021
because they would lose money every month
by not doing so, versus they

40
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:20,570
would gain by doing so there's a significant
increase in the number of

41
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,169
people that enroll.

42
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:27,250
Managing the choice set and presenting it
in different ways is yet another

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,670
common lever.

44
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,450
Rather than giving people a choice from out
of 60 or 100 different funds,

45
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,830
if you could somehow group and organize them
and lead people through

46
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,950
a multiple stage process where they first
select a category of funds and

47
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,200
then the actual fund itself, will ease the
decision making process.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,770
You could also simplify processes.

49
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,730
We've talked about the fact that when we impose
any transaction cost through

50
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,380
a decision point, that transaction costs tend
to inhibit progress towards

51
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,380
a particular outcome.

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,280
So if there's a behavior that you want to
restrict, you actually want to make

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,299
the process a bit more complex.

54
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:09,090
If it's a behavior that you want people to
accomplish, you want to make

55
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,180
the process as simple as possible.

56
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,549
Improving decision making through technology.

57
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,180
We've spoken about that a lot in this course,
and then finally, another

58
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,340
common nudging implementation strategy is
the way in which you change the

59
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,410
salience of the payment that people often
need to make.

60
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,260
Think about paying energy bills.

61
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,100
If you pay energy bills online, direct debit,
people don't notice the

62
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
economic impact.

63
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,609
If, on the other hand, you make people put
$0.05 on their grocery bill for

64
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:44,459
every single plastic bag they consume, it
becomes a salient cost.

65
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,889
And here I will make the argument that it
is a psychological impact of the

66
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,460
$0.05, and not the economic impact that actually
changes behavior.

67
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,610
So again, the principal is simple.

68
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,049
If you want to highlight the sunk cost effect,
if you want to get people to

69
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,299
consume something that they have prepaid for,
make sure you increase

70
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,790
the salience of the payment.

71
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,769
If you want people to not pay attention to
the sunk cost effect,

72
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,100
then, in fact, you reduce the salience of
the sunk cost effect.

73
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,410
So what we have here is a list of several
strategies that are commonly

74
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,620
used to implement some of the nudges that
we talked about.

75
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,540
Now again, at the end of this process we've
got perhaps a list of three,

76
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,340
four, five different nudging interventions,
different nudges we

77
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,850
could use to smoothen the flow of this decision
making process.

78
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,120
How do we decide which ones to prioritize
and which

79
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,450
ones to execute first?

80
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,570
There are four simple principles that we identify.

81
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,920
Principle number one, nudges that attack a
bottleneck in the upstream

82
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,790
part of any decision making process is generally
preferred to one that works

83
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,530
downstream.

84
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,490
If you improve the flow at the top of the
process, it is naturally going to

85
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,010
increase the flow throughout the rest of the
pipeline.

86
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,710
Principle number two, think about nudges that
have the

87
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,300
highest possible reach.

88
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,570
Think about interventions that deliver the
nudge to the most maximum number

89
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,740
of people that you possibly can, and choose
the one

90
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,940
that reaches the highest.

91
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,900
Principle number three.

92
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,890
Pick nudges that are simple and quick to execute.

93
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,820
The simpler you make the nudge and the quicker
you make it, the more likely

94
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,390
are you to see results sooner.

95
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,630
And finally, think through the long term effectiveness
of the nudge.

96
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,550
Some nudges work really well in the short
term, but once you un-nudge

97
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,931
people, and once you change the context back,
then in fact, the

98
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:40,950
effectiveness drops off.

99
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,890
Pick nudges that have higher, longer term
effectiveness than ones that have

100
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,300
lower long term effectiveness.

101
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,320
So these are four simple principles and simple
criteria that should help

102
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,750
you prioritize and select the one that you
should go for first.

103
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,440
Once you've selected, you now need to go into
a phase of

104
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,870
designing and iterating.

105
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,680
If it's a nudge that involves the manipulation
of information, you need

106
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,180
to think through how best to communicate that,
what's your vision

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,550
strategy, what is your media strategy?

108
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,960
You then need to design an experiment where
you can effectively identify the

109
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,370
cause and the effect, the fact that your selected
nudge actually results

110
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,139
in the outcome that you want it to.

111
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,490
Think about different designs that we've looked
at.

112
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,020
Are you going to use a simple two condition
design?

113
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,930
Are you going to use a fully crossed design,
or are you going to use a

114
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,870
before and after design?

115
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,681
And then finally, once you get data back from
your experiment, it

116
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:42,900
potentially gives you room to iterate and
update your nudge.

117
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,780
Perhaps you've done an experiment in which
you've tried to pit three nudges

118
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,130
against each other to see which one of them
creates the biggest

119
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,360
impact on the outcome.

120
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,431
And at the end of the experiment, you can
focus on just one or two, and

121
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:59,030
focus on the ones that give you the biggest
bang for the buck.

122
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,270
Let me end this module by talking about three
mantras for designing

123
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,360
nudges and working with a nudging initiative.

124
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,300
And I take the liberty of quoting Dick Thaler
on the first two.

125
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,400
Mantra number one is simple.

126
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,740
If you want to make people do something, make
sure that something is

127
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,730
easy to do, and perhaps fun to do.

128
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,590
The easier things are, the more likely are
people to do them.

129
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,100
Mantra number two, you cannot do evidence
based policy, or evidence

130
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,430
based business without evidence.

131
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,490
It is important to experiment, and not just
experiment once, but experiment

132
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,490
all the time.

133
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,700
Remember, we talk about triangulation, the
idea that you can collect evidence

134
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,680
from different kinds of subject populations,
different dependent

135
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,730
measures, and different contexts.

136
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,490
And if the multiple experiments that you run
all converge towards a common

137
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,310
conclusion, you now have solid evidence on
which you can base either

138
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,730
your business practice or policy.

139
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,550
Through those two mantras of Dick Thaler,
we add a third one, which is

140
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,580
to document your results diligently, simply,
and distribute them widely.

141
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,930
Unfortunately today, there is no central database
where nudges all over

142
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,560
the world can go and look for interventions
that other people have

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,650
done that have worked.

144
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,770
If only there were a common database that
in fact it would make it easier

145
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,180
for us, and that we would not need to reinvent
the wheel every single time

146
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,379
we wanted to come up with a new nudging intervention.
