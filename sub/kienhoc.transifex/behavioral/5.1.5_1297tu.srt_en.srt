00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,550
https://youtu.be/PTDzfulIo-g
Over the course of the past four weeks, we've
come to realize

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,900
that human behavior is, at its best, boundedly
rational.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,350
At its worst, it's a bit of a mess.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,270
How do we help people who clearly have a deficiency
in making optimal

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,840
decisions to make better choices.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,789
Let's draw a simple analogy between a cognitive
deficiency and a physical

7
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,460
deficiency.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,140
I once broke my leg.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,420
And when I thought about how to best help
myself get around from place to

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,500
place, I realize that there are two kinds
of strategies that we typically

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,329
use to help people with physical deficiencies.

12
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,230
The first strategy is to actually support
physical movement.

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,850
We do that by providing people with a crutch,
with an assistive device, with

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,850
a wheelchair, or a walker.

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,471
The second thing we need to do is to make
sure that the context, or the

16
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:59,360
environment in which they move around, is
a safe environment, and it is easy

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,059
for people to walk around or move around in
that environment.

18
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:06,670
And if you've got that same analogy to cognitive
deficiency, we'll again see

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,540
that there are two kinds of ways in which
we can help

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,670
people make better decisions.

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,700
A crutch approach, which simply means giving
them the tool to make better

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,520
choices, and a choice architectural approach,
or a context approach, which

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,790
is designing environments to where, in fact,
they are steered towards the

24
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,470
right choice.

25
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,530
Over the next little bit, we're to focus our
attention on the second of

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,150
the strategies, which is to design the right
environment.

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,240
And we'll focus on how to come up with processes
for designing nudges.

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,810
Now, before we actually get into the design
of nudges, there are a few

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,810
things that we need to keep in mind.

30
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,470
And in particular, there are five ideas that
I want us to focus on.

31
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,430
The first piece of advice that I would do
is simply this--

32
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,000
know your tools.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,630
Just like any plumber does before he or she
starts a new job, or any

34
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,509
carpenter, or any mason, you want to make
sure you understand exactly how

35
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,200
many hammers, and spanners, and wrenches you
have in your disposal.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,379
What are these tools?

37
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:11,950
These tools are twofold--
an understanding of the common mistakes that

38
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,959
people make in their
decision making process and an understanding

39
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,040
of things we could do to
correct those mistakes.

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,840
We've already looked at a number of phenomena--
mental accounting, choice over time, choice

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,499
overload, and
so on, and so forth.

42
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:30,079
And in the next module, we'll actually review
a lot of these tools with a

43
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,749
view to understanding exactly what are the
different kinds of strategies we

44
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:37,489
could use to help people make better choices.

45
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,389
Second, before you start designing you nudge
intervention, you want to make

46
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:45,769
sure you know exactly what behavior you want
to change.

47
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,110
Now this is a tricky process.

48
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,379
Sometimes we can define behavior change at
a very broad level.

49
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,069
For example, I want people to eat more healthy
food.

50
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,809
Or you could say something like, I want for
people's

51
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,249
savings rates to go up.

52
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:03,409
But if you think about it, each of these outcomes
has a number of

53
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:07,599
specific actions that need to happen to make
that outcome true.

54
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,719
For example, how do I get people to save more
money.

55
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,209
I need for them to actually open their retirement
account.

56
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,849
I need for them to make sure that they're
monitoring that retirement

57
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:21,999
account, and that they're reviewing and constantly
making changes as a

58
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:25,810
function of changes in the environment as
well as their own income.

59
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,620
Likewise, if I want people to increase their
recycling behaviors, there are a

60
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,599
few specific things that I need to do.

61
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,989
So when do you think about a nudge intervention,
you want to make sure

62
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,669
you're very precise in terms of what, exactly,
you want to happen as a

63
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:41,779
result of the nudge.

64
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:45,499
For example, do I want people that currently
have a bank

65
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:47,059
account to save more?

66
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:50,349
Or do I want more people to open bank accounts?

67
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,680
These are two very, very different outcomes.

68
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,510
But they might both result in the same grand
outcome, which is an increase in

69
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,319
the savings rates.

70
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,629
Third, clean up your pipes.

71
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:02,769
What does that mean?

72
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,859
Think about the following simple example.

73
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:10,599
Let's imagine I have a problem where I run
a call center where people call me

74
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,480
for help on how to save money.

75
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,510
Let's say it's a financial literacy center.

76
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,489
And I notice that there are a lot of dropped
calls.

77
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:20,459
There are dropped calls because people call
in, they wait

78
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,780
for a period of time.

79
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,000
Their calls don't get answered, and then they
hang up.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,360
I could think about a number of interesting
behavioral strategies to

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,350
keep those people in the line.

82
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,670
For example, I could play music.

83
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,130
I could give them information about how many
people are ahead

84
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,509
of them in the call.

85
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,659
Or I could give them some other distraction
task to keep them engaged

86
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,150
in the process.

87
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,710
However, if I have a faulty process for actually
answering the calls, then

88
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,740
these interventions are not going to play
a big role.

89
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,960
For example, suppose I have no triaging system
where a caller calls

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,590
in, reports the kind of information they need,
and then their calls get

91
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,740
directed to one of five different agents.

92
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,220
If that doesn't happen, then the wait times
are going to be incredibly large

93
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,970
to begin with.

94
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,169
And so what do you really need to do is to
make sure that your processes

95
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,500
for delivering the service are as good as
they can be before you nudge people

96
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,860
into doing what you want them to do.

97
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,750
Having a clean pipe allows the nudging intervention
to work

98
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,819
as best as it can.

99
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:27,800
Having a clogged pipe reduces the effectiveness
of the nudging

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
intervention.

101
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,500
So simple advice--
make sure your processes are as good as they

102
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,319
can possibly be.

103
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,590
Fourth, keep in mind that, eventually, you
will need to experiment.

104
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,039
Once you come up with a nudge, once you come
up with an intervention, you

105
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,259
need to be able to assign people to a control
condition, some other people

106
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,440
to the treatment condition, and then to be
able to test for the

107
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,219
effectiveness of the nudge.

108
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:54,810
And so make sure that you have all of the
processes in place that will allow

109
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,560
you to come up with that particular experiment.

110
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,310
And fifth, ask yourself the question, is nudging
indeed

111
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,289
the best option here?

112
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,080
Are there other alternatives?

113
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,039
Is it the case that, perhaps, an economic
incentive is better than a

114
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,530
nudging incentive.

115
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,819
As we said before, it is always a mistake
to think about the four

116
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:21,249
strategies of behavioral changes as competing
against each other.

117
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:25,889
We need to think about having then collaborate
to make sure that we end

118
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,289
up with the kinds of outcomes that we want.

119
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,840
Remember we said that outcomes like increasing
financial well being have

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,530
multiple components?

121
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,370
Perhaps some of those components are best
dealt with by an economic

122
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,370
intervention.

123
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,129
Perhaps others are best dealth with by using
persuasion.

124
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:44,290
And yet other are dealt best by using a nudging
strategy.

125
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,349
It is important for us to think through which
is the best fit for each

126
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,320
one before designing a nudging strategy.

127
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,590
And finally, let me again emphasize the importance
of clearly identifying

128
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,909
the behavior that you want to change.

129
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:02,349
You want to make sure that the behavior that
you identify is simple,

130
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:07,029
it is easy to observe, and, in fact, it can
be measured easily so that you

131
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,090
can experiment with it.

132
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,439
Once you've come to the work area, you've
cleaned up your pipes, and you

133
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,069
know what your tools are, you are now ready
to begin the process of

134
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,089
designing nudges.
