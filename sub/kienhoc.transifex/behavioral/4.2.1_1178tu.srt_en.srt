How should people make good rational choices?

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,950
A couple of weeks back, we saw a model of
decision-making that looked

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,370
something like this.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,220
We said that the utility of a given option
or a given product is a

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,520
function of the combined utility that is delivered
by each of its

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,630
attributes.

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,960
In particular, if you can decompose a product
into multiple attributes and

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,140
you can assess the importance of each of those
attributes to your decision,

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,980
then the utility is the sum of w, which is
the weighting that you place

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,870
on a given attribute, multiplied by the utility
of that attribute, added

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,630
across all of the attributes.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,579
A simpler version of that same model is the
second equation that you see in

13
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:54,110
this chart, where you simply multiply the
weighting of a given attribute by

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:01:00,180
the value of that attribute, wi multiplied
by xi, and add that up

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,649
across all of the attributes.

16
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,881
If you really think about that systematic
form of decision-making, it

17
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:07,850
requires a lot of effort.

18
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,290
How does a consumer, for example, choose between
two products, product a

19
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,610
and product b?

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,799
How does a policymaker decide which of two
policy options he

21
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,799
or she should choose?

22
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,539
Here's what they need to do.

23
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:22,799
They need to decompose that policy or that
product into as many as relevant

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,439
attributes as they think are important.

25
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,499
Then they need to come up with an importance
weighting for each of those

26
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:29,499
attributes.

27
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:34,749
Finally, they need to evaluate each attribute
on a scale, multiply the

28
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:38,920
weight by the value of the attribute, add
up the total to give them the

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,600
utility or value of every given option, and
then pick the option that

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,969
actually provides the highest value.

31
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:47,889
This is a very complex process.

32
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,779
Most of us don't engage in that process for
every single

33
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,240
decision that we make.

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,560
Instead, we follow something called intuition.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
What is intuition?

36
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,069
And I'm going to read for you a definition
of intuition that Robin

37
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:03,630
Hogarth first proposed in his book.

38
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,389
He said that intuitive choices or judgments
are reached without little

39
00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:09,220
apparent awareness.

40
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,610
But in fact, they typically involve very little
conscious deliberation.

41
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,650
Sometimes we make intuitive judgments in the
snap of a finger.

42
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,489
We call them gut feel reactions.

43
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,850
We call them visceral reactions.

44
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,909
Sometimes we go to a store, and we simply
know what we're going to by

45
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:27,270
just looking at products.

46
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,689
Or we look at policy options and we know what
the right thing is.

47
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,849
So what is intuition, and where does it come
from?

48
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,120
The first thing I want to keep in mind is
that intuition is

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,790
not necessarily emotion.

50
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,569
When you have a good intuition, it doesn't
mean that you're just acting

51
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,760
on an emotional response.

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,909
What it instead means is that you have somehow
developed a fast approach, a

53
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:54,459
sophisticated, yet quick approach to making
choices and making judgments.

54
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,760
Where does that sophistication come from?

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,319
Typically it comes from expertise.

56
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,360
Think about a doctor.

57
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,510
A doctor has spent 10, 15 years of their lifetime
seeing patients who

58
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,390
present themselves with a certain set of symptoms,
and they have learned the

59
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,489
correlation between those symptoms and a particular
disease.

60
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,250
It's not that they have a mathematical equation
in their head.

61
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,209
But every time they see a certain cluster
of symptoms happening at the

62
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:24,329
same time, they know it's got to be disease
a or disease b or disease c.

63
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,819
That is intuition.

64
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,799
That is a learned set of intuition, because
what the expert has done is

65
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,280
they have accumulated their knowledge over
a period of time.

66
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,969
They have somehow assessed correlation between
different variables.

67
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:41,250
And they have then come up with the quick
response to that particular set

68
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,709
of stimuli.

69
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,010
Likewise, a consumer could have an intuitive
set of preferences that they

70
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,630
use in making choices.

71
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,489
I know what sort of colors I like.

72
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,040
I know what sort of fragrances I like.

73
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,050
And I know what sort of visual appearance
I want.

74
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,569
So when I go to a store and pick up a product,
like a quilt or a product of

75
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,480
art, I don't necessarily spend the time decomposing
that product into its

76
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,019
attributes, because I know what I like when
I see it.

77
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,489
And that, again, is intuition.

78
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,019
So in sum, you can think of intuition as being
something that arises from

79
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:18,269
expertise, it arises from a vast experience
of dealing with similar

80
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,300
tasks in the past.

81
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,570
And the process that is used to arrive at
that intuitive judgment is

82
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,320
something called pattern matching.

83
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
What is pattern matching?

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,560
It is a process people look at their historic
database, if you will, of

85
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,331
similar choices that they've made, make a
comparison, and say, gee, this

86
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:42,940
situation looks a whole lot like something
else I did two years back,

87
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,050
retrieve from memory what they did there,
and apply that

88
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,650
to the present situation.

89
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,070
So pattern matching can be a very quick process
and a very seemingly

90
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,260
effortless process, but it doesn't mean that
it is made mindlessly.

91
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,760
It simply means that the individual is using
a lot of rich history in order

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,540
to make that quick, intuitive decision.

93
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,340
When does good learning happen based on experiences
in the past?

94
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,540
Good learning happens when you get feedback,
when that feedback is quick,

95
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,170
and when the feedback is unambiguous.

96
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,200
Think of a weather forecaster.

97
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,660
Weather forecaster makes a prediction, like
it's going to rain.

98
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,590
Within a day, they know whether it has rained
or not.

99
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,940
There's no ambiguity to the fact that it has
rained or not rained.

100
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,320
And the feedback is quick.

101
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,070
As a result, weather forecasters not only
get quick feedback and

102
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,220
unambiguous feedback, they get lots of it,
because they make these judgments

103
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,770
every single day.

104
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,310
Research shows that in fact weather forecasters
are fairly

105
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,870
well-calibrated.

106
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,870
What does that mean?

107
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,910
It means they have a good intuition about
how much they know.

108
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,880
In fact, when they say that they're confident,
they are generally fairly

109
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,650
confident that that outcome is going to happen.

110
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,130
When they say they're not confident, then
in fact they

111
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,900
are truly not confident.

112
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,940
But they have a good handle on how much they
know.

113
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,630
Finally, it's helpful to compare an intuitive
process of decision-making

114
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,280
with a more analytical process of decision-making.

115
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,570
The right hand side, we've talked about what
an analytical

116
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,720
process looks like.

117
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,310
What you do is you look at your past experiences,
your past decisions, and

118
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,930
use those decisions to formulate a model of
relevant attributes, and the

119
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,550
importance of those attributes.

120
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,990
You then use the model in a very systematic,
deliberate, and

121
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,670
computational manner to use data from the
existing

122
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,030
situation and make a choice.

123
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,960
On the other hand, intuitive processes also
use history, but they use history

124
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,150
to develop this engine that we call intuition.

125
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,410
Think of intuition as a regression equation
sitting in your head, which

126
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,640
is quick and which lets you make decisions
in the snap of a finger.

127
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,790
And it is that intuition that can be trained
effectively, and you can learn

128
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,440
intuition by getting good feedback.
