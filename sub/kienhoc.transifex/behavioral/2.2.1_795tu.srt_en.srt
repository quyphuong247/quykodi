Making investment decisions is hard--
partly because there's a lot of information

2
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:16,540
in manuals like this one.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,900
But as well, there are just too many choices.

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,090
And it turns out that, in fact, too many choices
exist not just in

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,349
investment options, but in a number of different
categories.

6
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:27,620
I grew up in India.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,809
And back in the 1970s and 1980s, I used to
go to the grocery store and

8
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:35,250
ask for bread, and I would be given bread.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,969
When I came to the United States for the very
first time

10
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:39,350
in 1991, I was shocked.

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,809
And my culture shock happened when I saw that.

12
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:48,550
The average American grocery store had about
25 different varieties of bread.

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,530
It had about 60 varieties of soft drinks.

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,070
It had about 120 varieties of headache medicine.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,579
And about 60 varieties of breakfast cereal.

16
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,699
And over the past 20 years, these numbers
have grown exponentially.

17
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:04,230
They've grown not just in supermarket categories,
and not just in your

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,200
traditional packaged goods categories, but
in services, as well.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,580
In restaurants, the average restaurant menu
has grown dramatically over the

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,210
past several years.

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,650
A number of years back, I was at a local Chinese
takeout restaurant.

22
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,640
I was looking through his menu, which looks
like this.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
It's long.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
It's comprehensive.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,250
It's got about 185 different items in this
menu.

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,110
And I was having a chat with the owner of
the Chinese takeout, and he asked

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,490
me a very simple question.

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,500
He said, professor, since you study interesting
human behavior, I've put a

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
puzzle for you.

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,170
I asked him, what?

31
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,610
And the puzzle was, and he said, I have 185
items on my menu.

32
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,310
Yet, 80% of my sales come from only five items.

33
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,470
Why does that happen?

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,840
Now, another example, or another category
in which you see a lot of

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,590
choice, is paints.

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,990
My neighbor recently wanted to get his house
repainted.

37
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,580
He knew he wanted to use a shade of beige
in his living room.

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,410
When he went to the store, this is what he
saw.

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,070
There were 55 different varieties of beige
in that particular store.

40
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,490
And, again, at the end of it, he did not know
how to choose.

41
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,629
The growth of choice is becoming a big problem
in many different product

42
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,180
categories.

43
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,469
Choice is fueled by two simple assumptions.

44
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:27,319
Assumption number one is that the more choice
you give people, the more

45
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,569
likely they are to find something that best
matches their needs.

46
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,480
Assumption number two is people need freedom
of choice, that people feel

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,239
better when they have more choice than less.

48
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,209
And it turns out that both of these assumptions
are actually true.

49
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,340
Yet, people report, that they feel too much
of a pressure and too much stress

50
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,330
when they make decisions in a number of product
categories.

51
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,640
So, psychologically, what happens when you
give people a lot of choice?

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,239
There's two or three things that jump out.

53
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,980
The first thing that jumps out is the idea
that when you give people lots of

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,980
options, they, in fact, need to make fairly
complex calculations.

55
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,560
The computations involved, the cognition involved,
is fairly

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,310
elaborate, and people don't have the ability
to perform those calculations.

57
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,950
The second thing that happens is that the
potential for regret goes up.

58
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,150
What's going to happen is you're in a store.

59
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,420
You pick up this particular shade of beige.

60
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,200
But then you go home, you paint your walls,
and you say, I wish I had

61
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,079
picked something that was darker.

62
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:30,049
And so in choices that can't be reversed,
greater assortment leads to

63
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,499
greater regret.

64
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:34,250
The third thing that happens relates to a
phenomenon that was first

65
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,900
documented by Chris Hsee who is a professor
at the

66
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,769
University of Chicago.

67
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,150
He talked about the difference between joint
evaluation and separate

68
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,540
evaluation.

69
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,620
Think about the following example.

70
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,400
You go to a store to buy stereos.

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,419
You see 15, 20, 25 different types of products
in the store.

72
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:55,260
You listen to them carefully.

73
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,300
You think about something called the harmonic
distortion of the stereo.

74
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,629
And the fact that you've got 15 in front of
you makes it easier for you

75
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:07,239
to compare the harmonic distortion, and pick
the one that has the lowest

76
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,900
harmonic distortion.

77
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,439
You take it home, and you realize it doesn't
actually look very nice.

78
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,219
It's an ugly looking piece of equipment.

79
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:18,489
What's happened here is when you've given
people a large assortment,

80
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,690
certain attributes--
in this case, the harmonic distortion--

81
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,560
seem to impact decision making to a great
degree.

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,900
But when you go home, and you do not have
a standard for comparison, that

83
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,380
attribute doesn't matter anymore.

84
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,780
And so, essentially, what's happening here
is that greater assortments

85
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,229
creates a greater distance between your choice
and what keeps you happy.
