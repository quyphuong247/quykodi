In 2001, Drazen Prelec and Duncan Simister
conducted a couple

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,350
of experiments to ask a very simple question.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,390
Does the use of a credit card increase spending?

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,830
In their paper, the idea was to test the notion
that the willingness to pay

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,820
increases when people pay using a credit card
rather than using cash.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,240
The paper presented two studies of which we'll
focus on one.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,320
This was a lab experiment in which participants
made choices that had

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,719
real consequences.

9
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:42,730
Participants were 64 MBA students, and the
experiment used a single factor

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,850
design in which there were two levels.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,719
The factor was the payment mechanism used,
and participants were put in

12
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,649
either the credit card condition or the cash
condition.

13
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,379
Now, the procedure of this experiment was
very simple.

14
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:02,600
Participants were given a chance to purchase
a ticket for a sporting event

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,820
in an auction setting.

16
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,280
And in fact, they were asked to write down
the reservation prices or the

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,810
prices they would like to bid for three items.

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,710
The first item was a pair of tickets for the
Boston Celtics and Miami game,

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,680
the second item was a pair of tickets for
the Red Sox Toronto game, and the

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,150
third item was a consolation prize that had
one Celtics banner and one

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,380
Red Sox banner.

22
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,870
The rule that was used to determine the winner
was as follows.

23
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,791
The auction followed something called a second
price sealed bid auction, in

24
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:44,630
which the prize is given to the person who
wrote down the highest value, but

25
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,869
it is sold at a price equal to the second
highest stated value.

26
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,420
Now, in the credit card condition, participants
were told that the

27
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,729
payment would be made by credit card, and
they were asked to write down

28
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,219
their credit card details, the card type,
the expiration date, and so on

29
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:07,740
and so forth, much as they would need to do
if they ordered any product or

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,040
service using a credit card.

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,520
In the cash condition, participants were told
that they would

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,630
actually pay by cash.

33
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:22,840
They had access to an ATM, and therefore liquidity
was not an issue.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,250
The data analysis technique was simply a comparison
of means of the two

35
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,760
groups, the credit card and the cash group,
and the

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,660
results were as follows.

37
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,340
In this graph here, the gray bars represent
the average of participants

38
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,010
who were in the cash condition, whereas the
red bars represent the

39
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,200
average for people who were in the credit
card condition.

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,010
Now, for the three prizes, the tickets for
the Celtics game, the Red Sox

41
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:00,290
game, as well as the banners, you see that
the red bars are always greater

42
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,519
or taller than the gray bars.

43
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,909
However, it turns out that the difference
between the two bars is

44
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:16,000
significant for the Celtics ticket, for the
Red Sox ticket, but not for

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,020
the banners, and that's represented by the
t values here.

46
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
In 2001, Drazen Prelec and Duncan Simister
conducted a couple

47
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020

focus on one.

51
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,020
This was a lab experiment in which participants

52
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
either the credit card condition or the cash

56
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Now, the procedure of this experiment was
very simple.

57
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,020
Participants were given a chance to purchase
a ticket for a sporting event

58
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,020
in an auction setting.
And in fact, they were asked to write down

59
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
the reservation prices or the
prices they would like to bid for three items.

60
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
The first item was a pair of tickets for the
Boston Celtics and Miami game,

61
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
the second item was a pair of tickets for
the Red Sox Toronto game, and the

62
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,020
third item was a consolation prize that had
one Celtics banner and one

63
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
Red Sox banner.
The rule that was used to determine the winner

64
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,020
was as follows.
The auction followed something called a second

65
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,020
price sealed bid auction, in
which the prize is given to the person who

66
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
wrote down the highest value, but
it is sold at a price equal to the second

67
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
highest stated value.
Now, in the credit card condition, participants

68
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,020
were told that the
payment would be made by credit card, and

69
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,020
they were asked to write down
their credit card details, the card type,

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,020
the expiration date, and so on
and so forth, much as they would need to do

71
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
if they ordered any product or
service using a credit card.

72
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,020
In the cash condition, participants were told
that they would

73
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,020
actually pay by cash.
They had access to an ATM, and therefore liquidity

74
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,020
was not an issue.
The data analysis technique was simply a comparison

75
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
of means of the two
groups, the credit card and the cash group,

76
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,020
and the
results were as follows.

77
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
In this graph here, the gray bars represent
the average of participants

78
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
who were in the cash condition, whereas the
red bars represent the

79
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
average for people who were in the credit
card condition.

80
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
Now, for the three prizes, the tickets for
the Celtics game, the Red Sox

81
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,020
game, as well as the banners, you see that
the red bars are always greater

82
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,020
or taller than the gray bars.
However, it turns out that the difference

83
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
between the two bars is
significant for the Celtics ticket, for the

84
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
Red Sox ticket, but not for
the banners, and that's represented by the

85
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
t values here.
Remember we said that the test statistic can

86
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
be converted into
something called a p score?

87
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,020
In most experimental analysis, a p less than
5% suggests that the

88
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,020
difference is statistically significant.
If p exceeds 5% or 0.05, that in fact, the

89
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
differences between the two
conditions are not statistically significant,

90
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
or not different from
each other.

91
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
So what did this experiment show?
Using a simple two condition design, Prelec

92
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
and Simister were able to show
that purchasing a product with a credit card

93
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
rather than cash increased
the amount of money that people are willing

94
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,020
to pay.
And as you can see, those numbers, the premium

95
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,810
that people were willing to
pay, were about 113% for the Celtics tickets,

96
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:22,490
76% for the Red Sox tickets,
and 59% for the banners, although again, this

97
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,320
difference was not
significant.
