What does it mean to be rational?

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,550
Perhaps the best way of answering that question
is to go

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,379
through a simple example.

4
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,810
Suppose a friend of yours comes to you and
says, Dilip, how much should I

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,300
save for a diamond?

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,710
How would you advise that person to proceed?

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,890
Well, it turns out that economics has a very
handy model to describe how

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,829
this person should go about making that decision.

9
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,120
That model is called the life cycle hypothesis.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,520
And without getting into too much detail,
what the hypothesis

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,750
essentially says is, you want to look at the
net present value of your

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,670
future income stream.

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,199
You want to look at the net present value
of your

14
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,980
future consumption stream.

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,449
And then set your savings decision such that
the present value of those

16
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,780
two numbers is the same.

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,409
Sounds simple.

18
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:56,269
It's something you can write in an equation.

19
00:00:56,269 --> 00:01:00,719
It takes all of a one inch by two inches in
a textbook to express.

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,059
But let's think about what a human being really
has to do to make the

21
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,170
equation work.

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,170
Thing number one.

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,960
I need to understand my exact consumption
streams

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,410
until the time I die.

25
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,590
I need to know how many children I'm going
to have.

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,970
What sort of lifestyle we're going to live.

27
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,910
Whether we're going to enjoy the movies, we're
going to enjoy living in

28
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,190
an apartment, a condo building, a house.

29
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,190
Thing number two.

30
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,690
I need to know exactly what my income streams
are going to look like.

31
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,140
Thing number three.

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,340
I'm going to need to think about what the
economy is going to look like.

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,300
What my interest rates are going to be.

34
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,220
What my investments are going to do.

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,140
And I could go on and on, listing the kinds
of information you would need to

36
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,740
know to answer that question.

37
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,380
I don't know anyone who can actually do any
of this.

38
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,280
And that, essentially, is the difference between
an irrational human

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,350
being, and what is an economically rational
person.

40
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,250
So what does it mean to be rational?

41
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,850
Well, there's a lot of things that go into
the definition of rationality,

42
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,910
but I'm going to be very simple in this video,
and I'm going to focus on

43
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,179
what I call the four C's of rationality.

44
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,170
And here they are.

45
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,370
Completeness of information, cognition, the
ability to think

46
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,859
through problems, computational ability, which
is the ability to

47
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:24,510
process information and make fairly complex
calculations, and finally,

48
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,329
consistency in decision making, both internal
and external.

49
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:31,790
Let's go through each one of them in detail.

50
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,989
Start off with completeness of information.

51
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,920
I think it's pretty fair to say that not a
single person who is listening

52
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,019
to this will agree with the economists that
it is possible to completely know

53
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,670
all of the information about your future state
of the world.

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,599
It just isn't going to happen.

55
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,389
There might be some decisions where you have
completeness, but in most

56
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,519
decisions, you don't.

57
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,060
Even when you go to a store to buy a product,
there are always issues like

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,269
safety, and warranty, and after sale service
that you don't have

59
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,700
information about.

60
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,840
The second point that we talked about was
cognition, the ability of human

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,290
beings to make completely unemotional decisions.

62
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,069
And that's important from a rational perspective.

63
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:17,340
If you're a rational agent, what you want
to do is to look at only elements

64
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,599
of the decision-making that adds something
called utility to your

65
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,629
choice, and look at those, and only those.

66
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:27,239
But it turns out human beings look at all
kinds of other things.

67
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,390
Regret is one of my favorite examples.

68
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,859
What is regret?

69
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,560
Regret is the emotion of wishing that you
had chosen something that you did

70
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,739
not choose.

71
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,870
Regret happens in all sorts of situations.

72
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,750
So you look at a movie listing.

73
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,389
You're thinking about which movie to watch.

74
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:48,829
You end up picking a movie that seems great
on everything that's been

75
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,209
written there, but you go and watch it, and
you hate it.

76
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,120
And you say, gee, I wish I had seen the other
movie.

77
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,239
That's regret, all right?

78
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,370
And regret can actually affect decision-making
in a number of

79
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,519
different ways.

80
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:01,519
Simple example.

81
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,480
I had a friend, curiously, an economist, who
was looking at a

82
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,129
membership to a health club.

83
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,359
His building had a health club.

84
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,879
They were offering a 30% discount, and like
any good economist, he thought,

85
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,329
and thought, and thought about that membership.

86
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:21,110
And he thought for so long, that the club
withdrew the 30% discount, and

87
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,340
replaced it with a 15% discount.

88
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,319
And my friend said that he did not want to
sign up for the health club at

89
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,000
15%, because he could have had the same membership
for 30%.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,139
That's an example of a regret from a previous
decision influencing your

91
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,370
future decision.

92
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,349
And it's not just my friend.

93
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:45,169
The number of people that should have bought
a stock that's going up for $10

94
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:49,569
but don't, because they could have bought
it for $7 is stunningly high.

95
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,599
So again, we see examples of these emotional
responses to decision-making

96
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:56,490
in a number of different spectrums.

97
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,860
The third C of rationality is something called
computational ability.

98
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,900
If you can go back to our decision-making
on how much to save

99
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,520
for the future, there's a lot of computations
that are involved.

100
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,400
There's obviously addition, there is multiplication,
there is summation,

101
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,490
there is discounting.

102
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,370
So even if you had perfect information on
all the numbers, the sheer act of

103
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,780
computing the outcome is problematic, it's
difficult.

104
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,550
And think of it as follows.

105
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,620
You're essentially trying to solve a complex
problem, it's an optimization

106
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,900
problem, that, in the world of computing for
example, can best be

107
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,750
handled by a Sun supercomputer, but now you're
giving it to

108
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,470
your laptop to process.

109
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,330
What happens there is the laptop, at some
point in time, simply freezes,

110
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,110
cannot handle the data, and gives up.

111
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,680
So what human beings tend to do is, they tend
to try and find short cuts

112
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,449
so that they can actually make decisions,
given their limited

113
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:56,879
cognitive abilities.

114
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,080
Herbert Simon was a Nobel Laureate in Economics,
and he first came up with a

115
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,430
term called bounded rationality.

116
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,289
And what he was saying when he meant that
was, he

117
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,129
said, people are rational.

118
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:09,830
They could have been rational if, in fact,
their heads were replaced by a

119
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,710
supercomputer, but now that they only have
that little laptop, they had to

120
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,220
be boundedly rational.

121
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,889
So in the context of the limited cognitive
ability that they have,

122
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,879
they're still rational, but it's just that
they can't go

123
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,570
beyond a certain limit.

124
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,009
So we've often heard terms like that.

125
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,610
We've heard the idea that attention is constrained,
because if you think

126
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,820
about perfect rationality, you need to be
able to soak up lots of

127
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,919
information.

128
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,530
But it turns out there is competition for
our attention.

129
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,229
We're looking at the products that they're
looking to buy.

130
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:46,120
We've got our BlackBerrys, our watch, we've
got our kids yelling at us.

131
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,560
And when you think about a world as complex
as that, we can only devote so

132
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,120
much attention to the stimulus, and that's
why we never pick up all of the

133
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,819
information that's necessary to make a good
decision.

134
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:04,580
Finally, the big idea of rationality is contained
in the fourth C of the

135
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,139
four C's that I talked about.

136
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,020
And that is a C called consistency, both internal
and external.

137
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,180
Now, when you think about the mathematical
modeling of rationality,

138
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,580
there's a fairly complex set of algorithms
and theorems that actually

139
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,780
describe what rational choice looks like.

140
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,710
And in order to understand those, we want
to first look at this, which is a

141
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,900
simple mathematical expression of the utility
that a product offers to an

142
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,900
individual.

143
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,440
If you look at equation, U stands for utility.

144
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,939
And what it says is that the utility is the
sum of w multiplied by the x.

145
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:43,939
What is x?

146
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:48,060
It is the attribute or the outcome that could
potentially happen as a

147
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,099
result of you making that choice.

148
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,699
And the w stands for the weightage that you
assign to that outcome.

149
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:55,830
Simple example.

150
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,419
Let's say you toss a coin.

151
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,850
It comes heads or tails.

152
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,139
If it comes heads, then I give you $100.

153
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,520
If it comes tails, you give me $50.

154
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,469
The way I'm going to capture that using this
equation is, I'm going to

155
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,810
say that the weight is here, the probability
of each of these outcomes,

156
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,001
0.5, multiplied by the utility of the value
that I assign to the $100, or

157
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:18,850
the minus $50.

158
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,960
Think about applying the same equation in
a different setting, where you're

159
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,289
choosing a product from a multiple set.

160
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,580
In this case, the x's are going to stand for
the different attributes of

161
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,300
the product, the quality, the price, the size,
the shipping costs, and the

162
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,789
w's are going to stand for how important each
of these attributes are

163
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,500
to you, the decision maker.

164
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,000
So again, this is a fairly general model.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,589
It captures all kinds of choice situations,
but what is center to all

166
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,860
of these is the idea that, somehow, these
different outcomes, these

167
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,670
different attributes, combined with an importance
