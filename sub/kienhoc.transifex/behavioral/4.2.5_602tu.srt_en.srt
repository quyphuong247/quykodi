Think about intuition again.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,120
We said earlier that you could model intuition
using regression by an

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,890
equation that might look like this--
judgment equals to some constant plus B1 times

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,670
Q1 plus B2 times Q2 and so on
and so forth.

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,700
Why would we actually look at our own judgments
and use

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,340
regression to model them?

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,660
This at least three reasons why this can be
beneficial.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,219
The first is it gives you insight into your
own decision making policy and

9
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:38,590
your own judgment policy.

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,000
It's almost like opening up your head and
figuring out how you make choices

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,980
and how you make decisions.

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,433
In particular, if you find yourself in a situation
where you say, well, gee,

13
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:50,540
I know I want to choose, but I'm not quite
sure why.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,470
This might be a wonderful technique.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,500
Looking at the coefficients of the different
Qs will let you understand

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,670
what you consider important and conversely
what you don't.

17
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,430
And perhaps once you have insight into that
process, you can then start

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,790
making changes and corrections to your own
judgment policy.

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,350
Perhaps you thought you were weighing price
to a great degree in your

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,400
decisions, but the data tells you that you
don't.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,829
So simply looking a your own equation gives
you A, a better insight, and B,

22
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,240
avenues for improving the quality of your
decision making.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,560
Second, you can actually use a model like
this to track changes in your own

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,340
decision making policy as a function of time.

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,569
You could run regressions like this at every
six months intervals.

26
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:39,369
You can see if the importance of certain attributes
has

27
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,850
gone up or gone down.

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,049
And again, you can perhaps more explicit about
whether, in fact, those

29
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,880
attributes should have become more important--
or not.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,929
Third, you can use the model of other people
that you consider as good

31
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:58,369
judges as a benchmark into your own decision
making.

32
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,951
Let's imagine you're a doctor.

33
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:03,709
And let's imagine that there is a physician
whose judgment you trust.

34
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,549
This physician always makes the right diagnosis.

35
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:07,689
And you wonder how they do it.

36
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,830
What you could do is you could try and convince
that physician to run a

37
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,920
judgment bootstrap of their own clinical diagnosis.

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,629
At the end of that process, you end up with
an equation.

39
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,510
And that equation well tell you the likelihood
of the patient having

40
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,810
disease A verses disease B in a regression
form.

41
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,030
You could then potentially compare your own
judgment policy with the

42
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,110
policy of this expert.

43
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,520
You could actually make this process a bit
more complex.

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,140
Let's imagine that you have two or three experts,
one who is an expert in

45
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,969
domain A, a second one in domain B, a third
one in domain C.

46
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:47,269
So let's say Doctor A is great at making judgments
about children's

47
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,000
illnesses, Doctor B at neurological problems,
Doctor

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,780
C at cardiac problems.

49
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,659
What you could do is you can then create different
models

50
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:58,939
for each one of them.

51
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,090
There you could draw Doctor A's expertise
in one domain and Doctor B's

52
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,410
in a second and Doctor C's in a third.

53
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,469
And you can become a lot more nuanced with
modeling the intuition that you

54
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:12,460
have of these different positions.

55
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,909
So in some, decision analysis is interesting
because it not only lets

56
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:20,329
you understand your own decision making process,
but it also lets you

57
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:23,650
benchmark and improve that process with time.

58
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,280
And as we look in week five and week six of
this course, we actually look

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,560
at some very specific ways in which you could
use this insight in

60
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,519
improving your own decision making.
