With the view to helping people understand
the process and

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,510
develop a framework for how to develop nudges,
my group here at the Rotman

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,039
School of Management and I have developed
a guide that we call the

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,660
Practitioner's Guide to Nudging.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,990
A lot of the content from this guide is actually
going to be part of the

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,470
reading material for this class.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,740
And in fact, today, you will see a link in
your materials to a PDF

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,470
version of this guide, as well.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,910
What we do with the guide is to identify a
simple, four stage process

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,870
of how to go about designing a nudge.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,010
The four stages are mapping the context--
mapping the decision--

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,640
selecting the nudge, identifying a specific
lever that you're going to

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,240
use to implement the nudge, and then finally,
a process of designing and

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,280
iterating on that nudge.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,170
So let's start off with the process of mapping,
or decision context.

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,630
What does it mean to map a context?

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,539
It means the following thing.

18
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,899
When we think about an outcome, such as saving
more for retirement or

19
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,770
leading a healthier lifestyle, there are several
stages that the consumer

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,060
goes through in order to actually make a sequence
of decisions that result in

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,529
that final outcome.

22
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:19,679
Mapping exactly what the sequence of decisions
looks like and what there

23
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:23,329
key considerations are when they make those
decisions is perhaps one of the

24
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:28,259
most important things to do when we start
working on a nudging strategy.

25
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,279
As part of the PDF version of the guide I
just talked about, an appendix

26
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:36,659
in that guide gives you a simple form with
a checklist for the kinds of

27
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,049
things you need to make notes on when you
ordered that

28
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,920
decision making process.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,520
What are the properties of the decision to
be made itself?

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,069
Is it a simple binary choice?

31
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:49,109
Yes, no.

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,319
Or are there multiple stages in that decision?

33
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,880
Are there many options from which the person
needs to choose?

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,189
Or are there simply two?

35
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:59,149
Are there simple choices?

36
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,729
Or do people need to make judgments on a continuous
case?

37
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:06,159
For example, a simple choice would be do I
choose Fund A versus Fund B?

38
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,280
A more complex judgment would be how many
dollars should I put into my

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,020
retirement account each month, and should
that number change as a

40
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,300
function of time?

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,780
The other set of factors to look at include
the information that people

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,290
need and use in making that decision.

43
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,370
How is the information presented to them?

44
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,540
Is it too much?

45
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,860
Is it too little?

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,690
In what medium do they get the information?

47
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,760
Is it in text?

48
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,170
Is it online?

49
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,659
Or does it come through them through some
kind of other channel?

50
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,680
Is it textual information?

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,130
Or is it visual information?

52
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,750
And is the information framed in a particular
manner

53
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,810
versus a different manner?

54
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,750
It's important to audit all of those things.

55
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,989
What is the mindset of the individual when
they actually make that decision?

56
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,170
Are they implementation focused?

57
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,360
Or are they in a planning focus?

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,099
Are they myopic?

59
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,190
Or are they employing a long term window?

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,709
Where do they make the choice?

61
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,750
Is it made in the store where they have time
constraints?

62
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,040
Or are they making the choice at home, sitting
alone in the comfort of their

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,260
living room?

64
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,390
Is it a choice that is made in the presence
of somebody else?

65
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,180
Or was it a choice that they make independently?

66
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,520
And finally, again, environmental and social
factors need to be audited and

67
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,609
documented.

68
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:25,030
Is the decision going to be publicly visible?

69
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,930
Or is it something that the person can make
on their own and nobody else will

70
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,219
know about their choice?

71
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:33,640
Is it a product category, which is conspicuously
consumed?

72
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,700
Or is it something that is silent and hidden?

73
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,450
Is the choice made in a group setting?

74
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,780
Is it made in an individual setting?

75
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,930
These and other factors are part of this checklist
and are always a great

76
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,469
place to start when you design a nudge, because
it gives you all the

77
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:54,120
information that you need to know when you
start thinking through what the

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,390
right intervention should be.

79
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,239
Now, here's an example of a process map for
a decision

80
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,000
under retirement savings.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,400
And what you see we've done here is we've
identified a number of different

82
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,799
stages that fall into three different brackets
of the

83
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,849
decision making process.

84
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,340
Recognizing the importance of retirement savings
is the first stage

85
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,790
in the process.

86
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,519
Without people realizing that this is something
they need to attend to, the

87
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,170
rest of the stages simply don't matter.

88
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,170
There are other stages.

89
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,220
For example, the fact that you actually go
in and need to open

90
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,610
retirement account, be it a 401(k) account
in the United States or an

91
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,039
RRSP in Canada or whatever the equivalent
account is

92
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,870
in your home country.

93
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,080
And finally, there are stages and have to
do with monitoring the account on

94
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,310
an ongoing basis, making adjustments, making
sure that your portfolio is

95
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,930
rebalanced over time and so on and so forth.

96
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,389
So this chart represents the simple stages
that people go through in terms

97
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,010
of making that particular decision.

98
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,060
Now, once you've got the chart, and once you
start thinking about what the

99
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,760
right kind of nudge should be to affect these
different stages in the

100
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,449
decision making process, there are four kinds
of questions that you need

101
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,849
to ask yourself.

102
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,730
And in fact, these questions are, again, highlighted
in the guide that I

103
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,419
just talked about.

104
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,150
The first question is perhaps the most critical
question.

105
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,949
Is the decision maker aware of the correct
decision and are they simply

106
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,860
unable to execute it?

107
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,440
Or do they not even know what the right choice
is?

108
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,960
Think of a simple example.

109
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,639
Think about retirement savings.

110
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,440
We've talked about the fact that everybody
knows they need to save

111
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,479
more, but they just don't get down to doing
it.

112
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,550
We've got awareness.

113
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,070
People know what they need to do, but they
simply fail on the execution.

114
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,540
But there might be other domains where people
simply don't know what to do.

115
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,389
Think about healthy eating.

116
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,550
Let's say part of the healthy eating program
involves a gluten free diet.

117
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,280
Unless the consumer has the right education
to actually figure out that

118
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,450
that's what's best for them, they will never
even contemplate going towards a

119
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,919
gluten free diet.

120
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:03,990
So that's an important question.

121
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,710
Is the individual aware, or do you need to
make them aware?

122
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,180
Do you need to steer them towards a particular
outcome?

123
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,410
Second question--
is the individual motivated to impose a nudge

124
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,060
on themselves?

125
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,150
Think about the Save More Tomorrow program.

126
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,639
If I go and tell somebody, here's a program
where you can trick yourself

127
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,110
into saving more, it's going to work for people
who know they have a self

128
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,610
control problem.

129
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,270
Or stickk.com--
we talked about the website that helps you

130
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,909
achieve your goals.

131
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,690
It's going to help people who know that they
have a self control problem.

132
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,150
If people have a self control problem, they're
aware of it, and they're

133
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,860
motivated to solve it, then in fact, you can
apply certain kinds of nudges.

134
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,520
If in fact they don't even have the motivation,
then you're talking about

135
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,660
a completely different set of strategies.

136
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,009
Cognition is a third question.

137
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,319
Should I give the person more information?

138
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,539
Are they actually making a poor choice because
they're deficient in

139
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:00,539
information?

140
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,090
Or is, in fact, the provision of additional
information or commission

141
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,129
going to hurt them?

142
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,539
Is cognition going to help or is it going
to hurt?

143
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,540
If they already have a lot of information
and the error arises

144
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,629
because they can't process too much information,
then in fact, you want to

145
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:16,689
cut down and simplify.

146
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,000
On the other hand, if they don't have enough
information, then you want to

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,199
provide them with information.

148
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,789
And then finally, another important question--
are people making the wrong choice because

149
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,250
of inertia, laziness?

150
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,159
Or is something else getting in the way?

151
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:38,830
In other words, do I need to provoke and excite
people, or nudge them, into

152
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,439
doing something?

153
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,889
Or do I want to nudge them into not doing
the opposite thing?

154
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,930
And again, on the face of it, these seem like
complementary processes.

155
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,590
But from a nudging perspective, they represents
completely different

156
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,610
psychologies, and therefore, completely different
interventions

157
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,990
that you would do to address those psychologies.

158
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,629
Now, after having answered these four questions,
there is one other precise

159
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:06,020
thing you could do by going back to the map
that we talked about a little

160
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
bit earlier.

161
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,220
And that is to identify bottlenecks in the
process.

162
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,289
Think of a map at 6 stages or 6 boxes.

163
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:17,710
Which is the box at which there is the greatest
attrition or

164
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,039
drop off that happens?

165
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,509
In other words, how many people that are in
stage one

166
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,310
actually go to stage two?

167
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,620
How many people that express interest or motivation
or recognition that they

168
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,090
need to save more actually go out and open
a bank account?

169
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,810
How many of those actually collect the information
needed to figure out

170
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,430
exactly what they need to invest in and so
on and so forth?

171
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,880
So if you actually map that out in your chart,
you can identify the big

172
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
bottlenecks.

173
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,450
Where are the bottlenecks?

174
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,860
The bottlenecks happen at those stages where
you have the

175
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,810
highest attrition rates.

176
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,540
Now, what actually causes these bottlenecks?

177
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,440
You need to think through the underlying psychological
principles

178
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,760
that cause bottlenecks.

179
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,150
For example, what's the biggest bottleneck
at the

180
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,890
need recognition stage?

181
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:09,630
Why do so few you, as a percent, actually
begin to feel the need to

182
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,130
plan for their retirement?

183
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,090
What part of it is simple psychological bias?

184
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,640
The distance bias--
it's too far away.

185
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,100
I'm 30 years away from retirement.

186
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,740
My children are little.

187
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,320
I have many other needs today.

188
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,270
Why should I focus on retirement?

189
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,830
So any strategy that overcomes the perceived
distance between today and

190
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,380
the retirement is going to help you.

191
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,160
Allocation--
why do people trip up trying to make an optimal

192
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,980
allocation of funds into
their retirement accounts?

193
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,910
Perhaps because they don't know how to choose.

194
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,850
And here, a simple intervention that gives
people a tool or a technique to

195
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,730
help them choose between different options
would be the best nudge.

196
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,060
Selecting funds--
how do people decide which of many funds to

197
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,060
choose?

198
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,720
Perhaps the bottleneck there is that there
are just too many options.

199
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,830
And so this choice overload that we talked
about earlier trips people up.

200
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,180
They chose to not choose.

201
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,390
And so they have an account, but they actually
don't put anything in it.

202
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,820
So at each stage, if you think through what
the attrition rates are and try

203
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,880
and identify exactly what you could do to
fix those particular sets of

204
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,280
attritions, you have now identified for yourself,
at the end of this

205
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,390
process, a series of potential interventions
or potential nudges that

206
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,530
you could implement in creating the flow from
the left part of the chart

207
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,600
to the right.
