Now that we found that the decision point
idea worked with

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,510
food and with gambling tokens, our next question
was, does

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,150
it work with cash?

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,480
We did a bunch of experiments in rural India
with people that

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,150
were in a cash economy.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,110
These were construction laborers.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,000
These were agricultural workers.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,460
People that earn cash that was difficult to
save.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,580
And so we worked with a banker.

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,660
The banker went with us to different households
and would suggest something

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,100
like, we think you should save 40 rupees over
the next two weeks.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,100
People nodded.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,100
They said yes.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,320
But they just couldn't get down to doing it.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,090
And so the simple intervention that we used
was an envelope like this one.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,170
All we did was we took the 40 rupees, put
it in the envelope, sealed it, and

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,170
said, here.

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,340
This is what you should aim to save.

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,629
In another version of the same experiment,
we added pictures of their

20
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:01,850
children on the envelope.

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,240
And what we found was simply by putting the
money in an envelope, we

22
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,830
were able to increase savings rates dramatically.

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,940
And, of course, adding pictures of children
increased that savings rate

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,080
even further because again, it was a decision
point.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,220
We had earmarked the money separately.

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,630
And now people were not going to use it for
anything other than their

27
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,660
children's education expense.

28
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,330
So we found across a number of experiments
that the idea of creating

29
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,750
decision point seems to work because it converts
decision-making from an

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,490
automatic process to a fairly deliberative,
rational process.

31
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,850
Why does it work?

32
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,080
It works, again, because there's two parts
in us.

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,580
There's part of us that wants to be self-controlled.

34
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,520
And there's the impulsive part of us.

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,960
The self-control guy says, you should only
eat a handful of popcorn.

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,130
The impulsive guy doesn't think too much and
eats until it's all gone.

37
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,630
And what's happening with the theory of decision
points is that the part of

38
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,920
us that actually is the visionary, the planner,
is imposing a constraint on

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,920
the impulsive person by creating these multiple
opportunities

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,360
to go back and think.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,349
And so what is a decision point?

42
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:14,420
It is any intervention that is designed to
get people to stop, pause

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,220
consumption, and think a little bit.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,950
There are different ways in which you can
actually

45
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,240
implement a decision point.

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,140
A transaction cost--
that's what we did with the envelopes.

47
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,420
It was easy to physically get the money.

48
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,200
But it simply meant you had to pick up the
envelope and get it open.

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,640
And the act of that small transaction cost
actually made

50
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,690
people stop and think.

51
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,640
The second way in which you can create a decision
point is to

52
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,520
send people a reminder.

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,750
So think about a study where you send people
a reminder about saving or

54
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,670
about taking their medication on a text message
or on email.

55
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,660
The moment that thing pops up on your mailbox,
it serves as a cue for you to

56
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,600
actually go and get the medication done, or
the savings account opened,

57
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,470
or whatever it might be.

58
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,120
The third way in which you can actually create
a decision point is to

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,310
simply create some sort of interruption to
a

60
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,819
consumption's routine.

61
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,700
Think of the following simple example.

62
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,420
Let's imagine that your air conditioning switched
itself

63
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,020
off every two hours.

64
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,480
And the only way you could switch it on is
to physically go down to where

65
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,220
your switch is, where your thermostat is,
and turn it back on.

66
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,480
Simple intervention that this thermostat does
is exactly that.

67
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,590
It interrupts the process of consuming your
air conditioning.

68
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,640
So now when you have to physically go down,
you think to yourself, do I

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,380
really need to keep the air conditioner running?

70
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,820
Finally, here's the last example.

71
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,150
What if every time you swiped your credit
card, a pop-up message would

72
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,650
say, are you sure you want to spend $50?

73
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,560
Click yes or no.

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,270
And you could actually make the process a
bit more complex.

75
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,110
If you wanted people to say no, make it easy
to say no.

76
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,170
Hit OK to say no.

77
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,140
But if you want them to continue, they would
have to type in a number, like

78
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,480
1973, which is a bit more tricky to type in.

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,500
And so you create a decision process.

80
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,420
Food for thought.

81
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,090
If at any point in time, there is something
you want to control, impose

82
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,390
decision points on yourself.
