Last week we talked a lot about different
kinds of experiments,

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,210
field and lab.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,700
But what does it really take for your organization
to become an experimental

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,700
organization?

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,680
What are the skills needed, and what sort
of capabilities

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,860
do you need to develop?

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,430
Before we answer that question, let's spend
a minute trying to ask a more

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,720
simple question.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,279
What is not an experimental organization?

10
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,550
Two important points to keep in mind.

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,770
Simply being innovative doesn't make you an
experimental organization.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,600
Likewise, simply trying new things from time
to time does not make you an

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,830
experimental organization.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,570
In the context of behavioral economics, we're
going to use the word

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,900
experiment in a fairly specific social science
kind of way.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,510
In other words, we're going to use experiments
to mean a controlled trial

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,530
where you take a treatment--
a particular intervention--

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,210
and test for its effectiveness, benchmarked
to some controlled

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,220
condition using the principles that we've
talked about all of last week.

20
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,409
So what does it need for you to become an
organization that is

21
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,869
experimental in nature?

22
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,350
The first skill that you need is to have the
ability to generate small

23
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,730
sub-samples of consumers, of citizens, or
of agents that you

24
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,250
can experiment on.

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,659
It is important to be able to generate a control
condition as well as many

26
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,630
treatment conditions that you need to test
a particular idea.

27
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,259
You can generate these sub-samples, obviously,
by allocating your

28
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:41,810
consumers randomly across different groups.

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,770
But it is also important that those groups
are segmentable.

30
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,470
What that means is that you need to have the
ability to deliver a

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,289
different intervention to each of those segments
separately and

32
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,789
effectively.

33
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:58,749
That delivery could happen through a multiple
number of ways.

34
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:01,289
You could have a mailing that is different
as a function of whose

35
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:05,439
receiving the mailing, or the product offering
could be different as a

36
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,470
function of who is receiving that particular
product.

37
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,380
But it is important to keep in mind that you
need to have the ability to

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,120
generate these samples and, therefore, to
treat those samples differently.

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,340
The second key indicator is you need to have
the ability to deliver simple

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,580
interventions, low cost interventions, and
quick interventions.

41
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,540
You need to have a process in place that decides
what exactly the

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,470
intervention is going to be, and those interventions
need to be effective and

43
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,510
efficient in order for you to be able to experiment
effectively.

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,280
Third, you need to have a system for rapid
feedback and rapid

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,290
analysis of the data.

46
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,230
The moment you generate an experiment and
you treat different consumer bases

47
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,590
to different products or advertising messages,
you need to be able to

48
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,350
quickly understand what the effect of that
cause was on whatever it is that

49
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,600
you're trying to measure.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,230
Be it choice, be it attitude, or be it a preference
for a

51
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,290
certain product or variable.

52
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,260
The moment you have the ability to collect
the quick feedback, you want

53
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,580
to also make sure that you can analyze the
data effectively and make sure

54
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,310
that the analysis is then delivered back to
people who might need to

55
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,280
design a follow-up experiment quickly and
efficiently.

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,120
There are two organizational skills that are
essential to make these

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,420
things happen.

58
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,570
The first--
and we've briefly touched on that--

59
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,570
is the need for processes.

60
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,700
In the next week we'll be talking a lot about
developing processes for how

61
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,540
to identify good nudge interventions.

62
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,960
Embed those processes well in your organization.

63
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,600
Make sure somebody automatically audits consumer
decision making

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,700
process, and make sure that bottlenecks in
that process are

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,310
identified routinely and are reported back
to people who can experiment.

66
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,980
The second set of skills that are needed is,
essentially, a culture of

67
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,400
empiricism.

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,930
You need to embrace data.

69
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,350
You need to embrace the fact that data tells
you what the truth is

70
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,940
as opposed to theory.

71
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,730
And as we live in a world where our science
evolves to being a more mature

72
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,410
science, we have to confess that today behavioral
economics doesn't have as

73
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,169
much of theoretical rigor as classical economics
does.

74
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,630
And that's not because the science is young,
or that the science is not

75
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,070
scientific enough.

76
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,830
It is because it is a science about human
beings and by definition, the

77
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,490
number of things that affect the behavior
of human beings

78
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,569
are extremely large.

79
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,819
So in order to have a comprehensive theory
of decision making, we would

80
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,150
need to have a theory that embraces almost
everything we see in the

81
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,380
world around us.

82
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,120
That is going to take time.

83
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,090
And until we get there, it is important for
us that work in the

84
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,530
field to embrace the notion of evidence based
decision making.

85
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,659
Can we use evidence to inform policy, can
we use evidence to inform new

86
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:03,319
products, can we use evidence to deliver service
to

87
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,240
customers and to citizens?

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,120
And as long as we have a culture of evidence
based action, then, in fact,

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,069
we will be able to effectively use experiments
meaningfully to improve

90
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:16,100
processes, products, and policy.
