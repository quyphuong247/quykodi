If you talk to any behavioral economist anywhere
in the

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,071
world and you ask them what their typical
day looks like, most will tell

3
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:19,520
you that they spend a fair bit of time in
a lab like this one.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,240
I'm standing at the entrance to the behavioral
lab at the Rotman School of

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,340
Management at the University of Toronto.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,700
In fact, doing experiments in the lab is almost
the bread and butter of the

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,660
existence of any behavioral economist.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,450
All of the great theories you've heard about,
all of the cool phenomena that

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,050
you've read about, were all born in a lab
like this one.

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,420
But what exactly is a lab, and how does a
lab function?

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,079
And what is an experiment?

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,910
To find out more, we'll talk to Julie Huang,
who is the manager of the lab

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,399
at the Rotman School of Management.

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,510
Julie, what exactly is an experiment?

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,800
JULIE HUANG: Well, an experiment is basically
a tool that researchers can

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,149
use to establish whether or not there's a
causal relationship between

17
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,810
one particular variable and an outcome that
they care about.

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,640
And in experiments, the outcome that they
care about is

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,890
called the outcome variable.

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,800
It's also known as the dependent variable
sometimes.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,120
And the factor that researchers are interested,
seeing whether or not it

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,820
has a causal relationship on the outcome variable,
that's called the

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,750
independent variable.

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,260
And at its most basic, all experiments compare
two groups, the treatment

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,570
group and the control group.

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,530
And typically, a researcher will deliberately
manipulate the presence

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,710
of the independent variable between these
two groups.

28
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,610
So in the treatment group, all participants
will experience the

29
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,020
independent variable.

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,740
In the control group, the independent variable
will not be present, and then

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,840
the researcher will compare both groups' responses
on the outcome variable.

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,500
And there are lots of different kinds of experiments
that can be run.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,250
There's natural experiments.

34
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:07,530
So in these cases researchers, instead of
deliberately manipulating the

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,789
independent variable, they'll just look in
the world and find naturally

36
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,870
occurring groups that just have to happen
to different based upon the

37
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,409
variable of interest.

38
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,940
In lab studies, what we can do is we can bring
participants into the lab.

39
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,999
We'll randomly assign them to either the treatment
group

40
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:26,510
or the control group.

41
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,159
And then we can really tightly control their
experiences, and we can make

42
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,140
sure that the control group and the treatment
group only differ based upon

43
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,830
the independent variable.

44
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,700
What are the kinds of things that researchers
would

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,129
typically manipulate in an experiment in a
lab like this one?

46
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,840
Well, there are lots of things that can be
manipulated in a

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,260
lab like this.

48
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,680
Basically from the second that a participant
shows up for a study, the

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,239
researchers can change something about their
experiences.

50
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,959
You could embed the manipulation into the
instructions that they receive.

51
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,239
You could embed it into the experimental materials.

52
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,739
You could vary the font that they do the surveys
in.

53
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,840
You could even change the participants' surroundings,
subtle

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,489
changes in a laboratory just like this one.

55
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,049
So in this lab, we have temperature-controlled
systems.

56
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,829
So if you had a prediction about, say, how
temperature affects people's

57
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:35,730
ability to cooperate or compete in a prisoner's
dilemma game, you would

58
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,829
only manipulate the temperature of the room.

59
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,150
So you could have the temperature be really
cold or just normal room

60
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,939
temperature, and then you just compare these
two groups on the level of

61
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:46,939
cooperation.

62
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:54,419
But you can really manipulate a lot about
a participant's experiences

63
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,569
according to your independent variable of
interest, and I think it's really

64
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:03,480
open to researchers' imaginations and creativity
how they want to manipulate

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,590
participants' experiences.

66
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,260
And the advantage that we get from these lab
settings is that basically

67
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,150
researchers can tightly control conditions
such that they're only

68
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,020
manipulating one and only one factor, and
they can basically hold all others

69
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,080
factors constant.

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,110
DILIP SOMAN: Tell us about one of your own
experiments, something that you

71
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,000
would consider perhaps a favorite experiment.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,760
What were you looking to study, and how did
you plan out the whole thing?

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,210
Well, I'm currently in the area of consumer
behavior, so I'm

74
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:48,270
very interested in what makes people willing
to pay for certain items.

75
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,289
And in one of my recent studies, I was interested
in whether or not

76
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:55,550
incidental feelings of disgust could decrease
people's willingness to pay

77
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,610
for objects that had been previously owned
by other people.

78
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,020
And I was also interested in seeing whether
or not people who felt disgust

79
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,009
would be equally disgusted by objects that
had been owned by their friends

80
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,680
versus by strangers.

81
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,210
And so basically, this was a two-factor experiment.

82
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,360
We had people who were induced to feel disgust
or not, and we had people who

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,069
rated objects that had been used by either
strangers or friends.

84
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,479
And so basically what we did is before all
participants come into the lab,

85
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,740
we'll flip a coin.

86
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,900
The first flip, they'll decide whether or
not they receive the disgust

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,000
manipulation or not, and the second flip will
determine whether or not

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,199
they rate a product that they're then told
belongs to

89
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,479
their friend or a stranger.

90
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,530
And so when they come in, we give them a cover
story.

91
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,270
We tell them that they're rating products,
they're rating logos, things

92
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,710
for consumer study, just making general consumer
evaluations.

93
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,750
Then we basically have them rate the logo.

94
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,220
Some of those logos are disgust related for
those who are in the

95
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,160
treatment condition.

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,330
For those who are in the control condition,
they

97
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,830
are not disgust related.

98
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,129
Then we show them a screenshot from Amazon.com.

99
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,580
We just pilfered it from Amazon.com.

100
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,949
And we changed everything, except for we told
people that this product was

101
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,509
being sold by their friend or by a stranger.

102
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,800
And we asked them, how much are you willing
to pay for this?

103
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,439
And participants would write down in exact
dollar amount how much they

104
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,090
valued that object, and we would then compare
these four groups.

105
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,080
Could you show us a couple of interesting
rooms in this lab?

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,080
So sometimes researchers will want to get
participants to

107
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,039
sample food items or beverages, and that's
why we have a space like this,

108
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,990
a kitchen where people can store the materials
for those studies.

109
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,879
And I know, Dilip, you've popped a lot of
popcorn in this room.

110
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,491
This is the control room where the research
assistant running the

111
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:02,509
experiment sits and manages the experiment.

112
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,639
So as a research assistant, my role is to
ensure that all the

113
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,699
procedures and protocols by the researcher
is followed completely.

114
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:17,330
I know how many conditions there are for experiments,
and I randomly assign

115
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,219
participants to those conditions.

116
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:23,800
However, I don't know the exact rationale
or the goal behind each

117
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,759
condition or the overall objective of the
study.

118
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,810
Experiments in which the data collection is
done by computer

119
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,760
are done in rooms like this one.

120
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,599
One of our Ph.D. students, Joon, is getting
ready to run an experiment.

121
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,060
In my experiment, I have two conditions.

122
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,169
Everybody reads the same information.

123
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,139
But in this condition, the screen appears
in a font

124
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,650
that is easy to read.

125
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,710
But here in the second condition, the screen
appears in a font that is

126
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,379
difficult to read.

127
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:00,310
Now that we've seen the insides of a lab and
we know what

128
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,560
experiments are, it's time for us to open
the hood and take a closer look

129
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,090
at the design of experiments.
