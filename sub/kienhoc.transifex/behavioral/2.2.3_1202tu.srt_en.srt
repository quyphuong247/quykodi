00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,890
https://youtu.be/NTrcXBcOjeg
We just talked about the fact that having
too much choice makes

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,680
it difficult for people to compute the outcome.

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,110
What are the effects of choice?

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,700
We document five different kinds of effects
in our research.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,910
The first thing that you'll see here is that
when you give people a lot of

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,480
choice, they end up not choosing at all or
they choose to defer their

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,480
participation.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,640
In the domain of retirement savings, the common
finding is that the moment

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,380
you give people lots of ways in which they
can actually spend their money,

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,809
lots of funds they can choose from, they choose
to not participate in a

11
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,760
fund at all because they have difficulty making
a choice.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,079
The second thing that you often see happening
is people tend to make

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,030
choices that are conservative, that are safe,
because they want to

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,020
minimize the potential for regret.

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,269
The bigger the choice set, the more likely
are they to go with a

16
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:59,309
conservative option.

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,030
The third thing that you'll see happening
is the power of status quo

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,880
or defaults or recommendations.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,490
When I have too many options to choose from,
I'm most likely going to look at

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,920
you and say, well, what do you suggest?

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,960
Or I look for simplifying cues.

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,020
Which is the most popular product in your
menu, which is the most

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,200
top-selling item in your list, and so on and
so forth.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,990
I did a study with a graduate student a few
years back.

25
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,560
We compared patrons in restaurants that had
a fixed price menu, but in

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,409
one restaurant, there were six items in which
people could choose from.

27
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:35,770
In the other restaurant, there were 30 items.

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,840
And we looked at people that dined as dyads,
two people that came together,

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,119
and we asked the following simple question,
what percent of people said

30
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:46,570
I'm going to eat what he's eating?

31
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,220
And it turns out that when you give people
a longer menu, the second diner

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,670
was much more likely to choose exactly what
his or her partner choose, again

33
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,070
pointing to the fact that as decision making
became more complex, people

34
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,799
resorted to a simplifying heuristic.

35
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,479
The fourth effect is again the reliance on
peer choices.

36
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,009
We tend to look at what other people chose.

37
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,410
Those other people could be someone we dine
with, it could be a celebrity

38
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,600
endorser, it could be something that a intelligent
agent recommends to us.

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,670
John Gourville and I did a number of experiments
where we looked at the

40
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,380
effect of over choice on consumer decision
making, and what be

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,000
documented was a phenomenon that we call brand
defection.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,910
Consider two brands.

43
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,190
Brand A has one offering in a given product
category.

44
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,090
Let's say toothpaste.

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,330
Brand B has 15 offerings in the same category.

46
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,270
Let's say it's a toothpaste that whitens,
the other one has chloride,

47
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,210
the third one has fluoride, and so on and
so forth.

48
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,820
And what we find is beyond a certain number
of options, once you get to

49
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,250
seven, eight, nine, or 10, people said, I
can't make up my mind there.

50
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,970
I'm just going to stick with a simple option.

51
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,120
So people defect brands.

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,230
They defect to the brand that has a fewer
number of alternatives.

53
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,340
And finally, we also looked at situations
in which consumers were

54
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,020
given the choice between three variants of
the same product--

55
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,240
a stripped down version, a fully equipped
version, and a middle of the

56
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,440
road option.

57
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,530
Think about a car.

58
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,200
You could get a basic model, you could get
a bells and whistles, everything

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,630
included model, or you could get a model that
is a little bit of the

60
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,970
everything but not all of it.

61
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,780
And what we find is that as the number of
options in the middle go up, people

62
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,860
tend to gravitate more to what's the basic
or the fully loaded.

63
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,360
They simply can't trade off subsets of the
options, and so they decide they

64
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,330
want at all or they want nothing.

65
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,990
Now, if in fact it is true that people suffer
from over choice and it is true

66
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,590
that if you give people too much information
they have problems

67
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,010
processing it, what can we do to help people
make better choices?

68
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,680
We identify five different strategies in this
regard.

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,650
The most obvious one is to streamline choices.

70
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,120
Think about your offerings, think about products
that you really think

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,840
add value and keep those and only those in
your product mix.

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,860
If there are products that are not doing well,
if there are options that

73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,970
are not popular, consider dropping them.

74
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,930
Second, help consumers understand their own
preferences and help them

75
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,820
make the right computation.

76
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,280
If you could think about a simple shopping
bot that allows a consumer to

77
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,560
understand the relative value that they place
on different attributes and

78
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,939
allow the bot to compute the total value of
the product and make

79
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,939
recommendations.

80
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,919
That would help the consumers a long way.

81
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,800
The third strategy is to organize options,
and you could organize

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,530
options in a number of different ways.

83
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,020
Think about mutual funds, think about mortgages,
think about even product

84
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,870
categories like cereals.

85
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,569
Oftentimes, you go to a store and you are
asked to make a choice between

86
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,630
low-fat and regular options.

87
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,830
Within the low-fat options, you might have
further choices for the

88
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,150
categories, and the moment you try and organize
all of your complex

89
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,280
alternatives within each of those categories,
it becomes easier for a

90
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,659
consumer to navigate and drill down towards
a particular choice, so now

91
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:15,159
they're making a sequential set of choices
rather than making one out of

92
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:17,289
160 different options.

93
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:22,199
Likewise, a similar strategy is to encourage
what we call attribute-based

94
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,199
decision making.

95
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,810
Remember the Chinese take-out that I talked
about before?

96
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,290
Here's how we finally helped this man solve
his problem.

97
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,259
We came to the realization that at the end
of the day, the 180 items on his

98
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,620
menu were a combination of four or five different
factors.

99
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,330
What was the style of cooking?

100
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,330
What meat was used?

101
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,639
What's the level of spiciness?

102
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,039
What sort of noodle was used?

103
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,590
And what sort of vegetables were added?

104
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,520
And if you simply asked people to pick along
each of these questions, one out

105
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,139
of four, which meat do you want?

106
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,030
I could give you chicken, I could give you
fish, I could

107
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,340
give you lamb or pork.

108
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,340
Right.

109
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,039
It becomes easier for them to answer those
five questions at the level of

110
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,960
each attribute and choose one out of five
five times then to

111
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,460
choose one out of 180.

112
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,199
And finally, think about outsourcing decision
making to agents.

113
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,139
Who are these agents?

114
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,650
These agents could be experts, and in fact,
people do this a lot.

115
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,370
In the field of medical advice, for example,
most consumers do not make up

116
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,099
their own minds about whether they want treatment
A or treatment B, they

117
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,280
simply asked their doctor to help them choose.

118
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,129
Likewise, you could have a doctor for your
financial well-being, you could

119
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,490
have a doctor for your weight loss program,
as well as for

120
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,990
your exercise regimen.

121
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,150
Outsourcing decisions is a perfect way of
making sure that you can safeguard

122
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,409
yourself from overload and fatigue.
