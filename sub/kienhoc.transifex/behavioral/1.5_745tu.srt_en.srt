Hi there.

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:06,790
A few people had posted questions about the
Allais Paradox

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,490
on the discussion board.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,350
And so I thought I would use this short video
to do a step-by-step demonstration of the

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:21,410
paradox,
and explain why exactly it is a paradox.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,550
If you recall, this was the original problem
statement.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,869
In the first problem, the first choice that
participants were presented with,

8
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,660
Option A was 100% percent chance of getting
$1 million.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:44,170
Option B was a gamble-- 10% of $2.5, 89% of
$1 and 1% chance of nothing.

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,970
In the second problem-- the one that had a
yellow background-- we had two

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:54,050
gambles-- 11% chance of $1 million, 89% chance
of nothing--

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,309
that was the first option.

13
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,270
And the second option was 10% chance of $2.5
million and a 90% chance of zero.

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,189
Now, let's take a moment to think about each
of these two gambles.

15
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:09,479
In the blue box, here's one line of reasoning.

16
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,249
If I'm faced with this choice, I'm going to
say

17
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:16,409
option A is a certain $1 million.

18
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,649
Option B, there is a small, but a clear chance,
of getting nothing.

19
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:28,609
I'd look like a bit of an idiot if I chose
to gamble and gave up $1 million.

20
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,719
And so one line of reasoning would say that
people

21
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,279
are going to go for Option A, which is a safe
option.

22
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:37,729
It's $1 million, no questions asked.

23
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,520
And so the prediction would be that a lot
of people might pick Option A.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,350
In the second problem, the yellow box, now
we are comparing two gambles.

25
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,219
And if you compare those two, first let's
look at the probability.

26
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:57,079
In the first gamble, you have an 11% chance
of winning $1 million.

27
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,029
In the second gamble, you have a 10% chance
of $2.5.

28
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:05,109
The difference between 10% and 11% doesn't
seem very large.

29
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:10,360
The difference between $2.5 million and $1
million is very large.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,310
And so the prediction might be that people
would pick

31
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:21,709
Option B in the second problem set.

32
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,629
And that's exactly what Maurice Allais found
in his research.

33
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:31,060
Most people pick Option A in the left-hand
side, in the blue box.

34
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:38,239
In the right-hand side, in the yellow box,
people pick Option B which, by itself, is

35
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,030
not a problem,
except for the following argument-- that the

36
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,159
problems
in the blue box and the yellow box are essentially

37
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,519
identical.

38
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,810
Now, why is that the case?

39
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,459
I'm going to start rewriting these two problems.

40
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,660
And in particular, I'm going to focus on the
two lines

41
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,170
that I've highlighted in red on both sides.

42
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,010
Option A, 100% chance of $1 million in the
blue box,

43
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,299
and one of the outcomes of Option B in the
yellow box-- a 90% chance of 0.

44
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:24,099
Now, I'm going to rewrite those two as follows.

45
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:30,079
I'm going to take the 100% chance of $1 million,
and I'm going to break that down into an 11%

46
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:35,150
chance of $1 million
plus an 89% chance of the same $1 million.

47
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,760
So functionally it's the same.

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,959
I've just broken it down into two separate
outcomes.

49
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,170
Likewise on the right-hand side, the 90% chance
of getting nothing

50
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:52,140
I've broken down into an 89% chance of nothing
and a 1% chance of nothing-- again, functionally

51
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,420
equivalent.

52
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:03,489
Just for the sake of clarity, I've broken
it down into two separate lines.

53
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,079
What am I going to do next?

54
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,030
I'm going to start with the blue box.

55
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,939
And I'm going to look at both options.

56
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:16,359
And I'm going to identify a feature which
is common to both.

57
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:22,280
And in this case, it is the 89% chance of
winning $1 million.

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,150
It's there in Option A. It's also there in
Option B.

59
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,190
And then, I'm going to take that $1 million
in each of these two features,

60
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,320
and replace that by nothing.

61
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,770
In other words, I'm going to cancel out an
89% chance of $1 million

62
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:55,120
both from Option A and from Option B.
So now, here's what my problem looks like.

63
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,020
I've simply replaced the $1 million with 0.

64
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,229
And now, if I compare the two boxes left-hand
side

65
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:12,770
in blue, right-hand side in yellow, you will
see that they're essentially identical.

66
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,900
In fact, they're completely identical.

67
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,750
Voila.

68
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,330
Now, this is a paradox.

69
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:29,849
It's a paradox because you have two options,
or two choice sets, two problems, which are

70
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:32,669
functionally identical.

71
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,849
Yet in one case, people choose Option A. In
the other case,

72
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:43,080
people choose Option B. That is Allais' Paradox.
