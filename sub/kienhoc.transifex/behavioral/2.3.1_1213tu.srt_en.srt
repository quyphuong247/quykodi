I want to start off by telling you a story
from Greek

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,030
mythology, and this is the story of Ulysses.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,110
Ulysses is a legendary hero in Greek mythology.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,230
He was the protagonist of two of Homer's most
famous works, The Iliad

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,570
and The Odyssey.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,910
And in particular, I want to focus on The
Odyssey, which is the story of

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:30,489
Ulysses returning home after the Trojan War--
was a voyage that took 10 years.

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,390
They were on a boat.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,899
And perhaps the most interesting part of the
story of Ulysses is the story

10
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,089
of Ulysses and the sirens.

11
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,390
Who were the sirens?

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,309
The sirens were these beautiful, mythical
creatures that

13
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,260
lived on rocky shores.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,739
What they did was they sang beautifully and
sweetly, and every

15
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,780
sailor that walked past or sailed past heard
their singing, tried to find out

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,269
who these sirens were, and ended up shipwrecking
the boats because the

17
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,170
rocks were dangerous.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,470
Now of course, Ulysses had heard about this,
and what he wanted to do was he

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,870
wanted to make sure that he would not be a
target of these kinds of

20
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,870
shipwrecks.

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,880
So what did he do?

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,570
He did two things.

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,500
As you can see in this picture, he instructed
his crew to

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,390
tie him to the mast.

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,700
Further, he had wax put into the ears of his
crew.

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,899
And what did this do?

27
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:27,880
The crew could not hear the singing.

28
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,710
Ulysses could hear the singing, but he couldn't
do anything about, as a

29
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,409
result, the crew was able to continue rowing
and Ulysses was able to

30
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:38,290
continue steering.

31
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,130
This story of Ulysses and the sirens is a
perfect metaphor for the notion

32
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,450
of self control.

33
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,100
Let me illustrate the notion of self control
with a very, very simple

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,130
demonstration, an example that's been repeated
again and again in a lot of

35
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,380
research in behavior economics.

36
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,869
Let's imagine I give you a choice between
$10 today or $12 in a week.

37
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,700
Which one would you choose?

38
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,271
You'd surprised that a lot of folks who answer
this

39
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:09,179
question choose $10 today.

40
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,860
And as an economist, that's OK, because it
simply reflects a large

41
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,950
discount rate that you place on the future.

42
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,050
Here's the more interesting part.

43
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,700
Suppose I add an extra year to both options,
and now the question is,

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,800
would you rather take $10 in 52 weeks or $12
in 53 weeks?

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,200
And when you're asked that question, everybody
is willing to wait one week

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,299
for the extra two bucks.

47
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:40,069
So, in sum, guess what's happening?

48
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,540
When people are making a choice between waiting
an extra week for an

49
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:49,320
extra $2, they will make it if both choices
are in the future but not if

50
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,830
both are in the present.

51
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,550
That notion is captured in this graph, and
what you're going to see in this

52
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,959
graph is SS and LL.

53
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,510
SS stands for the shorter, sooner reward,
the $10.

54
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,709
LL stands for the larger, later reward, the
$12.

55
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,040
And the two lines that you see coming from
SS and LL--

56
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,590
they're marked as Vt SS and Vt LL--
represent the present value of the future

57
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,590
outcome.

58
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,269
So for example, SS and LL are happening in
the future.

59
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,439
I'm standing here and I'm looking at them,
and the two lines represent how

60
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,879
I value SS and LL at different points in time.

61
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,519
What you see is if I'm looking at the future
today, I can see that SS is

62
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,130
shorter than LL.

63
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,379
I'm going to choose LL.

64
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,379
I'm going to be patient.

65
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:44,750
I'm going to wait for the larger, later reward.

66
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,690
But as I keep getting closer and closer, I
get to a point that's called

67
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,079
the indifference point in an area of time
that's marked on that plot as the

68
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,420
lapse zone.

69
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,540
And what happens in the lapse zone is suddenly
SS starts

70
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,060
looking larger than LL.

71
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,790
If you think about the world of visual perception,
this is something that we

72
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,220
call the phenomenon of parallax.

73
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,659
You could think about SS and LL as two buildings,
and when you look at those

74
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,049
two buildings from a distance, you can tell
which one is shorter

75
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,469
than the other one.

76
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:19,019
But as soon as you start getting really close
to the shorter one and

77
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,060
look up at the skies, it seems to crowd out
the larger building.

78
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,930
So there's a fundamentally simple psychological
process that is

79
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,470
explaining how people perceive visual distances
versus how they visual

80
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,880
temporal distances.

81
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,300
Now, the notion that these two lines coming
out of SS and LL cross each

82
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,550
other is a phenomenon that is called by behavioral
economists as hyperbolic

83
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,690
discounting.

84
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,830
Discounting is the idea that people value
things differently in the

85
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,410
present as opposed to the future.

86
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,150
Hyperbolic refers to the specific equation,
the specific functional form

87
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,240
which lets those two lines cross each other.

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,800
So think about it.

89
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,920
SS and LL are metaphors for all kinds of things
in life.

90
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,100
SS could be getting the tasty chocolate cake
now, LL could be having

91
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,139
a healthier life in the future.

92
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:18,100
SS could be working hard at a given point
in time and then goofing off, LL

93
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,310
could be keeping working hard and making sure
you have a secure future.

94
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,520
And so there are many points in time when
we look at options that are in

95
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,530
the future, we can see that LL is better than
SS, but as soon as we get

96
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,710
closer to SS, the tempting option, we choose
it.

97
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,400
What does it happen?

98
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,940
Why do we fall into lapse zones?

99
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,169
Well, there are three reasons.

100
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,330
One is physical proximity.

101
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,660
When you get really close to SS, you almost
feel like you have it, and not

102
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,479
having it feels like a loss.

103
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,980
And we've learned from the research of Danny
Kahneman and others that losses

104
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,120
hurt you much more than gains make you feel
happy.

105
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,490
Or you could have physical features of the
stimuli that

106
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,229
arouse the body's senses.

107
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:06,600
I had a doctoral student Xiuping Li, what
she did was she had students come

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,949
into a lab that smelled of chocolate cookies
or popcorn, and what she found

109
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:15,889
was the moment she had students come in a
room that smelled of chocolate

110
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,009
cookies, they made much more impulsive choices
in domains that had nothing to

111
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:22,520
do with either chocolate or cookies.

112
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,360
So there was a general arousal that was going
on

113
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,810
that make people impulsive.

114
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,030
It could be visualization.

115
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,270
We've all seen examples of lottery advertising
which tell us, imagine

116
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,240
you've won a million dollars, and the moment
you imagine, you feel like you

117
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,220
almost have it and you are tempted by that
option.

118
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,889
Or you think about framing.

119
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,419
The same option can be framed as you've got
a good thing coming a week

120
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,560
from now, how much do you want to pay to speed
it up, versus, I can give you

121
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,509
something today, how much of a premium would
you accept to

122
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,550
delay that same thing.

123
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,020
And it turns out that delaying is much more
difficult than speaking up.

124
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,720
So as a result of these three factors, we
end up with the notion of

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
intertemporal choice with the notion that
while people know from a distance

126
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,310
that LL is bigger than SS, they end up choosing
SS as they get close to it.
