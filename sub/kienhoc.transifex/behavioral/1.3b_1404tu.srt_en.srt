1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,030
This equation that we saw in the last unit
is the basis of what is called the expected

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,530
utility
theory of decision making.

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,640
This theory relies on five principles, or
five axioms,

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,740
that underlie rational decision making.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,500
Here are the five axioms.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
The first one is called completeness.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,920
The second one is transitivity.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,919
The third is substitution.

9
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:32,650
The fourth is continuity, and the fifth is
monotonicity.

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,240
We're going to focus on the first three, because
the last two are really there

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,410
for mathematical tractability off the model,
and they don't have interesting behavioural

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,210
insights coming out
of those.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,010
Let me start off with completeness.

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,840
It's a very simple axiom.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,270
Completeness says that when I give a decision
maker two options,

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,240
let's say x and y, the decision maker should
be able to articulate a preference between

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,400
those two options.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,239
In other words, they should either be able
to prefer x over y, or y over x,

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,030
or they should be able to say that they're
totally indifferent between those two options.

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,490
What cannot happen is for the decision maker
to say, well, gee,

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,260
I don't know which one to choose.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,159
Now, we've seen in some of the previous units
that in cases where there is too much information,

23
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,100
or when there is overload of data, consumers
might actually

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,060
choose to not choose, because they're confused,
and that would be a violation of this simple

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,010
axiom.

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,850
Let's go onto to the second axiom, and that's
called transitivity.

27
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,350
This, again, is a very simple axiom, and it
says the following.

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:49,780
Let's imagine a decision maker prefers x over
y, and then chooses y over z.

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,630
What this axiom says is, in that case, x should
be preferred over z.

30
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,580
Now this sounds fairly obvious.

31
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:03,630
If you prefer receiving $100 over $50, and
you prefer receiving $50 over $20,

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,330
it makes perfect sense that you want to receive
$100 instead of $20.

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,819
But there are many different domains in which
this particular axiom is violated.

34
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,659
And I want to show you one simple example.

35
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,599
Let's imagine that you are looking for a research
assistant.

36
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,540
You're looking to hire someone, and you have
three applicants, Mr. A, Mr. B,

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,390
and Mr. C. And for each one of them, you've
got data on two attributes.

38
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,219
The first one is their IQ, which is based
on a standardized IQ test.

39
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,999
The second one is the number of years of work
experience that these people have.

40
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:40,239
And let's say you've got a very simple rule.

41
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,879
You want to choose the most intelligent person,
and if in fact, you have two people of equal

42
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,439
intelligence,
then you will choose the one with higher work

43
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,439
experience.

44
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,150
If you look at this data, you've got three
people.

45
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,950
The person with the highest intelligence score
also has the lowest experience.

46
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:02,400
And this is a fairly standard kind of a set
up that you might expect in the real world.

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,239
Now, here's the interesting part.

48
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,549
We also know from the history of IQ tests
that they're not really reliable.

49
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,680
They're not really diagnostic.

50
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,779
In other words, a score which is different
from 10 points

51
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:20,340
from each other might not really mean that
one person is actually smarter

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,340
than the other one.

53
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,890
So if I look at these data, 120 is about the
same as 110.

54
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,519
110 is about the same as 100.

55
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,930
So if I apply my rule of decision making,
here's what it's going to tell me.

56
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,459
It's going to tell me that I will prefer Mr.
B over Mr. A,

57
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,860
because they're about equally intelligent,
but B has more experience.

58
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:49,029
And likewise, I would prefer C over B. However,
if I now look at the whole picture, I will

59
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:54,780
end up preferring A over C,
because now, the difference between 120 and

60
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,249
100
is significantly large, that by my rule, I

61
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:01,599
end up
picking the more intelligent person.

62
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,059
So this is an example of the violation of
the transitivity principle,

63
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:08,859
and it happens in a number of different domains.

64
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:11,909
Essentially, what's happened here is that
the context

65
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:16,139
has conspired in such a way that the decision
maker views

66
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,609
the attributes differently in making choices.

67
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,229
So the literature is replete with examples
of the violation

68
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,920
off this particular axiom.

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:33,830
Here's the third and more important axiom,
and this axiom is called the axiom of substitution.

70
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,410
And it says the following.

71
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,630
If I have two options, x and y, and I'm indifferent
between x and y,

72
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,480
then I should be indifferent between two lotteries
that

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,280
have x and y as their price.

74
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,310
So for example, if I love an apple as much
as I love a banana,

75
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,780
then you come to me and say, well if you're
going to toss a coin,

76
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,220
in one case if it's heads, you're going to
get an apple.

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,990
In the other case, if it's heads, you're going
to get a banana.

78
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,270
Then I should be indifferent between those
two lotteries

79
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,870
because I was indifferent between the two
prizes to begin with.

80
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:14,060
Now, one corollary of this particular axiom
is something called the cancellation principle.

81
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,650
And cancellation says that if I've got two
options,

82
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,260
and I remove something identical from those
two options,

83
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,650
I should still now have the same preference
between those two options

84
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,650
as I had before.

85
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,790
Now it turns out again that this principle,
the principle

86
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,450
of cancellation, is often violated in a lot
of decisions that we make.

87
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,000
And perhaps the most famous demonstration
of the violation of this principle was done

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,810
by Maurice Allais in something
that is known as the Allais Paradox.

89
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,900
Let's look for a moment at this particular
choice.

90
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,200
Two options.

91
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,780
Option A, I give you a million dollars, no
questions asked.

92
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,280
Option B, they're going to play a lottery.

93
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,730
In that lottery, there's a 10% chance that
you will win 2.5 million.

94
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,930
There's an 89% chance that you will win one
million,

95
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,360
and there is a 1% chance that you will win
nothing.

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,770
In this circumstance, what Maurice Allais
found

97
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,130
was that most people prefer Option A. It's
a no brainer.

98
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,860
It's a million dollars with no strings attached.

99
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,810
Makes perfect sense.

100
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,480
Now, let's look at the second problem.

101
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,340
Again, if you're choosing here between two
options, we're going to call it A

102
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,810
and B. In Option A, we have a lottery in which
there's an 11% chance of winning one million

103
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,500
and an 89% chance of winning nothing.

104
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,170
In Option B, we have a second lottery.

105
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:47,820
10% chance of winning 2.5 million and a 90%
chance of winning nothing.

106
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,150
Now, as you might expect a lot of people prefer
Option B.

107
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,070
If you think about,
the difference between 10%, 11% isn't very

108
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,070
large.

109
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,650
The difference between a million and 2.5 million
is that much more larger.

110
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,060
And so, people tend to pick the Option B,
which gives them

111
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,270
a chance of winning the larger price.

112
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,330
Here's an interesting thing though.

113
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,730
If I put these two side by side, what you'll
notice

114
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,920
is that these two options are essentially
identical.

115
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,210
These two problems are essentially identical.

116
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,430
What I've done is I've taken away an 89% probability
of winning

117
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,790
a million dollars away from both options.

118
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:35,420
And essentially, by doing that, I have now
created a situation in which I can reverse

119
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,990
preferences between A and B.
And that, again, is a violation of the axiom.

120
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,830
Now, as we go through this course we'll see
a lot of different ways

121
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,780
in which consumers and people in general tend
to violate,

122
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,530
not only these axioms of choice, but tend
to make inconsistent preferences.

123
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,230
And I'd like to leave you with one thought.

124
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,850
We've talked about the four C's of rationality,
and we've made the point that all of these

125
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:05,120
four C's need
to happen for people to display rational behavior.

126
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,690
Now, people routinely violate axioms.

127
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,411
People routinely do not behave in consistence
with those four C's, but

128
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,730
they're just being people.

129
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,010
Are they being irrational?

130
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,590
Irrational, I think, has a very strong connotation
to it.

131
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,990
It suggests that people are making a mistake.

132
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,080
And in my opinion, if you have a theory that
doesn't account for the way in which people

133
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,320
make decisions,
perhaps that's not the right theory to explain

134
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
human behavior.

135
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,490
Perhaps it's not people that are being irrational.

136
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:41,019
It is the theory that is perhaps not rational,
and that's why a behavioral approach to economics

137
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,589
tends to be the richer approach.
