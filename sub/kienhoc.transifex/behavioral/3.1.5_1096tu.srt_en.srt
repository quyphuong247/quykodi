Now that we know what an experiment is and
we've learned some

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,630
basic technology of causes and effects, mediators,
and moderators,

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,480
let's think a little bit and ask the question,
what are the different kinds

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,740
of experimental designs available to us?

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,720
And in order to do that, let's start off with
the laundry experiment that

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,660
we talked about last week.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,740
This was the experiment where we showed that
when people pay for their

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,640
laundry by using a prepaid card, as opposed
to quarters, cash, they're

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,230
more likely to separate their white loads
from the colored loads.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,560
This was the design of the experiment.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,060
What we did in that experiment was we observed
people doing laundry over a

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,580
40 day window, such that in the first half
of the window, the machines

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,800
accepted quarters.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,739
They were then re-tooled, and in the second
half of the window, they

15
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,430
started accepting prepaid cards.

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,790
This is what we call a before and after design.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,110
Something has happened in the environment,
in this case, the

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,530
management of the laundromat, that has changed
the way in which people do

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,140
their laundry, or, in an experimental sense,
the focal task.

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,030
Natural experiments happen all the time.

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,330
And as long as you are around and sensitive
to the fact that there is

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,270
going to be some change in context, you could
convert that change into a

23
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,100
potential experiment.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,820
Does an experiment like this conclusive prove
that if you move away

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,830
from coins to cards that people with change
their laundry behavior, and

26
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,030
that the change in the laundry behavior is
attributable only to the

27
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,520
change in payment mechanism?

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,450
Keep in mind here the cause is the movement
away from coins

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,330
to a prepaid card.

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,090
The effect is the separation of laundry into
the

31
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,159
whites and the coloreds.

32
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,020
Let's imagine a hypothetical situation where,
for some reason, people in the

33
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,310
middle of this window have suddenly started
reading more off the Good

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,619
Housekeeping journals.

35
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:07,979
That might explain this data.

36
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,530
That might explain the fact that people are
now separating more because

37
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,620
they are now more aware of the need to separate.

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,700
So in order to rule out that possibility,
we need to include a

39
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,160
second set of conditions, something that we
would

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,209
call the control condition.

41
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:28,300
A control condition would look like the bottom
part of this panel.

42
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,650
In a control condition, you would have the
same 40 day window, pretty much

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,340
the same location, and the same kinds of people
doing their laundry.

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,120
But in the control, rather than switching
from coins to a prepaid

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,570
card, you would continue using coins throughout
the entire 40 day window.

46
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,550
And what you ideally want to show is that
the changes that we saw in the

47
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,580
top panel are not attributable to simply the
passage of time.

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,770
So that is a simple before and after experiment
with a control.

49
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,319
Now, let's go back and think of another phenomenon
that we looked at

50
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,769
in the first couple of weeks, the pennies
a day pricing phenomena.

51
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,700
John Gourville showed in his research that
if you in fact take

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,099
an aggregate price--
$365 a year--

53
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:16,660
and convert that into a dollar a day price,
people are much more generous

54
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,570
with their money.

55
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,319
One simple design that he used to test this
idea was a simple

56
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,230
two-condition design.

57
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,500
People were asked to make a donation.

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,870
Half the people who were randomly assigned
to the aggregate condition

59
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,440
were asked to make a donation of $365 a year.

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,510
The second part of the population, which was
randomly assigned to the

61
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,330
pennies a day condition, were asked to make
a donation of $1 a day, which

62
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,319
equals $365 a year.

63
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,459
And all that John Gourville did was he compared
the mean willingness to

64
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,810
donate in the aggregate condition with the
pennies a day condition.

65
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,019
That's what we would call a simple, two-condition
design.

66
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,459
In this case, the cause is the fact that you
move away from an aggregate

67
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,400
framing to a pennies a day framing.

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,780
The effect is your willingness to donate.

69
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,740
This experiment used only one factor, which
was the way in which the pricing

70
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,199
information was framed.

71
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,250
Now, let's push that argument a little bit
further.

72
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,970
Remember we said that pennies a day works
wonderfully well if you are

73
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,900
talking about $1 a day or $2 a day.

74
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,360
But the moment you get into $20 a day or $25
a day, that argument falls

75
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,020
apart, because people are now not able to
compare 25 with other items that

76
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,940
they spend $25 a day on.

77
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,169
And so the strategy might backfire.

78
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:41,369
How would you test that?

79
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,080
Here's what you would do.

80
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,479
What you would do is something called a fully
crossed design.

81
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,800
What you see along the rows are two conditions
in which we compare the

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,039
pennies a day strategy with the aggregate
strategy.

83
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,080
First, we look at a low amount condition.

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,270
Second, we look at a high amount condition.

85
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,129
This case, this experiment uses two factors.

86
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:09,219
And each of the factors has two levels--
low amount, high amount, aggregate versus

87
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:12,909
pennies a day--
resulting in a total of four experimental

88
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,479
conditions.

89
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,020
What you want to show is that pennies a day
outperforms the aggregate

90
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,759
framing when the amount is low.

91
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,020
But in fact, when the amount is high, you
would get the opposite result.

92
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,919
Finally, let's spend a minute talking about
something called

93
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,699
within-participant designs versus between-participant
designs.

94
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:39,059
When we looked at the example of the laundromat,
we essentially tracked

95
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:42,790
people over a 40 day window, but it was the
same group of people, people

96
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,910
that lived in that apartment building that
kept visiting the laundromat.

97
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,849
Essentially, the same group of people were
exposed to two treatments, the

98
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:56,779
cash condition and the prepaid card condition.

99
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,110
That's what we call a within-participants
design.

100
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,849
In contrast, when people were in Gourville's
experiment on pennies a

101
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:13,089
day, they either saw an aggregate request,
$365 a year, or they saw a $1

102
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,089
per day request.

103
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:17,800
In other words, there were two different groups
of people that each

104
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,669
saw one particular kind of treatment in their
experiment.

105
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,029
That's called a between-participants experiment.

106
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:29,379
Obviously, both between and within-participant
experiments have

107
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,509
their own merits.

108
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,029
And as we go through, we'll talk a little
bit about conditions under

109
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,279
which you want to use one versus the other.

110
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,229
So in a nutshell, we looked at different kinds
of designs.

111
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,029
We looked at before after.

112
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:43,169
We looked at before after designs with the
control.

113
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,699
We looked at two-condition experiments.

114
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,110
And then we looked at what we call fully crossed
experimental designs.
