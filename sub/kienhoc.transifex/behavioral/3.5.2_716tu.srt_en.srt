Many of us get a chance to allocate our labor
hours across

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,830
different days of the week, or different weeks
of the year.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,449
In some cases, some days are high-wage days
on an average, while others are

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,210
low-wage days.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,030
Will people work more on high-wage days and
less on low-wage days, which

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,780
is a prediction of labor economics.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,700
And that was the question that Colin Camerer
and his colleagues were

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,360
looking to answer in a paper that was published
in the Quarterly Journal of

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,720
Economics in 1997.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,890
In fact, this paper was looking to address
a number

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,920
of interesting questions.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,280
Why is it difficult to get a taxi in New York
City on days in which it

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,660
rains or in which there's a convention in
town?

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,819
But you would expect that the general demand
for taxis is high, and

15
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:55,120
therefore the average wage rate for a taxi
driver is also high.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,339
You would expect that taxi drivers would choose
to work longer hours on

17
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:03,559
days in which the going is good.

18
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:06,510
The goal of this paper was to test whether,
in fact, the labor hours and

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,780
wages are positively correlated as the life
cycle model of

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,880
labor supply predicts.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,080
In other words, do workers work more when
wages are high?

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
This was a field study.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,120
And the authors used data that was typically
collected as part of routine

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,700
operations--
in other words, archived data.

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,440
And the data that were used here were three
data sets provided by a fleet

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,710
company and the New York Taxi and Limo Commission,
hereafter called the NYTLC.

27
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:43,680
The data came in the form of a trip sheet--
a sequential list of trips that a driver took

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
on a given day.

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,000
Next time you sit in a taxi, you might notice
that the driver actually has a

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,690
clipboard where he or she writes down where
you left, where you ended up,

31
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,690
how much you paid.

32
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,930
That is a trip sheet.

33
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,730
There were three types of cab drivers in the
data set.

34
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:04,170
They were daily fleet drivers who lease their
cabs from a fleet company

35
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,750
for a 24 hour window.

36
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,420
There were lease drivers who lease the cabs
weekly or monthly.

37
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,560
And finally, there were owner drivers who
owned their own medallion-bearing

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,070
taxi, and drive it.

39
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,900
Three data sets were collected by the authors.

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,340
The first data set was provided by a fleet
company, and had 70 trip sheets

41
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,840
from daily fleet drivers.

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,030
The second data set and the third, both were
collected from the NYTLC.

43
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:39,090
The second one had 1,044 trip sheets, daily
fleet drivers, lease drivers and

44
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,090
owner drivers.

45
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,130
Whereas the third one had 712 trip sheets
just from lease drivers and

46
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,480
owner drivers.

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,230
And the labor hours and daily income of cab
drivers were collected from

48
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,630
these trip sheets.

49
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,459
The method of analysis that was used was regression.

50
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:03,430
And while the regression results pointed out
there were a number of

51
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,849
interesting facts, there were three key pieces
of

52
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,630
conclusions that jumped up.

53
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,910
And that had to do with the correlation between
the wages and the

54
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:19,470
hours worked, both on a log scale for each
of the three data sets.

55
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,970
All of these numbers were significant and
negative.

56
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,390
And the negative suggests that when the wage
rates were high on an

57
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,459
average, when the going was good, cab drivers
actually drove less.

58
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,520
Now, this was interesting for a number of
different perspectives.

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,800
But that was the simple approach that the
authors took to

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,630
analyzing the data.

61
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,880
In conclusion, wages were correlated within
days, but they seem to be

62
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,370
uncorrelated between days, and the wage elasticities
were negative.

63
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,709
But more importantly, these results here suggested
that cab drivers make

64
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,620
labor decisions on a daily basis instead of
allocating labor and

65
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,750
leisure across multiple days.

66
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,450
And in particular, it seemed like they would
set a daily income quota or

67
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,489
target and stop working on that day when they
reached the target.

68
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,280
If the wages were high and the going was good,
they would

69
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,209
reach the target sooner.

70
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,810
And as a result, they would stop working sooner.

71
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,270
And that is why it is difficult to get a taxi
in New York, or Singapore, or

72
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,630
even Hong Kong on a rainy day.

73
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,910
Because the average wage rate is high and
taxi drivers quit sooner.
