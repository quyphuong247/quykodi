What is behavioral economics?

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,780
Perhaps the best way to illustrate the difference
between traditional

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,619
economics and behavioral economics is to borrow
a phrase from Dick Thaler

4
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,500
and Cass Sunstein book, Nudge.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,390
In that book, the authors talk about two kinds
of species--

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,850
humans and Econs.

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,320
What are Econs, you ask?

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,160
Econs are mythical creatures that live on
the pages of economics textbooks.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,360
They're very smart, they can look forward
infinitely, they can compute

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,320
something called utility of objects, and they
make

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,570
perfectly rational choices.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,860
Econs don't care about emotions because they
don't have any.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,680
Econs have the ability of a supercomputer
to make fairly complex

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,910
computations in the snap of a finger.

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,910
Human beings are people like you and me--
very different.

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,550
We're different because we're emotional.

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,361
We fall in love, we sometimes do silly things,
regret our choices, and

18
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:06,040
sometimes we choose things just because, which
is a concept that Econs

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,280
would never understand.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,190
Human beings are impulsive.

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,560
Human beings tend to make decisions on the
spur of the moment.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,260
Human beings sometimes do things because other
people would like them

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,590
to do things.

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,360
Human beings donate to charity.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,250
Human beings are also very forward-looking
at some points in

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,530
time, but often care only about the present.

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,740
Human beings typically form judgments or make
choices based on the context

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,700
around them, as opposed to Econs, who don't
care about context.

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,280
Perhaps the best way to illustrate this point
is to talk about a product

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,700
category that's one of my favorites--
coffee.

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,079
Most coffee shops all over the world will
sell you coffee in

32
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,170
one of three sizes--
small, medium, or large.

33
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,860
That's probably going to come as no surprise
to you if I tell you that the

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,950
most popular size of coffee anywhere in the
world is the

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,470
medium size of coffee.

36
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,979
But here's where it gets interesting.

37
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,960
It doesn't matter how much coffee is in that
medium cup of coffee.

38
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,660
For example, in this scenario, this is probably
going to be the most popular

39
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,840
cup of coffee.

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,980
What happens if I remove the largest size,
and replaced that with an even

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,590
smaller size?

42
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,900
It turns out now the new medium cup of coffee
will be the most

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,980
popular cup of coffee.

44
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,830
A number of years back when I lived in Hong
Kong, I and a bunch of my

45
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,820
students did a study in a coffee shop which
was in an office building.

46
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,040
We asked people why they picked the medium
cup of coffee, and you

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,690
typically heard something like, the larger
one has too much, the little

48
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,890
one has too little, the one in the middle
has the right amount of coffee.

49
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,480
What we then did was we actually increased
the size of every cup of

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,280
coffee by two ounces-- just what I showed
you before--

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,099
and we found that the new medium now became
the most popular size.

52
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,430
Again, we asked people why they picked the
new medium, and they would say

53
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,910
that the little one had too little, the large
one had too much, and the

54
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,590
one in the middle was just right.

55
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,220
This is a classic example of what we call
a context effect.

56
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,360
This effect was first made popular by Itamar
Simonson, who is a

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,159
professor at Stanford.

58
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,200
And the argument he was making is that in
situations where people do not have

59
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,659
a good idea of how to value objects, they
use information from the context

60
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,209
to help them make that judgment.

61
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,500
Now it turns out that this works not just
for coffee, but for a whole

62
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,560
number of other product categories.

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,850
Here's another example.

64
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,959
I took this picture a few years back at a
gas station that I've been buying

65
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,629
petrol for the past several years.

66
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:40,810
And I took it because for years and years,
this gas station has been

67
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,950
selling gasoline in three grades--
87, 89, and 91.

68
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:50,269
And all of a sudden, they introduced a fourth--
94.

69
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:51,879
And I wondered why they did that.

70
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,170
And I'm still not sure why they did do that,
but one of the interesting

71
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,409
consequences of that introduction was that
now the 91 grade gasoline, which

72
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,769
used to be the extreme gasoline in terms of
quality, was in the middle.

73
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,239
And my speculation was that the sale of 91
would go up as a result of the

74
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,129
introduction of 94.

75
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,140
It turns out that that was indeed the case.

76
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,250
So here, we have situations where the context
now informs consumers about

77
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,860
what the right choice is.

78
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,150
And so, as we said before, humans are extremely
prone to the role of context

79
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,360
in decision-making.

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,660
A second example of the role of context in
decision-making comes from

81
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,800
a completely different domain--
the domain of organ donations.

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,460
Simple question--
why are organ donation consent rates really

83
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,530
low in countries like Canada
and the United States?

84
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,280
Why are they extremely high in other countries,
like France and Austria?

85
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,360
It turns out there are a number of differences
between countries like

86
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,500
Canada on the one hand, and Austria on the
other hand, but they don't seem to

87
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,290
explain the differences in organ donation
rates.

88
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,940
In Canada, organ donation rates are about
2.5%.

89
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,120
In Austria, they're close to 99%, and that's
a big difference.

90
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,620
The answer as to why there is a big difference
in donation rates comes

91
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,310
from the process that people need to engage
in order to

92
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,310
donate their organs.

93
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,680
In Canada, for example, if you want to donate
organs, you have to go to the

94
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,820
Department of Motor Vehicles, ask for a form,
fill it out, send it in.

95
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,650
You then get a web code that you go online,
access, and register, and then

96
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,949
you are an organ donor.

97
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,900
In Austria, it is assumed you will donate
your organs.

98
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,850
But if you want to not donate your organs,
you would go to the same

99
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,570
Department of Motor Vehicles, ask for a form,
fill it out, send it in, get a

100
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,990
web code, and then de-register from being
an organ donor.

101
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,460
Essentially, the default assumption is different
in Canada versus Austria,

102
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,100
and defaults play a huge role in shaping decision-making.

103
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,110
Defaults work because of two reasons.

104
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,280
Reason number one--
people are extremely lazy.

105
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,720
If you put obstructions in their approach
to a certain outcome, those

106
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,150
obstructions are enough to prevent them from
reaching that outcome.

107
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,470
So the simple principle that comes out is
if you want to engage people in a

108
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,000
certain outcome, make that outcome easy.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,450
Conversely, if you were to prohibit people
from engaging in that outcome,

110
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,479
impose a simple transaction cost or simple
obstacle, and they will not do

111
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,940
that outcome.

112
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,169
Second reason that defaults work is that defaults
signal something about

113
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,169
everybody else.

114
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,080
For example, if everybody else is donating
organs--

115
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,540
if that's the default--
perhaps I should donate organs, as well, because

116
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,310
that's the
right thing to do.

117
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,970
So what we've seen across these two examples
of the compromise effect--

118
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,460
Itamar Simonson's work--
and the default effect is the role that context

119
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,780
plays in
shaping human behavior.

120
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,870
The other big challenge in human decision-making
is our inability to

121
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,420
follow through on intentions that are our
own.

122
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,280
For example, all of us want to lose weight,
all of us want to work hard,

123
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,690
all of us want to save for the future, and
all of us want to exercise but we

124
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,640
don't get down to doing it.

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,400
And the reason we don't get down to doing
it is that life gets in the way.

126
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,240
So there's often a huge--
what we call--

127
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,550
action implementation gap, or a planning implementation
gap, where all

128
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,669
of us plan to do the right thing, but we just
don't get down to doing that.

129
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,940
And this gap, in conjunction with the idea
that context plays a huge role in

130
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,860
decision-making, is the perfect recipe for
all kinds of model

131
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,229
decision-making.

132
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:41,409
This is the reality of human decision-making.
