If you google the keywords "how to do laundry,"
you will

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,940
come across hundreds of articles.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,960
Common to all is the advice of separating
you colored clothing from

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
your whites.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,590
But how many people actually do that?

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,180
It turns out that the answer depends on how
you pay for your laundry.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,119
In a study done in a laundromat in 1999, 44%
of people who paid with

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,820
quarters separate their clothes.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,620
However, when they paid the same amount but
with a prepaid card, that

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,250
number went up to 60%.

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:44,090
The 

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,240
example of the laundry showed us that consumption
of a product or

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,900
service changes as a function of how you pay
for that product or service.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,649
Today, it's becoming increasingly easy and
convenient to make payments.

15
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,739
Think about the electronic wallet.

16
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,399
With an electronic wallet, you can use your
mobile phone to make a purchase

17
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,790
simply by tapping that phone on a terminal/
or the Octopus card has been

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,670
in Hong Kong for a number of years.

19
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,850
This is a prepaid RFID-based card which, again,
allows you to make a

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,750
payment simply by tapping your wallet onto
a terminal.

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,830
What happens when the payment form changes
and evolves away from cash?

22
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,000
The biggest effect of changing away from cash
is the fact that metering,

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,700
in a mental accounting sense, becomes difficult.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,840
Think about a simple world in which you could
either pay by cash or by

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
credit card.

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,420
When you pay by cash, you take out your wallet,
you count the bills, you

27
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,740
keep the change.

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,740
You have a very good idea of how much you've
paid because the process is

29
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,479
very salient.

30
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,061
When you pay by Octopus, or by a credit card,
it

31
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:51,590
happens all so quickly.

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,700
You don't see the numbers.

33
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,240
You don't rehearse them.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,680
You lose memory for how much you've paid.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,340
And in fact, today it is becoming increasingly
more difficult to keep

36
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,259
track of how much people have paid.

37
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,259
We are going to talk about a concept we call
the transparency of the

38
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,080
payment mechanism.

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,300
Cash is easily the most transparent of payment
mechanisms simply because you

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,470
have a very good visual idea of how much you're
paying.

41
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,330
But if you look at the transparency spectrum,
as you start moving away

42
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:26,140
from cash into checks, or plastic, debit cards,
credit cards, electronic

43
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,270
payments, and, finally autopay--
autopay is a system where you authorize your

44
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,060
bank account to
automatically make bill payments at the end

45
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,550
of every month.

46
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,310
What starts happening is that consumers lose
track of how much they

47
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,310
have spent.

48
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,980
In fact, as you go from the spectrum from
left to right, not only does the

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,760
physical similarity of the payment mechanism
to cash change, but also the

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,370
salience of the payment experience itself
reduces over time.

51
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,900
What happens when, in fact, that salience
goes down.

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,560
We document three effects in our research.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,640
The first effect is the idea of making metering
hard.

54
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,560
We found in our research, a number of years
back, then when you look at

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,180
people that have made payments by cash, those
payments are much more

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,650
memorable, and people are much more accurate
recalling how much they had

57
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,230
spent by cash.

58
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,310
Here's a simple experiment.

59
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,800
Next time your credit card bill comes home,
try and guess how much that bill

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,120
is going to be worth.

61
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Don't cheat.

62
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Don't look online.

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,049
And try and list down all the items that you
think you're going to see on

64
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,319
that statement.

65
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,560
It turns out most people do a horrible job
of predicting

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,170
their credit card bill.

67
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,220
They tend to not only forget smaller items,
but they tend to under report

68
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,739
the prices that they paid on several items.

69
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,269
So people in general have a poorer memory
for expenses that have happened

70
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,080
to the right of that spectrum.

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,519
The second thing that happens when you move
to the right kind end of the

72
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,390
spectrum is, from a mental accounting sense,
categorization becomes fuzzy.

73
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,560
Remember my friend's grandmom who had money
in different jars?

74
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,270
Once you start paying by credit cards, or
by an electronic, or e-wallet, or a

75
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,849
mobile wallet, it turns out that all of those
expenses are going to get

76
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,660
lumped into the same category.

77
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,930
Therefore, mental accounting becomes hard.

78
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,989
It becomes hard to track your expenses as
a function of category.

79
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,130
And finally--
and this is a problem unique to credit cards--

80
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,600
we found in our research with Amar Cheema
that people tend to use cues in

81
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,970
the environment to make judgments about their
wealth in a completely

82
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,630
irrational way.

83
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,410
In particular, in our research, we looked
at the effect of credit limits

84
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,780
on people's beliefs on how wealthy they were.

85
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,259
And we found out that people actually tend
to use the credit limit as a

86
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,110
signal for how prosperous they are.

87
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,610
When you combine these three factors, several
things happen.

88
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,620
People that tend to use electronic, or mobile,
or low-transparency methods of

89
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,530
payment tend to be more impulsive.

90
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,560
They tend to lose memory for their payments,
and they tend to spend

91
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,590
faster than people who actually use cash.

92
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,250
If you want to control how much you spend,
cash is still the king.
