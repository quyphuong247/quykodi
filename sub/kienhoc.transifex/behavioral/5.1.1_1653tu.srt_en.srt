Now that you know a lot of the basic principles
of behavioral

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,430
economics and you've studied a little bit
about how to design experiments,

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,900
you might want to think about topics with
which you could actually apply

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,770
some of these skills.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,230
And if you wanted to identify topics that
you could apply these skills to,

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,980
you need to go no further than your local
newspaper.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,890
Today's newspaper, for example, has stories
on a lot of things that are

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,570
relevant to us as behavioral economists.

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,690
There's a story on why people don't save as
much as we think they should.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,039
There's a story on unhealthy eating.

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,579
There are stories on why people don't donate
to charities.

12
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,940
There are stories about the fact that people
generate too much trash,

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,579
including items that they could put in the
recycling bin.

14
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,511
And finally, there are lots of stories about
self control more generally, and

15
00:00:54,511 --> 00:01:00,069
more specifically, as it applies to the workplace
and procrastination.

16
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:03,460
A number of years back, when I was searching
for topics to work on, that

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,460
is exactly what I did.

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,530
I looked at issues in the newspaper.

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,800
I looked at topics that I think I could apply
a lot of these skills to.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,150
And much of my work in the area of consumer
credit, in the area of goal

21
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,190
setting, bridging the gap between intentions
actions, was born out of

22
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,580
simply identifying a lot of real world problems
and then seeing what tools I

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,360
have at my disposal to address those problems.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,870
When I started doing my research, I worked
with a number of different

25
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,480
kinds of organizations.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,880
I worked with government organizations, not
for profits, NGOs,

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,030
and for profit companies, and I was struck
by one interesting fact.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,920
A lot of these organizations had an economic
advisor.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,810
None of them had a behavioral advisor.

30
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,000
And the reason this struck me as odd was that,
at the end of it, the heart

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,880
of every single problem that we just talked
about was to change the

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,880
behavior of the end user, be it getting somebody
to set aside the

33
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,620
extra $10 per week, or switching off their
air conditioning in the summer,

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,130
or making sure they replace that chocolate
cake with a

35
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,060
healthy helping of fruit.

36
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,200
Perhaps the one book that changed the fact
that companies and organizations

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,340
like governments started looking towards the
behavioral sciences was,

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,600
of course, the book that you've talked a lot
about, Nudge by Dick Thaler and

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Cass Sunstein.

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,700
It's now been about five years since this
book came out, and one questions

41
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,420
that I get asked a lot is, has the world really
changed

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,130
as a result of Nudge.

43
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,030
Have the principles that have been enshrined
in the book started to

44
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,281
influence the way in which governments, and
policymakers, and

45
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,690
welfare architects have gone about doing their
work?

46
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,069
And what I'd like to do in the next little
bit is to review some of the

47
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,780
key ideas from Nudge and, as well, talk about
how these have actually

48
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,510
made an impact in the world today.

49
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,760
Let's start off by reminding ourselves about
the four different strategies of

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,870
behavioral change that we've talked about
in week one.

51
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,050
We said initially that one common strategy
for governments in which to

52
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,580
influence behavior change is simply to impose
restrictions or constraints on

53
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,950
what people can choose.

54
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,420
Alternatively, the economic approach is to
offer incentives, either a

55
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,020
positive incentive through a reward program,
or negative incentive, which

56
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,940
would be a tax.

57
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,890
Third option is a marketing approach.

58
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,890
Persuasion.

59
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,890
Give people information.

60
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,319
Persuade them.

61
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,030
Convince them that they should choose the
preferred course of action.

62
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,280
And the fourth strategy, of course, that we
talked about, was the nudging

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,800
or the choice architecture strategy where
you simply make it easy for

64
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,830
people to accomplish the desired choice.

65
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,989
Now, we've got to be careful about making
sure that we do not fall into

66
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,900
the trap of thinking that these four strategies
are mutually exclusive,

67
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,310
that we should simply be nudging while ignoring
the other strategies.

68
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,060
This is not a story about nudging versus the
other three strategies.

69
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,110
It is a story about how we can best utilize
the right combination of these

70
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,090
strategies in behavior change.

71
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,020
Let's look at a simple example.

72
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,280
In 2009, the city of Toronto, like many other
cities all over the world,

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,949
decided to impose a small fee for the use
of plastic bags in grocery stores

74
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:21,250
and supermarkets, and department stores all
across the city.

75
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,750
Plastic bags, starting in 2009, were going
to cost $0.05 per bag, with the

76
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,580
idea that they would discourage people from
asking for plastic bags, and as a

77
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,390
result, build of culture of using reusable
cloth bags when they went

78
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,620
ahead and did their grocery shopping.

79
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,670
Is this an economic strategy to change behavior,
or is there more to it?

80
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:47,080
On the face of it, $0.05 seems like a punishment,
a tax for following the

81
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,320
undesirable behavior.

82
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,040
When you think about it a little bit more
carefully, though, it soon

83
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,530
emerges that it's not the fact that it is
$0.05 that matters, but the fact

84
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,870
that there is a payment to be made at all
that matters.

85
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,050
In other words, if you replaced $0.05 with
$0.10, or with $0.02, I suspect

86
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,690
you would have still gotten the same effect.

87
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,620
It isn't the fact that the amount of payment
changes, is the fact there is

88
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,930
a payment in the first place.

89
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,310
We've done a number of experiments in India
we were trying to get people in

90
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,130
the rural parts of the country to consume
financial advice.

91
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,750
And our initial response based on economic
theory was if you give advice

92
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,150
for free, it is more likely to be consumed.

93
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,760
We found the opposite effect.

94
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,110
We actually found that if you had people who
make small payments for

95
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,960
advice, they were much more likely to follow
through on that advice.

96
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,210
But here is the interesting fact.

97
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,600
It didn't matter how much they paid.

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,020
In one condition they paid 5 rupees, a second
condition, 10 rupees, a third

99
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,780
condition, they paid nothing.

100
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,370
And the consistent finding we found was that
people who had paid 5 or 10

101
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,420
rupees were much more likely to follow through
on the advice as compared to

102
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,460
people who had paid nothing.

103
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,280
The difference between paying 5 and 10 was
not significant.

104
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,420
The point I want to make here is that while
an element of financial

105
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,070
incentives, or economic incentives have been
used to get people to change

106
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,320
behavior, we could strengthen that particular
intervention by thinking

107
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,590
through a behavioral contribution to that.

108
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:29,240
Now, let's think about a few other examples
where there are differences

109
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,970
between an economic approach to changing behavior
versus a behavioral

110
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,770
approach to changing behavior.

111
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,199
A lot of times we find in the field of energy
conservation, for example, that

112
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,290
increasing prices does not have a significant
effect on the consumption

113
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,290
of electricity.

114
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,960
Why does that happen?

115
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,320
It happens in situations where households
typically pay their energy

116
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,380
bills by direct debit from their bank accounts,
so a lot of people actually

117
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,240
don't see the increased price that they pay.

118
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,479
And for the ones that do, they don't feel
its impact.

119
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,180
It's a mental accounting story.

120
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,740
If my average monthly expense is $42 per month,
and I now pay 10% more, it

121
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,020
goes from 42 to 46 or 47, it is still a $50
kind of experience.

122
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,449
In other words, it falls in the same mental
bracket in my head, and as a

123
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,699
result, there is no effect on consumption.

124
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,330
But on the other hand, think about a simple
strategy where you look at

125
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,840
people who make a payment for certain consumption
and fail to make the

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
consumption.

127
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,050
Along with this example, here is where we
looked at the ski tickets.

128
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,550
In one condition, we had a four day ski ticket,
which was framed as a

129
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,720
single unit, $160 for four days.

130
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,740
A second condition, four separate tickets
of $40 each.

131
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,400
Let's replace ski tickets with something that
you

132
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,270
want people to consume.

133
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,340
Let's imagine you are in the business of providing
insurance plans.

134
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,000
You notice that your plan that covers a free
annual checkup, or a checkup

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,860
that's included as part of the plan results
in very low take up rates.

136
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,850
Most people who are entitled to a check up
do not get it.

137
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,199
Suppose you gave them tickets that look like
this one.

138
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,150
So suppose you actually gave them a ticket
which made salient to them the

139
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,280
fact that they had actually prepaid for an
annual checkup.

140
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,819
Chances to high that they would actually go
and consume the checkup.

141
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,260
Here's an example of a situation where you
have an economic component, the

142
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,540
fact that people pay a price, but the strength
of that economic component

143
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,389
has been increased by simply changing a behavioral
factor, i.e.

144
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,080
the way in which the tickets are presented.

145
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,599
So in other words, you could think about the
effectiveness or one

146
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,321
specific kind of strategy, be it a nudging
strategy, be it an economic

147
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:50,200
strategy, be it a persuasion strategy, that
is affected or changed by the

148
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,290
presence of a second strategy.

149
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,750
And experimental language.

150
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,340
We going to call this an interaction effect.

151
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,140
The presence of an economic strategy can be
strengthened by simply crossing

152
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,820
it with a second behavior, or a nudging approach.

153
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,610
So when we think about these four approaches,
is easy to see that the

154
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:15,779
best approaches actually use a combination
of these four factors.

155
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,300
Over the past five years many governments
and not for profit

156
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,260
organizations all over the world have begun
to embed nudging into the way

157
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,490
they go about doing policy and welfare initiatives.

158
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,780
In particular, the United Kingdom, United
States, Denmark, and other

159
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,290
examples from countries like Singapore, Hong
Kong and India, as

160
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,000
well as Canada, have now begun to illustrate
that nudging is

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,500
truly here to stay.
