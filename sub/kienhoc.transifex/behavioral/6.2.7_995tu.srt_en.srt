Whether you're a manager or a policy maker
or run your own

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,900
company, you're often going to have to make
the following simple choice.

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,560
You have a decision to make.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,590
You've got data on which to make the decision.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,610
Should I use my intuition, my judgment, my
expertise in making a

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,590
choice, or should I rely on a model?

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,500
Now let's think about the difference between
the expertise of a model

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,780
versus the expertise of an expert, a manager,
a policy maker.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,970
Why does a model outperform an expert?

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,310
What are the three simple reasons?

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,140
The first, models are consistent.

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,550
They are after all mathematical equations.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,120
They can compute well, they can compute consistently,
they don't get bored.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,900
And so anytime you give the model the same
set of data, it is always going

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,489
to return to you the same prediction.

16
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,490
Second, models are never biased.

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,510
Models don't care about framing, they interpret
information down to its very

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,410
basics, they are not influenced by organizational
politics.

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,440
They're completely unemotional.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,480
They have no attachment to any of the options.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,430
Third, models never get tired, they don't
get fatigued.

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,750
The attention that a model gives to a problem
is going to be the same,

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,810
whether it has already solved a hundred such
problems or if it's doing

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,970
it for the very first time.

25
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,820
With managers, all of these three are issues.

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,770
We are, like it or not, influenced by the
context, and we've talked a lot

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,220
about that.

28
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,390
We are influenced by tiredness and we're of
course, emotional.

29
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,159
That said, experts have a place in the world.

30
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,690
And in particular, there are four reasons
why experts make better

31
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,840
decisions or better judgments than models.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,890
First, you've got to keep in mind that a model
only knows what the

33
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,990
expert tells it.

34
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,750
It's the expert who decides which cues are
relevant.

35
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,240
It's the expert that decides how to value
those cues.

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,400
And so if you don't have an expert, you're
not going to have a model in

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
the first place.

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,250
Second, when you think about attributes, there
are some attributes

39
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,239
that are easy to evaluate.

40
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,269
If you're buying a product, the price is an
easy to evaluate attribute.

41
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:14,880
There are some that are not.

42
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,889
So let's say you're hiding.

43
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:19,439
You're looking for creativity in an individual.

44
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,790
That's not easy to measure.

45
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,700
Experts are good at evaluating attributes
that are

46
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,659
difficult to evaluate.

47
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,939
Models don't know how to do it.

48
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:32,680
Third, experts can change strategy as a function
of time.

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,709
Experts can change strategy as a function
of what is

50
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,459
changing in the context.

51
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:40,230
If there's a recession, the expert knows what
to overweight and what to

52
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,230
underweight.

53
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,810
If there's a new product being launched by
a competitor, the expert

54
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,650
knows how to adjust the importance ratings.

55
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,090
Models don't know how to do that.

56
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,440
And finally, experts have access to more cues,
more pieces of information,

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,569
than models ever do.

58
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,480
Remember when we talked about interaction
effects?

59
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,890
Experts can actually make me think through
interaction effects.

60
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,129
Models can't do it.

61
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,809
They will keep using the same cues again and
again and again, even when

62
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:08,590
those cues are not relevant.

63
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,719
So obviously, both the expert and the model
are bringing

64
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,219
something to the table.

65
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:16,909
And the question is, which of these should
we choose?

66
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:20,540
Now that question was precisely the heart
of an interesting research paper

67
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,150
that was done by Bob Blattberg and Steve Hoch,
where they compared the

68
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,340
predictability of the judgments, and in fact
the quality of the outcome,

69
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,670
for model versus an expert.

70
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,809
And what they did was six different experiments
across six different

71
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:38,730
companies, different judgments, different
sets of data.

72
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,760
But here's what was common to all of them.

73
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,989
In every experiment, either a manager got
a bunch of data or a model was

74
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:50,099
given the same bunch of data.

75
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,920
And Hoch and Blattberg simply looked at the
performance of the manager

76
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,819
versus the performance of the model.

77
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,349
What is performance?

78
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:02,939
The correlation between what they predicted
and the truth.

79
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,499
Now what you see are six sets of bars in this
chart here.

80
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:11,309
The pink [the ones on the left]
bars stand for the performance of the model.

81
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:14,129
The violet [the ones in the middle]
bars stand for the performance of the expert.

82
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,489
What do the green [the ones on the right]
bars do?

83
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:21,930
What they did with the green bars was they
simply took a average prediction,

84
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,000
which was the average of what the model said,
and

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,970
what the manager said--
50-50.

86
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,470
And the green bars represent the performance
of the average as compared

87
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,820
to the other two bars.

88
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,840
And what you see across all of these experiments
is that the green bar is

89
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,810
always the tallest.

90
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,030
Which means, that the average performance
of the model and the

91
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,220
manager is better than the model alone or
the manager alone.

92
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,890
Now this is a story we've seen before.

93
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,571
We said the same thing with experts.

94
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:53,000
If you take two experts and you average their
prediction, is better

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,570
than the prediction of any one expert.

96
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,600
And it's the same story all over again.

97
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,780
Think about the expert in this case and the
model as

98
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,080
two different experts.

99
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,120
They're diverse.

100
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,090
They bring different skills.

101
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,950
One brings consistency, the other one brings
an ability to look at cues

102
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,950
differently.

103
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,880
And so when you average them, you end up with
an engine that is supreme as

104
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,950
compared to either of those two independently.

105
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,340
So next time when you think about using a
decision support system and

106
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,360
you think about using your own judgment, think
about it not as a

107
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,320
"which one should I pick" decision, but "how
should I combine them?"

108
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,130
And
the easiest prescription based on the research

109
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,750
you just saw, is 50-50.

110
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,530
Make it on judgment independent of what the
model says, let the model

111
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,560
make its judgement, look at the outputs, take
the average, and you

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,220
will do better than either yourself or the
model independently.
