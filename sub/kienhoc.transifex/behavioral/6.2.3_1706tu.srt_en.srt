Remember this jar?

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,220
A couple weeks back when we talked about mental
accounting and budgeting,

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,450
we had talked about the idea that people put
cash in jars like this one

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,800
in order to put a constraint on how much they
spend.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,640
Now, let me try a different example using
the same jar.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,810
This is my entertainment budget, and it's
got a bunch of coins.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,220
That's all it has.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,180
But looking at the jar, could you guess how
many coins

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,550
there are in this jar?

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,550
Simple question.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,400
Now, there are many ways in which you could
actually try

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,290
and answer this question.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,040
You could pick up the jar, you could rattle
it to get a sense of how many

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,260
coins there are.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,930
Or you could visually try and see how many
there are in the front, and then

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,470
multiply that by five or six, because that's
a good thumb rule

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,970
for thinking through.

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,210
Or you could multiply the height of the coins
through some process where

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,949
you have a judgment for how many coins there
are at each level.

20
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:03,220
There are many ways in which we could go across
making this judgment.

21
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,090
But you could also ask an expert.

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,170
Or, you could ask somebody else to give you
their estimate.

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,350
Now, let me tell you the answer.

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,270
There are 40 coins in this jar.

25
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,050
But let's imagine that you ask two people
how many coins there were, and

26
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,850
let's say that those two people give you two
numbers

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,490
each, or a number each.

28
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,860
How would you aggregate their two judgments
in order to arrive at a

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,330
judgment of your own?

30
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,510
Now, guessing how many coins are in this jar
is simply a metaphor for many

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,480
kinds of judgments that we make about things
that are going to

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
happen in the future.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,750
You hire a new employee, you're making a judgment
about how well he or she's

34
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,360
going to do for you.

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,270
You buy a stock, you're making a judgment
about what its price is going

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,730
to be five years from now.

37
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,880
And likewise, there are many, many other routine
judgement

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,560
tasks that we undertake.

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,290
And asking other people for advice for their
estimates is often a very good

40
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,539
strategy that we use.

41
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,230
So let's go back to the jars.

42
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,611
Let's say you ask two people for how many
coins do they

43
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,190
think are in this jar.

44
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,910
One of them says 50.

45
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,260
The other one says 60.

46
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,260
I thought, what's happened here is, both of
these judges have over

47
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,270
predicted, because we now know that the correct
answer is 40.

48
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,530
One of the judges is off by 10 coins, the
other one is off by 20.

49
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,750
But let's say you took the average of the
two judges.

50
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,350
The average will be 55, and the average error,
therefore, is 15.

51
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,630
It's better than one judge, but not as good
as the other judge.

52
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,920
Second possibility.

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,470
One of the judges over predicts.

54
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,080
The other one under predicts.

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,570
So let's say, for example, one of them tells
you that there are 50

56
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,310
coins in the jar.

57
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,959
The second one tells you, this looks like
28.

58
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,940
Now what's happened is your average is 39,
and the error of the average is

59
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,380
simply one.

60
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,180
So, just to sum up.

61
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,200
If you ask people for estimates, one of two
things could happen.

62
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,860
Thing number one.

63
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,800
Both of those judges over or under predict,
in which case your average is

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,850
better than one judge, but not as good as
the other one.

65
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,660
Or, one under predicts, one over predicts.

66
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,740
If that happens, the average is always going
to be better than either of the

67
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
two judges independently.

68
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,200
What's that telling us?

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,930
That's telling us that in many real world
cases, turns out that averaging

70
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,520
the opinion of two judges is often better
than listening to any advice of

71
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,440
any one judge on their own.

72
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,380
Let's think through this.

73
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,160
If two experts gave you advice, and you were
asked, what do I do with the

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,560
advice, what would most of us do?

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,440
Here's what we do.

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,811
We try and figure out which of these two experts
is the better expert, and

77
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,000
we go with that judgment.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,290
But the math's telling us that that might
actually be a wrong strategy.

79
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,319
That in fact, you might be better off simply
averaging.

80
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,700
And in particular, if you set your two experts
up such that, the dispersion

81
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,290
between the two is going to be high, one of
them is likely to over predict,

82
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,240
the other one to under predict.

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,849
Then averaging is always a better strategy
than relying on any one judge

84
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:20,000
at the same time.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,370
Now, much of the work in this area has been
done by two professors at Duke

86
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,140
University, Jack Soll and Rick Larrick.

87
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,190
And what Jack and Rick essentially argue is
that, while we can prove

88
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,940
mathematically that averaging is a dominant
strategy, most of us don't

89
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,940
believe it is.

90
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,940
Most of us believe that averaging results
in an average judgment.

91
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,740
It's not true.

92
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,940
Averaging actually results in a superior judgment.

93
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,650
Let's twist this the problem around slightly
differently.

94
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,090
Let's imagine you need advice on a situation.

95
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,350
You've got a problem to solve, you've got
an estimate to make.

96
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,820
You've done your homework, but you want a
second opinion.

97
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,100
You've got two folks you could go to.

98
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,771
Mr. A, or Mr. B. Mr. A has the same background
as you, the

99
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:09,930
same training as you.

100
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,940
Mr. B has a different background.

101
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,940
Who would you go to?

102
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,020
Now, it turns out a lot of people would tell
you they would rather go to

103
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,410
Mr. A, who has the same background as they
do.

104
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,139
But it turns out, Mr. B might be a better
bet.

105
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:24,139
Why?

106
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,460
Because now, you and your judge bring different
information to the table,

107
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,210
and therefore, if you averaged your two judgments,
you're more likely to

108
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,210
be accurate.

109
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,210
Second scenario.

110
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,800
Let's think about the same situation again.

111
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
You need advice.

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,190
You could to go to Ms. X or Ms. Y.

113
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,600
Ms. X has seen the same reports
that you have seen.

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,990
Ms. Y has had access to a different set of
reports.

115
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,800
Who do you get advice from?

116
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
And again, people will tell you that they
think they should go to Ms. X.

117
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,919
After all, they speak the same language.

118
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,240
We've seen the same reports.

119
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,650
But again, Ms. Y is perhaps a better choice,
because now you're bringing

120
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,290
more data, more information to the judgment
that you're going to make.

121
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,500
And that's an interesting puzzle here, is
most people have wrong intuitions

122
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,580
about who they should get advice from.

123
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,889
We think we should get advice from people
like us that have seen the same

124
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:17,889
data as us.

125
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,490
But in fact, we should be doing quite the
opposite.

126
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,510
Danny Kahneman and Dan Lovallo a number of
years back, wrote an

127
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,270
interesting paper that they called the Inside
versus the Outside Views of

128
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,300
problems or predictions or organizations.

129
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,330
They were studying venture capitalists.

130
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,290
And they would go and ask venture capitalists,
or entrepreneurs, in

131
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,860
fact, questions such as, what do you think
is going to be the likelihood

132
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,620
that your company is going to be successful,
defined in a given way,

133
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,050
five years from now?

134
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,680
And let's say the entrepreneur said 50%.

135
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,960
They would then say, well, but gee, the average
success rate in this

136
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,199
industry is only 10%.

137
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,490
That's the difference between an inside view
and an outside view.

138
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,820
The outside view collects a different set
of information, and looks at a

139
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,900
different set of perspectives than the inside
view.

140
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,250
The inside view looks at your capabilities.

141
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,229
The outside view looks at, what in the environment
could go wrong?

142
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:18,780
And the point that Kahneman and Lovallo were
making was that, again,

143
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,210
combining the inside with the outside gives
you a much better overall

144
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,110
perspective, because it lets you access a
broader set of information.

145
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,820
So, what is all of this telling us?

146
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,280
Well, it gives us four interesting perspectives,
in terms of how to think

147
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,590
through getting advice.

148
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,169
But before we get to those perspectives, there's
a common saying

149
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:44,830
that we've heard before, many, many times.

150
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,310
Two heads are better than one.

151
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,270
And that's true.

152
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,270
And in fact, it's a very common adage.

153
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,170
Many heads are better than two.

154
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,070
We've often see a lot of discussions surrounding
phenomena like this one.

155
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,270
The Wisdom Of Crowds.

156
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,021
The best way of winning a competition where
you have a jar like this, and

157
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:05,650
you have to guess how many objects are in
it, is to ask as many people as you

158
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,570
can for their estimates.

159
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,190
Simply average them, and that's likely to
be more accurate than any one of

160
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,260
their own judgments.

161
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,610
So four tips for making better decisions.

162
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,139
Tip number one.

163
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,820
Seek advice from people who are different
from you.

164
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,330
They could have different training.

165
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,009
They could come from a different part of the
world, or they have seen

166
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,430
different experiences, or have access to different
data.

167
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,539
Two.

168
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:36,269
Weight your advice at the same level as the
judge's advice.

169
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:40,110
Most of us tend to take a second opinion and
we like it if it conforms

170
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,849
with what we want, but we discard it if it
doesn't.

171
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,129
Wrong strategy.

172
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:48,129
Make sure you weight the judge's advice as
much as you

173
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,250
weigh your own judgment.

174
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,250
Three.

175
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,189
Get advice from as many judges as you can.

176
00:08:55,189 --> 00:09:00,140
The phenomena of the average of two being
better is only stronger when you

177
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,930
put three, four, five, or more judges.

178
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,540
And finally, if you don't have access to advice,
if you do not have anybody

179
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,130
you can turn to, use yourself as a second
person.

180
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,360
What do I mean by that?

181
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,199
Think about making the same judgment again
under a different set of

182
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:18,199
circumstances.

183
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:22,800
For example, if you made the original judgment
at work while you were busy

184
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,339
in the middle of a meeting, try and think
about the same problem in a

185
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,300
different context, when you're relaxed, when
you're sitting at home.

186
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,449
And it turns out, simply by thinking through
the same problem differently,

187
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,579
you might come to different judgments, take
the average, and that is likely

188
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,389
to be better than any one of those two judgments
that you made.
