Does restricting the right to withdraw funds
help

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,950
people to save more?

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,610
That was the topic of a paper by Nava Ashraf
and her colleagues published in

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,949
the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2006.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,000
The goal of this paper is to evaluate the
effectiveness of what is called

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,380
the commitment savings account.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,150
This is an account where clients commit not
to withdraw funds until the

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,060
account holders have reached a goal date or
have achieved a certain amount

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,060
of savings.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,270
There were two outcome measures of interests.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,489
One was the take up rate, the likelihood that
people would sign up

12
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,160
for an account like this one.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,660
And two, the actual savings.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,110
The paper reported one experiment, and we'll
talk about that experiment in

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,070
this module, but the goal was to test the
effectiveness of the commitment

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,769
savings account.

17
00:00:54,769 --> 00:01:00,429
It was a field experiment which only used
one factor, which was a type of a

18
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,469
savings account that was used.

19
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:07,570
In particular, there were three conditions,
a control condition, a

20
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,120
marketing condition, and a treatment condition.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,770
1,777 existing or former clients of a bank
in the Philippines were randomly

22
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,690
assigned to one of these three groups.

23
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,190
In the control condition, participants received
no face-to-face visits from

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,060
the bank, but they were simply offered the
chance to sign

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,200
up for a bank account.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,420
In the marketing condition, there was a face-to-face
meeting with the

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,220
marketer who encouraged them to save, and
then offered them the same regular

28
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,220
savings account that they saw in the control
condition.

29
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,780
And finally, in the treatment condition, they
again met a marketer

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,230
who encouraged them to save, but in this case,
they were offered the

31
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,500
commitment savings account.

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,740
So the difference between the control and
the marketing condition was that

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,030
the bank account was the same, but in the
marketing condition, there was an

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,050
actual face-to-face meeting.

35
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,770
The difference between the marketing and the
treatment condition was that

36
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,090
there was a face-to-face meeting for both
of them, but the bank account

37
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,379
that was offered was different across the
two.

38
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,019
Now, let's spend a minute talking about the
commitment savings account.

39
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:24,459
This was what was called a SEED account, in
which the right to

40
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,299
withdraw funds is restricted to the holders
until he or she reaches a

41
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:30,900
particular goal.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,239
Keep in mind that it is the user themselves
that enforce the right to

43
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,590
withdraw funds or the restriction on that
right.

44
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,010
Deposits can be made by using a lockbox or
an automated transfer from

45
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,800
a primary checking or savings account.

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,879
Now, in this experiment, in addition to simply
looking at the take up rate

47
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:56,359
and the savings, the authors also studied
personal characteristics of

48
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:57,580
the participants.

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,549
In particular, they looked at something called
hyperbolic preference

50
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,569
and that was measured by asking participants
to choose between an

51
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:10,799
option to receive a smaller sooner reward
versus a larger later reward.

52
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,790
So for example, those who choose the smaller
sooner reward were considered

53
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,090
to be more impulsive than those that were
willing to wait for the larger

54
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,400
later reward.

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
Other individual characteristics collected
included gender, current

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,519
savings balance, income, and so on and so
forth.

57
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,150
Now, the data analysis methods used to analyze
these data were a regression

58
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:40,989
analysis, and in particular for the choice
data, it used Probit, which is

59
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:47,099
a specific form of a Logit regression, and
for the savings data, the OLS

60
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,670
approach, or the optimal least square approach
to regression, but in

61
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,790
general, it was regression either in a Probit
format for the take up rate or

62
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,930
the OLS for the savings account.

63
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,049
Here's what they found.

64
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:06,249
The take up of the commitment savings product
went up with impatience.

65
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:10,560
The more impatient people were, the higher
the hyperbolic preference,

66
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,569
greater was the take up.

67
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:19,730
Women were more likely to take up, as well
as people who were more educated

68
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,160
and had higher income.

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,480
So in other words, what they found was four
factors seem to drive the take up

70
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,500
rate for the SEED product.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,230
When it comes to the results on the savings
amount, again, keep in mind

72
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,800
that it was analyzed by using a regression
that had a constant.

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,260
In other words, the intercept and a couple
of coefficients that was

74
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,950
significant, so one of the coefficients that
was significant for

75
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,700
the actual savings six months out was the
commitment treatment.

76
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,410
People in the commitment treatment were much
more likely to save more

77
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,730
than people in the other conditions.

78
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,130
And that was the case as well 12 months out.

79
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,260
Keep in mind that while the coefficients for
marketing appears to

80
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,530
be large, it was not significant.

81
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,410
In the most papers, you will notice the use
of the star to represent

82
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,790
coefficients that are significant.

83
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,630
If there's no star, that suggests that those
coefficients were not

84
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,040
statistically significant.

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,380
So what was the conclusion?

86
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,330
Females with hyperbolic preferences are more
likely to open the commitment

87
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,330
savings products.

88
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,090
After 12 months, the average of savings balances
for people in the

89
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,950
treatment group increased by 81% compared
to the control group.

90
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,349
And so in fact, the commitment device does
indeed help people save more.
