00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,140
https://youtu.be/vtYzXhHYLo4
All of us have heard the statement that a
penny saved is a

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,140
penny earned.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,969
In fact, economic theory tells us that money
is fungible.

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,340
And what that essentially means is that a
dollar is a dollar, no matter

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,590
how you earn it, no matter where you save
it, and no matter what currency

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,040
or form it takes.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,689
For example, I have in my right hand a $20
bill, and in my left hand three

8
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,270
bills that total $20.

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,860
And if economic theory is to be believed,
I'm going to spend this in

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,399
exactly the same way as that.

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,410
It turns out that my research shows that that
is not true.

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,710
And, in fact, the principle of fungibility
is often violated.

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,720
Today, I want to spend some time talking about
an area of research,

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,270
mental accounting, which is perhaps the single
area in which I have done

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,490
most of my own research over the past 20 years.

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,580
Let me start off by throwing a simple illustrative
hypothetical example.

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,180
Let's imagine you love music.

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,980
You've got tickets to the symphony.

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,830
You've paid $50.

20
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,430
And let's create two versions of this story.

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,990
In story one, you go to the symphony hall.

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,439
You buy a ticket, and then you have some time.

23
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,609
You go out and get a snack.

24
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,229
When you come back, you realize that you have
lost the ticket.

25
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,939
You go to the box office.

26
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,719
The box office tells you that the only way
in which you can get to consume

27
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,130
the symphony is to buy a second ticket, because
there were no seat

28
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,710
numbers on the original.

29
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,219
Would you buy a second ticket?

30
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,189
Here's a second version of the same story.

31
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:38,889
You go to the symphony hall.

32
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:40,979
You've planned to spend $50.

33
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,889
But before you buy the ticket, you realize
that you

34
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:45,499
have lost $50 in cash.

35
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:48,840
And the question is, would you buy a ticket
to the symphony?

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,049
Now, if you're an economist, both of these
stories are

37
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,399
exactly the same story.

38
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,670
In both stories, you lost a piece of paper,
you lost it because of your own

39
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,249
carelessness, and it was the same exact symphony,
and the same

40
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:03,130
performance, that you were about to consume.

41
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,570
Yet, as Richard Thaler showed us in one of
his landmark papers, people in

42
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,660
the first story are much more likely to say,
no, they would not buy a

43
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,280
second ticket than people in the second story.

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,730
If you lose cash, it turns out you're willing
to buy a ticket.

45
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,810
If you lose a ticket, you do not want to buy
a second ticket.

46
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,870
Why does that happen?

47
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,540
Mental accounting explains this story.

48
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,870
What is mentally accounting?

49
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,240
It is the idea that people tend to label money
with certain names.

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,560
And the moment you label money differently,
it gets spent

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
differently.

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,660
People behave like accountants.

53
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,590
It sounds like a bit of a scary concept, but
that's what we do.

54
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,110
For example, if you decide to watch a symphony
worth $50, what you might end

55
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,480
up doing is to create an account in your head.

56
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,920
It's called the symphony.

57
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,400
It's got a budget of $50.

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,330
And the moment you've bought the ticket, that
budget is gone.

59
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,330
It's blown.

60
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,540
So now if you lose the ticket, you have nothing
left in that budget.

61
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,630
On the other hand, if you lose cash, that's
OK, because that comes from the

62
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,910
general expenses account.

63
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,730
So the point is very simple.

64
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,910
People look at their money, and they tend
to categorize it into different

65
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,080
groups, and, as a result, they spend money
differently.

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,270
A number of years back, I was doing some research
in Canada--

67
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,140
and previously in India--
on different budgeting techniques that people

68
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,860
use for their money.

69
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,900
And I came across an interesting story from
a friend of mine who was telling

70
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,900
me about how his grandmother used to budget
their household expenses.

71
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,650
That method of budgeting is something called
Jar Accounting.

72
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,970
Or Viviana Zelizer, who's a sociologist at
Princeton, documents a

73
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,840
similar phenomenon that she calls Tin Can
Accounting.

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,830
And the idea is simple.

75
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,790
Husband comes home, thinks about all of the
disposable income that they

76
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,610
have to spend for the month.

77
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,610
They budget that into separate categories,
and they put them in

78
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,350
separate jars with different names on it.

79
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,600
So, for example, this one is a jar called
"eating out."

80
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,110
It's got $70 and
some change in it.

81
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,580
This one is called but "Dilip's allowance."

82
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,580
It's got only $5.

83
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,780
And so on, and so forth.

84
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,500
And the next time you're faced with a consumption
opportunity, what you do

85
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,180
is you look at the jar.

86
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,630
So your kids come to you, and say, can I go
get an ice cream?

87
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,630
You look at the jar.

88
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,250
If there's money in there, you say, OK.

89
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,060
If there isn't enough money, you say, no.

90
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,970
So what's happened here is you've taken cash,
which is fungible--

91
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,000
it could have been this, or this.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,970
But then you put a label on it-- ice cream
money and entertainment money.

93
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,580
And the moment you put a label on it, you
tend to spend those funds

94
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,460
differently.

95
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,260
So how do people mentally account?

96
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,240
How do they create these different categories?

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,460
Well, there's a number of different ways in
which they do it.

98
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,690
You could mentally account as a function of
how you earn the money.

99
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,520
If I find money on the streets, I'm going
to spend it differently from if

100
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,230
I worked really hard to earn it-- fun money,
laborious money.

101
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,740
Fun money is spent on frivolous stuff.

102
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,810
Money that earn through my salary is typically
spent on paying my bills.

103
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,340
The other way in which you could account is
by time period.

104
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,700
You could budget by the week, or by the month,
or

105
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,660
sometimes even by the day.

106
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,451
Alternately, you could budget as a function
of different expenses, or

107
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,870
different categories-- like we just saw here.

108
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,850
And finally you could even create mental accounts
for a specific

109
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,790
transaction, like the symphony example that
we looked at.

110
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,970
Every mental accounting process has two components.

111
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,870
Part one is what we call the metering process.

112
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,020
The metering process looks at counting how
much money is

113
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,630
actually in the account.

114
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:43,230
Part two is the scope or width of the mental
account, defining the category

115
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,920
over which that account exists.

116
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,889
For example, when I look at the symphony mental
account, it's a narrow

117
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:50,889
mental account.

118
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,840
It exists only for that particular consumption
opportunity.

119
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,750
And the metering part of it is a negative
50, which I have just

120
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,240
incurred in order to see the symphony.

121
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,480
Now, the moment you actually incur or prepay
to consume something in the

122
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,460
future, it sets up an interesting mental accounting
phenomenon that we

123
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,590
call the Sunk Cost Effect.

124
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,590
What does that mean?

125
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,620
It means the following.

126
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,060
Let's, again, go back to our symphony example.

127
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
You spent $50.

128
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,990
You plan to go to the symphony.

129
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,910
And if you live in Toronto, let's say there's
a really bad

130
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,791
snowstorm, or a blizzard.

131
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,310
It's difficult to drive.

132
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,280
Your friends tell you it's perhaps not worth
going to the symphony.

133
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,100
But you go.

134
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,270
And the reason you go is because the $50 would
otherwise burn a hole in

135
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,720
your pocket.

136
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,350
In India, when I grew up, there used to be
a term that was called "paisa

137
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,350
vasool."

138
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,080
And what "paisa vasool" stood for is making
sure you get your

139
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,220
money's worth.

140
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,300
And that effect turns out to be relatively
irrational economic

141
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,280
behavior, because economic theory tells us
that we should make decisions

142
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,139
based on what's going to happen in the future,
ignoring sunk costs.

143
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,770
But Dick Thaler, for example, in a lot of
his early work, documented a number

144
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,669
of instances of people who made irrational
decisions simply because

145
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,530
they had paid more to consume something in
the future.

146
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,790
If you've paid $100 to go see a basketball
game, you will go see it no

147
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,680
matter how bad the weather is.

148
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,880
If you got the same seat as a gift for free,
you're likely to

149
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,560
not go during a snowstorm.

150
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,490
There are people who actually play tennis
with a terrible tennis elbow

151
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,210
simply because they have prepaid to consume
a set of lessons.

152
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,020
And so the Sunk Cost Effect becomes a huge
motivator of consumer behavior.

153
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,110
If people prepay for something, it is very
likely that they will want to

154
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,850
consume something.

155
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,680
And that is something that is called the Red
and the Black accounting.

156
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
The idea is simple.

157
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,960
The moment you prepay, you have a deficit
in your account.

158
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,550
If you cannot consume, then you have to close
your account in the red.

159
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,500
It's like making a loss.

160
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,420
People don't like making losses, and so they
are driven to consume that

161
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,610
particular product opportunity.

162
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,680
So the Sunk Cost Effect turns out to be a
huge motivator in nudging people

163
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,029
to consume products and services.
