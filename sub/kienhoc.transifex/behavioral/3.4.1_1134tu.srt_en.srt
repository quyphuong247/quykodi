00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,980
https://youtu.be/VqDIeYtt5uc
Thus far we've seen a number of different
kinds of

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,980
experiments.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,860
We've seen experiments in the lab, we've seen
some in the field, we've

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,550
seen fully-crossed designs, we've seen designs
that are simple before and

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,760
after designs, we've seen experiments with
you students as participants,

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,930
we've also seen experiments that use adults
and people in the marketplace

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,450
as participants.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,800
Let's think for a moment about how to organize
the different kinds of

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,910
experiments that we've seen.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,219
And I want to organize them into three sets
of experiments.

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,660
The first set is the lab experiments.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,300
And, in particular, there are two kinds of
lab

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,300
experiments that we can do.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,730
You could bring people into a lab, you could
ask them to make hypothetical

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,380
choices that have no real consequences and
then analyze their hypothetical

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,880
choices or their hypothetical judgments that
they come up with.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,780
We saw an example of this in the past.

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,649
The experiment about consumer credit and the
fact that people tend to spend

19
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,970
more using credit cards as opposed to a check
was an example of a

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,250
hypothetical experiment.

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,439
People hypothetically were given an income
profile, they were giving a

22
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,590
savings profile, they were offered a hypothetical
set of choices, and they

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,499
were told that if this was the financial profile
that you had, would

24
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:22,670
you or would you not make the choice.

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,560
So, in essence, in that experiment, people
were responding to a

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,639
hypothetical set of circumstances.

27
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:33,359
But you could also have experiments in which
people come to the lab and make

28
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,340
real choices that have real monitoring consequences.

29
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,109
The experiment we saw with Drazen Prelec and
Duncan Simester, where they

30
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:44,759
asked students to bid for tickets to a Boston
Celtics game

31
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,299
was one such example.

32
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,599
Participants came for the lab, they were put
into different experimental

33
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,939
conditions, but they then had to bid in an
auction setting and, if in fact

34
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,270
they won, they had to actually pay for the
tickets that they bid for.

35
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,659
So in a lab you could, again, have two kinds
of studies, hypothetical or

36
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,749
studies with real consequences.

37
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:11,420
The second set of experiments that I want
to talk about are what we call

38
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,480
natural experiments, or experiments using
archived data.

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,470
The world often conspires to create experiments
all around us.

40
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,110
For example, the laundry study.

41
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,880
It was a natural experiment.

42
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,250
It just happened that the management of the
laundromat decided to switch

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,300
from quarters to prepaid cards, and that gave
us an opportunity to study

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,890
it's effect on a particular outcome variable.

45
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,030
Likewise, there could be all kinds of other
natural experiments.

46
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,860
Sometimes the natural experiments happen without
us even knowing that

47
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,420
those experiments have happened.

48
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,490
For example, Colin Camerer and his colleagues
were trying to understand

49
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,690
the driving behavior of taxi cab drivers in
New York.

50
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,980
And they were simply trying to answer the
question, does their behavior

51
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,470
change as a function of whether they have
a high wage rate day, or a low

52
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,920
wage rate day.

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,400
You're wage rate is high on an average if
it's a rainy day.

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,350
There's a greater demand for taxis, if there's
a convention in town.

55
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,170
It is low when there is nothing out of the
ordinary happening in that

56
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,170
particular date.

57
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,070
And essentially, what Colin and his colleagues
were able to do is they

58
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:24,650
were able to simply look at archived data
and look back at weather reports

59
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,790
as well as history of conventions and so on
and so forth to then try and

60
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,820
match days on which they had records for driving
behavior, as well as the

61
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,780
weather on that particular day.

62
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,550
Or think about the euro in the 1990s.

63
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,640
Back in the 1990s, when the European Union
decided to switch away from

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,030
their home currencies into the euro, there
were some countries that had

65
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,030
extremely numerous currencies.

66
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,780
Think about the Italian lira, for example,
that then

67
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,960
switched to the euro.

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,380
Beautiful natural experiment.

69
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,209
Now you could look at the way in which the
same people who spend numerous

70
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,819
liras spend a smaller number of euros.

71
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:11,190
So in some there are two kinds of experiments
that the world conspires

72
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,190
to create for us.

73
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,380
There are some in which there's a archive
of data that already exists,

74
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,850
you might need to go out and collect and document
that data.

75
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,599
Or their experiments in which the work conspires
to create conditions for

76
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,069
you, but you might need to go and ask people
questions or observe behavior

77
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:33,199
to document the effect of that intervention
on people's behavior.

78
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,259
And finally, there are two sets of experiments
that we call field

79
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,650
experiments and they differ in the scale.

80
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,240
Both in field experiments, as well as what
we call randomized controlled

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,280
trials, the researcher actively goes out into
the field and they come up

82
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,110
with an intervention or a manipulation to
look at the effect of a predictive

83
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,510
variable on people's actual decision making.

84
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,969
Think about the research we did in India where
we helped people save more

85
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:04,069
money by putting cash salary in envelopes.

86
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,499
In that case we had a few conditions.

87
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:10,210
We had some laborers who got no envelopes,
there were some who got

88
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,759
plain white envelopes, there were others that
caught envelopes with

89
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,159
pictures of their children on it.

90
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,999
We had a small number of conditions and we
were able to document savings

91
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,509
behavior by individually going and talking
to each of those

92
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,860
laborers over time.

93
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,400
On a larger scale, you could think of studies
of where people have thousands

94
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,199
and thousands of respondents.

95
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,819
Study by Marianne Bertrand and her colleagues
had as many as 15,000 to

96
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,210
16,000 respondents.

97
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,059
What they were doing was they were working
with a company that sends out

98
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:45,789
mailings for loan products, and what they
were able to do is they were able

99
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,740
to manipulate the features of the mailing
in order to see the effect on

100
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,800
pick-up or acceptance of those loan products.

101
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,720
In their experiment they had about 10 factors
that they manipulated with

102
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,590
about two or three levels each.

103
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,990
So you can imagine there were a very large
number of conditions.

104
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,360
Now if you put all of these sets of experiments
together, you see a

105
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,120
spectrum that goes from the very top where
you have simple lab experiments

106
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,249
where people make hypothetical choices to
the very bottom where you fairly

107
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:21,800
complex randomized controlled trials with
lots of things being manipulated

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,409
and with data collection being done in the
field.

109
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:28,180
What you get at the top is control.

110
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,039
In the lab you can make sure that all of your
background variables are

111
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,039
controlled.

112
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,620
What you get at the bottom is realism.

113
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,900
You make sure that what you are studying in
this experiment is real,

114
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,050
because at the end of the day, you're documenting
real effects on real

115
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,400
people making real decisions.
