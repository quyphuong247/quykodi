Now that we know what choice architecture
is and what a

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,180
Nudge is, let's think for a moment about a
framework to organize all of

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,230
the different kinds of Nudges that we have
come across.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,850
There are four dimensions on which nudges
can be organized.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,929
The first dimension is one in which you can
categorize Nudges just whether

6
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:29,380
they boost self-control or they activate a
desired behavior.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,809
In the boosting self-control type of Nudge,
we're typically faced with a

8
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,430
situation where the consumer or the individual
knows what they need to do,

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,579
but simply need a Nudge to stay committed
to that particular behavior.

10
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:48,129
Whereas, in the activation kind of Nudge,
the individual is perhaps not

11
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:51,890
even aware of the right outcome, or the right
behavior, and so they need

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,770
to be steered towards that desired behavior.

13
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,089
Nudges can also be categorized by whether
they are externally-imposed or

14
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:02,670
they are self-imposed.

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,180
Earlier, we talked about consumers that are
sophisticates, or individuals

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,350
that are sophisticates.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,240
These are people that have a self-control
problem and they know

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,670
that they have a self-control problem.

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,680
These are the kinds individuals who might
want to impose a Nudge on

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,909
themselves to make sure that they, in fact,
follow through

21
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:25,189
on the chosen action.

22
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,790
Externally-imposed Nudges, on the other hand,
might be Nudges imposed by

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,720
some other party.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,990
It could be a government.

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,040
It could be a not-for-profit organization.

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,710
It could be a think tank.

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,670
Or it could even be a marketing organization.

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,369
Nudges can also be classified as to whether
they are mindful or mindless.

29
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:50,159
We think about a mindful Nudge as one that
increases cognition and gets

30
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,259
people to think more a little bit about their
decision at hand.

31
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:59,390
Mindless Nudges, on the other hand, go the
opposite way.

32
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,930
Mindless Nudges are effective because the
individual typically currently

33
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,759
faces too much of a cognitive overload.

34
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,580
And so we simply try and make it easy for
them to move towards the final

35
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,610
outcome by making it easy and getting them
to think less about the decision.

36
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,239
And finally, another way of classifying Nudges
is by what we call

37
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,600
encouraging Nudges versus discouraging Nudges.

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,170
When you think about consumers trying to make
the right choice, they can

39
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:37,569
often not make the right choice because something
else dominates, some

40
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,870
other activity takes up their time.

41
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,950
In which case, we want to come up with a Nudge
that discourages that

42
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,970
particular competing activity.

43
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,510
Or we could think of a Nudge that encourages
the focal activity.

44
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,599
Now when you think about these four different
dimensions of Nudges and put

45
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,830
them all together, you will end up with a
table or a taxonomy

46
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,530
that looks like this.

47
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,070
We've got mindful versus mindless.

48
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,780
We have encouraging versus discouraging.

49
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,780
We have externally-imposed versus self-imposed.

50
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,420
And we have Nudges that activate versus those
that boost self-control.

51
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,030
In a future section, we're actually going
to look at multiple cases and

52
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,000
try and fit them in the context of this framework.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,049
But for now, let's spend a minute talking
about the extreme conditions

54
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,110
in this taxonomy.

55
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,540
Let's start at the bottom right.

56
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,450
A simple Nudge where an individual can channel
money into a separate bank

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,670
account to reduce the likelihood that it is
spent is a mindless Nudge

58
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,940
because it makes the decision easy by moving
the money into a separate part.

59
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,200
It discourages spending.

60
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,939
It is typically self-imposed because the consumer
knows that they want to

61
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,330
constrain their own spending.

62
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,620
And it enhances self-control.

63
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:06,650
On the other hand, a Nudge where you can simplify
tax rules to make tax

64
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,159
filing easier encourages the target behavior,
which is filing of taxes.

65
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,290
It is externally-imposed because typically
the tax authorities or the

66
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,250
government would actually impose the Nudge.

67
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,070
It is mindful because it gets the end user
to think about the tax decision.

68
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,230
And it activates the desired behavior rather
than thinking about a

69
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,660
particular impulse control or self-control
device.

70
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,420
Now, just a couple of caveats before we move
on.

71
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,610
The goal in presenting this framework is to
aid in organizing everything we

72
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,360
know in terms of cases and examples of previous
Nudges.

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,970
By putting together all of these different
dimensions into a unifying

74
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,030
framework, it helps us develop a ground for
a process

75
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,030
for designing Nudges.

76
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,830
And so when we actually go on and think through
a process where we look

77
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,730
at how to design Nudges, we'll keep making
references

78
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,590
back to this framework.

79
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,980
Also, keep in mind that different programs
could employ multiple Nudges.

80
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,660
And hence, they might span multiple cells,
or occupy multiple cells in

81
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,390
this framework.

82
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,640
In the next section, we'll look at a number
of cases.

83
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,800
And think about how exactly they fit into
each of the cells of this

84
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,540
particular framework.
