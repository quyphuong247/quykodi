In this segment, we'll ask ourselves what
the building blocks

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,080
of experiments are and get to know the key
terminology as we think about

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,440
designing experiments.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,269
But before we do that, let's think about why
experiments are done in the

5
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:17,310
first place.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,140
There are five reasons for doing experiments.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,590
The first is to document behavioral phenomena.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,460
Any major phenomena, like decision biases
or strategies used for making

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,649
decisions, are typically documented by doing
a series of experiments over

10
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:38,109
time that converge towards the same conclusion.

11
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:43,059
Second, experiments are often run to develop
a theory to explain the

12
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,769
phenomena that have been documented, as we
discussed earlier.

13
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:51,379
Third, we often do experiments to study the
effect sizes

14
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:52,789
of different phenomena.

15
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:58,100
For instance, how large is the effect caused
by, let's say, something like

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,210
information framing or presenting something
as pennies a day on the

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,769
final measure of interest?

18
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,710
Which, in this case, could be the likelihood
that people make a purchase

19
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,150
or a donation.

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,490
A fourth reason for running experiments is
to reconcile and test

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,150
across theories that make conflicting predictions.

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,150
And finally, we often do experiments to test
for the efficacy of what we

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,980
call in behavioral economics as nudges or
behavior changing interventions.

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:35,450
So these are five good reasons for why experiments
are typically conducted.

25
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,520
Every experiment studies the relationship
between one variable,

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,450
that we call a cause, and it's consequence,
which is

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,420
often called an effect.

28
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,880
In a nutshell, every experiment tries to show
that a particular cause

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,560
results in a specific effect.

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,230
For example, framing a price as pennies a
day, or framing a request

31
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,670
for a contribution as pennies a day, results
in greater spending or perhaps

32
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,130
a greater likelihood of donation.

33
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,929
Likewise, in a sunk cost setting, increasing
the amount that people

34
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,769
prepay for a basketball game ticket increases
the likelihood that they

35
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,870
will fall prey to the sunk cost effect.

36
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,680
In this case, the framing of the price as
pennies a day or the dollars that

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,670
are spent in prepaying for a given ticket
are the cause, while the

38
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,049
greater spending that occurs as a result,
or the greater sunk cost

39
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:37,790
effect that occurs as a result, will be the
effect.

40
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,209
Let's focus a minute on the pennies a day.

41
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,779
The idea behind the pennies a day research
was that taking a particular

42
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:49,810
price and framing that as a pennies a day
expense, let's say $1 a day,

43
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,159
increases the likelihood that people will
spend on that product or service.

44
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,769
Why does this happen?

45
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,739
John Gourville's work suggested that when
a price is framed as a pennies a

46
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,019
day price, it increases the perception of
affordability of the product,

47
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,840
thereby resulting in greater spending.

48
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,139
This intermediate variable between the cause
and the effect is often called a

49
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,630
mediating variable.

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,819
So in this case, the cause results in the
mediator, which in turn results in

51
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:30,659
the effect of interest, i.e.
pennies a day changes the perception of affordability,

52
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,120
which itself results
in greater spending.

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,129
Let's go back and think again about the basic
cause and effect medium.

54
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,450
Again going back to pennies a day, the research
suggested that framing

55
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,680
something as pennies a day increases in greater
spending.

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,590
But if you remember, this effect happens only
when the pennies a day

57
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,169
frame results in a dollar amount that can
be compared easily to other

58
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:02,499
expenses that the consumer might make that
are in the range

59
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:03,519
of pennies a day.

60
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,260
If in fact, the per day expense goes up to
a certain level, let's say it's

61
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,849
$25 or $20, then the pennies a day effect
might backfire because now the

62
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:19,900
consumer cannot recall anything else they
do that routinely cost them $15

63
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,560
or $20 or $25 a day.

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,340
In other words, pennies a day will result
in greater spending, but only

65
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,660
for small daily amounts and not when, in fact,
the daily amount or the daily

66
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,600
equivalent is large.

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,310
In the language of experimental design, this
third variable is called

68
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,210
a moderator variable.

69
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,250
A cause results in an effect.

70
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,840
And that relationship between cause and effect
is changed as a function of

71
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
the moderator.

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,060
The moderator, in this case, eliminates the
effect.

73
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,860
But it could also strengthen or weaken the
effect in question.

74
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,170
Now, let's think about some other elements
of an experiment.

75
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,940
We've talked a little bit earlier about a
control condition and a

76
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,600
treatment condition.

77
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,390
A control condition is one in which there
is typically the

78
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,400
absence of the cause.

79
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,630
In the kinds of experiments that we often
run in behavioral economics, a

80
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,590
control conditioned represents a condition
where the intervention, or

81
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,310
the nudge , that you're trying to test is
absent.

82
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,000
Or it typically represents the status quo
or the way in which a choice is

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,280
typically currently being made.

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,910
In a treatment condition, we often add in
the intervention that we

85
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,550
are trying to test.

86
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,250
Or more broadly speaking, we try and add in
the factor that we call the

87
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,620
cause, to see if, in fact, it changes the
effect.

88
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,080
Now, oftentimes in an experiment we could
have multiple causes or multiple

89
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,390
treatments that are employed simultaneously.

90
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,400
A condition refers to the collection of specific
tasks and stimuli that the

91
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,590
experimenter presents to a participant.

92
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,810
In a given condition, we might have two or
three or perhaps even one

93
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:24,750
factor that has been manipulated by the researcher.

94
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,100
Treatments themselves may take the form of
many factors.

95
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,510
Each factor could have multiple levels.

96
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,230
For example, in one of the experiments we
saw earlier, price framing is a

97
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,240
factor that has simply two levels, an aggregate
level or an at a

98
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,370
pennies a day level.

99
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,850
But you could think of many factors that are
multiple levels.

100
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,360
Think about the sunk cost effect.

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,770
We could run an experiment in which a ticket
that has been purchased for a

102
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:58,320
basketball game has been obtained for free,
for $10, for $20, or for $30.

103
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,550
In this case, the price that has been prepaid
for the ticket is the

104
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,580
treatment in question, in fact, the factor
that we are studying.

105
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,340
But it has four levels, 0, 10, 20, and 30.

106
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,810
And finally, there are a number of things
we could measure as the effect

107
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,890
variable or the outcome variable.

108
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:24,090
In experiments, you could study the effect
of a cause on the attitudes or

109
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,150
on the strength of preference or on the choices
that participants make.

110
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,550
In behavioral economics, we typically study
the effect only on choices.

111
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,140
Although, some researchers do study effects
on attitudes, as well as the

112
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,150
strength of preference.

113
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,520
Now, we've often used the word "manipulation"
in this course.

114
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,810
What is a manipulation?

115
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,240
It is any aspect of a process or a task that
the experimenter changes

116
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,180
across experimental groups.

117
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,360
When we visited the lab, we heard Julie say
that the entire set of

118
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,760
experiences that a participant goes through
can be potentially manipulated

119
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,440
from the way the information is presented,
the font in which a text is

120
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,780
written, or even the color or temperature
or different elements of

121
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,270
the background.

122
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:21,200
So any element of the task that is changed
by the experimenter across

123
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,120
groups is called a manipulation.

124
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,560
A couple of other terms to keep in mind when
we think about experiments.

125
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,550
The first is background variables.

126
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,710
What's a background variable?

127
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,400
Any set of variables that are given in an
experiment and are not manipulated

128
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,010
are background variables.

129
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:46,490
Oftentimes, the location, at which data has
been collected, or the

130
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,120
ethnicity of the participants or the gender
or the education level, all

131
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,400
represent background variables that are given
in the context of an

132
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
experiment.

133
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,650
We have to make sure that we interpret the
experiments in the context of the

134
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,430
background of that experimental setting.

135
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,520
In particular, care must be taken in order
not to generalize too much from

136
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,330
a given set of background variables and push
the results of the experiment

137
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,150
into other conditions of background variables.

138
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,080
And in fact, that's why replication of the
key

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,290
experimental results are important.

140
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,960
It is important to replicate the experiment
across different sets of

141
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,580
background variables, so that the researcher
has greater confidence in

142
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,630
the results.

143
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,980
Randomization refers to the act of allocating
participants to different

144
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,180
conditions randomly.

145
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,310
Why this is important is that it minimizes
what is called selection

146
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,440
bias or allocation bias.

147
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,930
For example, think about doing a field study
of consumers that use credit

148
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,090
cards versus cash or checks when they make
purchases.

149
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,670
If you simply observe what's happening in
the field, you might notice that

150
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,790
people that use credit cards spend more than
people

151
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,520
that use cash or checks.

152
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,570
But it could be that people who expect to
spend more decide to use credit

153
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,570
cards in the first place.

154
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,839
And so here what you're seeing is the true
cause is the

155
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,700
actual level of spending.

156
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,680
The effect is the credit card versus cash
choice.

157
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,420
And if you make the opposite conclusion, if
you make the conclusion

158
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,830
that the payment mechanism actually changes
how much people spend, that

159
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:38,940
would be a confound or, what is called, a
bias, as it happens in the

160
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
experiment.

161
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,630
Likewise, experimenters or research assistants
who actually collect the

162
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:50,090
data are typically blinded to the cause of
the experiment, so that we

163
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,540
minimize the chance of any allocation biases,
minimize the chance that they

164
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,650
aim to allocate participants to certain conditions
that they think

165
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:05,110
would push the results as they expected.

166
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,360
Triangulation refers to the use of multiple
methods with the view to

167
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,680
double check or triple check the results.

168
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,440
You could triangulate across many different
factors.

169
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,910
You could triangulate by changing the dependent
measures.

170
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,150
For instance, in some cases, participants
might choose between

171
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,680
options a and b.

172
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,681
In the second case, they may indicate the
strength of preference or they may

173
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,940
indicate their willingness to pay.

174
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,010
But across multiple experiments, the use of
different dependent measures

175
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,410
will strengthen the belief that the experimental
results all converge

176
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,090
towards the same conclusion.

177
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:48,160
Similarly, one could triangulate by changing
methods across experiments,

178
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,830
by using multiple sets of background variables
and finally, even by

179
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,480
changing the data analysis techniques across
different groups of

180
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,839
experiments.

181
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,839
Triangulating across multiple experiments
that all try and test the

182
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,700
same basic idea, the same basic cause and
effect relationship, will increase

183
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,300
the confidence in the conclusion that the
researcher comes up with.
