We've all heard the term "bias" before.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,830
What exactly is a bias?

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,840
A bias is any systematic deviation from a
response or a decision that you

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,000
would expect a rational decision-maker to
perform.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,820
Keep in mind that the deviation needs to be
systematic.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,550
It always has to be in one direction and not
random.

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,670
If the deviation is random, it is noise.

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,140
If is systematic, it is a bias.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,620
Think about a simple bias called overconfidence,
the idea that people

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,579
believe that they know more than they actually
do.

11
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:46,050
This is a bias, because people on an average
always believe that they know

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,520
more than they do.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,320
It's not that some people believe they know
more and others believe

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,500
that they know less.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,870
That would be noise.

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,430
The finding that most people believe to they
know more than

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,360
they do is a bias.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,879
Now, how do you correct for biases, and what
the different ways in which

19
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,480
we can think about those corrections?

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,750
There are two words that you hear me throwing
around--

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,220
de-biasing and re-biasing.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,630
Both de-biasing and re-biasing talk about
the idea of making a bias go

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,000
away, but they do so in different ways.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,080
And the best way to illustrate the difference
between the two is to use a

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
simple metaphor.

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,330
Here's a picture of a door of my office, and
the door has a door

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,970
stopper on the top, which is supposed to keep
the door shut every time

28
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,970
somebody opens it.

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,180
It's got a simple spring mechanism.

30
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,890
Every time you push it open, the spring contracts,
and

31
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,979
the door stays shut.

32
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,180
What you see in this picture is the fact that
my door is

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,320
unfortunately open.

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,950
There's some error in the spring, there is
some mistake in the spring

35
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,149
due to which the door does not come to close
in the fully closed

36
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:52,399
position, as it should.

37
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,770
How do I fix that problem?

38
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,920
There are two things I could do.

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,420
The first thing I could do is I could actually
go in, remove the mechanism

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,110
from the top, clean it up, replace the spring,
and make sure that the door

41
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,130
now closes.

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,979
That is a de-biasing mechanism.

43
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,930
What I've done is I've identified the cause
of the bias, and I have fixed

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,580
the cause so that the bias no longer happens.

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,230
Again, keep in mind the bias here is the fact
that the door that is

46
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,660
supposed to be in a closed position stays
open.

47
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,640
Here's a second way in which I could keep
the door shut, which is, I can

48
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,640
introduce a locking mechanism or a force that
physically

49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,990
pushes the door shut.

50
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,800
What I have done here--
the bias still stays because there is still

51
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,530
an error in the spring.

52
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,690
But I have imposed a second mechanism on top
of the first one to cancel out

53
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,220
the effects of the first one.

54
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,220
That's called a re-biasing.

55
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,510
So again, a de-bias is a situation where you
identify the cause of the

56
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,310
bias, you fix it, and the bias goes away.

57
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,000
A re-bias is a situation where you have a
bias, you impose a second bias

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,720
that acts in the opposite direction, and now
the door stays shut, people

59
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,750
behave as if they were not biased.

60
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,340
Let's look at some simple examples--
overconfidence.

61
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,050
How do we make sure that people are not overconfident?

62
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,730
It turns out that there are two common strategies
for reducing

63
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,150
overconfidence.

64
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,310
One strategy is simply getting people to write
down two or three reasons why

65
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,220
they think that they would be wrong with whatever
judgement or prediction

66
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,910
that they have made.

67
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,850
Simply getting people to think about the what
if scenario reduces

68
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,410
overconfidence.

69
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,970
Why?

70
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,620
Because the mechanism for overconfidence is
the fact that people

71
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,400
only look at information or reasons that support
their judgment, not for

72
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,450
reasons that oppose it.

73
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,229
By physically instructing them to come up
with the reasons that oppose a

74
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,880
judgment, you de-bias that particular judgment.

75
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,440
Now, let's look at a second example, a self-control
failure, the fact that

76
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,580
people want to save more for the future, but
don't.

77
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,799
We talked about a simple program earlier called
Save More Tomorrow, the

78
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,090
idea that you commit to saving more in the
future by promising to set aside

79
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,870
portions of your next salary increase.

80
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,600
Here's the interesting part.

81
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,940
That program works.

82
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,340
It turns out people who participate in the
Smart Save More Tomorrow program

83
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,260
actually save more, but they would become
any better at self-control.

84
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,830
What you've done is you've used the principles
of loss aversion and the

85
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,510
fact that they simply forget that they're
in the program to fool

86
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,630
themselves into saving more.

87
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,220
And so that's a classic example a re-bias.

88
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,730
You've got a bias, a self-control failure.

89
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,711
You pick two other biases, the fact that people
forget, the fact that they

90
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:46,880
have loss aversion, to cancel out the effects
of the first bias.

91
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,680
And that's a classic example of a re-biasing
strategy.

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,020
In many ways, a lot of the choice architecture
that we're going to talk

93
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,340
about is a re-biasing approach, because what
we're going to do is

94
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,270
we're going to try to design environments
where the fundamental

95
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,950
flaw in decision-making doesn't matter, because
something

96
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,040
else cancels it out.

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,630
But before we do that, let's spend a few minutes
talking about the

98
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,710
different kinds of de-biasing strategy.

99
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,470
There are three kinds, and we'll actually
get into a lot of detail in

100
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,410
these kinds in the next week.

101
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,560
The first one is a motivational strategy.

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,850
The idea is simple.

103
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,880
If you motivate people to come up with the
right answer, they will.

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,680
How do we motivate people?

105
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,690
You could give them financial incentives.

106
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,000
You could give them economic incentives.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,210
Or you could respond to their sense of being
socially correct--

108
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,310
put peer pressure, have them make public commitments.

109
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,010
Once there is some external stimulus that
gets people to be more motivated

110
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,020
to be accurate, they are more likely to process
information more

111
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,980
effortfully and to draw more information into
their decision.

112
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,970
The second set of strategies that we've used
to reduce biases are

113
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,590
cognitive strategies, getting people to think
differently or training

114
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,580
people or generating templates that they could
use which provide them with

115
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,280
the right kind of data, or forcing them to
think through model-based

116
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,090
approaches for making decisions.

117
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,440
And finally, technological strategies include
the use of decision supports

118
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,260
or aids or online databases to inform people
with the right data to make the

119
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
best choices.

120
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,390
So in sum, we talked about two different kinds
of approaches for

121
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,810
getting rid of biases.

122
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,520
There is de-biasing, and then there is re-biasing.

123
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,020
They're both accomplished the same, but theoretically,
they are very different.
