It's always fun to enjoy a good glass of wine.

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,710
While I'm working on my wine, I have a simple
question for you.

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,410
What is common to wine, quilts, and classical
music?

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,170
Obviously, on the surface, it seems like these
are three completely

5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,880
unrelated categories.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,720
But there is something common.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,550
And the answer is as follows.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,850
If you ask the majority of people who consume
one of these three things as

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,410
to what they like, they probably will be able
to tell you what.

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,350
Most people can tell you that they like a
given wine versus the other

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,440
one, that they like a given piece of music,
that they love the

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,730
pattern on a quilt.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,040
But if you ask them why they like what they
like, most people do not have a

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
good answer.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,280
Now there are two reasons for why that happens.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,460
The first reason is simply that a lot of people
don't know why they like

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,000
what they like.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,150
A lot of these categories involve sensory
inputs.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,280
They involve the processing of sensory information.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,230
And in many of those situations, a lot of
things combine to produce liking.

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,950
For example, with this glass of wine, there's
obviously the taste of the

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,570
wine, the smell, the fact that it feels good
in my hands, the fact that

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,789
the experience is a good one.

24
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:37,220
Now let's think a little bit about these two
processes.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,399
If you ask me why I like this glass of wine,
I'm going to say because it

26
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:42,619
tastes good.

27
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,830
What I'm not going to be able to tell you
is that my preference for this

28
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,590
glass of wine is a function of the complexity,
the bouquet, the aroma,

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,200
the acidity, the tannins, all of that lovely
stuff that you read about in

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,819
Wine Spectator magazines.

31
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,489
If I only knew what all of those things meant,
and if I were able to

32
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,289
identify each of those terms with a specific
feature of this glass of

33
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,110
wine, a few things could happen.

34
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,100
One, I would be able to describe my preferences
better to you.

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,840
Two, I might be able to learn more about my
own preferences by trying

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,640
wines that are constant on every single dimension
except one.

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,690
Three, over time, I might start actually making
better choices.

38
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,650
This is the idea of Patricia West and her
colleagues called preference

39
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,200
vocabulary or consumption vocabulary.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Here's the idea.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,799
The idea is that in a lot of different domains,
people know what they like,

42
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:43,640
but they don't know why they like it.

43
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,650
And simply providing them with the language
to express their preferences

44
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,269
helps them not only express them, but also
to develop

45
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,960
those preferences further.

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,890
Let's look at the example of quilts.

47
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,800
You can actually decompose the liking for
a quilt along a number of

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,819
different dimensions.

49
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:03,980
And I'm not making these up.

50
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,540
These are actually real pieces of data from
expert quilters.

51
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,140
You can look at the border patterns or the
sashing or the blocks or the

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,330
alignment or the arrangement.

53
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,569
These are all the attributes of quilts that
you and I would probably not

54
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:21,120
think about, but the expert knows that they
exist.

55
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,020
Now let's imagine a simple experiment.

56
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,879
Suppose you had five or 10 such attributes
and you created a large

57
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:31,360
number of quilts by looking at different combinations
of these

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
attributes.

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,499
Let's imagine you came up with 150 different
patterns of quilts.

60
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:40,750
Now you did an experiment which looks a lot
like a randomized controlled

61
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:47,090
trial, but within experimenter or within participant
sense.

62
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,879
So you picked a participant.

63
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,010
And you asked that participant to evaluate
each of those 150 quilts on

64
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,400
the liking scale.

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,260
Now what you have is the participant's liking
for each of these quilts, which

66
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,129
you have from the expert is the evaluation
of each of those quilts on

67
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:06,769
those different attributes.

68
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,970
All you do now is to pull out your favorite
tool,

69
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,430
the regression analysis.

70
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,859
And if you did that, you could actually come
up with a regression for

71
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:21,600
this particular individual where you can model
liking as a function of a

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,360
plus b 1 times border plus b 2 times sashing,
and so on and so forth.

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,030
What you've just done is you have allowed
this individual to figure out

74
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,550
why they like certain quilts and why they
don't.

75
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,500
This individual might discover, for example,
that the b-weight the

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,669
coefficient that they place on sashing, is
high.

77
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:45,510
And so, in fact, they really care about that
attribute.

78
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,530
If you could actually start decomposing the
preferences for fine

79
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,200
wine or classical music or quilts or objects
of art along these dimensions,

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,720
we can now start achieving some of the ideas
that we spoke about at the

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,460
beginning of this module.

82
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,470
Pat West and her colleagues did a lot of research
where they showed that by

83
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,810
actually giving people a consumption vocabulary,
they could end up

84
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,400
producing the three effects we talked about.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,229
First, people in her experiments were taught
how to appreciate a quilt by

86
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,930
being given the right vocabulary.

87
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,960
Folks that had received the vocabulary were
much better at expressing their

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
preferences.

89
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,450
They could actually say, I like that pattern
over this one because.

90
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,919
Second, people that had received a vocabulary
could

91
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,250
learn preferences better.

92
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,039
They were able to come up with their own experiments.

93
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,440
They were able to say, gee, it looks like
these two attributes are

94
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,840
important, but let me try and see what the
effect of the third attribute is.

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,960
And they learned their preferences better
along each attribute.

96
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,509
And finally, what Pat West found was that
over time, people that had

97
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,979
received information on the consumption vocabulary
actually made

98
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,490
better choices.

99
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,490
Their preferences were much more stable.

100
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,060
Because they now had a hook on which to anchor
the utility on, they were

101
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,110
able to come up with much more fine-tuned
preferences for those quilts.

102
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:17,250
We talked about the difference between an
analytical process and an intuitive

103
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,140
or a gut-feel process in making judgments.

104
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,229
By providing people with the consumption vocabulary,
what you can

105
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,050
actually do is to take a process that is largely
intuitive and convert that

106
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,659
into an analytical process because you now
give people to the right

107
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:38,190
terminology, and therefore the right meter,
on which they can assess their

108
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,150
own utility for this lovely glass of wine.

109
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,650
Cheers.
