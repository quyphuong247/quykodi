00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:10,240
https://youtu.be/EGujospTlmE
Every time I come to the end of any course,
I'm always reminded

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,530
of a fictional character called Father Guido
Sarducci.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,070
I don't know if you've ever seen Father Guido
Sarducci.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,590
He is, as I said, a fictional character.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,710
He's an invention of a comedian, and he used
to be on an American TV show

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,919
called Saturday Night Live a fair bit.

7
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:31,119
And one of his most interesting videos--
and you can find it online by simply doing

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,360
a search--
is a video called the Five Minute University,

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,379
where he
makes a simple claim.

10
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:40,579
He says that most college students in five
years tend to remember only five

11
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:44,420
minutes of any particular course that they
took.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,480
And so he said if he were to set up his own
university, he would only

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,710
teach five minutes worth because that's all
they remember anyways.

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,859
So towards the end of every class, I feel
compelled to do a five-minute

15
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,430
version of my course.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,729
Now, I hope most of you are here not just
for the five-minute version but

17
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,690
for a much more bigger objective, which is
to think about behavioral

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,760
economics differently.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,479
But let me quickly remind you what you've
done and then push through a

20
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,030
talk about some key messages that I have it
in the next steps, both for

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,240
the course as well as for using behavior economics
effectively in your

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,450
careers and your lives.

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,500
This picture is something we looked at in
week one, the

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,620
structure of the class.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,159
If you remember, we said there were three
things we were going to do.

26
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,180
We'd study the principles of behavioral economics,
we'd study the

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,520
methods, and we would study applications.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,770
We looked at a whole host of principles.

29
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,650
We looked at experimental methods.

30
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,770
We looked at methods of decomposing preferences
through regression.

31
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,291
And then finally, we looked at two kinds of
applications, first, choice

32
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,759
architecture and nudging, and second, designing
decision support systems or

33
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,210
tools to improve decision making.

34
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,590
Now, where does all of this leave us?

35
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,970
In the short run, I want to focus a minute
on those of you who are going

36
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,070
to take this course for a certificate.

37
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,331
The next thing you need to do is to work on
the nudge challenge, and we

38
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,829
talked about that.

39
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,579
Apply all the tools we've learned.

40
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:11,090
Apply the thinking principles to come up with
an interesting, creative

41
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,900
solution for one of the two nudge challenges
that we spoke about and

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,640
that you'll see a lot more of on your EdX
web pages.

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,800
But going forward beyond the nudge challenge,
what's next?

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,811
I want to talk about seven key ideas or seven
final thoughts that I want to

45
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:32,060
share with you before I say goodbye to this
particular EdX cohort.

46
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,540
Thought number one--
in behavioral economics, everything matters.

47
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,519
Remember when we went to the lab, we heard
this interesting point that

48
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,270
Julie made, which was that every part of the
context in which a decision is

49
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,030
made in the lab is an opportunity for a researcher
to create a manipulation

50
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,040
and to influence choice.

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,489
Choices depend on not just option A and option
B which is presented to the

52
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,600
decision maker, but to the color of the table
around them, the color of

53
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,430
the walls, the height of the ceiling, the
ambient temperature.

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,180
You can draw a list of as many things as you
can think of that might

55
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,390
potentially influence choice.

56
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,390
What does that mean?

57
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,660
That means that developing a theory of decision
making is complex.

58
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,769
It is important to be nimble in terms of our
empirical approach.

59
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,230
It is important for us to be able to go to
the lab, go to the field,

60
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,689
document phenomena that are interesting, and
then use those

61
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,840
phenomena in designing better choice context.

62
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
But everything matters.

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,500
So when you audit the decision-making process,
rid yourself of the illusion

64
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,790
that there are certain things that are relevant
and other

65
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,810
things that are not.

66
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,030
Anything could potentially influence the outcome
and make sure you think

67
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,909
about every single thing.

68
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:49,980
Second, question the way in which things are
traditionally done.

69
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,230
A classic example is defaults.

70
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,140
We've talked about the power of changing
defaults on changing decisions.

71
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,280
Nobody stops and thinks about where defaults
actually come from.

72
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,330
Defaults are traditionally created because
somebody--

73
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,730
50, 20, 100 years ago--
thought that that was the right way to make

74
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,030
a decision.

75
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,840
Every decision has a default, but very little
thought goes into

76
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,450
designing the default.

77
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,489
And so rather than accepting a given away
of asking a question or accepting

78
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:23,170
a given process that an individual would need
to make a decision,

79
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,820
challenge it and see if there's a better way
of doing it.

80
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,009
Advice number 3--
keep your tools sharp.

81
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,009
What does that mean?

82
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,850
It essentially means that the field of behavioral
economics is perhaps the

83
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,000
most dynamic field ever.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,550
We started off in 1970, 1980, 1990 designing
basic ideas of rational

85
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,550
decision making.

86
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,460
And we've spent the last 20, 30 years figuring
out that that rational model

87
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,919
is imperfect.

88
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,120
But every single day, we learn something new
about decision making.

89
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,270
Make sure you're on top of the literature
by reading.

90
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,270
And you can read a lot.

91
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,000
You can read popular journals.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,530
You can read blogs.

93
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,860
Or you can continue taking classes like this
one to stay on top of

94
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,650
exactly what's new and what's interesting
in the world

95
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,000
of behavioral economics.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,949
Advice number 4--
in your organization, in your work, whether

97
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:19,660
you're a policy maker or a
business, it is important to develop a culture

98
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
of data.

99
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,150
We've seen before, time and again, that unless
policy or decisions are

100
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,170
informed by data, there is very little to
stand alone.

101
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,780
Theoretically, you could make arguments for
as long as you want

102
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,220
about whether option A or option B is the
right option to make.

103
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,610
Let the data tell you and work with experiments
to try and make your

104
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,010
decisions more behaviorally informed.

105
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,740
Advice number 5--
document successes and failures equally importantly

106
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,460
and share them as
widely as you can.

107
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,910
Our field will only develop when we have access
to a rich worldwide

108
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,330
database of ideas, of results, and of experiments.

109
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,860
By leveraging and standing on the shoulders
of others, we will be able

110
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,139
to make progress and make our own nudging
strategies a lot more effective.

111
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,509
So in the interest of the field as a whole,
see if you can disseminate your

112
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,240
learnings as best as you can.

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,830
If interventions succeeded, that's fantastic.

114
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,319
But even if they failed and your nudging strategies
didn't work, share

115
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,860
them so others won't waste time doing exactly
what it was that did not work.

116
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,800
Likewise, if you find something that didn't
work for somebody else but

117
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,370
worked for you, that's also an interesting
report to file.

118
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,380
Because now it suggests that that strategy
might be the victim of an

119
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,819
interaction effect, where it works in some
conditions but not in others.

120
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,530
Advice number 6--
the fact that human beings are irrational,

121
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,570
the fact that any actors
are irrational, be they governments or agencies

122
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,470
or groups, is
now not news anymore.

123
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,919
We need to move on beyond that.

124
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,440
We know that people are irrational.

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,289
It's time to focus on so what?

126
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:06,610
In this course, we talked about two "so whats"--
choice architecture and tools.

127
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,220
But as time goes on, there will be others,
so watch that emerge.

128
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,770
And I would encourage you to focus on the
"so what" part of the discussion

129
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,830
and not so much on the fact that people are
irrational.

130
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,099
And finally, number 7--
spread these ideas.

131
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,540
While all of you are believers, and we've
all drunk Kool-Aid together, and

132
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,520
we all understand that behavioral economics
is here to stay, there are a

133
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,190
lot of people who still are not exposed to
the field.

134
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,110
So next time you're at a cocktail party, or
you're having chai with your

135
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,650
family, or you're simply out with friends,
talk about the ideas that

136
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,470
you've picked here and elsewhere and spread
the flame

137
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,790
of behavioral economics.

138
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,991
Because by spreading the flame and shedding
the culture, we will make

139
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:50,879
this field stronger and more impactful over
time.

140
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,879
Thank you.
