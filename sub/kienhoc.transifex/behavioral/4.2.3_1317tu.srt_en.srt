In many situations in life, we need to make
predictions or

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,490
judgments about things that are going to happen
in the future or things that

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,930
we can never observe.

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,840
Think about investing in the stock market,
for example.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,590
Let's imagine you have two mutual funds to
choose from.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,930
You need to decide which one to choose from
on the basis of your prediction

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,480
of the prices that those funds are going to
yield in the next few years.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,600
Or let's say you're hiring a new employee.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,820
You need to make a judgment about the quality
of the performance that this

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,160
person is going to give you over the next
three years on the basis of

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,050
evidence that you can see in front of you
now.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,110
But unless that performance actually happens,
all you are left with is

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,579
simply your judgment.

14
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,219
Or think about whether or not to give a loan
to somebody that

15
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,760
applies to your bank.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,890
Again, you want to assess the loan worthiness.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,960
But there's really no way that you know exactly
what that variable is

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,079
going to be.

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,239
In all these cases, there is some truth, But
all you can observe are

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,030
pieces of evidence that you believe will predict
that truth.

21
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,850
Let's look at this model, for example.

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,840
This is what is called the lens model, and
it comes to us from a part of

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,940
psychology known as social judgment theory.

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,899
The social judgment theory says something
very simple.

25
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,690
It actually says that when we try and make
judgments about the truth, and

26
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,540
again, the truth is something that we don't
observe or that will take time

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,920
to happen, we rely on what are called cues,
which are pieces of information

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,420
in the environment that we believe will predict
the truth.

29
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,340
Based on those cues, we somehow combine them
to form a judgment.

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,530
That combination could be based on intuition,
as we talked about, where

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,251
we somehow have some pattern in our head which
says, if I see cue one, cue

32
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:55,810
two, and cue three, here's what's going to
happen.

33
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:03,140
Or you could have a systematic model to combine
information from those cues.

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,700
Once you have a set of cues, all you then
need to do is to look at these

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,210
cues and form a judgment about the truth.

36
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,090
Let's think about an example of a situation
where you have a recruiter

37
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,569
who's going to try and make judgments about
the performance of a given

38
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,450
employee over the next three years.

39
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,110
If you, in fact, had true data on the performance
and you measured the

40
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,159
correlation between the judgment that the
recruiter made today and the

41
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,069
actual performance, that correlation is a
measure of what we call the

42
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,989
performance of the judge.

43
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,819
The higher the correlation, the better the
judge can actually predict what's

44
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,030
going to happen in the future.

45
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,739
So let's look at this judge.

46
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,580
Let's see what sort of cues might be relevant
in a situation like this one.

47
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,290
If you're the recruiter, let's imagine that
you've done a lot of research to

48
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,170
show that there are three cues that you believe
predict the performance of

49
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,329
the employee.

50
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:01,239
The IQ score of the applicant is important.

51
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,690
The second thing that's important is the kind
of experience that they've

52
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,249
had in the past, or work experience, both
in terms of quality and quantity.

53
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:12,700
And finally, their performance as a student,
their educational

54
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,260
qualifications.

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,060
Let's also imagine that you had a scale on
which you could measure each

56
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,409
of these three items.

57
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:23,239
For a moment, let's focus on a situation where
we don't

58
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,019
yet know the truth.

59
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:30,239
But all you know is that as a recruiter you
look at 100, 150, 200

60
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,719
such applications during the course of recruiting
season.

61
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,349
For every application, you have data on these
three cues, and

62
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,739
you form some judgment.

63
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,260
Suppose we focused on the right-hand side
of this model for a minute.

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,310
Let's imagine that you could run a regression
where you looked at your

65
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,760
judgment, the recruiter's judgment, as a function
of the three cues across

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,579
these 200 data samples.

67
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:56,620
It's like an experiment.

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,290
It's an experiment where you are essentially
replicating yourself

69
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,939
multiple situations where the cues are different,
and

70
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,050
you're forming a judgment.

71
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,700
What does that regression equation tell you?

72
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,609
This is what the equation might look like.

73
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:15,920
It might actually say that judgment is some
a, a constant, plus some b1

74
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,049
multiplied by the IQ score plus b2 multiplied
by experience, plus b3

75
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:23,430
multiplied by education.

76
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,470
What is this?

77
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,710
This is a model of your judgment.

78
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,060
If, in fact, tomorrow you are not at work,
I could use this model to

79
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,310
predict what you would have judged about this
particular applicant.

80
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,449
Now what is the value of doing something like
this?

81
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,479
What does it do for me?

82
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,810
There was a number of studies done in the
'70s and '80s that looked at the

83
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,270
idea of using a model of the judge to see
if, in fact, it did better than or

84
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,990
worse than the judge themselves.

85
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,280
And here's what the research found.

86
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,490
If you did a correlation between the model's
prediction of what you would

87
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,211
have predicted and the truth, assuming, of
course, now you had the

88
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:08,810
truth, it turns out that that correlation
is better than, in many

89
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,190
cases, the correlation between the judge's
prediction and the truth.

90
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,780
That simply means that the model is a better
predictor of the final outcome

91
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,780
than the judge is.

92
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,080
Now that's an interesting finding.

93
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,990
And it essentially is intuitive because of
the fact that models are

94
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,280
great at consistently applying the same rule
again and again and again.

95
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,620
The judge is fantastic, because the judge
tells us what cues are relevant.

96
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,919
The recruiter knows what data to look at.

97
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,560
But they sometimes get tired and fatigued,
and they might not

98
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,220
consistently apply that same rule again and
again.

99
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,270
The model does that for them, so it minimizes
errors.

100
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,430
If that's the case, what implications does
that have for us?

101
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,259
Here's some data from a paper by Robert Dawes
back in 1979 where he

102
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:01,789
looked at studies that were done by a number
of people where experts were

103
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:04,759
asked to make some predictions, some judgements.

104
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,230
They ran a model of that expert.

105
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,250
And then, finally, they compared the r squared,
the correlation of the

106
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,229
model's prediction, with the truth as well
as the manager's or the expert's

107
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,050
prediction with the truth.

108
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,419
And here's what they found.

109
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,720
In one study where experts were asked to predict
the GPA, the Grade Point

110
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,870
Average, of a number of students in Illinois,
the correlation between the

111
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,630
experts' prediction and the truth was 0.33.

112
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,340
The correlation between the model of the expert
and the truth was 0.5.

113
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,800
In other words, the model of the expert did
a better job than the

114
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,229
expert in predicting the truth.

115
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:45,990
Likewise, a number of doctors were asked to
make predictions about a

116
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,940
patient who had a given set of symptoms.

117
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,250
Was this patient neurotic or psychotic?

118
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,819
And it turns out that the experts' correlation
was 0.28, the model of the

119
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:56,670
expert, 0.31.

120
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,699
Likewise, faculty ratings at a university
in Oregon, the experts'

121
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,550
correlation was 0.19.

122
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,289
The model's correlation was 0.25.

123
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:12,930
This process of taking a regression model
to capture your own intuition is

124
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,240
called judgment bootstrapping.

125
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,520
Essentially, what it is is that you're using
your intuition, but you're

126
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,160
letting an equation capture it.

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,539
And by using that equation, you can be more
accurate and more predictive

128
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,439
about your own prediction.

129
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,360
And that's the basis of judgment bootstrapping.

130
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,289
So in essence, intuition can be modelled.

131
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,240
Intuition can be decomposed by simply looking
at situations where you have a

132
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,400
decision or a judgment that you make repetitive
times.

133
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,039
Keep track of the judgment.

134
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,750
Keep track of the cues.

135
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,340
And the resulting regression equation will
give you a model that explains

136
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,090
how you make decisions and judgments.
