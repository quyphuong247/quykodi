In this segment, we'll study 
the use of large-scale field

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,160
trials by looking at a specific example of
research done by Marianne

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,950
Bertrand and her colleagues in which the central
question that they tried

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,760
to answer was, what is the value of advertising
content?

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,400
Now, before we look at the actual experiment
itself, let's think a

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,130
little bit about large scale field trials
more generally.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,470
Unlike some the experiments we did earlier,
some field trials, which are

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,269
also called Randomized Controlled Trials,
or RCTs, use a really large

9
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,940
number of factors, each with multiple levels.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,960
This results in a very large number of conditions
that need to analyzed.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,079
And so rather than using ANOVA, regression
analysis turns out to be

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,819
the easiest method of data analysis.

13
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:55,249
Let's now turn to the specific example of
the project by Marianne Bertrand

14
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:56,909
and her colleagues.

15
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,899
The goal of this paper is to test the effectiveness
of advertising content

16
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,030
on the take-up of a loan offer in a field
experiment and to estimate

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,700
demand sensitivity to advertising content,
compare it with price

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,150
elasticity and the demand sensitivity to deadlines.

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,780
Now, in essence, what these authors we're
trying to do is they were trying

20
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,840
to send out solicitations for a loan product
in which they manipulated both

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,229
the features of the loan as well as advertising
content.

22
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,189
And they were trying to understand what the
effect of changing the

23
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:36,130
advertising content was on the take-up rates.

24
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,189
So this was a field experiment which was done
in the nature of what we call

25
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:42,960
a randomized controlled trial.

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,710
The advertisement varied on ten factors, both
advertising factors and

27
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,710
loan features.

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,109
Each factor had multiple levels, two or three.

29
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:58,470
For example, one factor that was used was
a photograph.

30
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,799
There were three levels.

31
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,240
In one set of conditions, there was no photo
on the solicitation.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,649
In a second set of conditions, was a female
photo.

33
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,890
And in the third, a male photo.

34
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,080
A second factor was the number of example
loans that was shown in the

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,720
solicitation.

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,510
Some solicitations had just one example.

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,959
Others had four.

38
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,510
Likewise, information about the interest rate
was either

39
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,459
shown or not shown.

40
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:33,360
Suggested loan uses were either not specified
or were specified.

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,990
There was either a comparison to an outside
rate or no comparison, and so

42
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,990
on and so forth.

43
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:47,150
So in total there were 10 factors, each of
which had two or three levels.

44
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,379
So you can see very quickly that the total
number of conditions was

45
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,940
extremely large.

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,819
Participants in this study were 53,194 former
clients of the consumer lender

47
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:05,569
in South Africa who received a direct mail
solicitation from the vendor.

48
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,560
And of course, that solicitation, as we said,
varied as a function of these

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,880
factors and the levels.

50
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,730
The authors use a probit type of regression
to look at the effect of

51
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,960
each of these factors on the take-up, or the
likelihood that the loan was

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,849
actually accepted by the recipient.

53
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,560
The results are shown here.

54
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,260
And in fact, this table is a subset of the
complete table that's

55
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,920
available in the paper.

56
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,980
And it shows only statistically significant
effects, as you can see,

57
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,099
the ones with stars.

58
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:48,469
Let's look for a moment on the full probit,
which is the result for the

59
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:51,230
entire sample put together.

60
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,879
We found that four variables were significant.

61
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,020
The first one was the interest rate, the actual
interest rate.

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,340
And the coefficient for the interest rate
was negative and significant.

63
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,730
It was negative because as the interest rate
went up, the likelihood

64
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,549
of accepting the loan went down.

65
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,489
This is perfectly consistent with economic
theory, with the rational

66
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,630
decision-making that as you pay more for the
loan, you are less

67
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,580
likely to want it.

68
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:26,600
The second thing that was significant and
surprising from the standpoint of

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,810
pure economic theory was the presence of a
female photo.

70
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,400
Simply putting a female photo increased the
likelihood that the loan

71
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,390
was taken up.

72
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:44,930
Likewise, providing only one example of a
loan increased the likelihood

73
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,640
that the loan was taken up.

74
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:53,250
And finally, mentioning no specific uses of
the loan also increased the

75
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,720
likelihood that the loan was taken up.

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
So while the first of these factors is what
one would call a rational reason

77
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,001
for influencing the take-up rate, the other
three factors were simply

78
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:10,250
factors that were part of advertising content
that also had significant

79
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,280
effects on the take-up rates.

80
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,010
Notice that all the factors are an effect
on the male respondents,

81
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:27,940
whereas only the interest rate had an effect
on the female respondents.

82
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,070
So what was the conclusion?

83
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,430
Across the eight advertising features that
were tested, three variations

84
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,600
that we just saw here have a substantial impact
on applications for

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
the loan offer.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,931
Including a photo of an attractive woman,
showing one loan example, and

87
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:47,030
not mentioning the specific use of the loan
increased the probability of

88
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,010
applying for that loan before the deadline.
