One of the key drivers of successful mental
accounting is the

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,789
extent to which the cost and the benefit in
a mental account are

3
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,109
coupled, or associated with each other.

4
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,039
If, in fact, that association becomes weak,
then they become decoupled, and

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,089
it becomes harder to mentally account for
that particular expense.

6
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:26,189
Let's look at a simple example.

7
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,190
Let's imagine that you love skiing, and you
go to the mountains of

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,780
Colorado, and you buy a four day ski pass.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,260
It's going to cost you $160, but the ski pass
comes in one of

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,460
two different varieties.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,949
In the picture in the top, you get one card
that you carry with you with your

12
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:44,629
jacket all the time that gives you access
to the

13
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,690
mountains on all four days.

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,980
In the second case, in the bottom, you see
four separate tickets that are

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,629
attached to each, and every day you detach
one, and give it at the gate.

16
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:58,160
Now, here's a simple experiment.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,239
Suppose you ski.

18
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,879
You have three beautiful days of skiing, and
on the last day

19
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,829
there is warm rain.

20
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,600
Everybody tells you it's no fun skiing, but
would you

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,720
actually go and ski.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,101
In other words, would the Sunk Cost Effect
of having paid $40 a day make

23
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:17,250
you go to the mountain and ski even in conditions
when you shouldn't?

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,820
Here's an interesting story.

25
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,120
When you look at the tickets at the bottom
left, there is an explicit

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,030
coupling between each day's worth of skiing
and the expense, which is $40.

27
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,110
As a result, that $40 that you've prepaid
is much more likely to burn

28
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,850
the hole in your pocket in the lower case,
than if, in fact, you had a

29
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,600
single card, because in the card you can amortize--
or allocate--

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,640
the three equal days of skiing across the
$160 that you have spent.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,560
What we would expect is, in fact, people are
much more likely to go

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,720
skiing on a bad day in the condition at the
bottom as opposed to the top.

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,950
And in fact, that's exactly what we found.

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,630
We found in an experiment that was run back
in 1998 that people are much more

35
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,660
likely to ski and fall prey to the Sunk Cost
Effect when they have

36
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,979
separate tickets each day than if, in fact,
they have just one ticket.

37
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,390
Here's a second way in which the coupling
between the expense and the

38
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,610
benefit could diminish--
and that's time.

39
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,410
Think about the following scenario.

40
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,160
Let's imagine that you decide to buy a subscription
to a health club.

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,170
And the health club asks you to pay in one
of four fashions--

42
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,470
once a year, quarterly, semiannually, or monthly.

43
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,090
It turns out that John Gourville at Harvard
and I collected data from a

44
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,710
health club back in 1999.

45
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,670
We were able to document the payment mechanism
that was used, the frequency

46
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,760
of payment, as well as the frequency of exercising
as a function of how

47
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,780
often people paid.

48
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,990
And here's what we found.

49
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,180
On the top left were people who had paid once
a year.

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,590
And what you see is, at the beginning, right
after they paid, they were very

51
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,740
likely to want to exercise.

52
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,470
They were in every single day.

53
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,060
They were trying all the machines.

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,380
The high bar, or the high level on the y-axis
shows that the frequency of

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,090
exercising was extremely high as soon as they
paid.

56
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,470
But notice what happens as time passes.

57
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,700
As time passes, by the time it gets to March,
consumption declines.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,240
Other things become more important.

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,120
By the time it gets to June and July, they're
consuming at about one-third

60
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,720
of the extent to which they were consuming
in January.

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,041
And by the time it comes time to renew in
November and December, they're

62
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,950
hardly there at all.

63
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,540
Contrast that with the graph on the bottom
right.

64
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,630
Those are folks that exercise monthly at the
same rate

65
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,940
because they pay monthly.

66
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,890
And what's happened as a result here is that
the moment you make people pay

67
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,800
on an ongoing basis, they are much more likely
to couple the benefits

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,160
that they get in that given month with the
cost.

69
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,900
They are more likely to be stable at exercising.

70
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,880
So we find across a number of different domains
that the frequency

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,500
with which you pay has a dramatic impact on
how much

72
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,900
you actually consume.

73
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,930
What you'll see in the other two plots, the
quarterly and the semi

74
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,740
annually, again, is that the moment you pay
your frequency spikes up, and

75
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,410
at the end of it, it again starts to declining
over a period of time.

76
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,500
Here's a second example of what I want to
share with you in terms of mental

77
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
accounting.

78
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,770
And that's a phenomenon called pennies a day
advertising that was first made

79
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,169
popular by John Gourville.

80
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,279
Look at this ad for a moment.

81
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:31,999
It says if you can afford this, you can afford
that.

82
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:35,289
If you could read the fine print, it essentially
tells you that that sofa

83
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:39,509
set that's being advertised is going to cost
about $1,000 a month no matter

84
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:43,979
which way you actually think about it in terms
of temporal framing.

85
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,169
But if you compare it to the cost of a yogurt
per day, it suddenly starts

86
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,310
becoming more affordable.

87
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,639
That's called a pennies a day strategy, and
the idea is simple.

88
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,150
When we think about any expense--
be it rent, or taxes, or coffee--

89
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,610
we tend to have a natural time frame that
goes with that expense.

90
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,270
So I think about rent on a monthly basis,
I think about coffee on a daily

91
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,629
basis, and I think about taxes on an annual
basis.

92
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:13,520
And the moment you change the frame in which
that time is presented, it

93
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,300
creates an "ah ha" moment.

94
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,080
Sometimes the "ah ha" moment works for you,
like here.

95
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,889
You say, I'm spending a few dollars on coffee
or yogurt every day.

96
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,199
Why can't I afford the sofa set which is going
to cost me the same.

97
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,719
Sometimes the "ah ha" moment could work the
opposite way.

98
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:31,569
Think about this ad, for example.

99
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:36,249
This is an advertisement where the "ah ha"
moment was to take an annual

100
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:38,839
expense and convert that into a daily expense.

101
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,410
But the problem was that the daily expense
was so high that people

102
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,729
realized that there was nothing else that
they did that cost them

103
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,680
$19 or $20 a day.

104
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,409
This message backfired.

105
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:52,249
So the point is that when people think about
a pennies a day strategy, there

106
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:54,749
are two elements of the strategy.

107
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:57,509
Element number one--
taking a lump sum expense, and expressing

108
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,430
that as a daily expense.

109
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,159
Element number two--
providing people with a comparison which is

110
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:07,909
a consumption that they occur
on an ongoing basis.

111
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,619
Comparison with a coffee is great--
we all drink coffee once a day.

112
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:15,570
But comparison with something which costs
$20, or $30, or $50 a day might

113
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,180
backfire because people realize that they're
actually going to spend a lot

114
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,780
of money doing that.

115
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,500
Here's a third way in which the coupling between
cost and expenses can

116
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,919
be weakened, and that is by making the metering
process a bit more difficult.

117
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,289
Let's think about the following.

118
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:40,190
I have in front of me three currencies--
10 euros, 80 Hong Kong dollars, and about

119
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,470
400 Thai bahts.

120
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,650
It turns out they're worth approximately the
same.

121
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,279
But depending on what my home currency is,
I tend to value the other two

122
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,430
currencies differently.

123
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,589
It's easy for me to account in my home currency,
but the moment you move

124
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,330
countries, or you go on a vacation, it becomes
difficult because now you have

125
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,990
lost your metering system.

126
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,021
And the moment you convert your home currency
to that foreign currency, it

127
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:11,330
becomes like free money, and that free money
is decoupled from the expense.

128
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,749
Think about the following simple situation.

129
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:16,889
You're on vacation, it's the last day, you've
got 400 Thai bahts sitting in

130
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,939
your pocket, and you're back at the airport
to go home.

131
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,710
What do you do with these?

132
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,580
Rational theory says, if you haven't found
any way to spend them, convert

133
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,330
them back into Hong Kong dollars or euros.

134
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,659
What do people really do?

135
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:35,099
They look for ways to spend the remaining
$400, because, after all, it

136
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,330
is play money at this point in time.

137
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,629
We, in fact, did an experiment in Hong Kong
where we took people, endowed

138
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:46,940
them with Hong Kong dollars, or a currency
that we call more numerous,

139
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,589
Thai bahts, or less numerous, the euro.

140
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,759
They were put into an experimental room.

141
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,259
They had to gamble money.

142
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,629
And we found this--
what we found was when people were endowed

143
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:02,930
with a more numerous currency,
they tended to be more generous with their

144
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,930
money.

145
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,009
When people were endowed with a less numerous
currency, they were much more

146
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,279
stingy with their money.

147
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,979
So in sum, what we've looked at here is the
fact that the coupling between

148
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:17,419
the expenses, and the cost, and the consumption
can you be weakened in a

149
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:18,749
number of different ways.

150
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,649
The first way is by making it difficult to
couple

151
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:22,969
through physical formats.

152
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,409
The second way is to allow for the passage
of time between when you pay

153
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:28,860
and when you consume.

154
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,830
And the third way is to weaken the metering
system whereby people no

155
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,639
longer have a good handle on how much they're
actually spending.
