Crutches to aid decision making are essentially
gadgets or

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,250
devices or engines that help people make better
choices.

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,529
We are going to talk about five different
kinds of crutches that

4
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:20,330
people make better decisions.

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,330
And here they are.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,242
Let me start off at the top.

7
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:28,210
The simplest crutch you can provide people
is data or feedback.

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,589
When you think about the behaviors we engage
in-- how much we save, how much

9
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,260
we consume, how much garbage we produce--
if you think about it, there is very little

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,230
feedback we get on a day by day
basis that tells us how much we consume.

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,070
Simple idea--
if you had a gadget or a device that simply

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,440
told people who paid by credit
cards how much they had spent up to that point

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,520
in time in a given month,
would spending reduce?

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,050
And the answer is yes.

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,260
Another simple experiment that we did at a
fairly small scale in the city of

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,550
Toronto was we actually gave people feedback
on the amount of garbage they

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,659
had produced in a given period of time.

18
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,970
And just getting that feedback made people
more aware of the fact that

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,619
they had trashed a whole lot of things.

20
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:16,460
And in fact, the rate of recycling in those
households went up.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,420
Second decision aid is advice.

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,090
If you are struggling with a decision, ask
someone else to help

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,890
you make that decision.

24
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,840
That somebody else could be an expert.

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,939
It could be a wealth adviser.

26
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,020
It could be a doctor.

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,140
It could be a health care practitioner.

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,140
Or it could just be a friend.

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,259
It could be somebody like you.

30
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:41,179
You could collect advice from an individual,
an expert, or a group.

31
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:43,979
And in particular, we've been hearing a lot
about things like the wisdom of

32
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,100
crowds, and we will talk a little bit more
about that as we

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,100
go through as well.

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,259
So the second piece of decision support that
one could give people is

35
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,310
just the input, the advice, the recommendation
of somebody else.

36
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,869
The third thing that we could do is to provide
cases or databases of other

37
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,539
similar situations in the past that might
help then predict what the

38
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:08,929
outcome is going to be.

39
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,120
Think of a simple example.

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,300
Let's say you're a loan officer.

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,200
A company applies to you for a loan.

42
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,470
Or you are an MBA admissions officer in a
business school, and you get an

43
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,159
application from a student to join your MBA
program.

44
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,660
One way in which you could decide what the
student is going to be like or

45
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,700
what this company's credit worthiness is going
to be is to say, well, gee,

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,230
let me see if I can find some other company
or some other student who

47
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,150
looked like this one five years back.

48
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,150
And let me actually see what's happened to
this other person or this

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,370
other company.

50
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,340
And so retrieving an instance that is similar
to the one at hand and using

51
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,040
the information from that instance to make
a judgment about the current

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,900
instance is an example of what we call a case-based
or a data-based decision

53
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,349
support system.

54
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,349
The fourth thing we could do is to offer a
structured model.

55
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,830
We've talked a lot about the fact that you
could think about the value or the

56
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,150
utility as the weightage of an attribute multiplied
by the level of

57
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,430
the attribute and then added across every
single attribute for the option.

58
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,469
If you actually had a simple online device
that knew your weighting system

59
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:23,459
for each of these attributes and could simply
accept values for that option

60
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,720
on each attribute, it could compute a utility
and tell you what the score

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,080
for a given individual, for a given company,
for a given

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,940
option is going to be.

63
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,959
So that would be an example of a simple model-based
decision support system.

64
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,930
Likewise, you could also use judgment bootstrapping
to create a model of

65
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,100
yourself that can be used to support your
decision.

66
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,940
And the fifth is something we've talked about
a fair bit a couple of

67
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,239
weeks back.

68
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,090
Giving people a consumption vocabulary allows
them to better develop a

69
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,340
framework to make a decision.

70
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,189
Objects of art, bottles of wine, fine quilts
and classical music are all

71
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,969
hard for people to evaluate because they don't
know the right attributes.

72
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:10,819
And so providing them with the vocabulary
to evaluate and give weight

73
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,069
to each of those attributes will actually
improve the quality of their

74
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,200
decision making.

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,030
So five simple ways in which we can provide
crutches to help people make

76
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,080
better choices.
