A decision support system simply refers to
the use of any

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,530
computer-based data delivery system that can
help people

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,240
make a better decision.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,111
We talked about two kinds of DSSs.

5
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:22,850
The first one is a model based decision support
system.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,480
The second one is a case based, or a data
based, decision support system.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,520
In this segment, I'm going to draw on some
research that was done by Steve

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,590
Hoch and David Schkade where they talked about
these two different kinds

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,760
of DSSs, and actually compared the two.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,760
But before we go to the comparison, let's
try and understand exactly what

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,370
those DSSs do.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,910
Let's think first about a model based decision
support system.

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,609
So if you think about the example we looked
at before.

14
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:55,130
You're a loan officer, somebody comes to you
with a loan application you now

15
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,120
have to make a judgment about the credit worthiness
of this given applicant.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,100
Let's imagine there are four criteria that
you're going to use, four

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,100
attributes.

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,920
Their debt ratio, the cash flow, the revenue
trend, and the location of

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,360
this company.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,410
And what you might actually end up with is
a model that looks like this,

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,040
where the credit rating is some a plus b1
times the debt ratio, plus b2 times

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,400
the cash flow, and so on.

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,640
You could actually get estimates for a and
b1 and b2 and b3 and b4 from a

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,320
number of different sources.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,110
One, you could have a bunch of managers or
experts who sit down

26
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,910
together to come up with their expert judgments
on what these a's and b's

27
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,280
should look like.

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,690
Alternately, you could keep track of previous
applications where you had

29
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,040
information on these attributes, or the cues,
as we call them, monitor the

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,150
success of these companies, and then use a
regression kind of analysis to

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:57,020
come up with thee true values of a and b1
and b2 and b2 that best describe

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,220
that success.

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,200
Finally, you could simply bootstrap your own
past judgments and use the

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,209
bootstrap, the regression, to tell you what
the a's and b's are going to be.

35
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,069
So now, if you had a computer system that
used this equation, all it's

36
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,950
going to ask you to do is it's going to ask
you to plug in the values of

37
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,680
the four attributes, and it would then give
you as output the

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,709
credit rating score.

39
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,030
And you can then make a decision based on
that, whether you would like to

40
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,450
give it a loan or not.

41
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,040
So that's a simple model based decision support
system.

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,820
Let's think about a case based DSS.

43
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,650
What happens in a case based DSS is you get
an application, you're going

44
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,959
to ask the system to find a previous instance
of an applicant that looks

45
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,730
similar to this particular application.

46
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,650
Here's what an interface for a case based
decision support

47
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,650
system might look like.

48
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,160
What you see on the top is a new applicant.

49
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,870
Let's say, company XYZ, that has a debt ratio
of 2.7, cash flow off 1.8,

50
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,000
revenue trend of 14, and is located in the
American Midwest.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,260
And you need to make a judgment about what
their credit

52
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,639
rating is going to be.

53
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,730
What you can ask the computer to do is to
identify a number of past cases

54
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,730
that you already now have information about
their credit rating.

55
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,319
What the computer is going to do is it's going
to follow a simple

56
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,720
algorithm which is called the minimization
of least squares, or

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,280
minimizing the Euclidean distance in the four
dimensional space between the

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,840
new applicant and its existing database of
cases.

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,760
And it might pull out, for example, these
three companies.

60
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,239
Jayrod, Lansco, Lobsen, and MS and Z.

61
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,390
So four companies it has pulled out
that, based on the criteria that the model

62
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,180
uses, are
similar to the new applicant.

63
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,939
You now have data on each of those four, and
you also know what the

64
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,939
credit rating is for those four, because you've
actually had an

65
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,530
experience dealing with those four companies.

66
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,329
What you could do next is to say, well, gee,
do I think that XYZ is most

67
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,530
like one of these four?

68
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,599
See what happened to those, and then make
a judgment about what you think

69
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,599
is going to happen to this one.

70
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,829
The psychological process that we follow to
make these kinds of

71
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:15,629
judgments is called anchoring and adjustment.

72
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:18,459
The DSS gives you a past case to anchor on.

73
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,250
So let's say you decided that XYZ is most
similar to MS and Z. MS and Z had

74
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,250
a score of 45.

75
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,720
You're going to anchor on the 45.

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
And you're going to make adjustments.

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,170
You're going to say, well, yeah, they had
45, but they

78
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,600
were on the East Coast.

79
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,120
This is a Midwestern company.

80
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,590
How does that change your prediction of the
score?

81
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,840
So that's a DSS based system.

82
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,340
Now in a series of experiments, Hoch and Schkade
actually compared these

83
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,630
two different kinds of systems.

84
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,820
They had managers come in and make judgments.

85
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,850
Managers were either given a case based decision
support system or a

86
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,080
model based system, or in some cases, both.

87
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,210
And here's what they found.

88
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,090
They found that when environments are stable,
nothing major is happening in

89
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,250
terms of changes, no new products being launched,
no income shocks,

90
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,150
nothing dramatic is happening, the model based
decision support systems

91
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,260
actually outperform the case based decision
support systems.

92
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,380
In other words, managers that use the model
based systems end up making more

93
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,890
accurate judgments or predictions than managers
that use

94
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,970
the case based systems.

95
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,070
Turns out, though, when the environment is
noisy, when in fact

96
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,720
there is, let's say, a recession or a new
product has been launched, or some

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,440
new regulation, where now the old model might
not be true anymore, the

98
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,070
case based system actually is a little bit
better than

99
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,350
the model based system.

100
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,930
But interestingly, no matter what the environment
is, having both

101
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,190
outperforms having just one of them.

102
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,940
And that's an interesting key lesson to take
away from their research.
