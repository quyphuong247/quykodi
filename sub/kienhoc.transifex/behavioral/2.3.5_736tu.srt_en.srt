In this segment, we will review the key ideas
from Self-control

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,330
and Choice Over Time.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,759
Future outcomes are valued differently from
present outcomes.

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,130
$1 is worth more today than it is in the future,
and hence people want more

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,779
in the future to compensate for not getting
one today.

6
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,880
This discounting can be measured by asking
questions such as, if I

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,929
promised you $100 today, how much would I
need to give you 365 days from

8
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,879
now to make you indifferent between the two
outcomes?

9
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,750
Or, if you were to get $1,000 in a year, how
much can I offer you today

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,620
to make you indifferent between the two outcomes?

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,390
In this chart, this is the future, and this
is now.

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,190
Let's say you were promised $1,000 in the
future.

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,039
How much do you need now to make you indifferent?

14
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,920
Let's say that 30 days prior to the outcome,
you would require $700 to be

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
indifferent.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,490
60 days prior, you would require $600, and
so on and so forth.

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,430
The line connecting these points is called
the discounting function.

18
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,160
In this particular discounting function, there
is steep discounting

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:29,930
close to the outcome, and gradual discounting
further away in time.

20
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,030
This is called a hyperbolic discounting function.

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,670
Hyperbolic functions help us understand reversals
in preferences as

22
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,410
a function of time.

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:46,240
In this chart, SS represents a smaller, sooner
outcome--

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,880
say, $10--
and LL, a larger, later one--

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,360
say, $12.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:01,100
When I am here, the discounted value of LL
is larger than the discounted

27
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,780
value of SS, so I pick LL.

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:15,030
But as one gets closer in time to SS, the
functions crossover here, and now

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:21,000
at this point SS starts looking larger than
LL, resulting in

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,650
an impulsive choice.

31
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:33,459
This area here is called the lapse zone--
a region where we fall prey to temptation.

32
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:37,050
Another way of looking at this analysis is
to make the claim that

33
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,680
there are almost two different kinds of entities
within us--

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,130
one who sees the world from here, and the
other one who sees it from here.

35
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:54,390
This first of these entities is the planner,
the rational, and the wise

36
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,769
part of us.

37
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,469
The second is the doer, the impulsive part
of us.

38
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,079
The doer ends up deviating from plans made
by the planner, creating the

39
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,939
intention-action gap that we talked about
earlier in this course.

40
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,930
However, a smart planner can trick the doer
by imposing some constraints on

41
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,540
their behavior.

42
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,830
These smart planners are called sophisticates--
people who have self-control problems, they

43
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:26,080
know they have self-control
problems, and they want to address those self-control

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,219
problems.

45
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:33,920
We could now model self-control as a battle
between the planner and the

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,189
doer, or a battle between will power and desire.

47
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:47,469
In this model, willpower wins in the region
above the dotted line, while

48
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:51,959
desire wins in the region below the dotted
line.

49
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,549
If you find yourself in this region where
you expect that desire will

50
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:02,029
dominate willpower, there are a number of
strategies to both reduce desire

51
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:05,180
and to increase willpower.

52
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,129
Avoiding the tempting stimulus is an easy
desire-reduction strategy, as is

53
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,579
the imposition of cooling off periods, a mandatory
period of time between

54
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,570
making a decision and actually making a purchase.

55
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,420
A third option is to substitute an impulsive
product with something else.

56
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,190
We've already talked about two powerful strategies
for increasing willpower.

57
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,040
The first, pre-commitment, especially one
that is backed by a public

58
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,590
declaration; and the second is the keeping
and monitoring of budgets.

59
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,340
In addition, evoking anticipated regret at
your choices is a third

60
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,350
powerful strategy.

61
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,940
And finally, decision points serve to both
reduce desire

62
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,220
and to increase willpower.

63
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,130
To conclude, here are three specific examples
of self-control strategies.

64
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,300
First, restrict the supply of resources, even
if it comes at a cost.

65
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,040
Smokers will keep only pack of cigarettes,
and students will

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,480
self-impose an early deadline on their assignments
just to impose constraints

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,150
on their own behavior.

68
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,950
Second, freezing credit cards in trays of
ice ensures that they're there for

69
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,440
an emergency, but it's simply not easy to
rip them out.

70
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,390
And finally, impose constraints on your own
behavior by prohibiting

71
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,340
further actions, like withdrawals, from your
savings accounts.

72
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,030
To the extent that you can put a lock on your
own behavior at the time that

73
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,580
you make an intention to do something good,
that lock will help to close the

74
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,910
gap between your intentions and actual actions.
