00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,080
https://youtu.be/kUjHrSh_UZ0
So what does this mean for various domains
of business, for

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,440
policy, for well-being?

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,940
There's a few implications that jump out.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,000
The first one that I want to touch upon is
from the world of

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,060
marketing or business.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,820
If you look at the failure rates of new products,
they're stunningly high.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,200
Depending on what survey you look at, it turns
out anywhere between 90% and

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,170
99% of new products that are launched are
not successful.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,329
Why does that happen?

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,130
That often happens because of a failure to
understand human decision

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,280
making at the last mile.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,940
We produce products that are technologically
superior.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,690
We produce products that offer cost savings,
but we don't think too much

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,829
about the consumer who's going to make the
final purchase.

15
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,230
We don't think too much about the way we display
those products, the way we

16
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,679
sell the products, and the way we message
the key

17
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,929
benefits from that product.

18
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,140
Think about policy.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,880
One famous instrument that policymakers use
is the notion of

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
disclosure.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,200
Disclosure simply says, give people information
and that will help them

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,080
make better decisions.

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,560
It turns out an understanding of behavioral
economics shows that that's

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,140
the furthest thing from the truth.

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,380
If you've ever looked at the back of your
credit card statement, if you've

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,409
ever bought a new medical prescription and
looked at all of the disclosures

27
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,130
that come with it, you will know what happens.

28
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,210
People look at the information, there's simply
too much of it, and

29
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,750
they put it aside.

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,860
And so in fact, what the world needs, is not
just a lot of information but a

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,840
lot of information that is presented appropriately
to

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,369
the appropriate audience.

33
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,469
And that's a theme we'll touch upon later
in this course.

34
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:47,000
The third point I want to touch upon is the
fact that we can use our

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,619
knowledge about behavioral economics to help
people help themselves.

36
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:52,869
What does that mean?

37
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:58,039
It means that we can close the gap between
actions and intentions by

38
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,150
designing environments where in fact, we can
push people towards making the

39
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,150
right choices.

40
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,909
As well, we can design tools and technologies
and products and gadgets

41
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:10,820
that would actually help people make better
choices.

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,210
And so those are the two elements that we're
going to

43
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,560
focus on in this course.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,830
A, how can I change the context to help people
make better choices?

45
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,250
B, how can I actually get them more information,
more insight, and more

46
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,630
analytics to help them make those better choices?

47
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,750
Now, before I end this segment, I want to
talk about the other big element in

48
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,340
this course, which is the notion of changing
the context

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,690
to influence choice.

50
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,670
Let's think about a very, very simple example.

51
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,890
Let's imagine that you are a policymaker or
a business person, and

52
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,580
you want to do something to influence consumers
choice.

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,220
You've got people that currently chose option
A, and you want to move them

54
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,831
towards option B. What are the different tools
you

55
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:56,870
have at your disposal?

56
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,500
One tool that is popular with policymakers
and governments is the

57
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,110
notion of restriction.

58
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,900
I simply ban A. If I'm a business, I can simply
withdraw

59
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,200
product A from the market.

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,510
And when I do this, I leave people with no
option but to choose product

61
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,320
B. That's a simple example.

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,200
It's a domain that you've seen a lot of discussion
and debate about in the

63
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,450
policy world.

64
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,200
How good are restrictions in influencing customer
behavior?

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,840
The challenge with the restrictions is that
they often create backlash.

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,450
You often hear arguments about who is the
government to decide

67
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,370
what is good for me?

68
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,290
The second option that you have at your disposal
is a carrot and stick

69
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,470
option, incentives.

70
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,870
What you can do is you can create positive
incentives, like a subsidy or

71
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,290
surplus or some kind of payment, for people
that move from point A to point

72
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,190
B. Or you could create a negative incentive
for people that choose to

73
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,680
stay at point A. You could tax them.

74
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,540
Again, if you were a business person, there
are different ways in which you

75
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,580
create those incentives.

76
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,430
You could offer discounts or promotions or
gifts and

77
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,940
so on and so forth.

78
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,820
Third option that you can use in pushing choice
from point A to point B

79
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
is advertising or knowledge.

80
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,770
Marketers do this all the time.

81
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,840
If you are at point A, I'm going to give you
enough information about why

82
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,259
you should be at point B. I'm going to convince
you that you need to be at

83
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,590
point B. These are three fairly traditional
approaches

84
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,310
to influencing behavior.

85
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,210
In this course, we'll talk about a fourth.

86
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,280
We'll talk about the notion of choice architecture.

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,460
How can I influence choice without changing
economic incentives, without

88
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,190
imposing restrictions, and without advertising?

89
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,150
Simple example, defaults.

90
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,689
If I know that people stick with the default,
simply changing the default

91
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:47,189
in a given choice is going to change the percent
of people

92
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:48,460
choosing that option.

93
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,440
Or, the compromise effect.

94
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,090
If I know that items displayed in the middle
are more likely to get chosen,

95
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,599
can I take a preferred option and surround
it by an option that is

96
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:02,550
weaker and cheaper, another one that is stronger
and more expensive?

97
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,050
And the research would show that, in that
case, choices are more likely to

98
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,310
gravitate to the one in the middle.

99
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,540
Final point.

100
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,499
We talked about choice architecture, we talked
about influence, we talked

101
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:17,699
about stealing people's choices, so what's
the right option?

102
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,650
Who decides what is right?

103
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,689
And again, there are multiple ways of thinking
through that.

104
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:28,050
We can think through a parental body, a government,
a policy board, a

105
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,860
cooperative unit, a dieting society, someone
that we trust that tells us

106
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,740
what the right choice is.

107
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,729
And in fact, when people sign up to loss weight
for a program, they are

108
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,009
essentially trusting the administrators of
the program to help

109
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,139
them make the right choice.

110
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:45,310
That's one option.

111
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,030
A second way to think about it is the majority.

112
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,710
Can we actually think about what the majority
wants?

113
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,860
Can we think about options that are socially
more desirable and steer

114
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,340
people towards those choices?

115
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,479
That's a second norm, a second way, of thinking
about who decides.

116
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,110
The third and most important point is you,
the individual, decide what is

117
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,419
right for you, and then you compose a choice
architecture.

118
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,790
You compose a context in which your own choices
are now influenced by what

119
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,080
you decide is right for you.

120
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,330
Remember, we said that there's a big gap between
what people want to do and

121
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,039
what they end up doing, and choice architecture
presents a fantastic

122
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,530
opportunity to lock yourself into the kind
of behavior that you want to do.
