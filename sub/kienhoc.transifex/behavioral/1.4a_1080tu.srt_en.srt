If you go to the movies and ask for a large
helping of

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,529
popcorn, you're going to get something like
this.

3
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,000
It's going to have about 10 cups of popcorn.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,630
It's going to have 1,200 calories.

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,070
If you want butter, it's going to be 300 extra
calories, perhaps three days

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,590
worth of saturated fats, and more nutrition
than you actually want for a

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,400
long period of time.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,070
What's interesting is that a lot of people
who get popcorn of a very large

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,570
size don't actually want to eat all of it.

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,070
And if you caught them separately and asked
them, do you really want to eat

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,860
10 cups of popcorn, they'd say no.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,480
But the point is, a lot of them do eat all
of the popcorn.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,250
Here's a simple thought experiment.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,070
If the same quantity of popcorn now came in
four separate bags, would you

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,820
eat as much?

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,520
And the answer is no.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,539
And the answer is no because of a phenomenon
that we call a theory of

18
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:06,250
decision points.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,930
Let's think about it as follows.

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,630
A lot of times when people decide to eat popcorn
or potato chips or drink

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,450
soda or eat chocolates, they tend to make
what we call a meta-decision.

22
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,600
They decide to eat popcorn, but they don't
decide how much.

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,829
So I'm going to open the bag, and I'm going
to start eating.

24
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:27,810
And I don't look at the next kernel and say,
well, should I eat this one?

25
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,680
It's tasty.

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,539
Or that.

27
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:36,539
I just keep going until the bag is all finished.

28
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,350
And so what happens when I have four bags
is something interesting.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,450
I start with the first bag, I eat until it's
all gone, and now I have an

30
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,389
active decision to make.

31
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:51,590
And that decision is, should I open the next
bag?

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,680
And that's where the rational part of myself
kicks in, and I say, no, it's

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,209
time to stop.

34
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,489
So in sum, what happens with this experiment
is that the moment you take

35
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,319
a large resource--
be it popcorn or soda or time or money--

36
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,540
and you partition that into multiple units,
you are creating what we call a

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,270
decision point.

38
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,629
Amar Cheema and I did a number of experiments
that tried to replicate

39
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,849
the thought experiment that we just showed
you with popcorn.

40
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:25,970
We showed that when chocolate is packaged
in different units, its

41
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,409
consumption decreases.

42
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:30,939
We found that when cookies are partitioned
by putting glazed paper in

43
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:34,060
the middle of different cookies, in fact,
again people slow down the

44
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,239
consumption of cookies.

45
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,380
We found this also with beverages and all
kinds of foods.

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,049
And with thought to ourselves that if this
works for food and for beverages,

47
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,629
might it work for other kinds of resources?

48
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:49,060
So back when I lived in Hong Kong, we did
an experiment at the Hong Kong

49
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,760
University of Science and Technology.

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,519
We invited a number of people to participate
in a gambling study.

51
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,969
I mean, how much fun was that?

52
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,670
They came to the lab.

53
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,530
They were each given 100 gambling coupons
that looked like that.

54
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,329
Each coupon had a cash value of $0.50, which
meant that every individual in

55
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:11,530
our experiment was getting about $50 worth
of assets, which they could

56
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,219
exchange for cash at any point in time.

57
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,650
So people could actually choose to simply
leave the room, cash in their

58
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,989
$50, and be done.

59
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,720
Of course, gambling was fun.

60
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,159
Gambling was almost addictive.

61
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,180
And a lot of people in our experiment told
us that they knew they shouldn't

62
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,300
gamble, but they had fun doing it.

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,329
And hence, our idea was to try and see if
partitioning these coupons into

64
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,670
different set sizes actually changes how much
people gamble.

65
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,040
Here's what happened.

66
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,610
People were given coupons in one of two conditions.

67
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,110
In one condition, there were 100 coupons in
an envelope sealed and

68
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,670
given to participants.

69
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,430
In a second condition, there were 10 coupons
in an envelope, and 10 of

70
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,920
these envelopes were given to the participant.

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,799
So in every condition, everybody got 100 coupons.

72
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,109
It's just that in one set of conditions, there
were 100 in one.

73
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,840
In the other set, there were 10 in 10.

74
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,109
And we were interested in seeing how much
people gambled as a function of

75
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:14,560
this particular manipulation.

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,280
The gambling exercise was fun.

77
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,900
People had to actually go online, click on
a button.

78
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,420
There was a wheel that spun.

79
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,740
With some probability, they won five coupons
for every coupon

80
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,180
that they had gambled.

81
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,340
I believe the probability was one in three.

82
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,710
And there were only two rules of the gambling
game.

83
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,930
Rule number one was that they could not gamble
away their winnings, so

84
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,750
they could only gamble up to 100 coupons.

85
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,560
Rule number two, they had to gamble one at
a time.

86
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
What happened?

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,800
Well, here's what happened.

88
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,960
The panel on the top shows you the number
of people who actually gambled

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,970
a given number of coupons when they had 100
coupons in one envelope.

90
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,150
So the panel on the top is for people that
had all 100 in the same envelope.

91
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,610
What you see is a lot of people chose not
to gamble.

92
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,370
All right, so the first few bars are actually
zero.

93
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,630
Those are folks that didn't gamble at all.

94
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,480
But boy, once they started gambling, the bars
keep increasing in height.

95
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,830
And what you'll see is that there was one
person that actually gambled away

96
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,690
all 100 of their coupons.

97
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,030
The panel at the bottom, on the other hand,
shows you conditions where, in

98
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,960
fact, people had 10 envelopes, each with 10
coupons.

99
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,840
And what you see there is that almost everybody
gambled.

100
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,379
There were only two people who chose not to
gamble.

101
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:35,930
But the height of the bars are now much lower.

102
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,250
Some people gambled 20 coupons, some 30, some
40.

103
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,770
And in fact, 40 was the highest number that
was gambled.

104
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,590
And what's interesting is that these amounts
gambled represent multiples of

105
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,310
10, which essentially means people opened
an envelope and then stopped,

106
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,710
or opened two and stopped or three and stopped.

107
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,229
And one person opened four.

108
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:58,010
Again, same principle.

109
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,600
The coupons were like popcorn in bags that
are different sizes.

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,940
When people opened one envelope, the coupons
kind of became free.

111
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,840
There was not much thinking that went on.

112
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,280
People consumed a lot.

113
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,580
But in fact, when people had to multiply open
a number of envelopes,

114
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,490
that was a decision point which forced them
to stop.
