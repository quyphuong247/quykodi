Welcome back.
https://youtu.be/LEkRzeVJTwU
1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,660
As I promised I&#39;m going to go to website, and I would encourage you to look at it.

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,080
So I&#39;m going to portend the symbol for Amazon, which is AMZN.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,910
And we&#39;ll go to that page.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,180
And if you notice on the first page, you have Amazon&#39;s data available,

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,393
you have the stock price which is 738.

6
00:00:30,393 --> 00:00:35,729
It just changed from 738.9 to .95,

7
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,250
previous close 736.

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,005
I would encourage you to go right now,

9
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:47,600
obviously you are at different time watching at different times you can go and

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,852
some of the information I&#39;m going to talk about is pretty much available

11
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:57,783
over here and I just show you this is the pre-disclosed risk today.

12
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:02,000
I am taping today so the days are different for you.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,150
Bid ask prices, open price, day range, volume, average volume.

14
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,070
And then I&#39;m going to press Statistics.

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,560
And if you go to Statistics, you&#39;ll see,

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,970
start seeing some numbers that I&#39;m going to show you and one is market cap.

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,185
So when you see market cap it shows 300, right now it shows about

18
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:32,792
$348 billion which is the market cap of Amazon, all right.

19
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:39,830
And I&#39;ll keep going down this price book, price, sales If you keep scrolling down,

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,360
I would encourage you to look for

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,510
a balance sheet item and you&#39;ll see total debt.

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,268
And right now if I go down I see debt of about 17.61 billion.

23
00:01:56,268 --> 00:02:00,439
So the reason I&#39;m focusing on this is, Amazon, I can go there,

24
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,820
look up its balance sheet numbers, and I&#39;m going to ask you the following question.

25
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,930
Right now, Amazon&#39;s total market cap,

26
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,140
which is price times number of shares, is about $350 billion.

27
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,520
And its debt is about $17 billion.

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,820
So, what assumption can you approximately safely make about Amazon?

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,020
Let&#39;s assume that Amazon has only equity financing.

30
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,080
Okay, so what has happened?

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,820
Debt you can assume close to zero so that return on assets and

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,080
return on equity will be the same.

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,700
So that&#39;s what I wanted to show you right now and when we come back later,

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,170
I&#39;ll also show you some other information on the Amazon page.

35
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,030
Meanwhile, whenever you have a chance, whether it&#39;s Amazon or so on as I&#39;ve said

36
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,490
in my syllabus too, go too Yahoo Finance and try to figure things out.

37
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,938
So I&#39;ve shown you a balance sheet, what have I shown you?

38
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:06,301
The total market value of equity of Amazon is about 350 billion,

39
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:11,101
which is also almost perfectly close, not quite,

40
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:15,251
to the total market value of all its assets.

41
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:20,420
So if I asked you what;s the value of Amazon, you&#39;ll say $350 billion.

42
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,950
It&#39;s technically more right, because it&#39;s equity plus debt, but

43
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,080
the debt is very small.

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,950
That&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;ve also chosen Amazon is when we come back

45
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,880
later what will we see?

46
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,830
The return on equity of Amazon, and return on assets of Amazon are the same.

47
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,700
Point number one.

48
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,390
Please remember that.

49
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,550
The critical issue is once I figure that return on assets for Amazon, when

50
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,246
we come back to this site, after you&#39;ve done some work, I want to set it up.

51
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:55,870
Is that return on asset becomes the return on assets for

52
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,590
home, for rain forest, my new idea.

53
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,380
Remember the purpose to go to Amazon was try to figure out

54
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,420
what are the cost of capital for rain forest.

55
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,970
So, why did I go to Amazon?

56
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,086
Bottom line, whenever you&#39;re thinking of cost of capital,

57
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:19,769
it doesn&#39;t belong to you as a manager, it belongs to the marketplace.

58
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,620
Another way to think about it is the following.

59
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,422
There&#39;s an investor to whom you&#39;ll go and ask, not just one,

60
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:30,060
of probably many people.

61
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,830
And you&#39;ll go and ask for money.

62
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,730
What are they going to think?

63
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,900
They aren&#39;t gonna think like you as a project manager,

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,500
they&#39;re going to think like a investor.

65
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,820
And what does the investor do?

66
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,610
An investor will shop around.

67
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,152
An investor will say wait a second,

68
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:49,615
rain forest is going into an online portal selling everything.

69
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,280
A-ha!

70
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,940
So who&#39;s likely to be a smaller compatible as we call them?

71
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,970
Amazon.

72
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,090
So let&#39;s figure out what rate of return Amazon is providing.

73
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,830
If you provide a higher rate of return than Amazon what will I do?

74
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,390
I&#39;ll invest in you.

75
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,840
If you provide a rate of return below Amazon, what will I do?

76
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,810
I will not give you the money.

77
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,520
In fact, you shouldn&#39;t put your own money.

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,660
You should give it to Amazon.

79
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,305
So comparable is same business and the return on the alternative

80
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:26,970
is why everything is relative pricing, is what is your cost of capital,

81
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,510
because that&#39;s what you&#39;ve got to beat to convince people to join you.

82
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,380
We&#39;re going to take a break.

83
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,810
I would like you to just explore Amazon&#39;s website and look at data.

84
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:45,420
I promise you, once we have done risk and return and understood how to calculate Re

85
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,380
and Ra, we will go back and revisit this interesting problem.

86
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:51,920
See you soon.
