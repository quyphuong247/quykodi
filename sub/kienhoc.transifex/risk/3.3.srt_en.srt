Welcome back.

1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,990
So, having talked about two securities, let me show you some data

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,030
which is kind of artificial but quite reflective.

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,724
So stare at the deck for a second.

4
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:23,800
While you&#39;re doing that, I&#39;m going to walk you through.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,095
So on the left-hand top side, is a scatter plot but what&#39;s peculiar about it?

6
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:35,760
N in x axis, b on y axis, a on x axis, that&#39;s true about all of them.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,190
What&#39;s peculiar about the left top?

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,470
All the dots are in a perfect straight line.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,800
What&#39;s true about the right, extreme bottom part?

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,550
Same is true, except the relationship is negative.

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,700
Those are the two extremes.

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,590
What&#39;s happening along the other dimension?

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,930
If you go to the left bottom corner, that&#39;s negative 0.5.

14
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:08,518
Middle nothing happens, top 0.5.

15
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:13,477
So let me ask you a question and this is one of those things that

16
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:18,290
I do all the time, very rarely am I programmed in class.

17
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,030
But here this joke or this serious talk or whatever comes to mind.

18
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,420
If you stare at this first, let&#39;s talk about the serious stuff.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,430
Then the question for you, and then we&#39;ll leave it off and come back to it.

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,710
First, quick.

21
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,490
There are two reasons that risk is there, broad reasons about types of risks.

22
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:48,210
One is market tends to be common to everything, and one is specific.

23
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,600
And remember, for simplicity we have only two securities.

24
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,860
So they&#39;ll be specific to A or B, or common to A or B, market.

25
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,850
Quick question, what is the reason of the correlation between the two?

26
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,880
Is it the specific risks or something that&#39;s common to both?

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,421
Answer is pretty obvious.

28
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:17,445
Correlations exist, covariances exist because of the fact that most of us,

29
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:23,606
most security, most projects are affected commonly by this notion

30
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:29,440
of macro market moments, which is becoming global now.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,880
So as I said earlier I think at some point, in one of the sessions I talked

32
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,590
about something that wasn&#39;t a common risk has become.

33
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,750
Similar technology&#39;s another one.

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,370
Heck, Internet has been there for a long time, much longer than we know.

35
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,120
But, it was not a very specific risk, I mean,

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,220
not a very common risk, now it&#39;s everywhere.

37
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,010
So, if something were to happen to the Internet, everything, I believe,

38
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,650
will come to a halt, except, just enjoying nature, that&#39;s the beauty.

39
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,340
[LAUGH] Anyway, so, let&#39;s step back.

40
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,580
Let me ask you the following question.

41
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,540
Okay, so everybody, hopefully,

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,280
agrees that it&#39;s not the specific risk that remains, when you combine securities,

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,340
but the common, and that&#39;s the source of the correlation.

44
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,440
How likely are the left top other bottom, right, top.

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,240
Almost zero probability.

46
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,279
It&#39;s a unlikely that Google will move perfectly with Microsoft, though

47
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:38,980
they are in similar industries, though they are much more dependent on Internet.

48
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,499
By the way, the business that Microsoft is getting into is becoming more and

49
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:46,868
more different than just producing Windows software.

50
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:52,270
Okay, anyway so those two extremes are out.

51
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,790
How likely is the middle part?

52
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,172
[SOUND] How likely, right?

53
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:03,053
Because two securities being completely independent of each other actually

54
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,132
in that environment, say Google Microsoft, or

55
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:10,190
Google Walmart maybe no chance that will be zero.

56
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,890
There has to be some element of commonality.

57
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,870
So let me go to the left pattern.

58
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,850
How likely is it that one will go up and the other will go down?

59
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,870
Quite unlikely.

60
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,970
Why?, because it&#39;s very rare, it can happen, but a stark,

61
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,300
on average, is anti cyclical, meaning it moves against the market.

62
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,690
Of course, everybody love it, why?

63
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,850
Because when everybody is doing well, it does poorly.

64
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,538
But when everybody is doing poorly, it&#39;s doing well, and

65
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,000
that&#39;s what you want, right?

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,140
Is the risk of loss percent, it&#39;s also called a friend in need.

67
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,980
There are lots of friends that I have.

68
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,400
But the real friends are ones who show up when I&#39;m not doing well,

69
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,890
when I&#39;m in trouble or something like that.

70
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,910
Anyway, let&#39;s go to the right top.

71
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:04,140
I would say not 0.5 exact, but this notion of a positive relationship is most likely.

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,270
And the reason again is, the market is common to most things,

73
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,910
okay, so does that give you a sense of what&#39;s happening.

74
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,280
So if everything was in a straight line somehow, and

75
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,470
on the positive left hand top, diversification won&#39;t work.

76
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,890
But because two randomly securities tend to be in the right craft,

77
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,460
the 0.5 not exact a 0.5 but a positive number, not 1,

78
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,690
but positive, diversification will work.

79
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,080
Of course it will work very well, for the middle part or even better for

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,290
the left, because things will tend to cancel each other.

81
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,490
Okay, now the trick question and now the fun part.

82
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,624
Which one of these graphs is love?

83
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:55,907
Really, I mean it, when you love somebody,

84
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:59,730
which one of these graphs is love?

85
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,470
And you&#39;ll see how finances occurred.

86
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,244
See you on a bit.
