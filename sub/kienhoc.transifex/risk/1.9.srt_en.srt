00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:10,808
Okay, so now, there&#39;s a chance that you may get slightly confused,
https://youtu.be/Ly6rSmZ6iCU
1
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:15,839
and the reason is relationships can be measured in many ways.

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,830
And the ways we use to measure it have some logic behind them.

3
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,149
And I like finance because it brings out that logic beautifully.

4
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:31,890
I actually feel like statistics was created for finance.

5
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,580
And when finance, modern finance emerged, statistics made so much sense.

6
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,240
And you&#39;ll see what I mean, it&#39;s so exciting how closely tied they are.

7
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,760
So, one final notion of relationships.

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,220
So, why are we studying relationships?

9
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,830
Because it&#39;s related to the notion that I, as a risk averse person,

10
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,470
would never invest in one thing.

11
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,220
I would invest in a portfolio.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,900
Once I have put IBM in a portfolio, its risk is no longer its standard deviation.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,520
But it&#39;s related to how IBM,

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,300
it is based on how IBM is related to other stocks in the portfolio.

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,750
What did we just do?

16
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,840
We found one way of measuring relationships called correlations.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,330
But correlations started off at what?

18
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,220
Covariance, which was dependent on units.

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,100
And also, could be enlarged, or made small,

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,143
shrunk based on how the units were measured, inches or

21
00:01:29,143 --> 00:01:33,360
millimeters if you may, okay?

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,980
Or if you measured feet, you&#39;d change the number again.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,630
Now what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to define what&#39;s called regression.

24
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,662
Okay, and the regression is a concept that is written typically,

25
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:55,427
and I&#39;ll write it out, Yi, this is the standard equation of regression.

26
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,857
So I&#39;ve written it out.

27
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:06,863
I&#39;m again starting with some very fundamental concepts.

28
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:14,020
So Yi = Alpha i + Beta i Xi + Epsilon.

29
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,960
What does it reflect?

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,590
So if Y is on this axis, and

31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,750
X is on this axis, there are a bunch of datas.

32
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,480
Yi, I should have, Xi.

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,110
So, we are measuring the relationship between the two.

34
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,935
What you&#39;ll see soon, when we come back for the next segment,

35
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:40,124
you&#39;re going to replace this by Ri, which is, you can pick of IBM,

36
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:45,879
then you are going to replace this by Rm, which is the return on the market.

37
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,306
But for the time being, just think of them by an X.

38
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:52,380
So, the first question is what are we trying to do?

39
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,300
You&#39;re trying to see if you can fit a relationship through that.

40
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,510
Okay, now, let&#39;s talk about it.

41
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,436
So what is, first of all, this guy?

42
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:12,308
This guy is also called the intercept.

43
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,580
And think about what it is.

44
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,312
So y is related to x, but

45
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:24,659
y is bouncing around and x is bouncing around.

46
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:31,020
So, alpha is that average y, which has nothing to do with x.

47
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,970
In other words, x is bouncing around, it&#39;s related to y,

48
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,470
but y is moving for, on average, without x moving too.

49
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,340
They&#39;re not perfect, you see what I&#39;m saying?

50
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,750
So, that&#39;s the average value of Y.

51
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,040
There is nothing to do with X.

52
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,924
What is this?

53
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,440
This is called the slope.

54
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:58,843
Slope, another word for it is, of course, BETA.

55
00:03:58,843 --> 00:04:02,320
And by the way, is going to stay with us for a long time.

56
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,640
So, what is BETA measuring?

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,710
BETA is measuring the relationship between x and y.

58
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,912
So I could throw in IBM here, and Xerox here.

59
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:17,560
Or I could throw in IBM here and market here.

60
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,890
Beta will capture the relationship between the two.

61
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,520
So, how do you define beta?

62
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,750
And the definition of beta is the following.

63
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,580
It has to start off with what?

64
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,228
Covariance, between what and what?

65
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:39,028
Y and X.

66
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,156
And we know how to calculate it, yeah?

67
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:47,060
Yi minus y bar, xi minus x bar, summed over all probabilities.

68
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,320
So I&#39;m using another symbol.

69
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,010
And by the way,

70
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,580
review of statistics is a note that is with this note that you should read.

71
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,261
It&#39;s available to you, it&#39;s in the syllabus.

72
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,288
And I&#39;m repeating some of this stuff, but

73
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:04,402
I think it&#39;s important to walk through the more important ones.

74
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:07,120
So, Yi Xi is written here.

75
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,676
What&#39;s the problem with Yi Xi?

76
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:17,790
Covariance of Yi Xi, imagine Y was bushels, and X was rainfall.

77
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,940
You have a unit problem, you have a magnitude problem, then what do you do?

78
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,220
Here, you standardize it by variance of x.

79
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,310
You do not standardize it by standard deviation of y and

80
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,130
standard deviation of x, which was called correlation.

81
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:44,300
The formula for beta turns out to be covariance standardized by what?

82
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,560
Variance of which variable?

83
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,000
The independent variable, y is called the dependent variable.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,880
So x changes around, and y is dependent on x.

85
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,780
That&#39;s why it&#39;s very, very important to not flip the two, for

86
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,970
the two to make sense.

87
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,050
That&#39;s why, what did I put on the left-hand side?

88
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,120
Bushels.

89
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,285
And what did I put on the right-hand side?

90
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:08,070
Rainfall, right?

91
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,740
So, rainfall affects bushels.

92
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,470
So, suppose we are talking about advertising and sales.

93
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,790
What should X be?

94
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,360
Advertising, sales should be Y.

95
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,271
Okay, so you have to use common sense and that&#39;s what&#39;s call hypothesis building,

96
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:23,040
building a good model.

97
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,955
Turns out when we do finance, when we come back for the next module,

98
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:32,130
Xi will be, could be anything, but it will end up being

99
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,850
Rm as the most sensible thing to use, that is return on the market.

100
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,500
And the formula is here.

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,000
What I&#39;m going to leave you with is, how is it different from correlation?

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,440
And you can go from beta to correlation, correlation to beta, and

103
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,050
I&#39;ll let you do that.

104
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,030
It&#39;s just a little manipulation of the same equation.

105
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,060
But important point, the numerators of both correlation and

106
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,090
beta are the same, which is covariance.

107
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,030
Therefore, the sign of beta and correlation are the same, but

108
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,760
the magnitudes are different based on how you are calculating them.

109
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,000
So what does beta tell you?

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,510
Correlation tells you strength of relationship.

111
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,520
What does beta tell you?

112
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,560
Suppose this is in percentage terms, and returns are in percentage.

113
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,110
Suppose this is percent change.

114
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,370
If x changes by 1%, how much does y change by?

115
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,990
That&#39;s exactly beta unit slope.

116
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,670
So yeah, it is a lot of meaning.

117
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,800
It&#39;s very beautiful.

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,700
It turns out, again, that finance is also, because you don&#39;t have to do percentages.

119
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,153
The return is already in percentage form.

120
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:46,190
And there is a deeper reason for using percentages in another context.

121
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,550
We won&#39;t talk about it here.

122
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,550
Finally, what the heck is this?

123
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,150
This, many people call error.

124
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,720
This is all these.

125
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,510
Once you&#39;ve fit the line, all these distances from the line are these errors.

126
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,970
And you&#39;re trying to do what when you fit the straight line?

127
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,270
You&#39;re trying to minimize those errors, and randomize them.

128
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,190
Because if there&#39;s a systematic part in the errors, they should show up where?

129
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,800
In the main equation.

130
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,460
So, epsilon has got errors.

131
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,100
And I also call it our ignorance.

132
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,825
So, if you&#39;re trying to explain, say again, bushels with rainfall,

133
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:32,890
rainfall is not the only thing that will explain your productivity.

134
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,300
What else could you think of?

135
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,450
Fertilizer, you can think of natural fertilizers being

136
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,160
more long-term beneficial than artificial, and so on and so forth.

137
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,800
In other words, there could be multiple determinants of y.

138
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,700
And what will you do when you get a better beta in determinants?

139
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,850
You make these errors the variance of them.

140
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,350
Shrink it.

141
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,390
And that&#39;s one of the goals of a good model, is to try to build a sensible model

142
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,240
that&#39;s got higher predictability, in some instances.

143
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,810
Here, I just wanted to introduce you to what?

144
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,080
Another measure of relationships, which is going to be very important.

145
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,103
And that measure is called beta,

146
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:16,144
which tells you the relationship between y and x.

147
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:21,275
It tells you if x and y are in percentages,

148
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:26,856
how much does y change by if x changes by 1%.

149
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:32,730
See you for a data driven module on statistics, risk and return.

150
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:34,930
See you later.
