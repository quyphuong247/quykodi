Welcome back.

1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,200
We are still with the problem.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,080
It&#39;s rich.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,280
Let&#39;s do an interesting question.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,230
Suppose Kitchen Inc has 100 million shares.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,100
They just financed this new business through its existing cash flows.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,670
What will happen to it&#39;s stock price?

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,270
Let&#39;s first ask qualitatively, meaning without calculating any numbers.

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,100
Do you what will happen to it&#39;s stock price, will it go up or down?

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,520
You know it will go up.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,350
Why?

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,130
Because you&#39;re taking on a positive NPV project, point number 1.

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,550
When will it go up?

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,710
That&#39;s so interesting.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,280
And if you have done finance before, dealt value money,

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,265
the courses before this, what you&#39;ll recognize is that in an efficient market,

16
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:56,440
where prices reflect value, prices will jump up today.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,730
Unless information is not easily available, blah, blah, blah.

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,225
You&#39;ve assumed that the market is competitive and there are no frictions.

19
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:05,900
So let&#39;s do the exact calculation.

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,090
So we know that we go up,

21
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,340
because it&#39;s many times written like that, three dots inverted.

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,570
Because NPV positive.

23
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,700
But you can do better.

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,540
You can see by how much.

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,671
So let&#39;s take $100 million.

26
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:35,428
Right, which is the investment in the new project, and

27
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:40,340
add to that the present value of all the cash flows.

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,922
Cash flows are expected to be $15 million a year and

29
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:46,241
I am not going to add all the zeros.

30
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,463
You know what I am talking about.

31
00:01:48,463 --> 00:01:57,160
Divided by 0.125 which is the cost of capital we just calculated.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,280
Okay, so if you do that, what you come

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,373
up with is $20 million is the NPV, right?

34
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:12,219
However, I am not asking you the total value.

35
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:16,401
What I am saying is how many shares and what will happen to share price?

36
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:22,454
So price per share will increase by 20 million

37
00:02:22,454 --> 00:02:28,980
divided by 10 million, which is $2 per share.

38
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,000
I want you to think about this very carefully.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,520
And the reason is, it&#39;s so cool, you don&#39;t even need to know the market value of

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,697
the rest of the firm before this, right?

41
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:37,910
[LAUGH] So

42
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,780
I can figure out changes in prices, because I know the base case is common.

43
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,838
And I&#39;m adding positive NPV, okay?

44
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:49,200
Think about it,

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,310
it&#39;s pretty cool and I would encourage you to go redo this problem on your own.

46
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,360
Let&#39;s move on and ask the following question.

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,050
What&#39;s the new cost of capital of Kitchen, Inc.?

48
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,495
Is this good or bad news?

49
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:07,970
What&#39;s the new cost of capital, is this good or bad news?

50
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,900
So let me ask you the following question.

51
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,871
If you take this project, which you should,

52
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:20,714
your 50 business percent will be in Kitchen,

53
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:25,455
and 50% business will be in construction.

54
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:31,160
The cost of capital of this business was 7.5%.

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,510
The cost of capital of this business was 12.5%.

56
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,460
So, your total cost of capital for Kitchen, new

57
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,473
cost of capital will turn out to be 10%.

58
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:50,921
Half of 12.5 is 6.25.

59
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,369
Half of 7.5 is 3.75%.

60
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,890
So the cost of capital is now 10%.

61
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,115
What was it before?

62
00:03:58,115 --> 00:03:59,520
7%.

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,300
Question, is this good news or is this bad news?

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,160
What should your answer be?

65
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,990
It&#39;s no news.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,270
The good news was you took NPV positive.

67
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,230
This is not news.

68
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,920
This is a new cost of capital.

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,060
Next time, the good news will be what we will do next will,

70
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,230
matters whether that&#39;s NPV positive or not.

71
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,200
Why is this the case not good news?

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,940
What was your beta equity here, earlier?

73
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,330
One.

74
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,200
That was also your beta of asset because you have no debt.

75
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,400
But now what is your new beta asset?

76
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,100
If you do the calculations, turns out your new beta asset

77
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,460
would have to have gone up for your return on assets to have gone up.

78
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,880
Please do the calculation yourself and you&#39;ll work out that it should be 1.50.

79
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,740
And the reason is that the cost of beta

80
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,050
asset which you need to calculate, which you already know for this business is one.

81
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,890
Calculate the beta asset of this.

82
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,020
How will you do it?

83
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,521
You know the return on asset, you know risk-free rate is 2.5.

84
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:15,685
You&#39;re left with what?

85
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:17,305
Take 2.5 to the other side.

86
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:23,242
So this has to be equal to 2.5%

87
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:27,915
+ 5% times beta asset.

88
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:30,800
2.5 subtract, you are left with 10%.

89
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,680
Divide by 5, you have 2.

90
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,508
So the beta asset is 2.

91
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:42,470
So the beta asset of the business is 2, beta asset of the old business is 1.

92
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,920
The average of the two, half and half, is 1.5.

93
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,100
Very easy to calculate.

94
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,440
The point I am trying to make here is the fact that your return

95
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,540
went up because of a reason, your risk also went up.

96
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,650
But that is not the important point here.

97
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,700
High risk, high return.

98
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,020
Not good, not bad, it doesn&#39;t matter.

99
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,600
The real good news here was what?

100
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,650
That you took a positive NPV project and created share price jump of what?

101
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,395
Two bucks a share.

102
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:20,630
$20 million was created because you chose to take a project that was different.

103
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,230
Another way to think about it is did you take on a high risk project?

104
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,240
The answer is yes, is that good or bad?

105
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,310
No.

106
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,170
What&#39;s good or bad is not whether you did a high risk project or not, but

107
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,930
to get a positive NPV proposition from it.

108
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,860
And that&#39;s the key you want to take home.

109
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,390
So let&#39;s take a break.

110
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,040
I hope you like this example.

111
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,500
I really, really like it because it puts everything together.

112
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,440
It&#39;s not got too much on cash flows,

113
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,420
because cash flows we know have spent a lot of time on.

114
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,015
Which is a lot about valuation and how you think about it,

115
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:55,940
un-levering, why and so on.

116
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,350
And as you go into more advanced classes, just on valuation,

117
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,680
even if you don&#39;t do more on financing, which I hope you do follow on courses.

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,640
You&#39;ll need to know this to go to the next level.

119
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,560
So let&#39;s take a break, wrap up a little bit, and

120
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,020
add what you&#39;re going to see in the real world, and that&#39;s frictions.

121
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,720
At least one of them, which is taxes and the beneficial treatment to debt.

122
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,056
See you in a minute.
