00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:06,300
Chào mừng trở lại. 
Tôi mong rằng bạn đã có chút khái niệm về việc

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,900
tại sao ta lại nghĩ về những mối quan hệ.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,630
Và lí do thì căn bản là vì sự ác cảm với rủi ro,

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,980
nên ta đã phải cập nhật toàn bộ danh sách đầu tư.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,900
So I&#39;m going to stick with two returns in a portfolio, or

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,660
two returns because if you make it more complex right away it&#39;ll become tough.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,330
So think of two securities, two things.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,860
One distribution is here, another distribution is here.

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,000
And let&#39;s for, just for the fun, call this Amazon,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,192
and let&#39;s, for fun, call this Microsoft.

11
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:53,000
Two companies most people have dealt with, know about, and so on.

12
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,160
So you have Amazon, you have Microsoft.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,457
The question then becomes, can you calculate the return on Amazon?

14
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:06,546
Yes, I can calculate the return, I&#39;ll call it RA.

15
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:15,750
Z just for the heck of it, RAZ bar, and sigma hat AZ.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:24,700
Here I can calculate R Microsoft bar and sigma hat Microsoft.

17
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,830
For being able to calculate it, which I promise you we will do with real data.

18
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,670
What do you need?

19
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,460
You need data to be able to do it.

20
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,110
Either continuous data, or discrete data and usually we&#39;ll have continuous data but

21
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,350
I&#39;ll do both.

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,796
Because you need to understand concepts, data applications very clearly.

23
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:47,405
Okay, so you&#39;ve done both, but what do I want to also measure?

24
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:51,648
Because they&#39;re both sitting in my portfolio, of risk averse person.

25
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:56,311
Assuming you can afford to invest, I guarantee you that if you&#39;re a risk averse

26
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:59,799
person, they are somehow showing up in a broad portfolio.

27
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:07,626
So the measure of relationship is called covariance.

28
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:17,530
And covariance is interesting, why, because what does it measure?

29
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,426
It measures how these two move together.

30
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:25,686
So if RAZ- RAZ bar,

31
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:31,213
what would you call that?

32
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:36,176
It would be at this point, this distance.

33
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:39,261
At this point it would be this distance.

34
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:41,044
This would have a what sign?

35
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:44,940
Negative sign, this would have a positive sign.

36
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,860
So this is negative, this is positive.

37
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,142
Similarly, there

38
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:57,600
will be RMS- RMS bar.

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,090
Quick question, what do you need to know to calculate which?

40
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,578
You need to know all RSZs to calculate this or RMS.

41
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:09,998
So this changes, this is a number,

42
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:14,677
one number based on all the data you have, okay?

43
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:17,724
So suppose you&#39;re looking at this item.

44
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,717
And then you ask yourself,

45
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:26,260
what is happening to Microsoft when this is negative?

46
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,670
How will you measure that?

47
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,039
You&#39;ll go measure a specific instance of that,

48
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,440
multiply the two that shows you how they&#39;re related.

49
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,160
But how many of them are there?

50
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,890
So if you&#39;ll take the regular formula, the longer formula, it is sigma i p i.

51
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:54,538
So the probability of event i, RAZ how is related to its mean?

52
00:03:54,538 --> 00:04:00,160
And multiply that by RNZ, how it&#39;s related to risk.

53
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,037
So basically what it&#39;s measuring is,

54
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:08,188
over the entire full set of possibilities, i, how are they related?

55
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:11,160
So let me ask you a simple question.

56
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Suppose when this is negative, this also tends to be negative.

57
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,900
Not by the same amount, necessarily, not exactly the same amount.

58
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,580
But, and when this tends to be positive, this also tends to be positive.

59
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,250
On average, what will this number be?

60
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,420
Greater than 0.

61
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,420
But on the other hand,

62
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,990
which happens rarely in the stock market between two stocks, we&#39;ll see why.

63
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,990
If this tends to be positive, this tends to be negative, the sign will be negative.

64
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,640
And in a very strange circumstance,

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,110
suppose Amazon does whatever it does return, has nothing to do with Microsoft.

66
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,140
So when it&#39;s negative, this then should be positive and when it&#39;s positive,

67
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,020
this then should be negative.

68
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,120
The relationship is 0.

69
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Very, very unlikely, in the real world, in the stock market.

70
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,960
The two returns, you&#39;ll see when it will happen, and you&#39;ll see why it&#39;s unlikely.

71
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,706
So what is covariance measuring?

72
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:17,770
Covariance is measuring the relationship between risk,

73
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,280
I mean between two different companies.

74
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,820
And we can think of it many pairs of company, okay.

75
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,410
There is a problem with the covariance.

76
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,591
And what I&#39;m going to do is show you why.

77
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:38,890
I will repeat this whole exercise and show you why there&#39;s a problem.

78
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,336
So I&#39;m going to now go from covariance to something called correlation.

79
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:50,804
Okay, so remember

80
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:57,107
the covariances were sigma,

81
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:01,391
bi, RAZ- RAZ bar,

82
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:05,940
times RMS- RMS bar.

83
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,913
The trouble with covariance is there are two things.

84
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:19,850
One, that it is dependent on the units, so let me distract for

85
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,000
a second from Amazon and Microsoft.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,850
And actually that&#39;s what I love about statistics.

87
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,802
Suppose this is rainforest, I mean this is rain.

88
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:31,540
[LAUGH] And this is crops.

89
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,600
So suppose this is measured in inches and this is measured in bushels.

90
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,330
Bushels is a way of measuring how much output you have in a crop.

91
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,020
What will be the unit of measurement?

92
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,600
Inches, bushels, two different units, very confusing.

93
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,993
In the case of returns because they are measured in percentage terms,

94
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:57,226
it doesn&#39;t jump out at you.

95
00:06:57,226 --> 00:07:03,249
But it&#39;s very important to recognize that covariance is unit measurement dependent.

96
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:08,445
Point number one, not a good thing because you cannot compare rain and

97
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:13,830
bushels with returns, or with advertising dollars&#39; effect on sales.

98
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,828
So units shouldn&#39;t matter to something, if you want to compare things.

99
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:23,380
So, covariance is a very, very important concept, but

100
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,530
it suffers from unit dependence.

101
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,990
The second problem it suffers from, and I&#39;ll spend a little bit of time.

102
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,690
There&#39;s a little bit lengthy because I want to finish relationships

103
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,880
all at once rather than keep doing snippets of it.

104
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,980
The other problem, so first is unit dependent.

105
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,990
The second problem is I can make its magnitude big or

106
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,200
small, and it doesn&#39;t mean much.

107
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,870
What do I mean by that?

108
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,780
So, suppose we take the examples of inches and bushels.

109
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,190
Instead of measuring inches, suppose I decided to measure in millimeters.

110
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,730
There are a lot of millimeters in inches, and, suddenly, the number will blow up.

111
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,640
So, it&#39;s also the magnitude

112
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,420
doesn&#39;t necessarily tell you anything, which is not a good thing, right?

113
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,650
So you would imagine 500 is more than 300, it should matter somewhat.

114
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,840
No, so the main value of covariance is

115
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,010
that you have to calculate it to figure out relationships.

116
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,570
The problem is that it&#39;s unit dependent and its magnitude may not make sense.

117
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,100
But why do you have to calculate it?

118
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,240
It&#39;s sign that is most important.

119
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,130
Meaning if it is greater than zero, less than zero, or zero, tells

120
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,560
you the nature of the relationship, but nothing about the units of the magnitude.

121
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,550
Those are very confusing.

122
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,350
So how do you go from here to something?

123
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,130
That measures the relationships, retains the beauty of covariance, but

124
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,570
adjusts it for the two problems.

125
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,330
What do you do?

126
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,480
You standardize it.

127
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,655
You divide it by standard deviation,

128
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:19,567
easy, and standard deviation of MS.

129
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,260
What have you done?

130
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:29,192
You&#39;ve created something called correlation.

131
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:37,651
What I want to emphasize about correlation is

132
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:42,250
that correlation gets rid of units issue of covariance.

133
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,630
First thing, why?

134
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,700
Because think of this as what?

135
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,540
Inches of rain and this is bushels.

136
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,715
This is inches, this is inches, cancels.

137
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,550
This is bushels, this is bushels, cancels.

138
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,273
It becomes a number.

139
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:59,720
In other words, you can compare numbers.

140
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,585
It&#39;s unit free, so it&#39;s unit free, yeah.

141
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:08,480
Pretty obvious, excellent quality to have.

142
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,980
The second very good quality about correlation is you can show

143
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,880
that it will be between + and -1.

144
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,620
Now that&#39;s awesome too.

145
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,902
So when you see correlation of 0.8 positive

146
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:29,527
versus 0.6 positive, which one is stronger?

147
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,470
0.8, you can say that.

148
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,880
You couldn&#39;t say that about covariance.

149
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,780
But finally, do not forget that covariance is playing a very, very important role.

150
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,520
You cannot calculate correlation without covariance, why?

151
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,340
Because it&#39;s determining the sign.

152
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,090
So the basic nature of the relationship has been determined by covariance.

153
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,060
We&#39;ll take a break now, come back with one final concept,

154
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,890
which is related to all of this and it&#39;s called regression.

155
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,869
We&#39;ll spend one more segment on it within the context,

156
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:07,419
hopefully a reasonably short one.

157
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:11,756
And then we&#39;ll come back to applications and applications with data,

158
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,357
revisit our everything.

159
00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:18,764
But we will have covered the fundamentals of statistics that you need to know for

160
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:22,360
finance, at least the introductory finance.

161
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,520
And of course, you could apply it to many other things like we talked about, rain,

162
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,610
and bushels, and so on, so forth.

163
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,658
See you in a minute for another five minutes or so.
