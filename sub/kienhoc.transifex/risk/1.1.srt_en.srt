Hi, welcome back.
https://youtu.be/3FoJ0P4lExE
1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,380
What we are going to do now, or in this multisegment section,

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,980
but break it up into pieces that make sense, which is as you know,

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,790
best practice, in especially digital education,

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,720
is we&#39;ll talk about risk and return.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,300
But to do that, we have to first do what I usually do is,

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,570
set up why we are talking about this.

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,790
And in the context of pretty much what we&#39;ve been talking about until now.

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,990
Then we&#39;ll spend time on statistics.

9
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,650
So in this particular ongoing segment,

10
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,560
chapter, week, whatever, we&#39;re going to do two things.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,430
We&#39;re going to define risk, see why we worry about it and

12
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,150
the context, and then take a detour and talk about statistics.

13
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,460
When I talk about statistics it won&#39;t be everything obviously,

14
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,290
because I found I don&#39;t know all statistics.

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,350
But more focused even among the things I do know,

16
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,880
we&#39;ll talk about statistics as applicable to the context.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,500
Here again, big advice like in accounting, it&#39;s good to do accounting.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,130
I think it&#39;s even better to do more statistics.

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,580
Why more statistics?

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,520
Because it&#39;s everywhere, and many times as you know I love finance, but

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,060
I sometimes think statistics maybe kind of a little bit better.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,070
More applicable with big data everything.

23
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,090
So it&#39;s not very useful in life,

24
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,560
to not worry about the implications of what you are talking about.

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,380
So, the nice thing about risk is, it&#39;s really easy to talk about it in context.

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,340
But finance makes statistics very applicable and related to risk directly.

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,240
So, let&#39;s get started.

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,220
Again, my favorite formula right in front of you, hopefully,

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,020
your favorite to know is in project analysis.

30
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,680
We have to worry about figuring out the NPV of the project.

31
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,310
I think it&#39;s fair to say that this formula is known in all over the world and

32
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,460
you understand what it is.

33
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,860
I&#39;m not going to repeat it, the most important elements is what?

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,020
Compounding, and that 1 plus r raised to power n over there

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,770
is something that you really, really need to worry about as Anstine said,

36
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,980
he found compounding the most fascinating things.

37
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,260
Okay, so there are two basic ingredients that

38
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,650
go into valuation, which are also related to the formula very directly.

39
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,010
The first is, cash flows.

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,940
And we have talked about cash flows.

41
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,082
If you entered the space, i.e., you want to just understand risk and

42
00:02:55,082 --> 00:03:00,312
return, I would encourage you very strongly to first understand the big

43
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:05,994
picture of NPV and then understand cash flows and then come to risk and return.

44
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:08,130
I think that&#39;s a logical order.

45
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,460
Finance is very logical, very framework oriented, and there&#39;s a reason for that.

46
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,620
So cash flows have we done.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,750
Have we done everything?, no.

48
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,270
Can you learn more on your own?, yes.

49
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,640
What will help you understand the cash flows?

50
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,290
A sense of business and accounting.

51
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,010
Now we&#39;ll turn to cost of capital.

52
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,220
If you look up on the slide and you&#39;re making notes,

53
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,580
I repeat what I said often before, which is, who do cash flows belong to?

54
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,206
Cash flows belong to, or

55
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:44,592
are the responsibilities of the project manager.

56
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,451
So, if you are doing that analysis, you&#39;re pitching your project,

57
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:49,250
you&#39;re making a case for it.

58
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,575
You better be careful about how you estimate your cashflows

59
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:57,912
including all layers, a special focus on your 0 and 10.

60
00:03:57,912 --> 00:04:03,866
But the second piece to do the NPVa, as you know, is the cost of capital which

61
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:10,030
is now is taken as a number typically a round number 5%, 10 % or whatever.

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,518
Question is, who does that belong to?

63
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,570
This is a very profound point.

64
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,400
And it&#39;s related to the fact that all values is relative.

65
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,340
And who does r belong to?

66
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,020
It belongs to the marketplace.

67
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,617
And you&#39;ll see that in a very stock terms through our discussion.

68
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:32,480
We have spent a donor time in cash flows.

69
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,450
We&#39;ve also spent a donor time in bonds and stocks are debt and equity.

70
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,130
Why is that important?

71
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,440
Because those are the two main ways that will see risk emerge,

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,450
and they&#39;re also the two main ways of financing, and this will all fit together.

73
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,460
Cash flows are coming from whom?

74
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,660
Your projects, but financing will become important to figure out cost of capital

75
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,950
In a way that&#39;s really very subtle.

76
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,480
So please hang on.

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,820
I could&#39;ve done bonds and stocks way later or in the sequence of courses,

78
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,250
or if you look at a textbook, bonds and stocks could come way at the end.

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,800
But they don&#39;t simply because they&#39;re intimately tied to cost of capital,

80
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,180
especially the way it&#39;s measured.

81
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,922
What we are going to, therefore, spend time on is r now?

82
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:28,010
So, if we are talking r, why are we talking risk?

83
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,480
Why do we talk about return and risk at the same time?

84
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,020
And, please take this one takeaway.

85
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,620
It makes no sense to talk about return in isolation,

86
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,110
like the financial press talks about all the time, and

87
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,300
I think that&#39;s wrong, because returns seen in isolation make no sense.

88
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,400
Always think of risk and return as a pair, both go hand in hand.

89
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,960
So high risk, typically, high return.

90
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,040
So if you look at a high return relative to a lower return,

91
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,090
what&#39;s the first thing that you should think of?

92
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,210
Risk, they always go hand in hand and we&#39;ll see why.

93
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,570
So, why?

94
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,750
First, I think most people would agree that different projects or

95
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,970
ideas, project is a refection of an idea, some good, some not so good.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,980
Most people would agree with the statement that different projects have different

97
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,120
risks.

98
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,410
It&#39;s almost a no-brainer, everybody would say of course that&#39;s true.

99
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,140
So, selling bananas is a different kind of proposition than selling a BMW.

100
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,339
Different risks, different cash flows, and so on.

101
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,674
Most people, and this is where, I really, really do love finances,

102
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:50,521
is that it takes real stuff and makes it conceptual, not the other way around,

103
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:55,309
that you are thinking only conceptually and not really about the real world.

104
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:57,933
And that deep connection between the real world and

105
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:02,270
conceptual thinking is what I think is the value proposition of financing.

106
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,058
Most people are risk-averse I would say, almost all people are risk-averse.

107
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:13,520
And hence, when they look at risking as of different projects, what do they expect?

108
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,190
They expect to get a higher return if a project is riskier than another one.

109
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,010
Remember the first bullet point?

110
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,950
Different projects, at different risks.

111
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,210
If there are risk averts, which we are, what do we look at?

112
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,120
We look at the return, but we immediately,

113
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,490
look at risk simultaneously, usually the other way round.

114
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,810
So, for example, if risk go up, you want to be compensated for

115
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,430
it, because you are risk avert.

116
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,199
Risk avert means you don&#39;t like risk.

117
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:49,430
Given all this, what our purpose today is to understand and measure risk.

118
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,810
And our next step is to take that measure of risk.

119
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,230
So, first understand risk, take that measure of risk, and

120
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,420
then go and relate it to return.

121
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:07,660
And when you relate it to return, that return becomes the cost of capital.

122
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,250
So for the time being, if you&#39;re having trouble, think of the following scenario.

123
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,050
Think of a spreadsheet of an institution, a company, or

124
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,390
a project with no debt financing, it will help you a lot thinking through.

125
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,740
So, whose risk and return are you worried about?

126
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,480
Shareholders, because they&#39;re the only people who are financing the whole firm.

127
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,630
That may help you.

128
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,070
And when you look at textbooks, when they talk about risk and

129
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,770
return, they&#39;re mostly focused on stocks.

130
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:43,221
Having said that, be careful, bonds also do have risk.

131
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:47,840
The mortgage-backed securities, the loans, were all bonds.

132
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,220
So, it&#39;s not [LAUGH] as if risk doesn&#39;t exist in bonds, okay?

133
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,500
So, what I am going to do now is take a break, I would love for

134
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,960
you to think about what we just talked about.

135
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,850
Why the heck are we thinking about risk?

136
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,970
We&#39;re thinking about risk because every project has different risks.

137
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,420
And, how will that risk be incorporated or manifest itself?

138
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,810
In the return.

139
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,690
And risk and return always go together.

140
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,676
See you in a minute.
