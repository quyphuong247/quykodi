00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:07,450
Now for some statistics.
https://youtu.be/NArmfxPfap8
1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,830
And what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to,

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,360
it&#39;s important to understand statistics by itself.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,180
I will use finance examples and so on.

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,100
But I think it&#39;s very important to understand some fundamental statistics.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,000
Because you&#39;re going to use it outside of finance, too.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,270
And that&#39;s why I&#39;m gonna focus on statistics a little bit.

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,890
In accounting, I did some, but not too much.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,180
Because I did enough to be able to understand cash flows.

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,030
Same here, but intend to be more than accounting.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,034
Why? Because it&#39;s just that many concepts that

11
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:43,150
float over to finance, that kind of pass over.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,840
Before jumping in there, quickly.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,050
We are talking about risk because humans have a specific attitude towards it.

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,380
And that has implications for return.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,360
Our specific attitude towards risk is what?

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,120
We don&#39;t like it.

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,050
Therefore, how do we deal with that?

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,830
We like return, but we don&#39;t like risk.

19
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,630
So how do we deal with our inability to handle risk or lack of desire to?

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,000
We do not put all our eggs in one basket.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,428
We put stuff in portfolios.

22
00:01:19,428 --> 00:01:23,264
It&#39;s a very broad, powerful concept determined in the cave.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,830
So when she was going to go hunting, the guy said, hang on a second.

24
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,300
Don&#39;t put all the eggs in one basket.

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,130
And it&#39;s taken so many centuries to figure out what that means practically.

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,230
So how do we deal with it?

27
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,030
We put stuff in portfolios.

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,950
And you must have seen the resurgence, or sorry, taking off of

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,290
companies offering portfolios that are prepackaged to investors.

30
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,440
Because they know investors aren&#39;t going to pick individual stocks,

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,760
if they&#39;re smart.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,617
Why? Because they&#39;re risk adverse.

33
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:02,370
Two, if they create their own portfolios, what will happen?

34
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,880
They&#39;ll incur a lot of transaction costs.

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,440
We get to that in a second.

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,782
So what will you do?

37
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:12,266
Because you&#39;re risk adverse, you&#39;ll naturally protect yourself.

38
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:15,570
And you&#39;ll diversify by holding portfolios.

39
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,901
Assuming, of course, that you have the wealth and the resources to invest.

40
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:25,843
And that&#39;s the one thing about finance that I wish could happen is that

41
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:28,942
if there was more people willing to invest,

42
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:33,310
had the ability to invest, it would help everybody.

43
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,265
And it&#39;ll also help make financial literacy very powerful and

44
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:40,040
useful to people.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,970
But the fundamental thing should appeal to you, we&#39;ll hold portfolios.

46
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,240
This simple fact will enable us to define risk.

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,130
And measure the relationship between return and risk.

48
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,800
Nothing more profound.

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,460
So before we do that, here&#39;s some statistics for you.

50
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,330
So let&#39;s get started.

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,850
The first thing that I&#39;ll talk about,

52
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,067
which is very applicable, is the notion of a distribution.

53
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:13,150
So remember, risk is not knowing the future.

54
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,690
Or avoid, in our case, about being worse off in the future.

55
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,010
So what I&#39;m going to now do is some statistical concepts.

56
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,641
And then, in the next section, a lot of applications with numbers and so on.

57
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:30,720
And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like that.

58
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,651
Okay, I&#39;m going to, Draw a distribution.

59
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:42,683
And just stare at what I&#39;ve drawn, and actually, I drew that really well.

60
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:45,830
Usually I&#39;m really clumsy, as you know, with a pen.

61
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,186
So this is a distribution of what?

62
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,648
Returns, okay?

63
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:55,245
And I&#39;m going to draw an axis here,

64
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:59,700
and this axis, what does it have?

65
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:08,325
Probability and here, returns.

66
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,780
Now important, returns, can they be negative?

67
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,890
Of course, can they be positive?

68
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,240
You would love them to be, right?

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,860
So this is called a probability distribution.

70
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,398
Now believe me, I could spend weeks on just probability distribution.

71
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:33,312
And there are classes on it.

72
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:36,480
What I&#39;m going to focus on is a particular kind of distribution.

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,840
And that is normal distribution.

74
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,300
And I will do so simply because it turns out to be very easy to work with.

75
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,710
And is assumed in most of the work in finance, and in many other fields, too.

76
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,830
Normal distribution is easy to work with.

77
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,940
But also, it&#39;s called normal because a lot of distributions will

78
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,920
converge to this in large samples.

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,120
So normal distribution is not called normal just for the heck of it, right?

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,709
So let&#39;s start off and say, what&#39;s a distribution?

81
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,570
When would you not have a distribution?

82
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,080
And we talked about that.

83
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,330
The distribution will not be needed or

84
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,170
will be just one point if the asset is risk free.

85
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,775
Meaning, if you have a Treasury bill,

86
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:29,070
where you expect to get 10% if you hold it to maturity.

87
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,037
And you do hold it to maturity, you&#39;re going to get 10%.

88
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:36,880
Because you assume the government will always pay up, right?

89
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,680
That&#39;s the assumption.

90
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,220
Here, the distribution has characteristics.

91
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,690
This, we&#39;ll see, is called mean, or average.

92
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,530
And then, you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s spread out on both sides.

93
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,060
The first important element about this is, can this be possible?

94
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,310
So suppose this mean return is 3%.

95
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,654
And you could get returns on this side, including negative ones.

96
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:12,290
And returns, positive.

97
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,920
So what does a nominal distribution mean?

98
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,810
Very quickly, that if I folded this curve.

99
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,220
And folded the screen right over that straight line, sorry, not a curve.

100
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,045
How many lines would you see, how many curves?

101
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:26,300
You&#39;ll see one, it&#39;s symmetric.

102
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,910
So you must have seen this in statistics, that when you calculate

103
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,080
the average return, there are three possible averages of return, right?

104
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,790
I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m being geeky a little bit.

105
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,520
One is called average, mean.

106
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,570
The other&#39;s called median.

107
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,010
The third is called mode.

108
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,280
So what is median?

109
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,220
Where 50% lie on each side.

110
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,024
What is average?

111
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:49,100
We&#39;ll do it in a second.

112
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,980
And what is mode?

113
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,810
Which we will talk about, the most likely, right, where it&#39;s up.

114
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,680
All three are the same for a normal distribution.

115
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,351
So they are also called expected return, what do you expect to get?

116
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:02,986
Why?

117
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:05,620
Because there&#39;s a whole possible set of thing you can get.

118
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,200
So when expected return is the mean return, also happens to be median and

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,060
mode for normal distribution.

120
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,900
So you don&#39;t have to worry about three different number.

121
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:18,730
The second thing we&#39;ll worry about is, because we are risk reverse,

122
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,300
which side of this distribution do we like?

123
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,100
We like this.

124
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,640
But we don&#39;t like this side of the distribution because we are risk adverse.

125
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,560
So what will we capture?

126
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:37,630
We&#39;ll capture something called variance, Which tells you the spread.

127
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,860
And the square root of that is called standard deviation.

128
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,300
Many times we&#39;ll focus on standard deviation.

129
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,772
Because as you&#39;ll see, the unit of standard deviation and

130
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:50,027
returns is the same.

131
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:51,537
Because they are in the same units.

132
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,795
So imagine this was not returns, but rainfall.

133
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:58,107
So rainfall variance is in square terms, and

134
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:01,680
it just is not comparable to the level.

135
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,580
So we&#39;ll get to that.

136
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,800
One last point about distributions, probability.

137
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,790
So this is the height, is the probability.

138
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,654
The good news is when you add up all the probabilities, what do you get?

139
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:19,620
One, you cannot get more than one.

140
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,090
And if you have less than one, and

141
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,470
you have a distribution you&#39;re dealing with, it is problematic.

142
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,110
Because it&#39;s not covering all possibilities.

143
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,610
So this is the first thing I wanted to introduce, is distribution.

144
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,620
Please, go to the website in between these little snippets.

145
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,380
And here I&#39;m going on little pieces at at time.

146
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,680
And try to kind of think about non-financial applications.

147
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,070
And distributions are applicable to everything.

148
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,920
And the beauty of distributions is that, if they&#39;re normal,

149
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,810
you only need to know two things about them, the mean and the standard deviation.

150
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,250
And you will notice, and if you read and the purpose is not to do this.

151
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,740
That&#39;s not the purpose of this class.

152
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,770
But you&#39;ll see things like mean plus/minus one standard deviation will

153
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,470
cover 60-plus% of the curve.

154
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,810
And plus/minus two, plus/minus three pretty much covers all possibilities.

155
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,307
So things like that make a normal institution very easy to play with.

156
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:24,359
And I&#39;ll tell you later what else is very cool about it.

157
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:26,240
But right now I&#39;m not going to do examples.

158
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,440
I want to just make you just focus on the concept.

159
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,140
To me, if you don&#39;t know the concept, examples don&#39;t mean much.

160
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,176
See you in a bit.
