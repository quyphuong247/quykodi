00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:06,290
Welcome back.
https://youtu.be/8AWiQeCSkHI
1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,380
Quickly capture the main elements of what we are trying to do,

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,570
because to me context is very important.

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,570
It&#39;s very easy to get caught up in statistics which we&#39;ll do.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,000
But before we do that, I always like to emphasize why.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,380
I hope I made you understand why you need accounting.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,470
I hope I&#39;ll motivate you to do statistics and more of it, but for a reason.

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,780
And that&#39;s makes learning more fun, right?

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,930
So what did we do?

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,780
We said we now are going to worry about risk because, not in isolation.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,870
In this course with a very specific reason, and

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,090
that is to figure out the cost of capital.

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,720
We assume for the time being that there&#39;s only equity financing and

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,380
of course change that.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,330
But by the way that&#39;s not a very drastic assumption first because the rest

15
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,940
becomes mechanical, so conceptually challenging if there&#39;s debt that is.

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,210
But also that equity and

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,680
financing and estimation of cost of equity if you can figure out,

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,530
then that&#39;s be a good return on asset, but that itself is very challenging.

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,664
So let&#39;s understand that piece, how to figure out return on equity.

20
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:21,276
Okay, so what are the issues, so you got a cash flow your in forest, you have

21
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:26,170
estimated the cash flow, you go to Amazon because your investor will go there.

22
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,990
So that first step is, when you think about risk and return your always thinking

23
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:37,530
of the context project analysis, not of your risk and return, of course you are.

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,210
But you&#39;re thinking about a comparable because all pricing is relative.

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,080
Determining the return that would compensate investors for

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,570
that risk of what?

27
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,670
The comparables risk!

28
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,230
In this case again, Amazon.

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,690
So the first is figure out the comparable, figure out risk,

30
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,940
the third is figure out the return that matches that risk.

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,900
We are all together on this right?

32
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,420
For simplicity again, emphasizing just for simplicity, and it&#39;ll help us a lot.

33
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,430
We&#39;ll assume only equity financing.

34
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,050
And I took you to the website of

35
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,850
Amazon just to make sure you understand that that&#39;s not an unrealistic assumption.

36
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,030
A lot of growth firms, a lot of technology firms have very little debt,

37
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,690
you can talk about that forever, that&#39;s a very interesting topic.

38
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,150
So now let&#39;s go to risk.

39
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,740
And risk will be a lot of statistics, but before we jump in, what is risk?

40
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,520
So let me ask you the following, go back to understanding bonds.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,100
Why is it that the treasury bill is a riskless bond?

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,390
Why is it that the treasury bill, and of course you have to understand that lingo

43
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,670
and I&#39;m assuming you do, but quickly.

44
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,950
A treasury bill is zero coupon bond issued by the government of the US.

45
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,040
So why is it riskless?

46
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,310
Because suppose I buy it today and

47
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,180
suppose I hold it til maturity and suppose the maturity is one year away.

48
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,294
And supposed I&#39;m promised $1,000.

49
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,010
Why is it riskless?

50
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,590
Because I&#39;m standing here, I suddenly pay a price for it,

51
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,050
because if I hold this maturity, I&#39;m going to get $1,000.

52
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,480
Chances of default of course some countries are defaulting,

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,750
unfortunately, or at risk of defaulting.

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,760
Even postponing your payment is a default, effectively,

55
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,110
because the time value of money.

56
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,600
But we are calling it a riskless treasury bill,

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,380
because we think you&#39;re going to get paid this for sure.

58
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,340
Okay?

59
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,960
So, what is risk?

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,700
Remember I told you risk will start in the context of equity?

61
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,460
But Iâ€™m starting at the basics, where something is riskless, so

62
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,760
that you can gradually work your way up.

63
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,980
What about an identical bond issued by an average corporation?

64
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,099
What is that bond saying?

65
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,970
Identical, 0 pays $1,000.

66
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,860
What&#39;s the difference between these two bonds?

67
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,320
Both of them say they&#39;ll promise 1,000.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,140
Both of them, you&#39;re standing one year away.

69
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,540
Assume for the time being both of them has no coupons.

70
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,500
The zero coupon bonds are issued mostly by treasuries or governments.

71
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,250
The difference is that one could end up defaulting.

72
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,050
And if there is default, what will happen?

73
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,800
There is risk.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,020
So what is risk?

75
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,560
Risk is all about the future and

76
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,140
all about not getting paid what you thought you would get paid.

77
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,470
That&#39;s the notion of risk.

78
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,030
In this case, there is no ups side and

79
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,120
that&#39;s why I like this example too, what do I mean by that?

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,337
If times are good, will the government or the corporations suddenly pay you a more?

81
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:15,187
No, they will still pay you thousand, however,

82
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:18,129
if times are bad, what would happen?

83
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:22,044
The government bond will still pay you 1,000 and

84
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:25,790
the corporate bond is likely to pay you less.

85
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:32,980
So the question becomes, really important question, which one will you pay more for?

86
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,060
To answer that question, what do I have to assume?

87
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,170
What are you?

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,790
Risk adverse, risk neutral, what?

89
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,650
I&#39;ll assume you are risk adverse.

90
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,890
So what don&#39;t you like about the second bond?

91
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,630
The fact that it would actually pay you less than 1,000.

92
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,050
And we don&#39;t like losses, we like gains, right?

93
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,890
There&#39;s not compensating gain here, so which one will have a lower price?

94
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,740
You got to figure it out for yourself.

95
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,650
Which one will have a higher price,

96
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,960
the one that&#39;s more risky will have a lower price.

97
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,490
Because you value it lower, because of chances of default.

98
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,830
What&#39;s the difference between this and a stock, before we jump into stuff?

99
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:26,370
The difference between this corporate bond and a stock, is stock can lose money.

100
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,540
Of course you can.

101
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,990
I mean hey, in a day you could lose a lot of money.

102
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,510
But first thing you also happen, it could make a lot of money upside.

103
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,720
So that is, what this 1,000 bucks is.

104
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,500
This could be thought of, on average you&#39;ll get 1,000.

105
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,270
But there could be a upside, or a downside for a stock.

106
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,730
Let&#39;s keep talking about this for a second.

107
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:57,280
So if there&#39;s upside and downside, what are the sources of this risk?

108
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,070
So, capture it again.

109
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,130
Risk is not getting what you were promised.

110
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,110
In the case of a bond, it&#39;s all risk, less you&#39;ll never get more.

111
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,710
Think more broadly.

112
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,830
Suppose it&#39;s a stock.

113
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,670
You could get less ore more than you&#39;re expecting.

114
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,650
What are the sources of this risk?

115
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,250
What is going on?

116
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,640
And this where things become interesting.

117
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,230
There are typically two broad types of risk.

118
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,775
One is called economy-wide/macro/systematic,

119
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:32,300
non-diversifiable.

120
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,000
I&#39;m throwing that name out there, but not written it, because you&#39;ll see why I

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,120
called it that, and the second is, specific, meaning, it&#39;s idiosyncratic,

122
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,530
it&#39;s unique, it&#39;s related only to the thing that you&#39;re thinking of.

123
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,950
So, let&#39;s go back to Amazon.

124
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,240
Can you think of a market-wide risk that&#39;s built into Amazon?

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,490
Why am I thinking of Amazon?

126
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,830
Because I want to start a company similar to Amazon, so

127
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,690
I want to figure out what types of risks it faces.

128
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:09,150
So what is the market-wide macro risk you can think of?

129
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,725
Well you can think of what&#39;s happening to the whole GNP, what

130
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:17,124
happens to the economy, if the economy goes up what do you expect to happen,

131
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:21,424
people will buy more, when the economy goes down, people will buy less.

132
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:24,731
Chances are Amazon&#39;s stock prices will go up and

133
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:27,400
down based on how the economy is doing.

134
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,080
But what is specific then?

135
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,930
And this is very, very important.

136
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,250
Especially important because of the way we deal with risk, and

137
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,130
what are we assuming throughout?

138
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,190
That we don&#39;t like risk.

139
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,090
We are hypocritical.

140
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,280
We actually like the upside.

141
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
But we don&#39;t like the downside.

142
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,430
And you see that in life all the time.

143
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,040
Everybody likes things going up.

144
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,080
And they don&#39;t call it risky, of course it&#39;s jumping around, but it&#39;s going up.

145
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,580
As soon as things start going down, we think it&#39;s risky, right?

146
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,420
Because we are risk averse.

147
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,354
So Amazon broad risk easy, market, GNP.

148
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:07,750
What is specific risk?

149
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:16,910
Oddly enough, Jeff Bezos, who started the company is a specific risk.

150
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,820
Right?

151
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,800
I mean so he is the CEO, he is the founder.

152
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,350
He is a specific risk, why?

153
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,030
Because he is very peculiar to Amazon.

154
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,790
Please remember that.

155
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,995
Other types of specific risks could also be there,

156
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:36,400
right which are only peculiar to that firm.

157
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:43,140
So for example, giving you a broader sense of oil in one of my examples.

158
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,980
Oil became and is one of the major issues of the future is.

159
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,550
We&#39;re just exhausting the resources that are not renewable.

160
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,790
So what oil was.

161
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,110
Oil probably was a specific risk at some point.

162
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,950
For some companies that used oil.

163
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,933
But with transportation taking off, and with the boom

164
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:15,190
in railroads and cars, oil started becoming an economy wide factor.

165
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,990
So the reason I&#39;m raising this is, this is all art.

166
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,170
Nobody knows what is for sure, systematic risk or specific risk.

167
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,770
It&#39;s a way of thinking.

168
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,970
And we&#39;ll throw statistics in and you&#39;ll see how beautiful it all fits together.

169
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,420
So hang in there, think again.

170
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,980
I&#39;m thinking of Amazon,

171
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,700
because it&#39;s my comparable, because I want my cost of capital through Amazon,

172
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,640
because that&#39;s what investors will use to think about rain forest.

173
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,480
And when I think of Amazon&#39;s rate of return, it&#39;ll be determined by risk.

174
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,960
And there are two types of risks that you always need to worry about.

175
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,460
Broad, economy-wide risks and risks specific to your project.

176
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,720
See you in a bit.
