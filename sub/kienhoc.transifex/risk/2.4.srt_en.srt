00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:09,390
So now, remember we have talked about mean, standard deviation,
https://youtu.be/S3HGUo-lDN0
1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,090
covariance, correlation.

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,404
Turns out that the most used thing we&#39;ll do in risk and return is the next concept,

3
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:24,289
which we also have seen before which is, regression.

4
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:30,540
And, regression also must understand relationships, but in a different way.

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,823
So what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to write out the following equation.

6
00:00:34,823 --> 00:00:40,478
R1i = Alpha i + Beta R

7
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:44,951
2 i + Epsilon i.

8
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:48,415
First thing you have to notice straight away is that I&#39;m just seeing

9
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,010
the regression between what?

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,536
Security 1 and security 2.

11
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:55,040
And I&#39;m not going to worry about this here.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,000
We worry about it in the real world.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,575
I focus on this variable because this is the measure of relationships

14
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:06,913
that we are interested in which is also called slope.

15
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:09,480
And here again I&#39;m just talking about security 1 and 2.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,761
You&#39;ll see later that it may not make much sense to see the relationship

17
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:19,427
between security one and two in the large portfolio context but

18
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:22,787
between one and the whole portfolio return.

19
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:26,670
But here let&#39;s get mechanically going and calculate this number.

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,042
So what will Beta 1,2 at mean?

21
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:34,630
Let me just first calculate.

22
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,520
Then we&#39;ll go ahead and do this.

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,217
What will the numerator be?

24
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:46,160
Remember the numerator has to be Sigma 1,2 at covariants.

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,178
But we now standardize, it&#39;s likely different.

26
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:56,128
And the denominator here turns out to be Sigma 2 squared.

27
00:01:56,128 --> 00:02:00,415
And the way to remember it, and though I don&#39;t like remembering things,

28
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:04,013
is that it&#39;s the variance of the right-hand side variable,

29
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:08,668
called the infinite variable that is in the denominator that we are scaling by.

30
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:13,514
And the good news is that whether you have left hand side square or

31
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:19,096
right hand side square, they are percentages right, and returns okay.

32
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:27,795
This will work out to be 5.81 divided by 2.90.

33
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:33,420
I think 2.90 was the variance of the second security, right?

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,574
So, the answer turns out to be 2.00.

35
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:42,367
So now, let me just pause for a second, have some fun,

36
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:47,336
ask some questions, make your tape, maybe not answer the questions.

37
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:49,537
But if I can&#39;t, that&#39;s my problem.

38
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,497
I ask a question in class, too.

39
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:54,027
And I&#39;m nuts, I mean, I can&#39;t wait.

40
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:55,399
And so I answer it.

41
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,417
I&#39;m extremely patient here.

42
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:59,890
I&#39;m not very patient face-to-face.

43
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,880
Not a good thing to do, but anyway.

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,120
So what does two mean?

45
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,088
Two means that if return two, in our case if it&#39;s Xerox

46
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:15,314
changes by 1%, how much does IBM change by?

47
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:17,539
Twice as much.

48
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:20,378
That&#39;s just a function of the statistics.

49
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:22,614
The first I should ask you is,

50
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:27,188
suppose I asked you what is the correlation between the two.

51
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:27,940
Do you know it?

52
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,756
The answer is 1.

53
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,257
Can correlation be two?

54
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:36,178
No, correlation can only be between -1 and +1.

55
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:40,992
And in fact, I purposely chose the highest possible one, +1.

56
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:43,481
But can Betas be different than 1?

57
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:44,265
Sure.

58
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:48,832
The sine is still positive as it should be because it&#39;s dependent on

59
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:52,930
the numerator which is 5.81, positive for both cases.

60
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,830
But how you scale it matters and changes the definition.

61
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,410
So here you&#39;re asking a very interesting question.

62
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,779
What are the percentage change in 1 if 2 changes by 1%?

63
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,550
In correlation, what are you asking?

64
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,859
What is the strength of the relationship?

65
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:11,823
Maximum, 1.

66
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:12,737
Everybody get it?

67
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:15,220
Now here&#39;s my trick question.

68
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,040
What will correlation 2, 1 be?

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,972
What would this number be?

70
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:33,059
And what would this number be?

71
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:40,300
Even without doing the calculations, tell me which one will not change.

72
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,051
The strength is measured by correlation, therefore it&#39;ll remain at 1, right?

73
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:53,073
Because you&#39;re standardizing, remember by both standard division 1 and

74
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:56,532
2, so you can flip them across it doesn&#39;t matter.

75
00:04:56,532 --> 00:05:01,628
But the numerator&#39;s fixed across the two measures.

76
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:02,590
Now go to Beta.

77
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,299
Will it matter that I&#39;ve now flipped answers?

78
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:12,427
Yes because the numerator&#39;s the same but the denominator will change.

79
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:13,700
And what will it become?

80
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,380
It&#39;ll become the variance of security 1, right?

81
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,267
So please remember that.

82
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:21,905
That number is what?

83
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,261
11.61.

84
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:28,045
So the thing to remember is that correlations do

85
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:32,589
measure certain types of aspects of the relationship and

86
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:38,187
Beta measure a different type of relationship but both are unit free.

87
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:40,388
And both can be compared to each other.

88
00:05:40,388 --> 00:05:44,101
Meaning Beta 1 is Beta between two different securities,

89
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:46,189
can be compared to other things.

90
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,326
And so can correlations.

91
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:51,989
What I&#39;m going to do now is when we take a break, take a pause.

92
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:54,539
I&#39;m going to change our mindset.

93
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,730
Do not the concepts because they never change, but the calculations and

94
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,666
the mindset will change from a hypothetical concocted set of numbers

95
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:09,451
which you&#39;ll see in your examples, too, will jump to real life.

96
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:13,438
The concepts won&#39;t change, the way we calculate stuff and

97
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:16,639
the fact that we use spreadsheets will change.

98
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,990
When we come back I&#39;ll first show you the data set.

99
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,171
Please pull it up.

100
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:24,388
Get familiar, it&#39;s called stock-data.

101
00:06:24,388 --> 00:06:26,959
It&#39;s an Excel spreadsheet.

102
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,090
I&#39;ll pull it up, show it to you.

103
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,250
And then I will go off of it.

104
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,861
And I&#39;ll talk about how you can use various statistics for

105
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:41,238
the time being, just simple ways of doing it that you can relate to.

106
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:46,563
And then we&#39;ll do some calculations and then we&#39;ll wrap up this segment of it,

107
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:50,223
which remember is risk and statistics applications.

108
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:51,740
See you in a minute.
