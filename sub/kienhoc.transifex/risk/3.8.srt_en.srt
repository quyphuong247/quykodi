00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:07,529
Welcome back.
https://youtu.be/ib9CBZbUPi8
1
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,040
A lot of fun we have been talking about diversification and

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,345
we have gone up to three assets.

3
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:20,635
Now what I&#39;m going to do is as they say on the airplanes, put on your seat belts.

4
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:23,035
I&#39;m going to ask you to put on your seat belts after three,

5
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:25,635
because I won&#39;t keep going three, four, five, six.

6
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:29,045
I&#39;ll jump straight to a simply 500.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,430
And that by the way, is not an artificial jump.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,370
It is actually very realistic.

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,310
If you are index investing, you save money.

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,070
So you might as well invest in 500 because it&#39;s already pre-packaged.

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,350
Save transaction cost, just chug along, right?

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,940
And when we talk about portfolios, and

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,850
how they matter, you&#39;ll see how cool of an answer is, where you can take the market

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,070
portfolio and the risk free asset and pretty much create any asset you want.

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,370
And people don&#39;t understand that that&#39;s the reason why markets work,

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,240
because there are multiple ways of doing what you&#39;re doing.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,426
And using real world data.

18
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:17,490
And therefore there multiple opportunities to make sure the prices are right,

19
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,620
not to say that we don&#39;t screw up, we are human, we get things wrong,

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,840
many times they are bubbles, but usually you realize them after they&#39;re burst.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,298
If you are in a bubble and you know it is well, then you are going to be very rich.

22
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,520
Diversification three assets.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,750
We talked about it.

24
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,550
Two to three was a major jump because we went from four items, to how many?

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,200
Nine.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,620
So you have three assets,

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,220
how many unique variances are in the sigma squared p, remember?

28
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,989
We&#39;re interested in the variance of the portfolio because we&#39;ll

29
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,872
always hold portfolios.

30
00:01:55,872 --> 00:02:00,380
Conceptually sigma squared p when you&#39;re calculating you put a hat on it.

31
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,130
So how many unique variances, one, two or three?

32
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,250
Three.

33
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,973
Three people in a room, three people in a team, how many unique personalities?

34
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:15,977
Three.

35
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:18,590
Good question: how many relationships?

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,700
Six.

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,340
All right?

38
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,990
So Shawn is in the room, my relationship with Shawn, Shawn with me too.

39
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,952
Somebody else walks in, him with him, him with him.

40
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:38,850
Shawn with Tom, Tom with Shawn, four.

41
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,640
Then Tom with Gotham, Gotham with Tom.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,890
Six relationships.

43
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:49,132
The difference is, that human relationships are not symmetric, but

44
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:56,240
in our world, sigma AB, is equal to sigma BA, Sigma BC is sigma CB and sigma AC.

45
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,920
So how many relationships?

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,820
Six.

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,450
What am I ignoring right now?

48
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,710
I am ignoring the fact that each one of them is attached with some kind of weight

49
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,870
and that squared.

50
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,230
Simply because of calculating variances.

51
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,477
So how many relationships?

52
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:18,062
So three six.

53
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:20,800
How many unique relationships?

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,040
Three.

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,220
By unique, I mean, if you&#39;re symmetric,

56
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,930
then you unique two of them, only one is unique.

57
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,430
AB, BA, are the same.

58
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,237
Not very important issue, but nevertheless,

59
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:37,129
you&#39;ll see it in formula&#39;s with tools in front.

60
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:40,040
So that&#39;s why I&#39;m emphasizing it.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,780
How many total factors affecting the portfolio risk?

62
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,230
Nine.

63
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,964
How did you get it?

64
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:51,443
By squaring three

65
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:55,930
squared is nine.

66
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,630
With two how many were there?

67
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,770
Four.

68
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,800
With one how many were there?

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,312
One.

70
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:02,230
One squared is one.

71
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,640
So remember that we are trying to understand this guy,

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,550
this is what we are worried about as risk-averse people.

73
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,933
Not one of them, but the portfolio.

74
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,861
Let&#39;s keep going.

75
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:20,010
Suppose now we had 500 assets.

76
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,730
And I&#39;m doing that because you have a portfolio 500 stocks,

77
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,610
also because index investing is very, very common.

78
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,041
How many total factors [LAUGH],

79
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:36,137
sorry I&#39;m laughing, SMP.

80
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:37,915
And how many in there?

81
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:39,370
500.

82
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,537
How many total factors?

83
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:44,330
Confusing, right?

84
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,480
One, one, two, four, three, nine, 500.

85
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:55,646
500 squared, Which

86
00:04:55,646 --> 00:05:02,096
is if I get it right 250000.

87
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:04,491
So two zeros squared four zeros.

88
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:06,070
5 squared 25.

89
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:12,705
So how many things are affecting the portfolio SMPs variance.

90
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:13,394
250,000.

91
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:16,104
[LAUGH].

92
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:20,289
I mean, that&#39;s mind-boggling, but you&#39;ll see from math, it&#39;s so cool.

93
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:22,300
It&#39;s not that difficult.

94
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,390
How many unique personalities in a group hug of 500?

95
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,740
500, right?

96
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,620
One, two, three, four, five, each comes with a separate variance,

97
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,485
each person comes with a personality.

98
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:42,232
How many relations?

99
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:43,660
Very simple.

100
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,721
Total is 250000- 500.

101
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:53,844
So it&#39;s 249,500.

102
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,000
Isn&#39;t that mind boggling?

103
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,560
So when you have 500 things in the tank,

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,610
the relationships will kill the personalities.

105
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,920
That&#39;s why they say in a very deep sense it&#39;s the whole community

106
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,330
of people that matters, not individuals and yet humans forget that.

107
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,495
I mean, we are so hyped up about individuals,

108
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:25,510
the elections, we put people on pedestals and destroy them

109
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,260
simply because it&#39;s impossible for one person to dominate anything.

110
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,071
Anyway, that shows are very specifically.

111
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:35,400
So how many unique relations?

112
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,990
You&#39;ll just divide that by two.

113
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,350
And in this case, you&#39;re not talking about people,

114
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,380
you&#39;re talking about securities and the relationships are symmetrics.

115
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,320
So you&#39;ll take this and divide by two.

116
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:57,450
Okay, so the bottom line is variance of S&amp;P 500 will be largely dominated by this.

117
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,880
Can you calculate it?

118
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,650
Heck, this time you didn&#39;t even have to do the simple average of 500 stocks.

119
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,980
By the way, S&amp;P 500 is not a simple average, it is a weighted average.

120
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,982
By that I mean who will get most of the weight?

121
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:14,290
I mean a lot of weight.

122
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,700
Google S&amp;P 500, Google is a big company,

123
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,305
Apple is a big company, Amazon a big company.

124
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:24,710
They&#39;ll tend to dominant the variance because it is rated average and

125
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,040
then rates will sense it should be rated average, right?

126
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,060
Because amount of value somebody is generating,

127
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,950
should have a say to do with how well the world is doing relatively speaking, right?

128
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,620
So what is the variance?

129
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,600
If you&#39;ve calculate it and I have,

130
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:53,043
It&#39;s 0.0021.

131
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:58,609
Remember, one averages were floating around

132
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:03,760
in our data around 0.011 something.

133
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,220
And then they came down to 0.006 initially.

134
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,210
And then they have come down all the way to 0.0021.

135
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,650
Remember, as you&#39;re adding more and

136
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,820
more, it&#39;s becoming much more difficult to reduce the variance.

137
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,840
Right?

138
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,540
Especially if you&#39;re picking randomly.

139
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,930
If you&#39;re not picking randomly, then it&#39;s a problem, right?

140
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,870
Because it will come down very slowly,

141
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,620
because you are focused only on one industry.

142
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,550
So, what I want to do is emphasize the bottom line, and

143
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,640
then move on to interesting stuff.

144
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,770
Implications of all this.

145
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,050
So diversification.

146
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,740
Variance of an asset, and I&#39;m going to read these out, and you agree with me or

147
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,330
not, nod your head.

148
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,780
Variance of an asset determines risk faced by you,

149
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,930
only if you hold one or very few of them.

150
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,550
You face both systematic and specific risk.

151
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,500
What do I mean by that?

152
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,790
Suppose you have only one security in your portfolio.

153
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,390
You&#39;re facing all the risk.

154
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,680
And there are two kinds of risks, systematic, market-wide, specific.

155
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,920
You&#39;re holding on the Google.

156
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,250
You&#39;re based on Google&#39;s management decisions.

157
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,230
But you&#39;re also based Google&#39;s movements with the marketplace.

158
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:22,831
Now, variance of any asset is unimportant as soon as you hold large first item.

159
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,540
Actually, large.

160
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,470
More important than large, diversified.

161
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,510
And by diversified I mean, you don&#39;t hold everything in one Industry.

162
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,520
If you are, you will be relatively underspecified.

163
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,950
And what does large mean?

164
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:46,110
Data shows that up to around 30 stocks randomly selected, the variance goes down.

165
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,240
And then suddenly it kind of flattens out.

166
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
And the reason is simply what?

167
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,770
The common factor that&#39;s common to everybody starts dominating and

168
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,040
that is measured by what?

169
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,390
What is common step measured by?

170
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,885
Neutral variances or co-variances?

171
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:05,890
Co-variance, because if the co-valance,

172
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,070
if there&#39;s no common stuff co-variances would be zip o.

173
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,690
Our correlations would be zero.

174
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:19,170
Specific risks are diversified only relations among asset&#39;s matter.

175
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,740
And an asset&#39;s contribution to a portfolio&#39;s risk is determined by,

176
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,440
not its variance, but its co-variance with everything else.

177
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,110
Again, an asset’s contribution to a portfolio’s risk is determined,

178
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,189
not by what its variance is doing, but how it’s moving with everything else.

179
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,980
In the portfolio.

180
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,100
And we&#39;ll assume people hold large portfolios, large being more than 30,

181
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,890
and well diversified assumption is strongly based

182
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,950
on behavior conformed repeatedly through scientific experiments or

183
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,420
data that people are risk averse.

184
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,020
Please take this last notion very simply.

185
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,900
If you thought of a security in isolation what&#39;s its risk?

186
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,630
Variance of Google.

187
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,670
If you think of risk of Google in a large portfolio which most people will hold

188
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,880
a large portfolio Google, not Google alone, what&#39;s the risk of Google?

189
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,350
Not its variance.

190
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,610
It&#39;s 1 of 500,

191
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,940
but its co-variances with everybody else are what&#39;s going to dominate.

192
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,330
So we&#39;ll come back to that, that notion got a Nobel prize on its own, and

193
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,980
it&#39;s reflected in a model called Capital Asset Pricing Model,

194
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,580
which is the goal Of what we are talking about today.

195
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,590
However, to get there, we had to do a lot of work.

196
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,170
And the work is, to me, so important because it&#39;s making you

197
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,940
understand how do you make investments, how diversification works.

198
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,990
The final equation is awesome, but I could have just given it to you and

199
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,290
you do plug and chug.

200
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:01,930
Which we will.

201
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,840
But it&#39;s not very useful to think about, right?

202
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,830
So thinking is far more important than the equation.

203
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,848
Equation you can Google from anywhere.

204
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:14,990
Knowledge is stuff you can&#39;t Google.

205
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,010
That&#39;s what I call knowledge.

206
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,650
Anyway, let&#39;s come back in a little bit, and do the more interesting final stuff

207
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,670
in segments which are bite sized, so that you understand what we are talking about.

208
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,460
See you soon.

209
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,960
Bye.
