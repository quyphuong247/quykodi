00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:10,720
Welcome back, we are talking about the datas I&#39;ve provided you.
https://youtu.be/wiX7R6JiPh0
1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,888
And we are now going to look at variances and standard deviations of 1 and 2.

2
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:18,520
And I&#39;ll show you the formulas.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,470
And I&#39;ll show you also the Excel way of calculating what is the thing.

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,130
They&#39;re pretty self-explanatory.

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,730
If I make a mistake, doesn&#39;t matter.

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,720
What I&#39;ll do is, the mistake is likely to be I give the long column or whatever.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,487
But remember, how many data points, 60?

8
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:38,290
How many securities we are looking at, 1 and 2?

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,010
Please do 3, 4, 5 in your time.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,288
And I will also give you, you have an assignment with rich stuff to do.

11
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:53,390
So sigma 1 square-hat, how will you calculate it?

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,560
1/N, That&#39;s the probability.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,152
You can take it out of the parenthesis because it&#39;s a fixed number.

14
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:06,708
I&#39;ve assumed all data points are equally likely, like a lot of people do.

15
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:10,306
Okay, so now what?

16
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:16,468
(R1i- R1-bar) squared.

17
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:26,805
The function that you&#39;ll use In Excel is variance, VAR.S.

18
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:33,230
And the .S and .P means, .P means population, .S means sample.

19
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,990
And because this is a sample and not the entire population,

20
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,130
I would suggest using .SN.

21
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,180
That tells me that I&#39;ve forgotten to subtract 1, and that&#39;s the difference.

22
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,920
And this subtraction is called adjustment for degrees of freedom.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,001
And I don&#39;t have the time, or it&#39;s not that important to get into it.

24
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:59,030
Because we&#39;ll use large data sets, so N and N-1 are not very different.

25
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,900
But you lose degrees of freedom when you look at your data sets.

26
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,170
So you&#39;ve calculated the mean already, and, therefore,

27
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,510
it&#39;s called loss of degrees of freedom.

28
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:17,351
And the answer here, I believe, turns out to be, 0.0127.

29
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:19,667
Okay?

30
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:26,200
And I&#39;m going to quickly say, what is the standard deviation?

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:35,662
sigma1-hat=0.1125%, okay?

32
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:36,270
Why?

33
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,957
Because I&#39;ve done the square root, blah, blah, blah.

34
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,426
Remember, returns are in percentages.

35
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:49,402
sigma2-hat squared, I hope I&#39;m not going too fast.

36
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:55,983
Summation (R2i- R2-bar) squared

37
00:02:55,983 --> 00:03:01,880
will turn out to be .0102.

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,352
And the standard deviation sigma2-hat

39
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:12,201
will turn out to be 0.1008%.

40
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:19,790
So we now have variances and standard deviations for both securities 1 and 2.

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,470
So let me ask you a trick question.

42
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,082
If you were to compare these two, And

43
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:32,658
you said, I&#39;m only going to make an investment in 1 or in 2.

44
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:35,690
We&#39;re done, we don&#39;t have worry about anything else.

45
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,710
However, also remember that we&#39;ll never do that.

46
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,762
Even if there were only two securities available, we are risk-averse.

47
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:46,050
We&#39;ll try to spread our money across them.

48
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,090
When will it not matter?

49
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,460
You&#39;ll see, when they are perfectly correlated.

50
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,700
Remember the example I did in the concocted?

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,420
If they&#39;re perfectly correlated, the diversification doesn&#39;t help.

52
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,810
Spreading money in two things that look different.

53
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,250
I mean, they&#39;re called different, but are identical in behavior, there&#39;s not much.

54
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,440
They&#39;re the same thing, okay?

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,790
So that&#39;s another important element to remember.

56
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,660
So I&#39;ve calculated sigma1-hat, sigma2-hat.

57
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,450
And what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to keep going because I know

58
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,030
I don&#39;t have to stop here.

59
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,760
Because they&#39;re already living in a world where they are covariances.

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,720
One huge caution I&#39;ll give you.

61
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,080
Don&#39;t think these are the numbers that will work always, even for

62
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,150
these two stocks.

63
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,990
Why?

64
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,455
Because I repeat that I have picked a period of five years

65
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:39,650
that may not be representative of what happens normally.

66
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,750
Especially in times where there has been lot of volatility, okay?

67
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,890
So please, remember that.

68
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,934
So for example, if you looked at data and the US stock market,

69
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:56,078
that whole data, itself, the average returns are very high.

70
00:04:56,078 --> 00:05:00,054
But if you look at stock markets in the world in general over time,

71
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:02,453
the average returns are not that high.

72
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:07,790
So many people believe that it actually is unusual circumstance.

73
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,422
The whole history of 80 years worth of data, or

74
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:12,650
90 years worth of data for the US.

75
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,745
Because when you&#39;re thinking of the stock market, when you&#39;re thinking averages,

76
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:19,840
when you&#39;re thinking variances, you&#39;re thinking long term.

77
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,890
So when you say expected value, it means something much deeper than,

78
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,950
it&#39;s just a simple average calculation based on two, three things.

79
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,450
That&#39;s the conceptual thing that you have to keep in mind.

80
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,970
You&#39;re not just calculating averages for the heck of it.

81
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,230
You&#39;re calling them the expected returns.

82
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,600
So let&#39;s keep going.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,220
And what I&#39;m going to do now is going to calculate the covariance between 1 and 2.

84
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,220
And remember, the covariance between 1 and 2 is relatively easy to do.

85
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,334
Why? Because it shows variance in

86
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,547
a different form.

87
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:57,309
Instead of 1 minus 1-bar square,

88
00:05:57,309 --> 00:06:02,037
it&#39;s 1 minus 1-bar, 2 minus 2-bar, and summing them.

89
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:04,597
So here&#39;s the how you&#39;d calculate covariance.

90
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:16,190
Which we also call, Okay, so these are just symbols, used differently.

91
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,952
We know that this covariance will be calculated

92
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:26,566
as 1/N and, again, -1, right?

93
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:30,862
Summation (R1i-

94
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:38,449
R1-bar)(R2i- R2-bar).

95
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:43,240
The function you will use is COV,

96
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,214
and with an S, okay, for sample.

97
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:51,210
You can do, this but let&#39;s do the number here.

98
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,735
It turns out to be 0.0007.

99
00:06:57,735 --> 00:07:02,070
So the only thing I can answer when I see this number is the following question.

100
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,740
What kind of relationship do securities 1 and 2 have?

101
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,839
And what will the answer be?

102
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:11,280
That they have a positive relationship.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,410
Always qualify during this 5-year time period.

104
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,050
Chances, however, are, as we&#39;ll see later, that the relationships, if you randomly

105
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,540
calculate them across two stocks across a lot of time, they&#39;ll tend to be positive.

106
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,768
And you&#39;ll see the reason for it as we go along.

107
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:31,760
I don&#39;t mean to keep it a secret.

108
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,130
I want you to kind of figure out, why is it saying that?

109
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,980
Go scratch that itch if you may, intellectual itch.

110
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,950
And try to figure out what&#39;s going on.

111
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,370
What&#39;s the problem with covariance?

112
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,020
I don&#39;t even know what to make of 0.0007, right?

113
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,950
It just doesn&#39;t make, intensity, doesn&#39;t tell you, it doesn&#39;t tell you beta,

114
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,080
it doesn&#39;t tell you correlation.

115
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,160
So let&#39;s go and calculate the correlation version of it and the beta version of it.

116
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,170
Then what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll take a pause

117
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,740
where you then go calculate different numbers for all of them.

118
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,390
Get familiar with the data, and we can then come back.

119
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:19,120
So let&#39;s calculate correlation 1 and 2.

120
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,120
And the correlation of 1 and 2 will be what?

121
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,429
sigma 1, 2 hat /,

122
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:37,610
Okay, make sense?

123
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,940
You can also write this as covariance, standard deviation,

124
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,090
standard deviation other symbols.

125
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,291
So let me ask you this, do I know this number?

126
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,124
The answer is yes,

127
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:55,650
I know this number is 0.0007.

128
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,768
Do I know the numbers in the bottom part?

129
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:05,804
sigma1-hat, sigma2-hat, I&#39;m looking here to get the right numbers.

130
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:10,457
0.1125 *, this is

131
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:16,381
multiplied by, 0.1008.

132
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:23,956
And if I&#39;m correct, the answer works out to be 0.062.

133
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:30,469
Can I interpret this in a way that is more meaningful then 0.0007?

134
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,960
The answer is yes.

135
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,480
So if I asked you, how strongly they correlated?

136
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,280
First you&#39;ll say the relationship is positive,

137
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,500
which you could have said just by covariances.

138
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,480
But then you say, not too strong positive.

139
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,260
Why?

140
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,450
Because what is the strongest positive it could be?

141
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,515
It could have gone up to +.

142
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,830
Very unlikely, but so the correlation is fine, but it&#39;s not great.

143
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,460
It&#39;s not strongly positive.

144
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,740
And I don&#39;t mean it be, it should be strongly positive or not.

145
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,220
It&#39;s not a good/bad thing.

146
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,970
It&#39;s just, how do you interpret it?

147
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,124
Quick question.

148
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:14,988
What will that be?

149
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:20,720
And you should straight up and jump and say, heck, it&#39;ll be the same as this.

150
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,170
I had planned to go step on the next one.

151
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,120
But let&#39;s take a pause here because I think the beta by itself is

152
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,090
an important thing.

153
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,140
So I will spend some time on it.

154
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,600
But here, what I will recommend you do, do 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 2-3.

155
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,042
Do all the correlations and covariances among themselves, and just practice that.

156
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,650
It&#39;s a good, it&#39;s fun, and

157
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,590
you have a lot of data to mess around with and play around with.

158
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,948
See you in a minute.
