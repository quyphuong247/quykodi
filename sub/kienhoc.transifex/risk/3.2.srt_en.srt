Welcome back.
https://youtu.be/U90hIpn-SMc
1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,371
So I ask you the following question,

2
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:16,618
if you take sigma p at and compare it with

3
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,231
remember we have two securities,

4
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:26,332
sigma a hat + sigma b hat, averaged.

5
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:31,480
I sometimes flip it around and so on.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,890
Which will be the higher one?

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,710
This side, or more importantly, we are interested in minimizing this.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,850
This will go down relative to the average.

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,020
And we see that, but imagine you&#39;re Google And Microsoft.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,590
It&#39;ll be the case that if you&#39;re combining two randomly selected securities,

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,410
it will always be the case that standard deviation of the portfolio return,

12
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,530
will be less than average of the two standard deviations.

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,670
This is called a busificaiton, I asked you a question last time,

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,950
when will this not be the case?

15
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,820
When will the two be equal, intuition, you can try all the formulas you want, and

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,050
we get that.

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,690
But, what is the intuition?

18
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,900
Intuitive answers, they have to be the same, right.

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,800
Diversification will not work if two things are identical.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,970
So, when will they be identical?

21
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,150
Essentially, even the correlation is perfectly positive.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,400
And that is very, very unlikely.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,010
So let&#39;s try to figure out,

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,620
to answer this question, let&#39;s try to figure out what is this.

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,730
Before we do that, let me ask you this.

26
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,590
What is the expected return on the portfolio?

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,053
Turns out that the expected return on the portfolio, and I&#39;m using new symbols.

28
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:08,200
Is this, so this is the beauty of expected return.

29
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,600
Averages add up, probabilities don&#39;t add up.

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,750
And the reason is very simple,

31
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,650
one is linear, averaging as a linear process, whereas variance,

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,670
whose square root of the standard deviation is a non-linear process.

33
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,020
You know by the way it&#39;s been shown that humans are very good

34
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,940
dealing with linear processes.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,660
So good that they impose that thinking on even non-linear things.

36
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,770
So things like, very chaotic things or complex things like the rainforest,

37
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,752
climate change and so on are not easily understood by the mind,

38
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:49,828
because we very capable people but we tend to think leniently for

39
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:54,341
example, both of the things that we need to worry about.

40
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,301
By the way, read a book called Think Fast,

41
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:01,248
Think Slow if you have a chance and you will get a sense of,

42
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:05,950
why is it that in spite of everything being so cool about our brains.

43
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,500
We tend to make quick decisions based on quick thinking.

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,890
But the answer&#39;s very simple, in some senses.

45
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,020
It takes a lot of effort to think deeply,

46
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,390
to learn, to have an educated view on things.

47
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,906
I&#39;m not talking about college degree.

48
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:24,003
I&#39;m talking about a thoughtful view.

49
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,690
Anyway come back.

50
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,910
So what I XB.

51
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,460
In our case we are to assume half and half.

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,550
What do we expect of return of RA?

53
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,660
So what will it be?

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,413
It is the same thing as Ra bar R expected as I said last time as

55
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:41,370
what you expect to happen.

56
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,400
And Rb 5.

57
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,190
So this is pretty straight forward.

58
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,460
Let&#39;s now see what the volatility of the portfolio will be.

59
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,660
Now for simplicity I&#39;m going to write up the equation for you but

60
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,680
it&#39;s very straight forward.

61
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,230
Think about the following.

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:05,630
In order to calculate standard deviation, you have to calculate this guy.

63
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,660
And by the way, hat is just I&#39;m carrying around as an estimate.

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,130
So when you don&#39;t have an hat, you&#39;re talking concept.

65
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,440
When you have a hat, you&#39;re talking about the estimate.

66
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,730
So let&#39;s ignore this, let&#39;s look at conceptually.

67
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,020
Look what we are looking at here.

68
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,660
We are looking at variance, and variance of what now?

69
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:33,104
We are looking at a variance of the portfolio, which is XaRa + XbRb, right.

70
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:37,390
Now stare at it, a variance,

71
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:43,900
if you remember, is a complicated animal.

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,000
It&#39;s square.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,750
You&#39;re squaring stuff.

74
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,240
So what will you do?

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
You&#39;ll have to worry about squares, but

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,740
you also will have to worry about what is the relationship between this and this.

77
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,390
Why?

78
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,170
Because when you square xa ra, xb rb.

79
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,944
You remember from high school, it&#39;ll be two squares and

80
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:08,840
two cross-products.

81
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,260
So that&#39;s what&#39;s happening.

82
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,270
And the cross-product, that&#39;s what&#39;s really interesting.

83
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,730
So let&#39;s do that in a second.

84
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,520
I&#39;m gonna put it up for you.

85
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,250
So I would take a second pause, you can pause this film and

86
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,540
write out this equation.

87
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,730
I&#39;m gonna talk it out.

88
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,630
So the variance of a portfolio which you have to calculate to calculate this

89
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,840
standard deviation is xa squared variance of a.

90
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,970
In our case xa was half.

91
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,510
xa squared was a quarter.

92
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,440
Why are we squaring?

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,000
Because variance is a square.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,320
If you didn&#39;t square and just subtracted the mean of something and

95
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,150
added them up what will you get?

96
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,220
Zippo.

97
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,200
So that&#39;s where you first calculate variance and

98
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,620
then take the standard deviation.

99
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,090
I mean square root to take the standard deviation.

100
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,510
So you get xa squared, sigma a squared.

101
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,360
This is why statistics is very important.

102
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,630
Plus xb squared sigma b squared.

103
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,640
So what is sigma a squared?

104
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,750
Variance of a which in our case Google.

105
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,050
Sigma b squared, variance of Microsoft which is what?

106
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,800
B is Microsoft.

107
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,490
And how much is x b squared?

108
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,640
it&#39;s half times half.

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,340
Squaring again happening simply because variance is a non-linear function.

110
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,470
So that&#39;s okay.

111
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:35,000
But remember what a portfolio return is in the background, and this will make sense.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,160
So remember Rp = XaRa + Xb Rb.

113
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,490
And you&#39;re kind of squaring this, so what will you also have to worry about?

114
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,740
Xa, Xb, are they all b?

115
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,763
Xb, Xa, Rb, Ra, and 2xby,

116
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:58,710
because it&#39;s happening twice.

117
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,030
So once you are going Xa Ra Xb Rb and the other way around.

118
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,885
So what is Ra Rb?

119
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,630
Co-variants.

120
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,110
So remember when you square itself, you become variants but

121
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,080
when you have two guys it&#39;s called co-variants.

122
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,460
So it&#39;s very straightforward.

123
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,560
It&#39;s from high school,

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,950
you must have learned this and kind of forgotten it by now.

125
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,650
Is that when you&#39;re squaring something with two variables in it,

126
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,810
cross products which are covariances enter.

127
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,550
And this is very cool stuff, very cool.

128
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,420
And it looks exact, it is.

129
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,940
And that&#39;s what the beauty of finance is.

130
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,640
Finance can be math or finance can be art.

131
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,950
Finance can be very intuitive.

132
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,240
Okay, so very quickly, and

133
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,780
I&#39;m going to do this til you go nuts with me and that&#39;s okay.

134
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:58,060
How many terms in the portfolio&#39;s variance, how many total terms.

135
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,970
Term number one is the first one, term number two is the second one.

136
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,730
And then there are two terms in the last one so the total there are four.

137
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,760
Why?

138
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,440
Because the two are symmetric.

139
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,260
So sigma ab is equal to sigma ba.

140
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,820
So the covariance of a with b and b with a is very similar.

141
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,140
Unlike human beings, right?

142
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,300
So Sean is sitting there, and

143
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,830
my thought about my relationship with him Is very positive.

144
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,820
But his talking about relationship with me, with the sigma p.

145
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,410
I&#39;m not very sure about, right?

146
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,160
It could be zero, it could have been negative.

147
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,500
But here, the good thing is their symmetric.

148
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,270
So, the two sigma a b simply coming because there is

149
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,170
symmetry in the relationship.

150
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,580
And both are multiplied by xaxb because the weight is very important.

151
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,510
And in our case, you can plug and chug.

152
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:02,950
If xaxb are half, xa squared is quarter, xb a quarter, xaxb is also a quarter.

153
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,520
But multiplied by 2 it becomes half.

154
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,170
Okay, simple.

155
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,380
Very straight forward.

156
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,590
We&#39;ve done each of these pieces, the complication here is that sigma squared b

157
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:20,800
the variance doesn&#39;t look any okay like an average of the two variances.

158
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,510
Right, whats messing things up?

159
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,610
Things that are messing things up which is really cool in the end

160
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,720
Is the fact that you have this covalences.

161
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,810
So let&#39;s take this covalences and rewrite it, remember what the covalence is?

162
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:45,140
Covalence ab can divided by a sigma a, sigma b and that becomes what?

163
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,320
Rho ab.

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:55,238
And this implies that you can take sigma ab and

165
00:09:55,238 --> 00:10:02,524
write it out as rho ab times sigma a sigma b.

166
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:06,680
Why am I doing this?

167
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,710
Because rhos are easier to understand.

168
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:14,490
Remember, covariances are great, but, in the end, a lot of people can rely on rho,

169
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,430
because it has plus, minus limits, it can compare, and so on.

170
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,680
So, look what I&#39;ve done.

171
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:28,070
I&#39;ve just taken and substituted sigma ab by this guy.

172
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,110
And there to equal.

173
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,290
Very simple.

174
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,890
So in question one and

175
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,600
two are just two different ways of looking at the same thing.

176
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,980
One with covariances and one with correlations.

177
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,140
A lot of people like correlations for understandable reasons.

178
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,930
I don&#39;t particularly care.

179
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,600
Why? Because the idea of relationships as

180
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,030
the area is important.

181
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,320
So very quickly, two securities.

182
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,890
How many relationships?

183
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,670
Two.

184
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,560
But they&#39;re symmetric.

185
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,560
A with B, B with A are the same.

186
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,280
In one security portfolio, how many relationships?

187
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,780
Zippo.

188
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,080
How many variances?

189
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,340
One.

190
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,200
In two how many variances?

191
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,120
Two, A and B but how many covariance?

192
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,410
Two they happen to be symmetric.

193
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,660
Okay, total how many items?

194
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,340
Four.

195
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,850
You&#39;ve gone from one singularity in a portfolio to two.

196
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,700
What has happened to the number of things you have to worry about?

197
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,830
Four, right?

198
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,770
Sigma square A, sigma square B, sigma AB, sigma BA.

199
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,915
The two are the same so there are two of those.

200
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:36,700
Let&#39;s take a pause.

201
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,030
Let&#39;s think about it.

202
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,550
Let&#39;s come back.
