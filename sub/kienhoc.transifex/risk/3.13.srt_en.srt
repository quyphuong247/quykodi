Welcome back.

1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,180
What we are going to to do is we are going to look at now,

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,550
application of what we were talking about.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,210
Trying to value rainforest.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,035
Rainforest, cashflows have been estimated, we are focused on cost of capital.

5
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:22,410
We make an assumption, no debt.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,710
Turns out, you&#39;ll see when we go to Amazon, Amazon has no debt.

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,240
We&#39;ll just assume a rainforest also has no debt.

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,670
If that&#39;s the case, then we know that return on equity, which we&#39;ll

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,100
use CAPM to estimate in a second, will also be equal to return on assets,

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,350
nothing to worry about debt and that becomes your cost of capital.

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,640
Why Amazon&#39;s return on asset becomes your cost of capital?

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,880
Let&#39;s go back to the basics.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,500
The investor is gonna compare you to Amazon before giving you the money.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,040
So what are the elements of capital?

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:06,328
Risk-free rate, plus the risk premium times beta of Amazon.

16
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:09,950
I&#39;m on Finance.yahoo.com, thanks to Sean.

17
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,233
And the first thing I would like to highlight is that look at that 10 year

18
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,101
bond, you&#39;ll see a 10 year bond right there.

19
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:25,730
And that means it&#39;s like Treasury bill bond, 10 years.

20
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,930
And that&#39;s the standard practice,

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,560
is that you are using a 10 year treasury bond to measure risk-free rate.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,490
Why 10 year?

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,070
Because you wanna use long term rather than short term because the project is

24
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,290
likely to be a long term thing, rather than say for example daily trading.

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,710
So what&#39;s the number over there?

26
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:53,234
In my case it happens to be about 1.587.

27
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:56,550
I&#39;m now going to go to third decimal.

28
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,120
So let&#39;s assume 1.58.

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,360
By the way, that number is what?

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,700
If you hold a treasury bond for ten years,

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,330
you&#39;re going to likely get an annual return of about 1.58%.

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,140
That&#39;s what it says.

33
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,570
But let&#39;s go to getting beta.

34
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:21,050
Before we go to beta, and while I do it, I&#39;ll press AMZN and go looking for it.

35
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,200
And yeah.

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,230
Before we go to beta, remember, that yesterday we were, we had gone on.

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,190
I mean, last time we had gone on Amazon and

38
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,290
seen that the zero debt assumption is not that drastically different.

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,960
The total market value is about 350 plus billion.

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,600
And the debt was around 17.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,940
So, we are okay.

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,960
I just want to be more real, right?

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,370
Now, what about the risk premium?

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,065
So the RF we know, 1.58, what is the risk premium?

45
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:54,640
We have to rely on a very reliable number.

46
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,820
And we cannot predict the future.

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,700
Luckily for the risk free rate, I can tell you the next ten year rate because it&#39;s

48
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,980
risk free if you know it today.

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,030
So well, what would we do?

50
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,180
We go to the past.

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,270
And the number that we use is around 5%.

52
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,030
I&#39;m making the judgment call.

53
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,750
Even today people are using 7% in textbooks.

54
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,210
I think that&#39;s living in la-la land, because that&#39;s not a realistic number for

55
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,260
the future.

56
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,960
So we know 1.58, we know 5, what is the only number left to calculate?

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,890
The beta of Amazon.

58
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,470
Turns out you don&#39;t need to go very far.

59
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,440
It&#39;s so popular now it&#39;s reported here at 1.68.

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,400
Now when you&#39;re watching, you&#39;re on the same page, just go to the right column.

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,522
It&#39;s listed there.

62
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:46,766
It&#39;s that powerful a measure.

63
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:51,230
However, caution, the Yahoo.Finance probably

64
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,220
requires only 24 months of data to estimate it, does it in a simple fashion.

65
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,270
Therefore, as I said earlier, try to use professional services, learn statistics,

66
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:07,970
learn to get it better, and improve on the CAPM model as the real world is doing.

67
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,327
So let&#39;s run with 1.68.

68
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:10,820
So what am I going to do?

69
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,692
5% multiplied by 1.68.

70
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:22,478
5% multiplied by 1.68, and I will add to that 1.58.

71
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:28,017
5% times 1.68 and I&#39;ll add to that 1.58 and

72
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:33,433
your answer if I&#39;m kind of done it, I&#39;ve scribbled

73
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:38,400
some numbers here, should be close to 10%.

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,640
I believe it to be something like 9.96.

75
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,230
So it turns out the textbook assumptions are making things simple.

76
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,220
Let&#39;s assume it&#39;s about 10%.

77
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,393
So what does 10% become?

78
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:54,710
10% becomes the return on assets that people will

79
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,620
expect from rainforest, assuming it&#39;s very similar to Amazon.

80
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,540
So if your IRR is greater than 10%, people will give you the money.

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,640
If your expected IRR is less, no.

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,878
But the better calculation to do is NPV.

83
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:17,240
If at 10%, the NPV of your cash flows.

84
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,650
I mean, if the present value of your cash flows is what they&#39;ll evaluate,

85
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,490
relative to.

86
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,670
What Amazon has done.

87
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,460
But the relative part is present values were happening by definition,

88
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,050
because you&#39;re going to Amazon to figure out your cost of capital.

89
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,240
I hope this was useful to you.

90
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,400
I hope we have captured cost of capital.

91
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,770
And the next big module in this in this particular project analysis

92
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,960
is what I would call wrapping things up or the first peak at valuation.

93
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,800
Because I don&#39;t want to leave you with just with figuring out cost of

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,150
capital with no cash flows.

95
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,980
I want to wrap it around, and then you can do more detailed

96
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,916
courses on financing and put it all together.

97
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,731
See you soon.

98
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:11,870
Bye.
