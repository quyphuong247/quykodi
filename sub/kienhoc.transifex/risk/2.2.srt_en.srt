00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,060
So let&#39;s start off with the first basic thing we need to understand.
https://youtu.be/ha21aiQrdj0
1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,900
And let&#39;s ask the following question, which is up there.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,660
What are the average returns of securities 1 and 2?

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,920
And as I said, I&#39;ll focus on 1 and

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,610
2 because you need just 2 to figure out everything we are doing.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,625
But you can obviously apply and I encourage you to work with all 4.

6
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,790
So security 1.

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,590
What is the average return?

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,320
How will we calculate it?

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,260
So I&#39;ll call it R1 bar.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,301
We&#39;ll calculate it as sigma BI,

11
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,186
all right, okay?

12
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:48,290
And pretty straightforward.

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,540
When you do that, what are the probabilities?

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,360
What are you doing?

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,150
So let&#39;s just bounce back to the table, and let&#39;s visually see it.

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,650
And I&#39;m going to walk through it, talk through it, and you can understand.

17
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,990
What am I doing?

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,653
I&#39;m multiplying the probabilities by the return.

19
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:07,900
So 0.1 times 5% is 0.5.

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,352
0.4 times 7 is how much?

21
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:12,461
2.8.

22
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:16,867
0.3 times 6 is 0.18.

23
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:22,290
And 0.2 times minus 2 is minus 0.04.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,590
If I&#39;m misquoting the decimals, don&#39;t worry about it.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,820
You&#39;re hopefully doing it.

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,852
And this answer works out to be 4.7%.

27
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:40,430
So all you have done is, you multiply probabilities by the amounts.

28
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,530
Important point, and I&#39;m going to emphasize it.

29
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,980
This usually has a tilde in it.

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,810
Tilde, or a curly, and

31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,870
the reason it&#39;s on it is because each i will have a different return.

32
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,940
Each state of the world will have a different return.

33
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,740
So that&#39;s why RIs change, but R1 bar does not change in the sample, right?

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,546
So RI bar.

35
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:12,466
The second number to calculate is R2 bar,

36
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,866
which is sigma p i, R i.

37
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:20,780
Of course, when I say R i here, we&#39;re talking about security 2.

38
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,427
And the answer, I think, turns out to be 3.35%.

39
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:28,840
Why is this important?

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,428
Because remember, in the distribution of things,

41
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:37,818
I&#39;m very interested in what happens on average.

42
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:43,614
It is also called expected return, in finance,

43
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:48,420
because on average, this is what you expect to happen.

44
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,860
So if, supposing Ri was IBM and r2 was Xerox, and you did this calculation,

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,180
you would say on average I would expect IBM to pay 4.7% and

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,200
Xerox to pay 3.35, under the assumption these are those returns.

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,660
And the first thing you must remember is this what the real world does,

48
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,180
and I think it&#39;s not good practice.

49
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,160
They say R1 bar is higher that R2 bar, true.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:25,067
But they also imply that IBM is giving you a better return than R2 bar,

51
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:31,480
as if that&#39;s an investment that will therefore be better.

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,235
Answer is wrong.

53
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:39,760
It&#39;s not better or worse, it is just on average compensating you for

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,392
risk if the market is functioning well, of course I am making assumptions.

55
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:49,360
So it&#39;s very rare that on average you will expect something to give a high return but

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,890
have a low risk,

57
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,100
these are kind of trading strategies people are looking for all the time.

58
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,520
And therefore, the market actually functions reasonably well.

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,320
That doesn&#39;t mean always, but reasonably well.

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,170
So in isolation, please remember the fact that 4.70 is greater

61
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,520
than 3.35 doesn&#39;t mean much, okay?

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,330
But the purpose here was to calculate these numbers based on

63
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,710
what I have just told you.

64
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,590
So let&#39;s go back and write out the two securities, and that&#39;s it.

65
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,740
Let&#39;s move on now to variances and standard deviations.

66
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,838
So again, what are the variances and standard deviations of the two?

67
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:36,070
Here what I&#39;m going to do, instead of bouncing back and forth, back and forth.

68
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,880
I&#39;ll just write out the formulas and can you please

69
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,610
take the time either with me, or take breaks, and do this?

70
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,150
So what will the formula look like?

71
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,360
So, sigma squared hat 1.

72
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,110
What does 1 stand for?

73
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,000
Security 1.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,390
What does hat stand for?

75
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,640
Estimation.

76
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,030
Sometimes s is also used for a variance as an estimator.

77
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,950
And square.

78
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,470
Why?

79
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,270
Because it&#39;s a variance.

80
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,660
So how would you do it?

81
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,430
Summation pi.

82
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,090
Quick question, who determines the probabilities?

83
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,380
Nature, you can&#39;t control them.

84
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,750
Because if you could control them, I think life would be pretty boring.

85
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,850
You know what I mean?

86
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,830
It wouldn&#39;t be interesting.

87
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,910
There would be no risk, so on and so forth.

88
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,270
So these are things that are not under your control.

89
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,000
And how would you calculate variance?

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,945
R1i.

91
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:39,100
Now I am making the symbols a little bit more complex, right?

92
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,030
So why R1i?

93
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,700
I is the state of the word.

94
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:51,230
1 is security 1 minus R1 but If I stop here, what will you get?

95
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,495
If I stop here, you will get 0.

96
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,986
But I&#39;m not going to stop here, because, I know that, so I square.

97
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:05,030
So I square, multiply by probability, sum them up.

98
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,620
So what am I doing?

99
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,953
Just raise.

100
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:15,747
I&#39;m taking these distances, multiplying by the probabilities,

101
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:18,890
but squaring them before doing that.

102
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,820
Otherwise, they&#39;ll cancel.

103
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,702
And for us, this number turns out to be 11.61.

104
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,881
Okay?

105
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,360
However, it&#39;s much better to deal with what?

106
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,420
Standard deviations, because remember they are not squared.

107
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:45,120
So returns, means and returns will become easier to understand.

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,965
So the standard deviation, the square root of this,

109
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:52,986
turns out to be 3.41, okay?

110
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,980
Now let&#39;s go to sigma 2 squared.

111
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,930
I&#39;m looking around to make sure my calculations are right.

112
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,244
What will it be, pi?

113
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:14,990
Now you have R2i, R2 bar squared, right?

114
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,860
Remember that i makes R2 change.

115
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,770
There&#39;s no i for the state of the world changing so it stays at R2 bar,

116
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,990
one number for this sample.

117
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,820
And what was these numbers?

118
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,855
I think this was 4.7 and this was 3.35.

119
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:32,570
Again, what are you doing for

120
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:38,650
a different distribution, you are figuring out what do these deviations mean.

121
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,220
And we are mostly worried, like about this side.

122
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,748
This number turns out to be 2.90 and

123
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:53,441
the standard deviation,

124
00:07:56,619 --> 00:08:00,593
Turns out to be 1.70.

125
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:06,440
And this is sigma 2 hat.

126
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,351
Let me make sure I got the numbers right.

127
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:12,432
11.61, 3.41, for one.

128
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:16,400
2.9, 1.741, so now what have we calculated?

129
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,780
We have calculated the means, and we have calculated the standard deviations.

130
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,860
What was the mean for security 1?

131
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:32,713
The mean for security 1 was average R1 bar, was 4.70%.

132
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:37,417
And R2 bar was

133
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:42,128
3.35%.

134
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:43,880
Quick question.

135
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,590
If I were investing in only one of them at each time,

136
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,170
you invested in security 1, I invested in security 1, that&#39;s it.

137
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,120
We have all the information we need.

138
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,010
However, the problem is that both of us

139
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,380
will not invest in just one of the securities.

140
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:08,000
Imagine if there were two securities available to us, we will naturally want to

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,330
diversify and spread our money around, and not put our eggs in one basket.

142
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,580
Let&#39;s take a break, because to calculate what risk means for

143
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,150
a security, within the context of a portfolio, not standalone,

144
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,660
is a totally different ball game.

145
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,718
See you soon.
