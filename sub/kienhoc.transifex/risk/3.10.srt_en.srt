Welcome back.

1
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:08,434
Here&#39;s is some data.

2
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:13,124
I&#39;m going to use it to calculate betas with the caution I just made in the end of

3
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:15,400
the previous segment.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,370
We&#39;ll do it.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,070
We&#39;ll even go to Yahoo Finance and find the betas.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,940
You see, that&#39;s how common it&#39;s become.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,530
And this is last 50, 55 years that this theory has emerged.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,920
And it&#39;s so powerful.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,300
It&#39;s very powerful framework.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,180
Measurement, there are issues.

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,370
But, heck, when are there not issues in life?

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,840
Okay, let&#39;s keep going.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,660
So you have five securities and one market portfolio, as simply 500.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,380
We calculate betas.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,080
Consider Securities 1 &amp; 2, please calculate the betas of these securities.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,320
Not the variances, the betas.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,460
How will you do that?

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,560
For simplicity, let&#39;s use the slope function.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,590
And in the slope function, you&#39;ll have to get 2 variables.

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,985
The first variable we want, security 1 and the second variable will be SnP and

21
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:18,140
then you&#39;ll do slope 1 and you do slope 2.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,728
And you&#39;ll give the data on security two and then s&amp;p 500.

23
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:28,270
Now important question.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,626
If you&#39;re calculating correlations, what function will you use?

25
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,690
This is not the important part, it&#39;s very easy.

26
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,590
Correl, C-O-R-R-E-L.

27
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,090
And you can do the correlations.

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,620
The betas and correlations are different, right?

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,600
So please keep that in mind.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,200
Use the slope function, not the correlation function.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,340
And we are trying to figure out the sensitivities, right?

32
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,010
Not the strength of the relationship.

33
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,660
Okay, you do this, and the ordering is important guys.

34
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,826
So please keep security one on the left hand side, and

35
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:05,610
S&amp;P500 on the right hand side.

36
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,399
It&#39;s also very important, conceptually, security one is unlikely to have an effect

37
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,560
on S&amp;P500, that&#39;s another beauty of finance.

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,720
It tells you what your right hand side variable is.

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,560
And you don&#39;t just blindly run regressions, and it makes sense.

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,393
It&#39;s unlikely, impossible that security one will cause S&amp;P 500.

41
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:30,140
Where there are 500 others, the opposite is true, right?

42
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,180
So you measure these.

43
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,707
If you do, the numbers will turn

44
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:40,074
out to be .79 and 0.47.

45
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:42,858
I didn&#39;t mean to do this.

46
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,246
So .79 and .47.

47
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:47,195
So what does .79 mean?

48
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:53,148
How does if the market moves by 1%, how much security one move by?

49
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:57,299
0.47 tells you that the sensitivity of slope,

50
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,651
I mean sensitivity of security two to market is less.

51
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:06,556
It&#39;s not zero, it&#39;s closer to 0.5, it&#39;s less.

52
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:12,328
Itâ€™s simply because when markets change, this security is less common risk right?

53
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:13,508
So, okay.

54
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:15,857
It&#39;s also called systematic risk.

55
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:17,750
Quick question.

56
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,460
What is the beta of the portfolio of two securities?

57
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,516
So remember, hopefully you&#39;ve created this Rp,

58
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:32,043
which is weighted average of Securities (1,2) and

59
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:35,290
you put it in a separate column.

60
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,810
Remember we&#39;re done that.

61
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,810
Calculate the slope and replace two by that Rp.

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,199
And you should be able to figure the slope three and

63
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:52,210
I think it turns out to be 0.63.

64
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,484
Now comes the really cool thing.

65
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:59,858
How is the 0.63 related to the average?

66
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:04,800
How is the 0.63 related to the average of the two betas?

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,375
Thing is, they are the same.

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,757
You see what has happened?

69
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:17,087
We have gone from variances not being important in a portfolio,

70
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:23,620
covariances being important, therefore the measure of risk of Amazon is the beta.

71
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,310
The major of risk of security one is it&#39;s beta.

72
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,480
Security two is it&#39;s beta.

73
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,836
And betas are adding up.

74
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:35,110
They&#39;re averages, they&#39;re linear, variances were not.

75
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,900
So you see how cool things have become?

76
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,168
If I asked you what is the variance of a portfolio,

77
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:41,599
of 500 things what will you have to do?

78
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,262
Boy, there&#39;s a portfolio return, or have 250,000 things to worry about.

79
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:53,460
If I ask you, what is the average of the Betas of the 500, just like means.

80
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,850
The betas add up.

81
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,439
And this will give you a hint of why a beautiful relationship between risk and

82
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,130
return exists.

83
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,010
It&#39;s because betas are linear, and variances are not.

84
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,410
And betas determine risk in a diversified portfolio and therefore,

85
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,140
betas will show up as a measurement to for figuring out returns.

86
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,360
And that equation is called capitalistic pricing model.

87
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,530
And when we come back in a minute, that&#39;s where we go.

88
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,030
See you soon.
