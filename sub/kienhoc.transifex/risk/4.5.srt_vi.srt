Welcome back, I introduced you to the one thing that will change as you change your
https://youtu.be/eB2ghRjii3I
1
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:15,451
capital structure, and that is beta equity, risk of equity, because the equity

2
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:20,200
holders are now taking on the risk of the assets and the financial risks.

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,710
Let me explain that a little bit because it&#39;s highly misunderstood.

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,785
If you know that very simple, the same balance no worries.

5
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:35,280
Very easy, right?

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,750
Because all you need to figure out is the return on the asset and

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,290
not worry about all the other stuff.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,620
Important, regardless of how you finance your return on asset,

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,750
beta asset can&#39;t change.

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:54,870
We talked about that, so beta asset, let me put this equation, a little bar on top.

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,860
Your business risk, you have no control over.

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,590
What you do have control over is whether you finance your business with debt or

13
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,970
equity, and both have advantages disadvantages.

14
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,403
More details will be later, however, here for our purposes,

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:15,909
does everybody hopefully understand that debt is a contract and equity is not?

16
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,371
So, that&#39;s why equity faces financial risk.

17
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,870
Who gets paid first?

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,220
A company&#39;s making s hundred bucks, hundred bucks,

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,770
hundred bucks every year a hundred million.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:34,560
It take on a lot of debt and promises to pay interest of $90 million.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,940
What is likely to happen?

22
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,610
First, there&#39;s likely to be default but more,

23
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,830
even before that, What&#39;s likely to happen?

24
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,740
This conceptually.

25
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,695
You should know who&#39;ll get paid first.

26
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:51,330
$90 million has to get paid first.

27
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,320
That the contractured form of debt, it&#39;s a contract.

28
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,310
Closer you get to 90 million, all of the firms cashflows go to whom?

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,450
Debt holders before equity gets to see it.

30
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,180
So who&#39;s becoming risky?

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,010
Equity holders, before debt was there you were 100 million.

32
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,170
Who&#39;s getting all the 100 million, equity holders.

33
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,930
Of course the good news is there&#39;s no chance of default you can&#39;t go

34
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,495
to the bank.

35
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:21,820
[LAUGH] Sorry you can&#39;t go to the court and sue yourse.f

36
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,050
When you never promised anything to anybody you can&#39;t sue yourself,

37
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,502
so it could be held as their money and

38
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:33,330
said: &#39;if it all goes, fine.&#39; Debt holders can sue you if you don&#39;t pay them.

39
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,110
They are not only to be paid, but they have to be paid before.

40
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,830
That part that came before makes it equity a secondary residual claimant.

41
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,060
It&#39;s the senior most, I mean sorry junior most claimant.

42
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,100
Senior being the one who gets first.

43
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,370
And therefore beta equity goes up with debt.

44
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,100
Beta asset remains the same, beta equity goes up.

45
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,020
In a world without taxes.

46
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,740
This will be true in general, but let&#39;s assume no taxes.

47
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,590
So what will be the extreme case?

48
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,530
Beta equity equal beta asset otherwise beta equity will tend to

49
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,880
be higher than beta asset, okay?

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,980
In this world beta asset will be the weighted average of what?

51
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,260
Beta equity and beta debt.

52
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,600
We have just flipped that equation to get this one.

53
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,190
Let me first discuss the basics of it.

54
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,720
Business risk is the risk that of all the firms assets inherent in its operations.

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,890
It is also the risk of the equity of all of equity firm.

56
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,640
Financial risk is the additional risk placed equity as a result of a firm&#39;s

57
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,360
decision to get a senior fixed-income security in place.

58
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,120
Fixed income, promise payment, and so on.

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,340
Payment to equity holders happens after you&#39;ve paid of the amount you owe, debt.

60
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,100
This, by the way, if you look up any textbook, is probably the most

61
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,560
famous graphical representation of what we have been talking about.

62
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,250
Before I delve into it, I will just let you Stare at it for a while.

63
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,370
I am going to take a little break.

64
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,720
Okay. And I am going to come back and

65
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,360
explain each bit which you should be able to understand already.

66
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,570
But we covered.

67
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,050
Thank you. See you in a minute.
