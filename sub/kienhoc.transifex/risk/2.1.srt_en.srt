Welcome, this segment is again, on project risk assessment.
https://youtu.be/-UmwNfJkQuc
1
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,820
We talked about risk and statistics last time, but

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,690
we focus more on the concepts, though I always try to bring in real life,

3
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,670
because I think it makes sense to do so, especially if you can.

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,344
And here, what we&#39;re going to do in the next bunch of

5
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:36,474
short videos that form a module, week or whatever.

6
00:00:36,474 --> 00:00:41,501
You&#39;re thinking about is to bring in applications and bring in data and

7
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:47,532
I&#39;ll do it in two different ways, because the first one will reinforce the concept,

8
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:52,766
the second one will expand it to real world data and we&#39;ll work with both.

9
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:55,476
I would encourage you very strongly for

10
00:00:55,476 --> 00:00:59,664
the first part to review the stuff in the review of statistics

11
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:04,590
note that I&#39;ve created which usually I don&#39;t give too many notes, but

12
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,008
it&#39;s important and the numbers I pull from there will be the ones you&#39;ll see,

13
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:15,030
then there is another resource I&#39;ve put called stock data.

14
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,556
And it&#39;s an Excel file of a lot of data, of a different kind.

15
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:24,676
Meaning, over 60 months and on 5 different stocks and this is real data,

16
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:29,318
the company names are camouflaged, but they were chosen randomly.

17
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:34,257
And to, again, show you how intimately finances tie to

18
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:38,673
applicability and to reinforce the concepts that

19
00:01:38,673 --> 00:01:43,631
we&#39;ll then build on to dig deeper into cost of capital.

20
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:48,138
So big reason to go into this, cost of capital, background,

21
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:50,490
as an interesting background.

22
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,050
Rainforest Company looks similar to Amazon.

23
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,938
Picked Amazon as a comparable.

24
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:02,184
Recognize that Amazon doesn&#39;t have much debt, so we only worry about return on

25
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:07,770
equity, but return on equity or any return for that matter, depends on it&#39;s risk.

26
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,697
Risk depends on the characteristics of the company and

27
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:16,348
we need to analyze it using statistics.

28
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:17,709
So, let&#39;s get started.

29
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:22,818
Here are the characteristics, entirely fictitious of

30
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:28,150
four companies or four returns and in an idealized world.

31
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:34,090
By that I mean, a discreet distribution made, so that if you can nail the concept.

32
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,177
So, I&#39;m gonna pause here and let you stare at this data.

33
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:42,085
I would encourage you to open up the data in your review of statistic

34
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:45,691
slide is identical in that note and work with me.

35
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:51,037
So whenever I take pauses confirm what I&#39;m doing, but I&#39;ll work hand in hand with

36
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:56,398
you to work through this dataset and the second dataset is even more complicated.

37
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:57,888
So, let&#39;s get started.

38
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,291
So, what&#39;s in this dataset?

39
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,900
Let&#39;s look at it.

40
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,144
I call it discrete,

41
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:06,982
simply because there are four possible states of the world and what are those?

42
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:12,229
Expansion, normal, recession, depression and these are when?

43
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:15,004
Obviously, in the future.

44
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:20,508
To make matters simple, if you have one table to worry about with statistics

45
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:25,410
thrown at you this way, I think it&#39;s much simpler to understand and

46
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,981
then you can go onto more diverse datasets or larger datasets.

47
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:33,813
So an expansion probability is what, 10%?

48
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:39,752
Normal 40%, recession 30%, depression 20%.

49
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:44,662
As you do the assignments, many of them will have this kind of data available too,

50
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:50,090
because it&#39;s easier to work with, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the concepts are easy.

51
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,250
It&#39;s the data is easier to work with.

52
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,440
How much do the properties add up to?

53
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,670
One.

54
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,983
Now, what is in the next four columns for

55
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:04,547
securities with corresponding returns in each state of the world?

56
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:07,550
Instead of the world, again, probabilities add up to one.

57
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,256
So just let&#39;s pick one of the securities and

58
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:13,192
the calculations I&#39;ll focus on one, and two.

59
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:18,680
So let&#39;s just jump to number four which we won&#39;t do much with, but can be.

60
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,589
You can do on your own.

61
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,471
So what is the rate for security returns and what for

62
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:28,905
security for, for security return and what do they mean?

63
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:34,437
If it&#39;s an expansionary world, the security return will be about 2.5.

64
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:38,131
In a normal world, it&#39;ll be about negative 0.5.

65
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:43,503
In recession, it will be about positive 1 and depression would be about 13%.

66
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:48,465
Now the reason I focused on it is, it is the most unusual security and

67
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:55,200
we will not talk much about it, because it is so unusual it is very tough to find.

68
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,430
So, what is unusual about it?

69
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,270
I think the new thing about it is that it pays off in bad times and

70
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,219
bad times are what risk averse people are really scared about.

71
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:10,918
So imagine, compare it to security one.

72
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,180
Security one is behaving more normally.

73
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,696
I.e., expansion 5%, normal 7%,

74
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:23,348
recession 6%, but depression -2%.

75
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:27,609
Whereas here in depression for security four, what is it?

76
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:28,704
13%.

77
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,040
It&#39;s called a counter cyclical movement.

78
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,886
It&#39;s doing well in down times and that&#39;s what you really like,

79
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:41,552
everybody likes as risk covers not very often to find in the natural world.

80
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:43,650
This is the dataset, please stare at it.

81
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,346
Now what we are going to do is come back and calculate all the important concepts

82
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:51,420
that we learned last time, and we&#39;ll apply them.

83
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,721
See you in a minute.

84
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:55,240
Short breaks, short videos.

85
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,643
Short breaks, so that we get on top of execution.

86
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:00,260
See you in a minute.
