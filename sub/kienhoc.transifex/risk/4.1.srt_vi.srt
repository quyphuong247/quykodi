Xin chào.
Những gì chúng ta sẽ nghiên cứu trong khóa học,

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,880
 đó là đánh giá rủi ro dự án, hay là cách sắp xếp mọi thứ lại với nhau.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,115
Và có một điều tôi khá thích thú về những gì chúng ta đã nghiên cứu là nó có hệ thống.

4
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:25,119
So remember, I&#39;ll walk though what we are doing again, and

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,269
bạn sẽ thấy những gì tôi muốn nói là một phần có hệ thống.

6
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:32,718
But the way I would title this last finishing content,

7
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:36,500
week, module, whatever you want to call it.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,340
Tôi sẽ gọi nó là định giá của cái nhìn đầu tiên.

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,520
Nếu bạn nhìn vào chương trình học, đây là những gì tôi dùng để gọi nó.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,090
Lý do là chúng ta muốn đưa tất cả mọi thứ lại với nhau,

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,670
và làm một ví dụ rất dài.

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,790
Tôi sẽ phá vỡ ví dụ đó thành những phần có kích thước nhỏ hơn 

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,220
để bạn làm việc với tôi dễ dàng hơn.

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,080
Và nhiều khi, các video này có thể không dùng được nữa,
nhưng tôi vẫn muốn thực hiện video này

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,060
both conceptually and practically, so that you&#39;re left with a good

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,080
sense of why the heck did we do course one, on time value of money typically.

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,430
Course two on risk assessment, and how they belong together.

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,320
So let&#39;s get started.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,740
As always, I show this equation so

20
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,400
that it grounds you in where we have been and where we are headed.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,480
So we are doing project analysis, and most projects,

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,593
we would like them to go through this exercise, if not all of them.

23
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:33,320
In server and payback, IRR, whatever,

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,540
always do an NPV analysis because it&#39;s the deepest analysis you can do.

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,754
Does not mean your answers or your numbers are right, because law of

26
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:47,670
analysis is making assumptions largely because you don&#39;t know the future.

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,070
And to me that&#39;s the critical part of finance.

28
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,820
Which is it forces you to be in decision making mode in an uncertain world.

29
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,012
So, let&#39;s get started.

30
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:01,390
So -I naught is the cash flow today.

31
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,530
And bunch of cash flows in the future.

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,230
You, in a project, would idly like this to last forever, not true.

33
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,470
For simplicity and calculations, we will make the risen infinite

34
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,850
many times because we can use c over r minus g, or simple formula.

35
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,400
But you can always use a spreadsheet instead of doing calculations, so

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,780
there is a little disconnect sometimes between the notes and the problem sets.

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,100
But some of the disconnect,

38
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,550
it is by design, because I want you to be able to use Excel.

39
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,269
And I don&#39;t want the class to become about Excel.

40
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:42,086
I think Excel has its value, but

41
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:48,177
we want to use it when its value is worth it, right?

42
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:51,723
So okay, so we&#39;ll assume N is the life of the machine and

43
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,840
allow N to be as long as possible.

44
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,640
There two basic ingredients, the first is cash flow.

45
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
Very quickly, who do they belong to?

46
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,985
They belong to the project,

47
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:07,790
they belong to the manager who&#39;s responsible for projecting it.

48
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,180
We have done them.

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,920
You should know how to get free cash flows.

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,412
You should be able to do revenues, COGS, SGMA, depreciation,

51
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:21,090
taxes, working capital, cap-ex, all of those items.

52
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,980
And you should be able to understand the importance of the whole horizon.

53
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,560
Beginning year, end year, and so on.

54
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,910
Then we have spent a lot of time in this module

55
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,010
in trying to figure out cost of capital.

56
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,820
And we did that in many layered steps,

57
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,110
including statistics, and understanding finance,

58
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,860
understanding how the world works, how stocks and bonds work.

59
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,580
And we have assumed, for the time being,

60
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,510
that the cost of capital will focus mainly on equity cost of capital.

61
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,020
We have assumed no debt for the time being.

62
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,480
The important key, however, in doing cost of capital, framework key,

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,360
setting your mind right, is the r, who does it belong to?

64
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,230
R belongs to the marketplace,

65
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,950
to the investor, to the world that&#39;s looking at you.

66
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,050
So remember we were talking about rainforests,

67
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,100
how did you evaluate rainforests?

68
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,910
You didn&#39;t do the valuation, the marketplace looks for

69
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,840
the R and the best place to go for R is the next best alternative.

70
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,080
It&#39;s also called cost of capital or opportunity cost of capital.

71
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,730
And the reason why it&#39;s called opportunity cost,

72
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,520
because if you don&#39;t invest in rainforest, you&#39;re going to invest in Amazon, but

73
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,080
you&#39;ll do that only if Amazon is a better deal for you.

74
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,920
We have spent some time on cash flows.

75
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,160
We spent some time on risk and cost of capital.

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,140
For convenience, we have assumed all equity returns.

77
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,390
So let&#39;s stare at this graph for a second.

78
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,430
On the righthand side I made DEBT = 0.

79
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,210
And on the righthand side, the only thing that remains is EQUITY.

80
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,300
So when I do cost of capital I also do return on equity.

81
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,130
So let me just write for a second.

82
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,781
Return on debt will be called Rd.

83
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:21,385
And just setting things up is 0 because DEBT = 0.

84
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:26,810
We&#39;ll call EQUITY E and the return on EQUITY we&#39;ll call Re.

85
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,100
But our goal is to first pass get a return on assets.

86
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,150
Why?

87
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,240
Because assets generate cash flow.

88
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,480
And it&#39;s the return on assets that we want.

89
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,010
We cannot see it, so we go to an alternative, the next best alternative.

90
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:50,089
We cannot observe the REAL ASSETS; once we have DEBT = 0,

91
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:54,370
we know that these two numbers have to be the same.

92
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,670
So that&#39;s the logic of what we have been doing until now.

93
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,730
Cost of capital in an all equity firm is the cost of equity or

94
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,360
the return on equity by the way I used those and we do the cost and

95
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,870
return is synonymous.

96
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,340
The return on equity is obtained by figuring out what?

97
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,100
The beta of equity and

98
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,450
all published quote unquote betas, if you see out there, unqualified.

99
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,615
They just say beta.

100
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:30,250
So remember we went Yahoo Finance and we went to Amazon and it just said beta,

101
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,950
it didn&#39;t say beta equity.

102
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:38,624
And the reason is, beta equity is very easy relatively speaking to calculate.

103
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:46,506
Because stocks trade frequently but

104
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:52,070
bonds, here we have assumed bonds are not issued by Amazon.

105
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,230
Bonds don&#39;t trade that often, trade infrequently.

106
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,090
So even if you wanted to calculate as I see later,

107
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,220
beta of debt, it&#39;s tougher to calculate given the real world.

108
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,890
So, equity betas are what are published.

109
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,010
So, if you go anywhere and see a beta, that would be beta equity.

110
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,780
Please remember, a lot of people therefore think that debt can&#39;t have a beta.

111
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,080
Not true.

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,180
There&#39;s no such thing as debt can&#39;t have a beta.

113
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,710
The only place where we say beta is zero is risk-free debt.

114
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,200
So what I&#39;m going to do is now

115
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,620
try to build a world where your project is more real.

116
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,870
Or the project analysis is more applicable.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,530
I&#39;m doing this for two reasons.

118
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,410
One, most of the world&#39;s firms have debt.

119
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,193
And therefore it&#39;s more realistic.

120
00:07:49,193 --> 00:07:55,133
However, I&#39;m also doing it for the reason that this is a nice bridge for

121
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:58,209
bringing in markets and financing.

122
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,346
So what you want is to understand all of finance,

123
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:05,280
you just don&#39;t need to understand the valuation piece.

124
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,770
You need to understand now what are the details of debt and equity?

125
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,160
What are the markets in which they exist?

126
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,860
What are the characteristics of debt and equity?

127
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,060
How do firms go raise them?

128
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,020
That&#39;s not being covered right now but this section will be a good kind of

129
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,100
this module is a good tie-in into all the financing issues.

130
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,850
So let&#39;s take a break here, and come back.

131
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:37,040
And now consider what I call a firm that has got a capital structure.

132
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,850
By capital structure, you almost automatically mean mix of debt and equity.

133
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,840
And does that mean that there are forms without any debt?

134
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,600
Of course there are.

135
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,510
But typically it means Capital structure by definition means how much debt

136
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,270
versus equity you have, or vice versa.

137
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,830
So see you in a minute.

138
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,750
Just think about it for

139
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,830
a second, same graph, all we are going to make is debt is positive.
