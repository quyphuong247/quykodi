00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:06,190
So welcome back.
https://youtu.be/ghIwooKyY4A
1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,220
I have the same slide up and I&#39;m asking you the same question.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,030
Before we leave two assets I want you to be sure about how come

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,480
there was such strong diversification.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,360
Question number one, where will you go looking?

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,998
You&#39;ll go looking for relationships.

6
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:27,860
Between 1$2 and B in this case, 1 $ 2 in this case Nb in general,

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,460
and they&#39;re similar relationship and the best place to go I think

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,050
in my book I&#39;ll go correlations because you can compare those, those standardized.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,880
And I think it&#39;s from yesterday, or last time you should have calculated that

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,100
number with me, and that number is much closer to zero than it is to one.

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,850
I think it was about .062, I have numbers from yesterday here.

12
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,880
It is very small number.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,488
That should give you a sense of what the heck is going on.

14
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:00,780
Question number 2,

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,370
that correlation is very small relatively speaking close to zero but still positive.

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,450
Why still positive?

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,230
Because the market is likely to become to the both but

18
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,890
not really strongly affecting that correlation.

19
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,730
So what is most of the diversification happening It&#39;ll happen

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,470
when there are more idiosyncratic risks and less common strength, right?

21
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,300
So if the covalence was zero, of course let&#39;s ignore negative ones for

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,490
the time being, then of course you would devise five and more.

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,100
It&#39;s pretty close to zero covalence.

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,510
Let&#39;s keep moving.

25
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,010
Let&#39;s go on to three assets.

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,550
Why am I going to three assets?

27
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,640
Because believe it or not, nobody holds only three assets.

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,500
But we are going logically, to show you how nonlinearity can be so dynamic.

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,660
So we went from one security in a portfolio, no relationship, one variance.

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,810
Two securities in a portfolio.

31
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,400
How many relationships?

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,630
Two KB?

33
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,430
BA? The same?

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,830
How many variances?

35
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,240
Two.

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,620
Suppose if three securities in the portfolio.

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,900
Let&#39;s for simplicity call them Google Walmart, Toyota.

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,700
Are there different enough, chances are yes.

39
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,610
One is automobile,

40
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,110
one is I don&#39;t know what, I really don&#39;t know what Google does.

41
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,720
And Walmart basically sells everything,

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,490
mostly through actual buildings, rather than through the Internet.

43
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,990
How would you measure the risk of each of the three stocks?

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,966
What would you call that?

45
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:41,640
Very quickly let see,

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,580
sigma 1 square, sigma 2 square, sigma 3 square and

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,595
as I said you could then go and do the standard deviation, okay?

48
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:53,520
That&#39;s just a transformation but you had to go through variances.

49
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,014
How would you measure the risk of your portfolio?

50
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,320
What is the intuition now?

51
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,810
Very simple.

52
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,550
I mean the formula is this, right?

53
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,010
We&#39;ll go measure it, what will you do?

54
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,330
You found portfolio and simply measure it.

55
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,490
I&#39;m asking a deeper question.

56
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,620
How do you measure the risk?

57
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,610
Very straightforward but what&#39;s going on?

58
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,290
In the risk of the portfolio you start worrying about what?

59
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,020
How many items?

60
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,310
Things like that.

61
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,440
So, how many securities?

62
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,350
Three.

63
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,842
How many variances?

64
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:30,120
Three. How many co-variances?

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,270
We&#39;ll hold on for that.

66
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:39,540
Let&#39;s stare at the formula.

67
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,920
This is what it will be.

68
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,400
The first item, and I&#39;d speak very slowly and

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,940
let you kind of really stare at it mostly while I&#39;m talking.

70
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,190
X is a squared sigma squared.

71
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,440
Sounds familiar?

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,860
There&#39;s a in it, X b squared sigma b squared Sounds very familiar.

73
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,210
Very similar to what we saw with two.

74
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,050
Now there is the third guy, c.

75
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:13,790
It didn&#39;t do any harm, so it&#39;s got x c squared sigma c squared.

76
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,170
While you are doing that let me write out the portfolio return, because it will

77
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:25,698
have x a, r a xb * rb + xc * rc.

78
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,440
So there are three items.

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,150
And now what are you doing when you do variance?

80
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,270
You square all of this.

81
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,150
So xs squared, sigma s squared.

82
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,050
xb squared, sigma b squared.

83
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,480
xc squared, sigma c squared.

84
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,090
Those are the variances, three.

85
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,020
How many covariances?

86
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:51,144
Six and the reason is this, you will have A with B twice,

87
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:57,310
A with C twice, B with C twice.

88
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,670
So, see what&#39;s going on.

89
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,960
Your variances are increasing linearly.

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,590
If you have only one security in your portfolio, one variance,

91
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,340
no covariance, two securities, two variance, one to two?

92
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,320
How many covariance?

93
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,420
Two, right, your down from zero to two.

94
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,530
Now there are three securities in your portfolio.

95
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,950
How many covariances?

96
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,870
Six.

97
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,300
So you see what&#39;s happening.

98
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,520
You&#39;re going very non-linearly in the covariances but linearly in the variances.

99
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,410
That&#39;s should give you a hint of what&#39;s going to happen.

100
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,970
As you increase the number of securities,

101
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,435
which one will start dominating covariances.

102
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,990
So please stare at this, stare at the second row.

103
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,290
The first three items are identical, what am I doing in the second row?

104
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,910
IÂ´m just replacing like I did, people like variances are standard deviations and

105
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,010
most people prefer correlation to covariances because their standardized.

106
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,260
So what have I done?

107
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,951
I replaced this covariance.

108
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,265
By this.

109
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,454
I&#39;ve replaced this covariance.

110
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:11,475
By this.

111
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:15,245
I&#39;ve replaced this covariance by this.

112
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:19,915
And sigma y, sigma b, sigma a, b is correlation a, b.

113
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:22,085
Sigma a, c is correlation a, c.

114
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:25,305
Sigma b, c is correlation b, c.

115
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:26,655
And by the way, this is math.

116
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:27,655
This is acolyte.

117
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:28,495
This is what&#39;s happening.

118
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,310
Okay so, again I know I got carried away but

119
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,220
the fact is, finances simply awesome.

120
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,200
So step back and ask yourself one more time, one security how many items.

121
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,770
One, one variance.

122
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,870
Two security in a portfolio how many items, four.

123
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,310
Two variances, two co-variances, three securities,

124
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,330
how many items in the portfolio?

125
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:00,180
Nine, three variances, six co-variances.

126
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,670
So, how am I going from one, four, nine?

127
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,440
Very simple, square, square one, how much?

128
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,990
One.

129
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,430
Square two, how much?

130
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,120
Four.

131
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,369
Square three, how much?

132
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,950
So that&#39;s a very straight-forward way of remembering what&#39;s happening.

133
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,360
The other thing to remember is, variances are just one at a time.

134
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,570
You add one more, you get add another way it is.

135
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,770
But covariance is dramatic.

136
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,300
Think of it as group dynamics, you have two people, one person in the room.

137
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,290
No dynamic with anybody.

138
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,760
You can talk to yourself all you want that&#39;s called variance.

139
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,270
Now Sean is sitting there.

140
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,510
So, how many variances, how many personalities, two.

141
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,190
But how many relationships, two.

142
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,780
It turns out indeed a symmetric.

143
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,570
Now, the third person walked in to a group things are complicated.

144
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,140
How many personalities, variances, three.

145
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,140
How many relationships, six, right?

146
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,860
They come in twos.

147
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,953
See you in a bit, hope you&#39;re having fun.
