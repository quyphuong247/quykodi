Welcome back.

1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,170
Let me give you some intuition for

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,860
CAPM, and let me write it out in the way actually I should write it out.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,092
But for simplicity, we&#39;ll drop the Es many times.

4
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,100
Okay, let me give you some intuition.

5
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,330
Suppose I asked you what is the beta of a treasury bill.

6
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:41,990
What would you say?

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,790
It&#39;s a risk free asset.

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,986
Treasury Bill.

9
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:54,550
Beta i = 0, so what should you expect this equation&#39;s answer to be?

10
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,600
rf, because if we substitute 0 this whole thing drops out.

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,870
Is that right?

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,920
Sure.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,390
If the beta is zero the return should be RF.

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,950
So imagine a security that somehow has a beta close to zero,

15
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,850
remember when we looked at security

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,460
correlations across securities and the market portfolio and so on.

17
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,820
You could have a situation with very low betas.

18
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,440
And their returns should be slightly higher than the risk-free.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,250
Now, let&#39;s go to the market, the next part.

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,280
Suppose you look at S&amp;P 500.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,810
In this context it&#39;s beta will be beta = 1.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,260
What should its return be?

23
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,720
Let&#39;s substitute 1, rf cancels with rf.

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,620
Expected return will be market.

25
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,910
Great, expected return on market.

26
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:54,070
So, now this is very likely, suppose you find a security whose beta is one.

27
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,410
What does capitan say?

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,360
It has to have the same return as the simple 500.

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,460
Otherwise, what do you have?

30
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,490
Arbitrage opportunities.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,830
But here&#39;s the trick question, which of the two will you hold?

32
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,460
So imagine a security with, and

33
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,058
this is very important, imagine a security that has a beta of one.

34
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:17,368
And imagine S&amp;P 500 beta of one.

35
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:22,100
You&#39;re a risk-averse person, which of these two will you hold?

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,371
S&amp;P 500.

37
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:31,445
So, if you hold expected, if you hold the one security with beta close to one,

38
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,820
what are you happening to you?

39
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,410
You&#39;re bouncing around your tutorials and one is the market but

40
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,280
the second is idiosincartic, and why would you want that?

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,187
Because expected return both securities will be the same

42
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:52,591
in a market dominated by people who are risk first.

43
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:57,150
And that is the point, and that is something you need to internalize.

44
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,830
That specific risk cannot matter in such a world.

45
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,290
And it&#39;s not algebra, it&#39;s not math, it is very simple stuff.

46
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,910
So, what I want to do is CAPM is powerful because of the following reason.

47
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,950
It&#39;s a very intuitive, simple idea, it&#39;s based on the notion of diversification.

48
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,080
Simple measure of risk, which says, if you diversify and

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,900
you hold a large portfolio, the risk of something cannot be its own risk or

50
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,669
variance, it has to be relationship with other things.

51
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,810
And it&#39;s very easy to measure.

52
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,390
Simple relationship between risk and return, linear, betas add up.

53
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,684
Beta is the only measure you need to know plus the risk-free rate, both available.

54
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:47,940
Risk-free amount tends to be very stable, doesn&#39;t jump around a lot.

55
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,050
We&#39;ll assume it&#39;s 5% and easily measurable.

56
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,840
So, why would you not want to use CAPM?

57
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,250
There&#39;s one reason you may not want to rely on any model.

58
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,470
Nothing is perfect.

59
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,130
In a world with human behavior involved,

60
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,600
I say capital is better than equals MC squared.

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,690
And the reason is humans are complex.

62
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,774
The stock market is not easy to understand, and then to put such a simple

63
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:23,270
characterization around it, better be the best model ever created.

64
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,440
Because the intuition is right, right?

65
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,780
So if people are risk averse, which they are,

66
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,430
why the heck would a specific risk matter in the pricing of things?

67
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,290
And even though the measurements are not perfect, the concept is very perfect.

68
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,170
So here&#39;s a strong caveat.

69
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,950
We will apply in this course,

70
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,660
this concept in a very simplistic way as it was supposed to have been designed.

71
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,770
But when you go to the real world, there are a lot of measurement issues.

72
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,360
They&#39;re a lot of is the market portfolio capturing everything

73
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,840
because it&#39;s simply a measure of S&amp;P 500.

74
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,660
I would encourage you very strongly to think more about maybe market portfolio or

75
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,220
more than one factor that&#39;s common to things needs to capture the variation.

76
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,040
There&#39;s a lot of work done in that field and

77
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,850
you can make your models a little bit better.

78
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,900
But, my conjecture, all models are based on the hypothesis that market-wide risks,

79
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,760
however you capture them, simplistically or a little bit more complicated,

80
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,450
will tend to be things that matter to a risk averse person.

81
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,640
And therefore, to the valuation of anything,

82
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,650
because people hold projects through equity, that and so on, and so forth.

83
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,314
Let&#39;s come back and what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll go to rainforest.

84
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:48,176
Remember, we are trying to figure out the cost of capital of rainforest and

85
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:50,290
that means going to Amazon.

86
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:56,170
When we come back, we&#39;ll go to the financial screen finish up that discussion

87
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,390
and we&#39;ll be done--for this part.

88
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,930
See you soon.
