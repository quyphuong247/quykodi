00:00:08,793 --> 00:00:13,439
Okay, so we said value doesn&#39;t change, cashflows don&#39;t change because
https://youtu.be/MmI1zB9AsNI
1
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,580
they&#39;re coming from business, return on assets don&#39;t change.

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,550
The key was to figure out return on assets won&#39;t change because if they don&#39;t change

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,660
cashflows don&#39;t change, value can&#39;t change.

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,520
And vice versa, meaning value and

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,610
return on assets are extremely closely correlated.

6
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,820
Okay.

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,960
So what does change?

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,530
It turns out that return on equity changes when you take on debt and equity.

9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,170
And who is you who&#39;s taking on debt and equity?

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,770
The firm, the owners of the firm.

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,951
So the equation that I just showed you, in a while ago,

12
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:55,206
or let&#39;s go back and you can stare at it.

13
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:58,305
This is the WACC equation, forget the WACC part for a second.

14
00:00:58,305 --> 00:00:58,840
E(Ra).

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,950
If I take this equation, and

16
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,780
recognize that Ra is not changing but Re is changing.

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,820
And we are carrying the expectation signs here.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,640
What I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve simply flipped this equation and

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,000
written the dependent variable Re with changes with financing.

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,550
So it&#39;ll be equal to this equation,

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,130
you can play around with it, this is what you are going to see.

22
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,780
So what does the question say?

23
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,640
That expected return on equity has two components.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,840
One is expected return on asset which is determined by whom?

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,690
By their assets, by the business you have.

26
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:43,710
And financing cannot change that, but it&#39;s also dependent on the second piece.

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,930
And that second piece depends cryptically on the first factor, and

28
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,440
that is your capital structure.

29
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,060
Which is, what is the ratio of debt to equity?

30
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,730
By the way, we many times will talk about ratio of debt to equity.

31
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,020
But we&#39;ll also talk about a proportion of debt in the firm.

32
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,820
Which is d over d plus e.

33
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,420
So be very careful.

34
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,130
The proportion of debt on the firm is different than

35
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,670
the proportion of debt over equity, right?

36
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,030
Okay, just keep that in mind.

37
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,090
So let&#39;s assume there is no debt.

38
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,880
What happens to the second term?

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,290
It drops out by definition.

40
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,790
Doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s on the other side.

41
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,180
If D is zero, everything multiplied to it is zero.

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,590
Therefore, what will you get?

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,170
Expected return on equity will be expected return on a asset.

44
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,340
And go back to what we did with rainforest and Amazon.

45
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,040
When we assumed no debt.

46
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,610
All we had to do is figure out expected return on equity.

47
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,520
Let&#39;s ask you, how did you do that?

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,510
What did you need to know?

49
00:02:52,610 --> 00:03:00,400
You used CAPM, CAPM and figure it out.

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,380
Now let&#39;s assume that there is debt.

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,610
And so this ratio is positive.

52
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,980
Then, the expected return on equity will be a function of this ratio,

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,550
minus this difference.

54
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,130
Okay?

55
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,840
And this is expected return on asset which is given.

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,050
You know it&#39;s fixed.

57
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,680
So I&#39;m going to kind of, for

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,200
the simplicity stake, please don&#39;t misunderstand it.

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,660
I&#39;m gonna put a bar on top, meaning this is not affected by financing.

60
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,840
Not that it&#39;s not affected by things, it&#39;s affected by the real world, but

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,600
not by your financing.

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,640
Financing is under your control but return asset is not under your control.

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,218
It&#39;s under your control in the sense that your choices of different projects but

64
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:50,120
once you choose your project Forget about it the market controls it.

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,140
What is this?

66
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,300
Cost of debt.

67
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,790
And this thing is typically positive.

68
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,530
That the return on that and you&#39;ll see why is because it&#39;s very unlikely

69
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,540
the two will be equal because there&#39;s no such thing as a firm with al debt and

70
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,800
you&#39;ll see why not.

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,490
In the real world it can not be for some reasons that we&#39;ll get there.

72
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,830
Return on equity will go up because this is remain you cannot change.

73
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,470
And this goes up debt-equtiy ratio.

74
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,460
This tends to be positive and that&#39;s the idea.

75
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,080
Is that return on equity will up with more debt financing.

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,800
So let&#39;s see why.

77
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,130
Returns are determined by betas.

78
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,720
And here&#39;s the beauty, the return and beta equation are identical to each other.

79
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,880
Return and beta equation are identical to each other.

80
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,330
So let me without expected parts write the return equation.

81
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,694
L was for the Beta, Ra

82
00:04:54,694 --> 00:05:00,280
+ D over EL.

83
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,310
Ra- Rd. Do you see a connection?

84
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,040
They&#39;re both mirror images of each other except Ra is being replaced by beta.

85
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,950
And why is it, why is it that you can replace Re by beta E,

86
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,010
Ra by beta A and so on?

87
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:22,170
And the two equations mirror each other because this is related to beta equity,

88
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,170
this is related to beta asset, and this is related to beta asset, and

89
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:31,280
this is related to beta debt,

90
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,079
which we&#39;ll get to talk about in a second, through which aggression, and that&#39;s why.

91
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,540
Sorry, got excited about all this.

92
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,780
All of these are related to each other through one equation which is the same and

93
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,380
which is linear.

94
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,880
One equation which is the same cap-end, numbers are changing, you put in equity,

95
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,470
you get Re.

96
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,050
You put in a beta you get Re.

97
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,100
And beta that you get RD but the cap in the question is same.

98
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,640
And what is it?

99
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,100
Let&#39;s write it.

100
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:12,070
R is equal to R F plus expected R n minus R f times Beta.

101
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,280
So if I put E here I will need to put E here.

102
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,130
If I put A here I&#39;ll need to put A here.

103
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,440
If I put d here I&#39;ll need to put d here.

104
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,940
And usually causality goes from risk to return, not the other way around, right?

105
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:35,090
So now look at the causation for that last equation which was return on equity.

106
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,020
Suppose there&#39;s no debt.

107
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,920
What happens to the second part?

108
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,170
Disappears.

109
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:46,400
So, equity holders will face all business risk, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen.

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,720
In this equation, there&#39;s a second component, which is called financial risk.

111
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,480
So let me kind of explain what financial risk is.

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,460
You will have no financial risk if you have no debt in your Capital structure.

113
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,410
As soon as you&#39;ve capital structure, and

114
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,740
this difference is positive, this is positive, what happens?

115
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,990
Equity holders, who are also the owners of the firm, also the managers of the firm,

116
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,340
or at least the manager behaving as if they&#39;re working in the interest of

117
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,330
the equity holders are.

118
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,120
They become riskier, why?

119
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,230
Because they&#39;re taking on both the risk and business risk they have, but

120
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,890
they&#39;re now sharing financial risk.

121
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,630
And that&#39;s what equity becomes very risky,

122
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,790
and this is really not very well understood in the world.

123
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,570
So just pause,

124
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,390
stare at this, I&#39;ll take a break, I&#39;ll come back to it before I go forward.

125
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,890
See you in a minute.
