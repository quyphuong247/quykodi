Hi I&#39;m Gautam Kaul.
https://youtu.be/QvXBDmGBIjY
1
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,840
I&#39;m at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan and happy to offer

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,470
the X series on edX on corporate finance.

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,860
&gt;&gt; Hi I&#39;m Amiyatosh Purnanandam.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,920
I&#39;m also at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan and

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,340
I&#39;ll be co-teaching this series with Gautam.

6
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:27,380
Gautam, I have a question for you.

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,340
What fascinates you most about finance?

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,380
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a great question.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,350
I guess I&#39;ve always thought there are a few things in life one cares about.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,810
The most important one is love.

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,520
And there are three or four other things, which I won&#39;t get into, but

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,530
to me finance would be a very close number two.

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,010
Because I see it everywhere maybe I&#39;m get too carried away but

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,320
I blithely think the understanding of time,

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,820
uncertainty, decision making is everywhere all the time.

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,310
And if you get the few principles of finance right, I think, and

17
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,540
I&#39;m not talking about formulas or the mechanics of it,

18
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,920
just ways of thinking, it&#39;s so powerful that it kind of stays with you and

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,310
you can almost think about any problem in life using that framing.

20
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,380
&gt;&gt; So let me follow up that, that finance is love.

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,680
I mean the last thing I think about when I think about finance is love.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,730
In fact, when I think about finance I think about money.

23
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,020
I think about these folks on Wall Street and very competitive markets.

24
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,930
&gt;&gt; Yes.

25
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,540
&gt;&gt; Everybody is out there to get you.

26
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

27
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,970
&gt;&gt; Very competitive traders and firms and markets and regulators.

28
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,560
&gt;&gt; Very true.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,220
My parallel when I think about finance.

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,130
You&#39;re right, but I see finance as democracy.

31
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,550
I see markets as access to everybody and

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,060
yes, it&#39;s true, it&#39;s about money, but I think the principles can be

33
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,970
used to use any scarce resource as the basis evaluation.

34
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,810
So for example, I think you&#39;d know Becker started this whole

35
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,600
wave of using time as the constraint and value.

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,980
So that&#39;s what appeals to me about finance is that I think it&#39;s underused.

37
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,780
Why is it only on Wall Street.

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,410
Why don&#39;t governments use finance the way it should be.

39
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,960
Why don&#39;t they have a clue about how to value stuff.

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,770
You know pull out things from thin air.

41
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,800
I wish the president of America or

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,870
our country knew finance, knew financial markets, knew how value works.

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,430
That would be so much better than sitting in the corner worry about money.

44
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,730
So that&#39;s what fascinates me.

45
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,200
I think you could value any asset, including nature,

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,880
using the same principles.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,530
So it&#39;s not the dollar that, that&#39;s just the [INAUDIBLE].

48
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,160
&gt;&gt; Year, true.

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,140
I&#39;ve always thought about, dollar is after all just accounting for what we have done.

50
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,650
So when I think about corporations, when I think about firms, and

51
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,050
I look at the balance sheet.

52
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,630
I look at the income statements.

53
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:24,710
To me these numbers are simply after the fact once we have done certain things.

54
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,560
We are keeping track of what we did.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,190
&gt;&gt; Yes.

56
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,890
&gt;&gt; Right?

57
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,130
But most fascinating thing of course, in finance and

58
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,690
in life, is how you make decisions.

59
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,600
And how do you live with implications of the decisions you make.

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,420
So let me ask you a question on that.

61
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,440
When you think about valuation,

62
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,410
something that you&#39;re going to be teaching in the first two module of this program.

63
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,685
What are the core say two or three key insights?

64
00:03:55,685 --> 00:04:01,535
It&#39;s that you would like our students to learn in the first two modules.

65
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:05,755
&gt;&gt; I think because of the framework that finance provides,

66
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:08,265
you can take that same framework to any level.

67
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:14,955
So in this series we are geared more towards people who will be working for

68
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,040
an entity.

69
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,660
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Right,

70
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,370
instead of worrying about their own investments.

71
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,290
So therefore, the two fascinating things,

72
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,460
which are common across, are the issue of time and uncertainty.

73
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,930
And the reason is, every time you make a decision, you&#39;re standing at a point but

74
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,910
it&#39;s going to affect you in the future and you don&#39;t know what the future is like.

75
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,770
That&#39;s why I make fun of accounting sometimes, it&#39;s about the past and

76
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,730
the past is gone.

77
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,260
So, the fascinating thing about finances is the study of timeline uncertainties.

78
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,320
So, the first course assumes no answer.

79
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,500
Because it&#39;s very tough I think even for people who have done finance to kind of

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,100
take all the complexity and not break it up into pieces like Legos,

81
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,110
and deal with them separately, and put them back together.

82
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,700
What we tend to do is, think about time alone which is difficult enough, and

83
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,910
kind of incorporate the notion of time value of money in multiple contexts.

84
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,620
And here the context is the firm trying to make decisions.

85
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,260
The second course will then introduce uncertainty and revisit everything.

86
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,360
So, let me ask you something.

87
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,850
So, I will make unreasonable assumptions

88
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,310
even I do this because I believe nature is not unreasonable.

89
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,450
Humanâ€™s kind of mess things up.

90
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,380
So, I&#39;m gonna assume that the markets work, everything is perfect, nobody lies,

91
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,730
nobody bad incentives.

92
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,680
The trade is very easy, there not much transaction cost so that you get what

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,850
financing all about in a pretty, beautiful world, pretty actually does exist.

94
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
So, let me ask you some question.

95
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,690
Tell me the value of this, because I know you very well, you love the fact

96
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,560
that we have a beautiful world, but then you also tell me the world is messed up.

97
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,700
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m there, in fact, I&#39;ll take it from there, that what&#39;s love without pain?

98
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,630
&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m here to provide some pain.

99
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,570
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, no,

100
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,120
no, you are here to explain why there is pain not provide the pain.

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,780
&gt;&gt; After all love is about longterm investments and

102
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,710
there are a lot of uncertainties and risks surrounding love, so I see your point.

103
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,740
But in my world, there are firms,

104
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,970
and firms are run by people.

105
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,135
People have incentives.

106
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:48,470
They might sometimes slack off.

107
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:56,090
They might sometimes hide information from others,

108
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,820
and when it comes to money just think about these what I&#39;ll call frictions.

109
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,120
We&#39;ll put some names to these frictions, we&#39;ll call them information friction or

110
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,980
we&#39;ll call them agency friction.

111
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,020
But the point is, in your world where the world works smoothly,

112
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,820
nobody lies, nobody cheats, nobody hides information.

113
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,840
That is an ideal world to translate that into a world that we live in,

114
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,040
the real world.

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,080
You have to think about both love and the pain that comes with love.

116
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,270
And to value in the asset, in fact, you have to bring them together.

117
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,900
That when you think about a positive NPV project, our bread and

118
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,920
butter in finance, we essentially are trading off that love and pain.

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,650
That is the return more than the risk that I&#39;m taking, right?

120
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,810
In corporate finance, in my world, we&#39;ll expand on that, and

121
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,170
we talk about What should you be thinking about as a corporate manager,

122
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,270
or as the CFO of the firm, when you are thinking about issues,

123
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,190
such as how much equity should I raise?

124
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,260
How should I fund my business?

125
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,640
Or, should I keep cash on my balance sheet or not?

126
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,030
Should I pay dividends or not?

127
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,740
So to connect it to your world,

128
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,470
essentially the two modules that I&#39;ll be doing after you come in is introduce

129
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:29,780
realistic real world frictions into the models that you will have taught by then.

130
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,710
And in that world, think about the flip side of your argument.

131
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,550
Or let me say it this way.

132
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,880
That you will teach how to value,

133
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,410
given the financial policy or keeping fixed the financial policy.

134
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,070
I&#39;ll flip it and say what financial policy will maximize value.

135
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,460
And in your frictionless world, in fact, there will be no role for folks like me.

136
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,990
You&#39;ll say that financial policies are not relevant for value.

137
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,690
&gt;&gt; True.

138
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,000
&gt;&gt; In your world in fact you&#39;ll say that whether the firm has more debt or equity,

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,710
whether the firm has more cash or less cash, that will not affect its value.

140
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,810
But in a friction filled world those decisions will impact your value.

141
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,292
So what I&#39;m hoping our students will get from the third and

142
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:24,430
fourth module to think about maximizing firm value in real world.

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,220
So on that note, let me come back to you with this question.

144
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,990
That when you think about the time value of money.

145
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,439
And often, we think in terms of look,

146
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:46,440
a dollar today is better than a dollar tomorrow.

147
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,080
What do you think of the philosophical underpinning of that issue?

148
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,800
&gt;&gt; I think the philosophical underpinning, which unfortunately,

149
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,970
we probably won&#39;t spend much time on in this series, is everything to me.

150
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,030
It&#39;s basically we are impatient.

151
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,650
And, it&#39;s kind of, we presume that the interest rate is positive,

152
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,500
therefore we act.

153
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,430
But we, the fact that the interest rate is positive is because of our own

154
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,180
preferences and behavior.

155
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,550
That&#39;s what I find fascinating.

156
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,340
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

157
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,610
&gt;&gt; And to me, that&#39;s a theory of interest, we both have read Fisher.

158
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,970
I think it&#39;s the most fascinating question.

159
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,620
The only unfortunate part about the series is we will not spend too much time.

160
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,917
We will presume there is an interest rate, and we won&#39;t go too much into that.

161
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:33,630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

162
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,140
&gt;&gt; To me actually I wish I could just do a course on that.

163
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,700
Or teach using theory of interest as the background.

164
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,830
But let me go back to you for a second.

165
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,170
What is the role of markets in all of this?

166
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,920
Remember, because when you asked me about love and finance and

167
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,590
I think the reason I really like finance is it&#39;s market I said democracy.

168
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,859
And when I was thinking democracy, I was thinking people.

169
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,887
When I was thinking people, I was thinking markets.

170
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:08,640
When I was thinking democracy, I was thinking worthy.

171
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,690
So the fact that you can vote and put your money where your mouth is, or

172
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,960
whatever the, is what&#39;s so powerful about markets.

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,620
And of what attracts me so much about it.

174
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,984
So how will that fit?

175
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:29,960
It plays a very important role in how we go from me to you or you to me.

176
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,700
You know what I mean?

177
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,020
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s the connector between these two modules right?

178
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,380
In fact corporate finance is nothing without markets.

179
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,855
When you you think about corporate finance, and you&#39;re thinking about

180
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:49,475
private companies or you&#39;re thinking about public traded companies.

181
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,996
The key distinction that you make from, say, household finance,

182
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:56,701
when I&#39;m thinking about my own pocketbook or my own budget, is that for

183
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:59,324
corporations there&#39;s a marketplace out there.

184
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:03,169
A stock market, a bond market, a derivative market,

185
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,185
where the pricing happens.

186
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,990
And when firms are making decision, when they&#39;re investing,

187
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,248
what they are thinking is that, well if I invest $100 today.

188
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:15,830
I raise that money.

189
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,410
&gt;From where?

190
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,865
&gt;From the markets.

191
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:23,375
So the market is giving me $100 and they&#39;re expecting some return right?

192
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:28,355
So my decision whether I should invest $100 or not fundamentally depends

193
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:33,265
on what is the expectation of return by the providers of capital to my firm?

194
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:38,427
So in corporate finance we take that as given.

195
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:41,020
Now the market gives me the hurdle rate.

196
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:47,850
Market tells me as the CFO for this kind of project you must earn 10% return.

197
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,860
And inside the firm I have to work hard

198
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,260
to beat that 10% hurdle rate to create a positive NPV project.

199
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:02,724
So if you take markets away from corporate finance, we are essentially like

200
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:09,890
directionless in a sense that we don&#39;t know what my hurdle rate will be, okay?

201
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,150
But it get&#39;s more exciting,

202
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,080
more fascinating beyond just getting the hurdle rate so

203
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,841
that we can compute positive, whether the product is positive NPV or not.

204
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:26,584
Marketplace is where we have a voice as a shareholder, as investors.

205
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:33,580
So in democracy we vote, in markets we vote with our feet.

206
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,950
If I don&#39;t like your company&#39;s policies, I don&#39;t like your share price, I sell.

207
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,900
I get out, and that&#39;s a very powerful vote.

208
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
When I sell, and

209
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,890
your stock price goes down, your cost of capital goes up, effectively.

210
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,730
Which means your hurdle rate goes up, which means the next you project that you

211
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:58,175
do you have to now think hard what you did that markets did not like.

212
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:02,565
So in a sense connecting to your thought about market being democracy.

213
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:06,165
I think it&#39;s the most powerful democracy that you can have.

214
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,415
Because you don&#39;t have to wait for

215
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:11,250
a five yearly election, election after every four years.

216
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,600
You can vote every nanosecond thanks to high frequency trading in the marketplace.

217
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,340
So that&#39;s one.

218
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,299
But the second aspect, where corporate finance and markets, get integrated

219
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:27,260
is about one of the fundamental things about finance that I love the most.

220
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,580
That finance is the field where, when I came for

221
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,570
my PhD, I thought I&#39;m going to learn to measure markets.

222
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,550
I thought I&#39;m going to learn about dividend pricing.

223
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,510
I thought I&#39;m going to learn about risk management.

224
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,946
Quickly I realized that essentially what I&#39;m

225
00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:50,502
learning is all about market for information.

226
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:52,850
All about market for information.

227
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,170
So why do the stock prices move to begin with?

228
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,488
Because you get some new information about the company,

229
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:03,890
about the macroeconomy, about the competitors.

230
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,170
There&#39;s something that is relevant for the valuation of the fund that moves.

231
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,970
If that information changes, so

232
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,210
does the stock price of that company in the marketplace.

233
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,110
So from a corporate finance perspective, from the market we get the hurdle rate.

234
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,640
And from the market we also get the information that is collectively

235
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,730
what the market is thinking about me as a firm.

236
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,680
And as a CFO it&#39;s a two-way transmitter going on.

237
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,806
CFO is releasing information that hey, I&#39;m going to do this project, this project,

238
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:35,720
and that project.

239
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,530
And the market is telling we like your this project, this, and not this.

240
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,610
So, it&#39;s this fascinating two-way interaction or feedback or

241
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,260
whatever we want to call it that lies at the core of

242
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,220
an economy that functions based on free markets and

243
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,180
based on stock prices that form based on this information and expectation.

244
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,170
&gt;&gt; No, I completely agree.

245
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:05,570
Actually The one thing I find in this series which may,

246
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,320
students may struggle with, the learners may struggle with is

247
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,250
that we have to put, and you and I have talked about this,

248
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,900
we have to put market somewhere, because they&#39;re so fundamental.

249
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,950
So I feel the same way as you feel, there will be no corporate plans for

250
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,010
the market, I will feel like undervaluation of the market.

251
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,150
Because all the pricing is coming from the marketplace.

252
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,090
And I assume what it is.

253
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,400
And I assume the markets are perfect, and worth all the time.

254
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,990
So I get with that, but that&#39;s why I think markets always come first, in some sense.

255
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,130
&gt;&gt; Let me push back on that a little bit.

256
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,530
Would you have a market without a firm?

257
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,750
&gt;&gt; No.

258
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,890
&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.

259
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,490
So, it&#39;s the chicken and egg story, right?

260
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,320
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes.

261
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,250
&gt;&gt; The reason I push back on that a little bit is because, in your world,

262
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,940
what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re &gt;&gt; Pricing for impatience

263
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:14,230
and pricing for risk on top of that.

264
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:19,300
So you&#39;ll have a time value of money, and you have risk set on that cash loans,

265
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,020
and you&#39;re going to teach our students how you do evaluations.

266
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,730
And corporations provide those securities in the marker,

267
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,590
and investors, depending on their preferences and

268
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,580
impatience are going to prize these securities.

269
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,780
But let me change the topic a little bit, and let me ask you about

270
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,220
something that we all have witnessed, in the last ten years,

271
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,160
that there have been a lot of talks about breakdown in financial markets.

272
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,010
I&#39;m thinking about Lehman Brothers failure.

273
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,820
I&#39;m thinking about mortgage crisis.

274
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:05,430
And when those breakdowns happen, what do you think would

275
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,570
be the recommendation that he&#39;ll give to folks who are doing valuation?

276
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,740
Because one of the things that I keep hearing, that hey,

277
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,700
you are in 2008, 2009,- &gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

278
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,400
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve learned all these beautiful models, capital asset pricing models.

279
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,880
But sometimes they don&#39;t work.

280
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,030
&gt;&gt; Yes.

281
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,980
&gt;&gt; What&#39;s your part on that?

282
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,530
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a great great point.

283
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,080
I think clearly the way to be set up in my world,

284
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,140
which is reflected in this particular context in the first two courses,

285
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,800
is we don&#39;t even deal with those issues.

286
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,050
So that&#39;s where I think the value of knowing the word with frictions and

287
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,920
within centers and conflicts of interest come into picture.

288
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,220
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to corner you with that notion.

289
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,750
&gt;&gt; No, no. &gt;&gt; That indeed in your world there will

290
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,440
not be a financial crisis.

291
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,550
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a perfect world.

292
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,320
&gt;&gt; Right?

293
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,770
&gt;&gt; So, in fact what would be interesting if our students see

294
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,110
that when we introduce informational frictions

295
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,660
that that perfect market sometimes might fade a little, might delay.

296
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

297
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,750
&gt;&gt; One of the things that will be our students who learn in this cities is that.

298
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,600
When you have serial informational frictions

299
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,930
then you might end up in a situation where markets might not just work.

300
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,170
&gt;&gt; No it&#39;s like as I said, I mean the market democracy also has the danger

301
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,075
of somebody hijacking it once in a while.

302
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:37,900
[LAUGH] And it&#39;s happened in our own past.

303
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,030
We are both from India.

304
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,390
It&#39;s happened in India,

305
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,800
too, where a democratically elected person basically froze the market.

306
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,170
Same thing can happen, and I think that&#39;s the beauty of finance,

307
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,520
is that it doesn&#39;t stop at assuming.

308
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,270
It didn&#39;t stop at assuming the world as a perfect place.

309
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,620
In fact I would say that in the last 40 years,

310
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,940
most of the contributions of finance have been in the areas where

311
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,790
we have begun to understand the real world much better using fundamentals.

312
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:16,790
The fundamentals were not in the first two decades of even option pricing.

313
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,680
The fundamental pricing models were there, but

314
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,660
they were also making too many perfect presumptions, as you and I know.

315
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,570
So I really think that even this CD&#39;s If we had offered it 40 years ago,

316
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,660
we would have gotten away with just doing evaluation.

317
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,120
And by the way, a lot of business schools got away with doing just that piece and

318
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,930
saying, financing is irrelevant.

319
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,880
I think the beauty of this series is both you and I have gotten together,

320
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,470
we both know finance, but we also have our special interests and specialities.

321
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,610
What I think they use, hopefully, the user will take away, or the learner

322
00:20:53,610 --> 00:21:00,510
will take away from this, is how finance also allows you to understand complexity.

323
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,310
And that&#39;s where I would say it&#39;s more economics than finance.

324
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,350
I don&#39;t wanna get.

325
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,650
The one time I get a little bit upset is when finance

326
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,050
people think there&#39;s no mother discipline.

327
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,820
The mother discipline is economics,

328
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,950
that&#39;s where information economics started, and all that.

329
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,930
So the more we have embraced economics,

330
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,520
the better off finance has been as a discipline.

331
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,610
In fact, the reason I like this course is that now folks who are working to

332
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,460
get an MBA or working at a company, they will not just see the perfect finance.

333
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,850
They will see it with its complexities.

334
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,990
And hopefully, they will then be enticed and excited to do

335
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,500
deeper finance and even PhD, I mean, that&#39;s what&#39;s fascinating to me, right?

336
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,520
That&#39;s why I&#39;d be introducing this course.

337
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,310
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you a more personal question which is on my mind, and

338
00:21:54,310 --> 00:22:02,620
it&#39;s not related to finance so much as why did you agree to perform in this format?

339
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,950
&gt;&gt; The reach that you can have by just

340
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,230
having a classroom experience is going to be much smaller

341
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,750
than the reach that you can have with this kind of format, number one.

342
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,574
And that is important to me

343
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:25,490
because going back to our course, where we were talking about frictions and

344
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,490
that create a need for understanding corporate finance.

345
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,320
And when removed frictions, value improves.

346
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,780
So, similarly, if we remove or reduce frictions in education, the way

347
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,080
folks get education, you can improve value for the society as a whole.

348
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,420
And I actually believe that because

349
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:57,640
the fundamental value to human development is education.

350
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,290
If you look at last thousands and

351
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:05,670
thousands of years of the development of mankind, the fundamental breakthrough

352
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:11,140
that have happened when as a collectively as a society, or as human beings,

353
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,380
we discover something new and we share that knowledge with everyone, right.

354
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,710
And as we become smarter as human beings our

355
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,180
ability to share those knowledge has also improved a lot, right.

356
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,940
And now I think we are at a time were

357
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,510
I don&#39;t have to go to Brazil to teach a class in Corporate Finance.

358
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,880
I don&#39;t have to go to India physically to teach a class in Corporate Finance,

359
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,700
I can do it, I can reach.

360
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,960
That audience sitting here in Ann Arbor, which to me, is a lot of power in that.

361
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,610
&gt;&gt; You say it, now you&#39;ll understand why I think finance is love, and

362
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,620
the way we are teaching it.

363
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,850
One way to think about it is that the textbook idea of a strategy

364
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:03,120
Is that market&#39;s working all the time, and you can create positive NPV.

365
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,640
I think if market&#39;s working all the time,

366
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,497
[LAUGH] finding NPV positive projects would be really difficult.

367
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:12,170
So another way to think about it is,

368
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,371
removing frictions is the way to create value, right?

369
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:20,386
And what&#39;s so nice is that this is what we are doing, too.

370
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:21,014
&gt;&gt; Right.

371
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:21,942
&gt;&gt; We are creating a market. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

372
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:25,430
&gt;&gt; Which is hopefully valuable to the learners and so on.

373
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,820
&gt;&gt; Just to build on that, this city sets the stage for

374
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,443
understanding at a deeper level, the role of regulation, for example.

375
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:43,669
Or the role of interventions by governments

376
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:48,850
across the financial markets.

377
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:55,530
And we have witnessed a lot of that in the recent years, be it from

378
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:01,330
the Federal Reserve Bank in the US, to the European Central Bank worldwide.

379
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,232
And these policies that governments take, they have implications that go

380
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:10,057
far beyond the shareholders and bondholders of the firm.

381
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:10,857
&gt;&gt; Yes, it&#39;s societal, right?

382
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:15,167
&gt;&gt; It has the implication for the entire society.

383
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:19,003
And I would say, even when we think about society,

384
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:24,192
it has implications for beyond what you think of society as of today.

385
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:25,364
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s true. &gt;&gt; It has implications for

386
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:26,383
society that will be tomorrow.

387
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:32,085
And one of the failures of democracy sometimes is that when you have democracy,

388
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:35,253
the future generation does not have a vote.

389
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:36,100
&gt;&gt; They&#39;re not even here.

390
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,973
&gt;&gt; They&#39;re not even here.

391
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:44,263
People who are not yet born, they can&#39;t vote on a policy that might have,

392
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:48,460
perhaps, large impact on global warming.

393
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,770
Who is going to speak for them?

394
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,049
Finance to me,

395
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:58,963
comes across as a fundamental tool that has some hope to settle those issues.

396
00:25:58,963 --> 00:25:59,546
&gt;&gt; I completely agree.

397
00:25:59,546 --> 00:26:03,125
&gt;&gt; Because in finance, we deal with issues about making decisions today for-

398
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,017
&gt;&gt; A very long period.

399
00:26:04,017 --> 00:26:06,127
&gt;&gt; Something tomorrow, for a long time period.

400
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:11,130
So tools that we have in finance, you talked about interest rates.

401
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,580
You talked about price of risk.

402
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,680
In fact, we can use those tools to do, A, learn a little bit more in a very

403
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:27,230
fundamental manner how we should think about pricing these environmental risks.

404
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,690
How we should think about a marketplace for global warming.

405
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:37,980
And second, how we can use the information from that marketplace to

406
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,770
regulate some of these behavior that perhaps we,

407
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,735
collectively, as a society, are engaged in right now.

408
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:51,756
&gt;&gt; So consistent with the whole structure of the series, in the first course,

409
00:26:51,756 --> 00:26:55,371
I will deal simply with the notion of time value money.

410
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:58,666
But it will be done with a lot of applications, and

411
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:04,020
the context will be a firm making a decision about a project evaluation.

412
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,200
The thing that I will not do is risk,

413
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,206
and it&#39;s a pattern, I think, adopted across all top business schools,

414
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:15,110
is the reason is if you combine both, it becomes a bit much.

415
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,390
And what I like about finance is you can take them like separate Lego pieces,

416
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,170
get familiar, and then put them all together.

417
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,366
The second course is all about risk.

418
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:29,044
And the fundamental notion is very simple but

419
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:33,976
very powerful, which is, that risk for whom?

420
00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:38,783
It is for the people investing in your company, and we&#39;ll assume that those folks

421
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:42,140
are risk averse, which behavioral data shows they are.

422
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,529
And that simple fact will lead to what is called portfolio theory and

423
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:48,532
the measure of risk, or beta.

424
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:54,613
And we spend one four week period trying to both understand the measure of risk,

425
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:58,267
apply it in the context of selecting projects.

426
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:01,587
So, folks, I&#39;ll see you in class,

427
00:28:01,587 --> 00:28:06,098
starting with course one in then on to course two.

428
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:06,690
Bye, now.
