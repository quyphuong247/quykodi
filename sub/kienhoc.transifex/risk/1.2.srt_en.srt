00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:06,180
Welcome back.
https://youtu.be/84X0GJ8elTo
1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,040
So we introduced the notion of risk and return and

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,640
the purposes to kinda try to understand risk before relating it to return,

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,200
because risk is the kind of the source of return, if you may, right.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,280
So let&#39;s make it a little bit interesting.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,540
Let&#39;s assume our goal is to value a company called Rainforest, Inc.

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,200
And by the way, this is my attempt at being humorous.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,500
Just hang on.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,680
We want to evaluate an idea/project/firm that is launching an online portal

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,060
to sell everything under the sun, and we&#39;ll call it Rainforest.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,740
And anyway, I&#39;ll leave it at that, my attempts at being funny.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,350
So you want to value Rainforest.

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,350
What you have done is your job, you&#39;re the manager.

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,090
Or you&#39;re being hired by a set of people, by stockholders,

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,200
to run the company, this new company.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,760
And you projected all the cashflows.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,880
Remember, who do the cashflows belong to, belong, in quotes?

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,110
You, if you haven&#39;t done your cash flow estimation,

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,510
there&#39;s nobody who&#39;s going to give you money.

19
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,750
Right? Even you shouldn&#39;t put your money in that

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,850
idea because you&#39;d have no clue what value it&#39;s going to provide in the future.

21
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,170
So you&#39;ve done that.

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,840
And we know how to do that.

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,880
I recommend that you don&#39;t do this section

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,690
until you know how to do time value of money and cash flows.

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,190
We have done that.

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,250
How would you determine the cost of capital?

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,428
In other words, you have this new idea,

28
00:01:37,428 --> 00:01:41,340
you have all the cash flows over which you have more control in estimating.

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,940
Of course it depends on market share, market place and all that.

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,860
But you have done it.

31
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,390
How do you determine your cost of capital?

32
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:54,110
And this is where a lot of people just pull things out of thin air.

33
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,170
And this is again where I just love markets.

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,210
I love finance, I love competition,

35
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,079
not to say that it exists even in the best of markets.

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,060
But this is the beauty why we like markets.

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,450
This is the value of information.

38
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,100
This is the value of democracy,

39
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,140
that people can actually participate in the marketplace.

40
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,270
So how do you determine the cost of capital?

41
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,700
To answer that question, you have to remember and

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,250
I&#39;ll answer it in a second, you remember one big hint.

43
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,630
All valuation is relative and

44
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,170
the law of one price is lurking behind the background.

45
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,180
So what will you do?

46
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,110
You can pause here.

47
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,750
Take a break.

48
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,560
Go for a run.

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,150
Think deeply about it.

50
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,800
What I want to do is I&#39;m gonna keep moving so that we are on track, and

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,820
these short segments of videos make sense, contextually, and within this.

52
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,800
So, if you realize that all pricing is relative, what will you do?

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,680
You will go looking for a company that has a very, very similar business proposition.

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,730
And that&#39;s why I thought Rainforest was a pretty funny choice.

55
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,460
So what will you do?

56
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,720
You&#39;ll go looking for a company that&#39;s very similar and that company,

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,530
we know what it is.

58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,460
We&#39;ll call it, for simplicity, Amazon.

59
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,358
So this is what you&#39;ll do.

60
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:30,030
Please stare at the screen or the slide.

61
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,870
What will you see?

62
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,430
My favorite picture all over again.

63
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,480
And you have a fundamental problem.

64
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,710
So you go to Amazon, what do you see?

65
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,179
You see its balance sheet.

66
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,980
And you see on the balance sheet what?

67
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,450
Real assets and equity and debt.

68
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,260
Let&#39;s assume this number is relatively close to zero,

69
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,110
it would just make matters a little simple and we&#39;ll do debt financing,

70
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,710
equity financing and the you have two courses that you could go into,

71
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:08,140
which are sometimes built in a series, they are on financing.

72
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,280
And in this particular x series, we&#39;ll have them.

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,040
But you can do this course in isolation, that&#39;s why I&#39;m emphasizing it.

74
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,090
For the time being, let&#39;s assume only equity.

75
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,740
So what is your problem?

76
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,230
The real assets of Amazon are sitting here.

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,310
They are generating cash flows to Amazon, but they are based on that.

78
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,310
They are being returned.

79
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,190
And that return, I&#39;m going to call Ra.

80
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,520
Please remember, this is very important.

81
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,850
The return on assets we&#39;ll call Ra, and as you go, it will make sense what Ra is.

82
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,510
So where does Ra come from?

83
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,720
Where do the cash flows come from?

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,940
They come from your returns.

85
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,200
And, I mean, from your real assets.

86
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,840
And then you take those returns and distribute them all to whom?

87
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,380
Equity in this case, because the data is relatively low.

88
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,590
So what is the challenge?

89
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,965
The fundamental problem is you can&#39;t see Ra.

90
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,100
Because Ra is return on real assets.

91
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,090
Heck, you don&#39;t even know what real assets Amazon has.

92
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,240
I would claim that even Amazon can&#39;t figure out its return on assets.

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,220
Now here&#39;s the beauty of it.

94
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,830
And that&#39;s why markets are so good.

95
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,690
That one of the main primary functions,

96
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:34,630
main primary functions, that will count is to figure out value.

97
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,400
Markets are created so that we can make it transparent so

98
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,770
if there&#39;s no debt, what will Ra be?

99
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,720
Ra has to be equal to Re.

100
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,496
In other words the return on equity and the return on assets have to be the same

101
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:55,098
because there&#39;s no debt, there&#39;s nobody else sharing the pie?

102
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:57,166
So but what comes first?

103
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:02,502
Return on assets, and then you decide to give it all to equity holders

104
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:08,310
because they are the main financing source for this company, okay?

105
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,800
So here&#39;s the beauty of finance.

106
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,193
If we didn&#39;t have this trading going on, if we didn&#39;t have markets,

107
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,380
And we didn&#39;t have trading going on.

108
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,080
It would not be easy to determine this.

109
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,670
And because we have markets, and we have trading going on, there should be a Ts.

110
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,131
I got excited.

111
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,380
You could never forget our table.

112
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,750
So you&#39;re catching your nose the long way through markets.

113
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,240
Markets reflect value.

114
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,110
Right? So I work for a not for profit.

115
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,240
One of the best creations is a university.

116
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,360
I work for a university.

117
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,230
But the one thing about not for profits is you don&#39;t know the rate of return.

118
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,740
If it, even if it first making some cash flows.

119
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,630
Because nothing is public, right.

120
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,840
So when you have shares trading,

121
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,340
one of the beauties of it is it gives you information about value.

122
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,240
And therefore the fundamental problem is resolved.

123
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,210
Of course it&#39;s challenging, and there&#39;s debt and so on, so forth.

124
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,140
We&#39;ll get into that later.

125
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,130
So return on equity and return on assets are the same, therefore we can go and

126
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,550
figure out return on assets based on the information about Amazon.

127
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,640
I&#39;m going to take a break now and

128
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,875
when we come back I&#39;ll spend a few minutes going to Amazon on the web.

129
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:40,860
Remember whenever I teach I try to go to the information that&#39;s readily

130
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,670
available with one major caution.

131
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,850
As soon as we get into estimation, like we will,

132
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,090
of risk, there&#39;s data available on the web, freely available.

133
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,730
That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the best data.

134
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,940
Okay, so be a little careful.

135
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,400
We&#39;ll come back in a minute and go visit Amazon.
