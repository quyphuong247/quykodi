1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,420
Question.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,400
Should Kitchen, Inc., take the new project?

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,170
Think about it.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,660
Be very, very careful.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,840
What is the answer?

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,300
Yes, 15% is the error.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,024
Think about what we know.

8
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:31,955
15% out of construction business,

9
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:39,560
Kitchen&#39;s cost of capital is 7.5%.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,340
Should I take it?

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,350
Your answer should be, I don&#39;t know.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,660
Why is that?

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,570
Because you cannot compare apples and oranges.

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,210
You cannot compare IRR of a construction business with the cost of

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,769
capital of a kitchen business.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,400
And these are the type of things which are the business sense art of

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,320
doing evaluation.

18
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,101
And that&#39;s the reason I love financing more than the number crunching.

19
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:14,020
Because you regard this wrong, you don&#39;t understand business, right?

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,570
So you can&#39;t compare apples and oranges.

21
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,040
So let&#39;s go and ask, what do I need to calculate?

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,520
Well, I need to calculate the cost of capital of the project, not of Kitchen.

23
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,030
Many people use their own cost of capital to analyze new projects, but

24
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,739
the new project has to identical to you, to be able to pull that off.

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,500
And this is the trap you don&#39;t wanna fall into.

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,210
Question, can I calculate the cost of capital of the project?

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,780
If so, how?

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,377
Yes, you go to a comparable.

29
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,890
Have I given you data on the comparable?

30
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,650
Yes.

31
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,280
What did I give you?

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,443
Beta equity in that business, construction business.

33
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:04,382
Construction was 2.50.

34
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:09,110
The two equity ratio was

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:15,371
1 and Rd was 10%.

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,900
So can I?

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,140
Yes, I can.

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,040
The only thing now is that I cannot run with the following.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,090
I cannot take, so let&#39;s do cap m.

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,170
Re c.

41
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,380
C stands for construction if it&#39;s okay with you, or comparable to.

42
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,080
Is equal to 2.5% + 5% times 2.50.

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,196
What do you get?

44
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:52,047
Re in the construction business turns out to be 2.5 or 12.5 or 15%.

45
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:58,280
A lot of people will use this as the cost of capital.

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,550
And what will they say, why would you do a business and

47
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,450
with your cost of capital and your return are the same?

48
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,500
That means what, MPVS?

49
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,927
Zero. But they are making a mistake.

50
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:16,803
I asked you a while ago if you use Re as a cost of capital to evaluate businesses,

51
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:19,480
what will you usually do?

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,940
You will kill business&#39;s value,

53
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,060
because you&#39;re using a number too high if there&#39;s financing.

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,810
So what do you have to do?

55
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,780
You have to un-lever it.

56
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,360
How do you un-lever?

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,661
You know Re is equal to Ra

58
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:39,270
plus D over E, Ra minus Rd.

59
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,440
And what do we want?

60
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,750
We want Ra.

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,208
Another way of writing this equation is simpler, D/(D+E)

62
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:58,163
* Rd + E/(D+E) * Re.

63
00:03:58,163 --> 00:04:02,460
The same equation can be rewritten as this.

64
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,640
Quick question, which is the one number that you cannot change with financing?

65
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,400
It&#39;s Ra, but you don&#39;t know it.

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,200
You only know Re through beta e.

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,060
So what do you do?

68
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,647
You plug in Re (15%) here, and you plug in Rd (10%) here.

69
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:23,270
And what do you get the cost of capital as?

70
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,580
So you need to know this is half and this is half, why?

71
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,040
Because if the debt to equity ratio is 1, the proportion of debt and

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,100
equity is both half and they add up to how much?

73
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,290
They add up to 100%, okay.

74
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,712
So half of 10 is how much?

75
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:45,687
5%.

76
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:47,983
Half of 15 is how much?

77
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,847
7.5%.

78
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:51,997
And the answer to that will be 12.5%.

79
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:55,847
This is what?

80
00:04:55,847 --> 00:05:00,649
Ra of the construction business, which is also in our case,

81
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,424
cost of capital of the construction business.

82
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,900
You see. This is not easy.

83
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,240
So the question now becomes should Kitchen,

84
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,750
Inc., should it accept the new project?

85
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,220
Answer is yes.

86
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:28,340
And the reason is 15% IRR in the construction business

87
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,950
is greater than cost of capital, construction business of 12.5%.

88
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,140
Why can I use this rule?

89
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,415
I can pretend to be in the second I should calculate NPV.

90
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,314
But why can I used this rule?

91
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:44,979
Because I showed you that the cashflows are very well behaved and

92
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,155
there&#39;s only one project to choose from.

93
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:51,779
So I know this will mean NPV &gt; 0.

94
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,635
So the answer is yes.

95
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:58,360
Let&#39;s take a break.

96
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,550
Think about it.

97
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,740
Let&#39;s come back.

98
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,010
Rock and roll.

99
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,884
See you in a minute.
