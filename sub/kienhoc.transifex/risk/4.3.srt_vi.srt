00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:08,870
Now comes the trick question for you, and this is a tough one.
https://youtu.be/d4_-iucmwK0
1
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,410
And I&#39;m using intuition for you to answer it, and

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,930
we are going to repeat this so many times that you&#39;ll can get tired of it.

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,800
But believe me, the world gets very confused.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,563
Which return of these three, Ra, Rd or

5
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:30,642
Re and in this case back and Ra are the same.

6
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:36,097
Which of these three returns ,does not depend on financing?

7
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:43,220
This is a trick question It&#39;s a very obvious answer.

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,520
If you&#39;ve been listening, and if you&#39;ve been thinking, and if you have intuition,

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
you should be able to answer it.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,570
The problem with this equation is,

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,050
many equations you think the right hand side is determining the left hand side.

12
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,280
So the answer is the following.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,770
Think deeply.

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,850
What determines return on assets?

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,190
Is it the financing that determines them intuitively, or

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,200
the product you&#39;re selling, the cashflows?

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,820
So the answer is, the business your are in and

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,740
the cashflow it&#39;s generating determines the return on assets.

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,375
And then you divide it up between whom and whom, equity and debt.

20
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:23,850
So here&#39;s the really powerful result.

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,500
Financing does not change the value of the firm.

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,820
Because financing cannot change the cost of capital which in this case,

23
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,980
and I would like you to remember that for the assets, cost of Ra.

24
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,540
So Ra will not change and this is such a profound result,

25
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,410
that it will not be but, it&#39;s very simple to understand.

26
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,560
You can do equations, you can do all the math, and Matt Miller had this story.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,470
When approximately said.

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,834
So, I&#39;ll say it with a little bit of spice, here, and there.

29
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:05,431
So here&#39;s what Matt Miller was asked when overprice was announced,

30
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:11,027
and people Chicago showed up, and they were taking pictures of him,

31
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:14,420
and so he don&#39;t talk to the cameras a lot.

32
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,975
Doesn&#39;t talk to the, they like talking to the public

33
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:21,380
a lot in the sense of being a celebrity or whatever.

34
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,090
But he was.

35
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,480
So they asked him, what did you prove?

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,720
He said I proved that if you have one pizza,

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,740
and you break it up, cut it up into two pieces.

38
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,110
And one you call e, and the other you call d.

39
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,470
And how many pizzas do you have total?

40
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,497
So some people would just turn and they said, one?

41
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,383
You said, that&#39;s what I showed you.

42
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:53,637
He said if you take up your pizza and divided it into two pieces,

43
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:55,419
you still have one pizza.

44
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,190
So they said is that all you solve?

45
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,775
He said yes with a lot of math.

46
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:05,390
[LAUGH] But it&#39;s a very powerful, it&#39;s one of the most powerful results in finance.

47
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,190
And that&#39;s why I say,

48
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,800
it&#39;s good to understand it completely in spite of some unrealistic assumptions.

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,650
And I would say, when did the assumptions thrown in its power is phenomenal.

50
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,640
So what I&#39;m going to do next is, say that

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,080
you know your expected return on asset because you know your idea.

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,850
Your idea, you generate the cashflows and the marketplace goes to Amazon,

53
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,890
to figure out the expected return on assets of rainforest.

54
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,370
I know that number.

55
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,870
I calculated last time, 10%.

56
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,250
Right now is the following.

57
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,860
In this world with no frictions, Ican do nothing about the 10%.

58
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,910
But changing the financing and rainforest.

59
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,000
If I started out with equity, return on equity would be 10%.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,080
If I started out with equity in debt, return on equity would change.

61
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,570
But return on asset would still be 10%,

62
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,170
because financing cannot affect what you&#39;re doing fundamentally.

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,530
Have you ever gone in and said, tell me what the difference

64
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,002
between the financing of Apple,

65
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:22,940
Notebook is, iPad or Samsungs.

66
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,510
You don&#39;t ask how those are financed when you buy them.

67
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,190
What do you ask?

68
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,660
What is the quality of the product?

69
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,630
You don&#39;t worry about financing when you worry about evaluation.

70
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,850
Anyway take a break, bless you.

71
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,789
See you in a minute.
