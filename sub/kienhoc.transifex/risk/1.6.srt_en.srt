00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:09,760
Welcome back, I&#39;m going to draw the distribution up here.
https://youtu.be/Rn1Fna63VrA
1
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:16,365
And I&#39;m not going to draw this axis,

2
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,478
simply because we know what probability it is.

3
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:23,875
So the question is, how do you calculate the average of return?

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,585
And I&#39;m going to give you two ways of doing it.

5
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:30,302
They are the same thing, but two slightly different ways.

6
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:35,368
So the first way is, and I&#39;m going to

7
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:41,097
write it out, I&#39;m going to call it R bar.

8
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:42,137
Why R?

9
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:44,914
Because we are going to be interested in returns.

10
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:50,963
Remember, you could call it x bar, in statistics books or y bar.

11
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:54,069
But because we are interested in returns, I&#39;m going to just define it this way.

12
00:00:54,069 --> 00:01:01,637
So suppose these are the returns of IBM distribution.

13
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:06,641
So the good question to ask is, what is the average expected return of IBM?

14
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:10,412
Good news, if they&#39;re normally distributed.

15
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:12,249
And by the way, if you take daily data,

16
00:01:12,249 --> 00:01:14,497
it&#39;s less likely to be normally distributed.

17
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:15,584
There&#39;s a lot of choppiness.

18
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:20,076
But as you aggregate data, so you go from one day to monthly data,

19
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:22,294
better behaved, more normal.

20
00:01:22,294 --> 00:01:23,158
Go to annual,

21
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:27,767
better behaved because that&#39;s how we came to normal distribution, okay?

22
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,424
So R bar will be what?

23
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,658
Let me just write it out.

24
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:35,773
This is summation

25
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:39,866
sign, pi Ri.

26
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,049
So pause for a second.

27
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:46,939
And as I said, in the next section, big module, I&#39;ll do a lot of number crunching.

28
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:47,864
What is pi?

29
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:52,861
pi is the probability.

30
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,319
And what is Ri?

31
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,512
Is the return.

32
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:06,440
How many possible are there?

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,313
Well you could have a discrete distribution, or

34
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:13,811
you could have a continuous distribution.

35
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:16,129
What does discrete distribution mean?

36
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,581
That there are only four or five possibilities of the future, and

37
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,605
we&#39;ll do that and multiply by price.

38
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:22,631
What is continuous?

39
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:26,295
Continuous means that you have a whole distribution up there,

40
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:30,866
it&#39;s not just four or five possibilities in the future you&#39;re considering.

41
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:34,250
So this is the generic formula, right?

42
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,901
But another way of calculating this, which you&#39;ll see very often is,

43
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:43,491
suppose you have N number of possibilities.

44
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,651
You&#39;ll do it like this.

45
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:47,965
So what does that mean?

46
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:53,658
That all possibilities are equally likely, and equal to 1 over N.

47
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:57,532
And that&#39;s a very strong assumption we make, regardless of thinking.

48
00:02:57,532 --> 00:03:02,372
So whenever we do calculations, we tend to use this formula.

49
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:07,328
But this is the generic formula that you should always keep in mind.

50
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,838
And when you use this second formula,

51
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:14,868
you&#39;re assuming that each R has the same likelihood of occurrence, okay?

52
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:17,129
So just keep that in mind.

53
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:19,353
What I’m going to do now is,

54
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:24,373
I won’t want to leave you with this, but go on to variance next.

55
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:29,103
And the reason we’ll go to variance in our contexts is simply because we’re not just

56
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,976
happy with knowing this number.

57
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:35,558
So suppose we calculated it, and this turned out to be 7%.

58
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:38,545
What are we worried about as risk averse people?

59
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:44,570
We are not worried about the times when things will be on this side.

60
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,907
We are worried about this side.

61
00:03:47,907 --> 00:03:52,846
And in order to do this, what we&#39;ll do is start worrying about,

62
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:54,957
what do the heck this mean?

63
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:58,655
What do the fact that this is spread out mean?

64
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:06,564
So, let&#39;s talk about the second important ingredient of risk return.

65
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:11,493
One is average, one is variance, and, if distributions are normal, there&#39;s nothing,

66
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:12,845
no third to worry about.

67
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,050
So, let&#39;s go on to variance.

68
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,749
So, what is variance measuring?

69
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:23,551
So variance is measuring, I got this for IBM, 7%.

70
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:25,658
What is variance measuring?

71
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:34,439
In its symmetric distribution these two lengths are the same, okay, distances.

72
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,424
I&#39;m not worried about this one, I&#39;m worried about this guy.

73
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,594
Okay, so let&#39;s try to measure it.

74
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:44,495
So this is what happens, and I&#39;m going to write out the formula.

75
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:49,275
You take a probability, and

76
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:52,660
take an event i, and

77
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,850
see how far is it from the mean.

78
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:04,924
So in this case, this is Ri and it&#39;s this far from the mean, okay?

79
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:06,892
You do this for everything.

80
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:10,068
So suppose I just added up all of these.

81
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,688
Would this work?

82
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:19,452
Would this be what is called sigma square at.

83
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:26,903
Sigma squared is the variance of the return, however, hat is an estimate.

84
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:30,189
So I&#39;m just using jargon that&#39;s pretty common.

85
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:31,848
If I did this, what would happen?

86
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,362
I would get 0 every time, right?

87
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:43,647
Because the positives and negatives will cut it, so I square it.

88
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:47,535
So the variance is the square of the deviation from the average.

89
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:50,737
And will give you a sense of,

90
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:56,081
how far the returns could be away from the mean.

91
00:05:56,081 --> 00:06:01,013
And more concern in finance when you&#39;re talking returns as a risk adverse person

92
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,779
about the downside, not the upside as much.

93
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,584
However, what&#39;s the units of this?

94
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:09,119
Remember, the units of mean would be percentage.

95
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,684
This will be very squared.

96
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:12,204
Makes it more difficult.

97
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,040
So what will I do?

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,950
I&#39;ll take sigma squared hat.

99
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,857
Take the square root of that.

100
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:21,748
And I&#39;ll get standard deviation.

101
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:29,451
So this is called standard, Deviation.

102
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:34,227
And I&#39;m not going to calculate the numbers here,

103
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:39,002
but I just wanted to give you a sense of both mean and

104
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:44,479
standard deviation as capturing IBM&#39;s distribution.

105
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,791
Because otherwise it&#39;s impossible to think about the future, right?

106
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,969
If I didn&#39;t give you two parameters, or

107
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:53,951
a few parameters to think about distributions and compare them, right?

108
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,840
I&#39;m always comparing, everything is relative.

109
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,830
If I couldn&#39;t give you these two parameters, you&#39;d be thinking,

110
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,374
what the heck is going on?

111
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:04,856
There&#39;s so many possibilities.

112
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:08,397
So how do you capture those possibilities?

113
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:13,068
Mean and radians or mean and standard deviation.

114
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:14,975
Of course when you take the square root, what will you get?

115
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,218
A plus and a minus, but

116
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:19,830
it makes no sense to have a negative standard deviation, right?

117
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,071
So we&#39;ll pick the positive one.

118
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,537
What I&#39;m going to do now is I&#39;m going to take a break.

119
00:07:25,537 --> 00:07:30,116
I want you to just go pick up some data from somewhere.

120
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,973
Rainfall data, whatever data you like, and

121
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:36,743
just mess with it if you&#39;ve never done statistics before.

122
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:39,525
You can get this data from wherever you want.

123
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,512
You can look at advertising money.

124
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:45,142
You can look at sales of a company and so on and so forth.

125
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:47,552
Or you can look at returns.

126
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:49,595
And if you want, Amazon.

127
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,290
They&#39;re available, by the way.

128
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,529
Not for many months, and not calculated properly.

129
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:59,078
So that&#39;s why when we do our applications, we&#39;ll do it with the right numbers, and

130
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,691
we&#39;ll talk about it, okay?

131
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:05,593
Let&#39;s take a break, let&#39;s come back, do some more statistics.

132
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:09,400
Statistics because this is not where the story ends.

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,087
The story keeps going, becomes a little bit more complicated.

134
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:18,015
And we want to introduce these concepts before we pick up the next

135
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:22,486
chunk of content which is applications, applications,

136
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:25,700
applications in the context of finance.

137
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,529
See you in a bit.
