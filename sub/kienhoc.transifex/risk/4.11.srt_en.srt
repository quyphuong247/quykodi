00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,250
So now let&#39;s go to the real world a little bit and actually just a flavor of it, and
https://youtu.be/um8tlN90mwQ
1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,400
the most blatant flavor, because I don&#39;t want you to get a sense that this is it.

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,650
What is really powerful in what we have done is,

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,430
that its flavor will remain with you throughout.

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,340
You need that as your basic way of thinking about the world, and

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,040
then changing the world based on reality, based on problems,

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,510
based on frictions So, let&#39;s go to The Real World.

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,450
There are two reasons why capital structure might affect value of the firm.

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,300
One of the reasons, broadly speaking, one of the reasons is,

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,760
that the realization of tax benefits provided you the tax shield.

10
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,600
So, one of the things that&#39;s happened in The Real World is,

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,920
that the interest on debt is tax deductible.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,140
So it is, after tax, more appealing to go with debt than equity.

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,400
And that benefit of that tax deduction goes to equity holders.

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,340
And cost of capital, after tax, goes down.

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,960
The capital structure policy adopted by a company&#39;s management,

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,000
may however also lead to high chances of bankruptcy.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,940
So these two forces, one a positive reason to take debt,

18
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,040
one a negative reason to debt.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,290
Create in many people&#39;s minds, and rightly so,

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,360
some kind of optimal capital structure.

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,870
And that capital structure, books are to be different for

22
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,780
different industries, and so on.

23
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,630
But I wanted to give you a flavor of that.

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,690
But it&#39;s happening because on purpose, debt is being

25
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,130
made sweeter than equity due to the tax deductibility.

26
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,362
So, let me show you WACC, and this is the WACC you&#39;ll often see in The Real World.

27
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:59,163
Till now, if you look DL/ VL, VL we have written as, and

28
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:03,379
let me write it out a little bit so that you don&#39;t get confused.

29
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:10,432
VL = E + D, L just for leverage.

30
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,620
So we&#39;ll just read it and

31
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,620
just a little bit, because that&#39;s always true of balances.

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,600
The part that&#39;s new is this, so think about it.

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,950
Suppose you are paying 10% on debt,

34
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,060
like in our example to your debt holder you promised it, you pay it.

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,230
However the government allows you to deduct it, so what you are actually paying

36
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,470
suppose Tc is 34% what you&#39;re actually paying is 6.6.

37
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,750
After tax.

38
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,750
So what happens, your cost of capital becomes subsidised and

39
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,790
this is what emerged as a result.

40
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,010
Your return on assets is greater than WACC.

41
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,500
Because your return on assets is what you get.

42
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,090
But what you pay gets subsidised a little bit.

43
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,769
So your cost of capital is lower.

44
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,850
So that&#39;s why you kinda lean towards that a little bit.

45
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,210
Many companies have it.

46
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,150
Note that WACC is an after-tax measure, it&#39;s not before tax.

47
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,860
And tax benefit to debt is a man-made thing.

48
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,135
If you notice there&#39;s a huge debate going on, that if you take a debt,

49
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:24,061
corporate level is structural but if you take it at a personal level, you can only

50
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:29,080
deduct interest in the US and I think most countries on the interest portion of it.

51
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,730
And only on housing debt.

52
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,890
Many people have believed therefore,

53
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,090
it has encouraged house building as opposed to say renting.

54
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,860
And that may have led to the huge drop in the house prices too,

55
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,620
along with low interest rates and so on.

56
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,700
So the question then becomes, in a world with no frictions, I mean, with

57
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,225
frictions and a tax favored treatment, why don&#39;t firms finance 100% debt?

58
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:02,140
[INAUDIBLE], no bank will give you all that.

59
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,920
You&#39;ll run away with that because if you have no skin on the game,

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,160
why would you not take more risk and you&#39;re nothing to loose.

61
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,500
And by the way, a lot of that happened [LAUGH] in the recent crisis.

62
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,512
So why is that the firms are an average for example,

63
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:25,620
is about 50% is the average debt to value ratio across all industries in the US.

64
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,360
Some industries more, like airlines, some industries net zero,

65
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,680
like in the tech industry, close to zero.

66
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,480
Why is it that debt is not everywhere?

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,100
There are two contributing effects,

68
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,170
the first one is called bankruptcy-related costs.

69
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,730
As we&#39;ve said, the closer you go to a lot of debt, chances of bankruptcy go up.

70
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,640
You better take account of that.

71
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,340
Even if it is a very low probability event, but everything could be lost.

72
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,590
The multiplication of the two is very high, so for

73
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,690
example there&#39;s lot of work on signs on climate change,

74
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,260
which I think is bankruptcy of the whole earth in some sense.

75
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,822
So the reason why it&#39;s so important,

76
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:17,433
is not because the probability is necessarily high.

77
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:21,180
If that were the case, I am telling you, forget about it.

78
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,346
Even if the probability is low but you could learn to lose everything,

79
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:25,590
you better worry about it.

80
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,040
So, that&#39;s the gross product.

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,850
So bankruptcy costs are important.

82
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,630
It&#39;s how what you lose and not just the probability of how much you lose.

83
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,950
But the secondary reason, which we haven&#39;t spent too much time on and

84
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,330
which unfortunately,

85
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,700
we do not spend much time on, is that we&#39;re only talking about corporate taxes.

86
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,030
When you go to the personal tax level, equity

87
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,850
is probably being subsidized more than debt.

88
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,230
By that I mean, is if you&#39;re getting interest payments you&#39;ve got to pay taxes,

89
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,060
you can&#39;t do anything about it.

90
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,940
But actually what can you do you can postpone capital gains.

91
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,590
So because of that and because of different tax rates and so

92
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,520
on so forth, what do you want to do a complete study is,

93
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,450
firms may not have a lot of debt because firms are eventually held by people and

94
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,500
there may be countervailing effects of having too much debt, that account for

95
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,832
the fact that debt is only about 30% of capital structures,

96
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:30,930
say 30% to 40% somewhere on there.

97
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,150
And not close to 100%.

98
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,080
At least in the US or in the rest of the world.

99
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,660
And when it&#39;s very high, let me tell you, we have seen a spate of bankruptcies.

100
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,550
When the economy goes south, in fact,

101
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,280
nobody expected all house pricing to drop across America.

102
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,340
Very rare event, very rare event.

103
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,700
But it happened.

104
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,220
And it devastated the economy for a long time.

105
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,510
I hope you&#39;ve learnt this module and done a lot.

106
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,229
What I would recommend is keep at the problems, keep at the assignments, and

107
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:06,184
keep smiling.

108
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,133
See you.
