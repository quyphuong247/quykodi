00:00:05,162 --> 00:00:10,446
Welcome, now is kind of, I don&#39;t want to leave you just with data,
https://youtu.be/4eoWWEKw-wU
1
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:14,450
I want to go back as to why we did all of this.

2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:20,250
The goal was to develop a relationship between risk and return.

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,920
So why were we after return?

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,790
We were after return because the return on compatible becomes

5
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:33,020
the return you should earn at a minimum, otherwise why would I finance rainforest?

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,973
And we assume for the time being, that we&#39;d go to Amazon,

7
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:39,592
which does a similar business, and we&#39;ll assume their debt was zero,

8
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:41,969
which turns out to be realistically the case.

9
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,187
And what I&#39;m going to do now is talk about the intuition, go back to it.

10
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:53,480
So return we want, but we can&#39;t figure out return before knowing risk.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,360
We have talked about risk and return.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,575
So let&#39;s go through the intuition and then I&#39;ll show you some even more data,

13
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:03,000
where you don&#39;t have to do the calculations because you know how to.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,870
And it&#39;s really rich data.

15
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,030
We&#39;ll assume we are risk averse.

16
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,151
Most data, most experiments show this is to be true.

17
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:15,200
I will show you data which proves this to be true on average.

18
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,360
We like return, but we do not like risk,

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,800
which is the definition of risk aversion.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,070
We like return, but we don&#39;t like risk.

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,670
The problem is the only way to ensure that you actually take care of your

22
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,770
aversion to risk is by holding diversified portfolios and reasonably large ones.

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,259
But larger loan doesn&#39;t mean much, because if you hold a large portfolio all in one

24
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:50,376
industry, you&#39;re really, all your eggs are in one basket with a lot of eggs in,

25
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:54,236
I mean, you know what I mean, a lot of eggs but in one basket.

26
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:58,980
But this behavior would only survive, this passion for return but

27
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,809
without taking on too much risk and therefore holding portfolios,

28
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:07,380
is if risk and return are positively correlated.

29
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,530
Otherwise, why would we invest in something that&#39;s very risky?

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,480
So that&#39;s the behavioral implications of our attitudes towards risk,

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,650
is that risk and return should be positively related.

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,240
I&#39;m going to now show you some data, and you&#39;ll recognize what this data is.

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,599
We all hold portfolios, more or less, so therefore I&#39;ve used portfolio data and

34
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,442
this is very commonly available.

35
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:36,100
Since 26 to 2008, we can include more recent data, but

36
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,290
this is just showing you some examples over large period of time.

37
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,030
So if you stare at this data, in the first column are portfolio.

38
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,510
Remember, we are holding portfolios, so portfolio.

39
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,507
Average return, average risk premium, standard deviation.

40
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,752
So the first column starts off with small stocks, so

41
00:02:56,752 --> 00:03:00,600
this is a portfolio of stocks that are relative small in size.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:08,087
Meaning, think about it that these are stocks that are low price stocks,

43
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:14,780
small stocks as supposed to S&amp;P 500, which has got what?

44
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,760
All kinds of stocks.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,550
It has got stocks ranging from Google to small stocks.

46
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,860
Then corporate bonds, government bods and treasury bills.

47
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,360
First thing, so these are average returns over a long period of time.

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,745
And what&#39;s phenomenal is, and this is mind boggling, and do this in your mind.

49
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:42,026
If you put $100 in a small stock portfolio,

50
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:49,560
and over the next, what 64, no, 74 plus 8, 82 years span.

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,790
How much would that $100 be worth if you invested at 21%?

52
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,550
Do the calculation.

53
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,270
Then do the calculation how much would it be worth if you&#39;d invested it in 12%.

54
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,643
How much would it be worth if you&#39;d invested in 7%, 6%, 4%?

55
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:13,360
And you will see mind-boggling differences in the amount.

56
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,651
You would have been a billionaire in one instance, and

57
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:20,177
not with much money in another.

58
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:24,293
The interesting part here is not just the magnitudes, but

59
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:29,250
how they are related to, go to the last column, standard deviation.

60
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,990
So, I hope you have jotted down these numbers,

61
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,414
and I&#39;m keep going back to the table and so on.

62
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:40,750
And I&#39;ll also share this data with you in a little note so

63
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,390
that you can look back and forth.

64
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,371
But even now, let&#39;s have some fun.

65
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:48,281
The key here is that the theory that high risk,

66
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:54,540
high return implied by risk aversion is actually proven over this data.

67
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,920
So yes, small stocks gave you 21% rate of return on average annual.

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,780
What is the standard deviation?

69
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,389
Twice as much of that of S&amp;P 500.

70
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,690
And what is the lowest standard deviation?

71
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,890
Lo and behold, Treasury bills, okay?

72
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,280
So basically, it&#39;s showing that high risk, high return, high risk,

73
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,900
high return, high risk, high return.

74
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,620
What is the middle column, average risk premium?

75
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,370
And that&#39;s also an interesting number to look at.

76
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,191
So what is the risk free investment for almost sure, lowest risk, if you may.

77
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:30,688
It&#39;s Treasury bill.

78
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:36,522
So 17% is 4%- subtracted from 21%.

79
00:05:36,522 --> 00:05:40,542
That&#39;s called risk premium, and that 8%,

80
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:46,130
12%,- 4%, is over for the overall S&amp;P 500, right?

81
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,170
So this gives you a sense of, and we will talk about data like this a lot,

82
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,209
this gives you a sense of the notion of what has happened.

83
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,560
By the way, unbelievable returns.

84
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,926
People have been studying this,

85
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:05,153
they&#39;ve call it a puzzle to have such high rates of return.

86
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:10,158
And a risk premium so high, because they&#39;ve never been witnessed before, and

87
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:15,330
it may be a long stretch of prosperity and innovation that America has witnessed.

88
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,470
Anyway, so that&#39;s the first reason.

89
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,620
So I&#39;m giving you people hold portfolios, the riskier the portfolio,

90
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,060
the higher the return.

91
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,270
This is being shown in the data.

92
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,830
This is being shown clearly in the data.

93
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,540
What I&#39;m going to do now is I&#39;m going to take a short break from my side,

94
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,027
come back, and give you an appetizer for the next time.

95
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:44,728
Because that appetizer will make you think about diversification,

96
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:49,671
which underlies everything we are going to do for the next two modules and

97
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:54,470
actually analyze a lot of human behavior and investment strategies.

98
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,932
See you in a minute.
