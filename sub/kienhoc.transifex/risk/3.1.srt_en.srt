00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:10,450
Welcome, we have been talking about Project Risk Assessment.
https://youtu.be/ay0zpJ1lHHM
1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:17,133
And this is one area where we are using a lot of statistics.

2
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:19,878
So, we spent a lot of time on, first of all,

3
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:24,730
as always trying to understand why the heck are we talking about this.

4
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,240
Second, doing a lot of statistics.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,970
And, I left you with some data last time.

6
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,800
I&#39;m not gonna put it up, you have it and the data showed two kinds of data.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,550
One on portfolios to show how risk and return have gone hand in hand,

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,950
over the last several decades, that was the US data.

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,620
And some startling numbers as high as over 20% for

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,320
small portfolios, and so on so forth.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,710
So, we talked about that just to set things up.

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,310
Because what we are headed towards is how do you measure risk and

13
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,340
how do you relate it to return which in the end, becomes the cost of capital?

14
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,710
A lot of steps, but we have to go carefully.

15
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,309
The second piece of data I left you with was should 11 stocks

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,830
and they were taken from the US Stock Market data, and

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,920
showed you the validity or standard deviation.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,770
When I say validity, standard deviation,

19
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,370
I&#39;m just trying to distinguish between variance and standard deviation.

20
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,605
And I showed you some data for

21
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:37,436
11 stocks over a reasonably long period of time, and then S&amp;P 500.

22
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:41,130
And I had left you with the question, what&#39;s going on?

23
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,535
And by that I meant, why is it that the average of the 11

24
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:51,825
individual stocks chosen across a lot of industries,

25
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:56,655
not just one, was so much higher than the standard

26
00:01:56,655 --> 00:02:01,144
deviation of the portfolio as simply 500?

27
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:05,390
You could also do an interesting exercise, which we will do today, actually.

28
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:11,380
Combine securities into portfolios and then see the effect on volatility.

29
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,670
But wanted to set up some interesting data.

30
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,745
And I think if you average the 11 individual securities

31
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:26,087
you get about 27% there about, whereas the S&amp;P 500 is 15% and

32
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:32,790
it&#39;s the lowest of all 12, 11 stocks and then, that should be right.

33
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,840
So that&#39;s giving you a hint of what&#39;s going on.

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,550
And what&#39;s going on rarely is the reason why we hold portfolio as

35
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,009
risk of those people is that you&#39;ll diversify risk.

36
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,330
And today what we are going to talk about is, what is diversification?

37
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,660
How does it work?

38
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,100
We&#39;ll step by step use again some data, so I&#39;ll pull up some

39
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,550
data again from stock-data file so that we&#39;re up to speed.

40
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,600
And is you recall I have an S&amp;P 500 in there.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,130
So, there&#39;s a reason for that.

42
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,870
So please go back and forth with the data file when you do it.

43
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,950
And I&#39;m gonna spend a ton of time on it, because we also have an assignment, but

44
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,860
enough so that you can do the assignment on your own.

45
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,440
So let&#39;s get started.

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,900
So diversification is the concept

47
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,250
of reduction in the standard deviation of volatility.

48
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,300
For portfolio of stocks combined and

49
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,430
if you were to average the risk of the stocks,

50
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,960
measuring standard deviation, it would be much higher than the standard

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,410
deviation of the portfolio of stocks so be careful and we&#39;ll see why.

52
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,330
Okay.

53
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,260
Remember though,

54
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,060
at the background, there are two types of risks underlying everything.

55
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,230
One is market.

56
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,700
One is specific to the stock, or the asset,

57
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
or whatever you are combining into a portfolio.

58
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,160
And hint, big picture.

59
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,540
Which of these two risks will get reduced.

60
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,640
In other words, will it be the market risk that&#39;s common to the stuff, or

61
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,290
will it be specific risk that will tend to cancel?

62
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,870
And the answer&#39;s pretty obvious.

63
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,150
And I&#39;ll leave it there for a second and come back to it.

64
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,840
So Diversification, 1 asset.

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,540
Let&#39;s start slowly.

66
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,220
Suppose for some reason you just decide that Google is your portfolio,

67
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,370
in other words, you buy the Google stock and that comprises your portfolio.

68
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,790
We&#39;ll go very slowly, I won&#39;t even right here often,

69
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,179
because I want you to kind of write for yourself.

70
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,430
First question.

71
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,520
How would you measure the risk of Google?

72
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,000
Or that specific stock?

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,120
And the answer is the standard deviation of Google.

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,480
So, you&#39;ll get a bunch of returns, like we have in our database,

75
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,750
and you can do this for yourself by going to Google, getting the data download.

76
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,260
Going to Yahoo Finance or some other data source.

77
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,060
There&#39;s some better data sources than others but

78
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,050
right now let&#39;s just focus on the concept.

79
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,790
How do you measure the risk of Google?

80
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,020
Well you&#39;ll take five years worth of data or more.

81
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,840
Hopefully representative data.

82
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,850
You&#39;ll see the data set assignments I&#39;ve given you, I&#39;m trying to capture that.

83
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,483
What I mean by representative is, even five years picked in a bad time,

84
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:35,210
is not represented, because we don&#39;t fortunately only see bad times.

85
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,830
So, how would you measure the risk?

86
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,700
The standard deviation.

87
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,900
How would you measure the risk of your portfolio?

88
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,250
Remember, right now, for

89
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,380
some reason you have chosen to have only one asset in your whole portfolio.

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,870
So what will be the risk of the portfolio?

91
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,287
I promised you that I wouldn&#39;t talk about

92
00:05:57,287 --> 00:06:01,540
right and I&#39;m gonna stick to that for a little while.

93
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,160
So standard deviation of Google is equal to standard division of your portfolio.

94
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,190
If instead,

95
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,970
you only invested in Microsoft, what would be the risk of your portfolio?

96
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,350
The volatility or standard deviation of Microsoft&#39;s return.

97
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,730
So it&#39;s pretty straightforward and simple.

98
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,170
So another question which is not up there.

99
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,830
What will be the expected return of your portfolio?

100
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,010
Expected return of you portfolio is easy, so we won&#39;t spend too much time on it.

101
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,650
Except when we do some examples.

102
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,120
The expected return in this case has to be the expected return on Google or

103
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
Microsoft.

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,890
Remember you&#39;re holding only one.

105
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,030
This is an artificial exercise.

106
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,990
So quick going back to risk

107
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,720
what is the relationship between the risk of your portfolio and the risk of Google?

108
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,370
They&#39;re identical.

109
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,380
So there&#39;s nothing to worry about.

110
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,270
But the world is not simple.

111
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,980
We do not hold one security and the reason is very simple it does diversification.

112
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,560
We do not want to put all our eggs in one basket.

113
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,270
Which by the way makes a lot of sense if you&#39;re risk averse right?

114
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,120
Because if you are risk averse, why would you ride on only one thing?

115
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,460
You may have fun but you may fall drastically and

116
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,740
lose everything especially in stocks.

117
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,810
So let&#39;s go on to two assets.

118
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,610
Set up the intuition and

119
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,500
then we&#39;ll take a little bit of a break before we get into the mechanics of it.

120
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,220
So today I&#39;m going to do both the intuition and the mechanics and the data.

121
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,060
Suppose instead you say, no, no, no.

122
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,870
This was not a good exercise.

123
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,321
Let&#39;s imagine I have two securities in my portfolio.

124
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,970
And let&#39;s say they&#39;re Google and Microsoft.

125
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,460
Remember later we&#39;ll use data,

126
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,050
and right now I&#39;m just having fun with names of well-known companies.

127
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,390
So I have Google and Microsoft.

128
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,870
How would you measure the risk of each of the two stocks.

129
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,970
Again, how would you measure the risk of each of the two stocks in isolation?

130
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,600
Very simple.

131
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,330
The risk of Microsoft will be sigma hat, Microsoft.

132
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,390
So let me right it.

133
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,708
So sigma hat MS is Microsoft&#39;s risk.

134
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:30,460
Sigma hat, Google.

135
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,210
Yes?

136
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,710
Google. They have symbols, MSFD,

137
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,490
I think is the symbol, and so on and so forth.

138
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,830
But here I&#39;m just having fun.

139
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,350
Okay, so this is very simple.

140
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,570
You also know how to calculate, right?

141
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,790
So if I gave you data on Microsoft and

142
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,420
Google, in fact I encourage you to, go ahead and try to get it.

143
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:55,370
Second, how would you measure the average risk of the two?

144
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,113
So this goes back to the graph I showed you last time.

145
00:08:58,113 --> 00:09:02,260
I showed 11 stocks and I asked you, what is the average of the standard deviation?

146
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,780
What would you do if it&#39;s a simple average?

147
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,546
You&#39;ll just take half.

148
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:15,390
And add sigma hat Google, plus sigma hat Microsoft.

149
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,440
It&#39;s pretty straightforward, right?

150
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,510
So to lie, everything is nice, but now comes the trick question.

151
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,440
How would you measure the risk of your portfolio?

152
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,510
So this is where things become really really tricky.

153
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,780
Why?

154
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,310
Because the risk of your portfolio is a combination of the two.

155
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,810
And let us assume for simplicity that you&#39;re putting, we&#39;ll see this.

156
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,465
You&#39;re putting half of your money, your $100,

157
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:52,889
you put $50 in Microsoft and $50 in Google.

158
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:55,273
So that&#39;s the first thing you have to decide.

159
00:09:55,273 --> 00:09:59,315
As soon as you decide a portfolio, you have to figure out how much in one,

160
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:01,390
how much in the other.

161
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,830
If you&#39;re investing all in one the weight on 100% is on Google.

162
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,454
If all in Microsoft, 100% rate.

163
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:12,940
So as soon as you form a portfolio, you&#39;re essentially, first question you have to

164
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,280
decide today, because you&#39;re the decision maker, is how much in each?

165
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,380
And by the way, a lot of financial companies try to

166
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,200
make you feel like it is they who are helping you make the decision, and

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,790
therefore, charging you for it.

168
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,850
No.

169
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,020
If you understand the basics of what we are talking about you will have

170
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,180
very simple strategies and

171
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,700
you can minimize transaction costs by holding diversified portfolios.

172
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,550
That is assuming you&#39;re risk averse and assuming you&#39;re willing to buy the notion

173
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,240
that if trading is happening at the stock market,

174
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,900
it&#39;s very very difficult to beat the stock market.

175
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,800
All of us think we can.

176
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,230
So this is where we are headed.

177
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,920
What is the risk of the portfolio?

178
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,150
And I will call that, for simplicity, sigma p hat.

179
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,390
Okay, so just contextually.

180
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:14,160
And I will leave it here to make you kind of think about what that means.

181
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,369
And let me write down the portfolio return as xa

182
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:25,460
Ra + xb Rb.

183
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,290
So the portfolio now becomes a weighted average of the two.

184
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,440
So we&#39;ll do these xaRas and all that soon.

185
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,070
And I&#39;ll reintroduce talk very carefully about them.

186
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,730
What is xa?

187
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,800
The weight in a.

188
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,580
What is a?

189
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,230
In our case, Google, what is b?

190
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,810
In our case, Microsoft.

191
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,390
So a and b are very generic, so it&#39;s the weight in R.

192
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,220
So see how our portfolio return depends now on both.

193
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,960
So what is the measure of the standard deviation of this guy

194
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,330
is what becomes the risk of the portfolio and that is what we are after.

195
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:07,180
Is the portfolio risk the same as the average risk of the two assets?

196
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,790
And you know that answer already.

197
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,540
Because last time I left you with 11th security then ask you this question and

198
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,810
your answer should be what?

199
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,960
No.

200
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:26,290
Randomly chosen two securities also are unlikely to have an average risk of two,

201
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,710
that&#39;s your average sigma hat of one, sigma hat of two.

202
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,169
That number cannot be the same as the standard deviation of

203
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:40,091
a portfolio of those two which will tend to be low almost always.

204
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:46,866
The one that&#39;s the portfolio and the reason is very simple.

205
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,350
It&#39;s diversification.

206
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,970
Quick question.

207
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,640
If you are adding Microsoft and Google together, and

208
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,140
you&#39;re jumping ahead a little bit, but that&#39;s my style.

209
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,840
I want you to think.

210
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,120
When will it be the case that the standard deviation of the combination of the two,

211
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,570
which we are calling a portfolio,

212
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,140
be the same as the average of the two standard deviations.

213
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,660
Leave it there, we&#39;ll come back in a minute, we&#39;ll start with that.

214
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,579
Take care, see you soon.
