Welcome back, let&#39;s have some fun.
https://youtu.be/_IkS4-11XsY
1
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:14,260
I hope you have opened up the data file called stocks-data.

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,180
And if you open it up, and it&#39;s right now on the screen,

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,840
you can stare on the screen and kind of make sure we are on the same page.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,910
The first thing you&#39;ll notice is that there are multiple columns, six of them.

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,260
And the first one is month.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,710
For simplicity, I have only labeled on thing, which is S&amp;P 500.

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,940
Now why have I included that?

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:44,740
You&#39;ll see in a second, but the other stocks are randomly chosen real stocks.

9
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,000
Turns out they&#39;re chosen over a specific time.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,330
But I&#39;ve just called them Months 1-60.

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,690
I want this part to be generic,

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,980
meaning I don&#39;t care which months you&#39;ve picked or whatever.

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,870
You should be able to execute the analysis regardless of what it is.

14
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,760
Having said that I&#39;ll also give you a corresponding assignment for

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,780
this section, which will be focused on data analysis like this.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,770
Because you see, the other kind will you see enough of those.

17
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,470
And I&#39;ll give you a new data set where I&#39;ll give you the also.

18
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,860
Or maybe camouflage them, but give you two separate time periods.

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,750
Why am I doing that?

20
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,190
It&#39;s because, first, different time

21
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,950
periods could be pulled from different parts of the economic cycle.

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,470
Remember what I told you, and you know this.

23
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,330
The economy goes into business cycles, and a lot of us don&#39;t understand why, and

24
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,280
that&#39;s one of the biggest challenges is understanding why there is a business

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,360
cycle and economics and finance to help study it all the time.

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,880
So you have 60 months of data.

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,300
Please make sure you do.

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,120
So I&#39;m going to just make sure my file up there has 60.

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,290
Okay I&#39;m going to spend a few minutes talking about this.

30
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,720
And I would encourage you to use Excel.

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,780
So total number of rows are what, 61.

32
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,650
Why?

33
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,710
Because the first row is given entirely to naming conventions.

34
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,880
So the column one is Month, S&amp;P 500, Stock 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,433
Then if you look at a particular stock return,

36
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:34,876
it is either negative or positive, which I told you is possible.

37
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:41,359
But it is not a percentage from its the way it is calculated is

38
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:46,953
kept it that way, because it is minus 0.085657.

39
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,862
So the numbers are not neat and round like we have.

40
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:54,040
However it&#39;s a pretty high monthly negative

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,370
return because it is percentage from you multiply by 100 so what do you know,

42
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,900
that month is not a very good month right and so you can almost guess

43
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,719
which period is strong during recession or during a down time or whatever.

44
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,205
So, what you also notice is that there are five such returns and

45
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:20,280
S&amp;P 500, and even the S&amp;P 500, which has how many stocks?

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,060
500 of them. On that day

47
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,050
has a huge negative return, right?

48
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,950
But one of the stocks doesn&#39;t.

49
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,550
One of the stocks has a positive return.

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,960
So this is showing you that this is just data.

51
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,060
This is how stocks behave, this is the fascinating part about the real world.

52
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,920
And that&#39;s what I love about data, is that we are going to try to capture concepts

53
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,250
and put them with data and try to make sense of them.

54
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,900
No model, I say this often in class, is right.

55
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,414
But the beauty of a really awesome model is it&#39;s simplicity versus how much of

56
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:56,220
the captures.

57
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,550
And what we are going to do in this return is we see,

58
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:06,560
this module which we call capital pressing model that we are building up to because

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,400
of it&#39;s simplicity and applicability not because it&#39;s right all the time.

60
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,810
It&#39;s the way of thinking that&#39;s right.

61
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,990
That&#39;s the awesomeness.

62
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,420
Anyway, so 60 months, why did I give you?

63
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,070
Because it takes a fair amount of data to actually calculate numbers accurately.

64
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,560
And the research has been done on it, and five years worth of monthly data,

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,189
60 data points, is considered reasonable.

66
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,590
You&#39;ll see similar estimates on Yahoo finance and

67
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,540
there they can estimate things even with up to 24 months of data so

68
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,970
that&#39;s why you have to be very careful how do you do your analysis.

69
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,340
So the data even it&#39;s identical, the data analysis is

70
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,480
a very critical component and could be right, wrong.

71
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,190
Better, and so on.

72
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,850
So, you have all this data, what am I going to do?

73
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,430
I&#39;m going to redo everything we did, with a major twist.

74
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:07,690
I will fix the one, and two stocks, like before, but real ones, over a five

75
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,700
year period, with 60 months of data I&#39;ll calculate the mean standard deviations.

76
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,530
I&#39;ll tell you how to calculate them.

77
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,790
I&#39;ll give you a bit of the flavor of Excel.

78
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,470
Remember, Excel, I don&#39;t get deeply into,

79
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,605
because I want you to take [INAUDIBLE] But I&#39;ll talk a little bit about it.

80
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:28,415
But the odd thing about there is the market portfolio.

81
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:31,785
And we will talk about that, and we&#39;ll talk about relationships.

82
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:34,737
And when we are done with this module, and we come back.

83
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:38,549
You&#39;ll see why I included S&amp;P 500.

84
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:43,940
And you&#39;ll see why covariances and correlations matter a lot.

85
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,860
So I hope this dataset is with you.

86
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,680
I hope you use it.

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,250
When we come back I&#39;ll start number crunching.

88
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,165
See you in a minute.
