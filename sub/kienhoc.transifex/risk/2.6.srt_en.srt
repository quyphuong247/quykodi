00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:08,110
So now for some calculations.
https://youtu.be/fwNurWd5zKk
1
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,480
I call it continuous data available in stock,

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,650
the data related to the previous dataset.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,610
So let&#39;s start off with the basics.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,002
We have five returns, stocks and it&#39;s simplify one.

5
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,300
Let&#39;s focus on the security returns first.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,190
So the first question is always what is the average return?

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,370
Again, in the interest of being consistent

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:39,370
even at the risk of being repetitive, let&#39;s try to draw the distribution.

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,000
That&#39;s what this is one, this is two.

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,820
You want to capture the main characteristics of the distribution,

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,850
because otherwise we are going nuts.

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,910
So what assumption will we first make.

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,190
The first assumption we make is the data we pulled is representative of the stock.

14
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,520
Now that may not be true, right?

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,090
Because we are only picking five years.

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,590
And if you pick the period of time when there was a certain trend,

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,230
it&#39;s not normal.

18
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,910
So when you think of expected average returns for

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,280
a stock, you have to think about both good and bad times.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,100
You have to think about

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,870
capturing not just one aspect of the business cycle or whatever.

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,660
So expected really means long run by a whole kind of investor.

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,140
Which by the way many people believe is the right kind of investing

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,030
instead of trying to make money, right?

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,680
Doesn&#39;t help, you can lose a lot of money when you do that.

26
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,870
So let&#39;s get started.

27
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,460
So the first number I&#39;ll calculate is R1 bar.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,370
Remember how many datapoints do I have.

29
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,250
I have 60 datapoints.

30
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,090
And the assumption I&#39;m going to make is the following,

31
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,330
which is made by a lot of people, I&#39;m going to calculate it as

32
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,130
one over N, submission R1i.

33
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,650
What assumption have I made?

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,840
It shouldn&#39;t take you long to assume that I&#39;m assuming that

35
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,910
I&#39;m just speaking equally likely events.

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,760
And I&#39;ve 60 data points so each n is one over n is one over 60.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,550
And when you do these calculation you can also do it in spreadsheet.

38
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,300
And I&#39;ll use simple symbols.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,100
You can use data analysis bags which you can bring into Excel and

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,240
so on if you have.

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,695
Or you can do it on a Google spreadsheet so let&#39;s do this.

42
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,603
Average.

43
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:49,510
Sorry, print this and then you have return the data.

44
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,090
So tell me, where are the returns of security 1 sitting?

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,290
Is it in Column A, is it in Column B or is it in Column C.

46
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,310
So match that.

47
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,770
So, I&#39;m going to write out (C2:C61).

48
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:16,590
I&#39;m making sure I&#39;ve got it right, C2:C61.

49
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,100
If I have this column wrong Go fix them.

50
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,020
Because I&#39;m, you know?

51
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,370
You can always change the columns.

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,150
Run around, make sense.

53
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,380
What I&#39;m pointing out is,

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,310
when you calculate on the Excel, you don&#39;t need to use the formula.

55
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,280
You can use the average function.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,800
And what do you need to tell them?

57
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,840
The data points.

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,960
So how many data points two through 61 is 60.

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,620
Why did I start at one?

60
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,581
Because that was the row further naming convention.

61
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:50,344
And the answer turns out to be 2.18%.

62
00:03:54,113 --> 00:04:03,200
R2 bar, 1/N submission R2i.

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,800
You can literally do it with the formula if you want to, you can go step it by and

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,860
do it, but thereâ€™s no point going through something this simple,

65
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,170
step by it, when quickly Excel can do it.

66
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:24,565
So Iâ€™m going to assume that this column is D2:D61.

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,070
Again, if I&#39;m getting the wrong symbols don&#39;t worry about it, all right?

68
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,650
You have to know which column that data is residing in.

69
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,630
Important point is this should be,

70
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,220
you should cover the range of data you want to cover.

71
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,724
And the answer turns out to be 3.25%.

72
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,262
So, let me make sure.

73
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:48,880
2.18, 3.2.

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,210
So, what can you say right now?

75
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,640
You can say that security 2 has a better average return, than security 1.

76
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,900
Higher, sorry.

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,950
You&#39;ll note, that I&#39;ll be a little bit picky.

78
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,070
Higher average return, nobody&#39;s going to argue.

79
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,340
First thing, you should remember it&#39;s over which period of time,

80
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,560
the period of 60 months I gave you.

81
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,459
And they just in the sake are corresponding to about 2009 to &#39;13,

82
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:20,210
the dataset.

83
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,710
Yes, it is high return, but is it better?

84
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,080
Answer is you cannot answer that question.

85
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,813
And you cannot typically say, it&#39;s better, because that&#39;s silly.

86
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:33,910
Of course 3.25 is better than 2.18 but

87
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,750
it&#39;s likely to also be a little bit riskier, okay.

88
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,490
So that&#39;s the notion I&#39;m trying to push is that whenever you do return analysis,

89
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,200
it&#39;s likely to suggest that you run with returns and average returns and

90
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,550
report them.

91
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,780
But remember, think in pairs, average,

92
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,310
return with risk, return, risk, return, risk.

93
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,560
Let&#39;s take a quick break because I want you to just go ahead and

94
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,460
do calculations for three, four, five.

95
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,810
And if you&#39;re, while you&#39;re at it,

96
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,790
it should take you a second or two or maybe a few seconds.

97
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,350
See you in a minute.
