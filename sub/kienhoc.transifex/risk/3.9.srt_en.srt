Welcome back.
https://youtu.be/NWTtodXNBLg
1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,400
So now we are into the land of measuring the risk of a project.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,740
Circling back to the reason why we started.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,250
And the risk of a project, we now begin to understand,

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,500
has very little to do with its own variants.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,418
But will have a lot to do with the relationship of the project,

6
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:31,350
with larger portfolios because that&#39;s what introduce all.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,140
Risk of an idea/project/asset has to measure its

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,500
relationship with other assets.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,530
And the equation most famous, tt&#39;s called a market model,

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,000
I&#39;ll show you some equations and now you see why we did regressions.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,500
Okay, look at this equation.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,060
What does it say?

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,550
Suppose you pick a particular specific security I, and

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,180
I have given you five of them.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,800
Pick one, but let&#39;s call it security one for the fun of it, Amazon.

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,890
Right? Cuz remember we&#39;re going to do rainforest,

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,410
evaluate and we go to Amazon.

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,640
So coming full circle back to some example that underlies all of these.

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,470
I have an idea to rainforest but

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,820
Rainforest was closed to Amazon and cost of capital comes from.

21
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,910
The next best alternative.

22
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,690
So ri is Amazon&#39;s return.

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,620
Alpha i is the intercept.

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:37,390
Slope is beta i, rm is market return, and epsilon is error.

25
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,830
This is regression and that&#39;s what I meant.

26
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,600
The beauty of finance is the following.

27
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,820
If you look at this regression, it&#39;s understanding the relationship

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,690
between Amazon and the whole market portfolio.

29
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,130
Remember, the market portfolio should be held by the largest possible

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,680
set of securities under the sun because you&#39;re trying to capture

31
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,870
common risk across the whole world.

32
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,750
That&#39;s why I said trying 2000 securities.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,200
Ideally, it should also have what?

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,550
Real assets.

35
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,920
It should have bonds.

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,680
It should have all of those.

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,320
And fortunately, real assets don&#39;t trade often.

38
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,730
Those that trade, the equity trading makes them measurable.

39
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,710
Bonds don&#39;t trade as often as equity, so many times it&#39;s simply 500 is used or

40
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,980
SL200 which is just docks to capture stuff, okay?

41
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,780
Most of the stuff.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,360
Let&#39;s keep going.

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,440
So rm is market return can be measured it, yes.

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,770
ri, can I measure Amazon&#39;s return?

45
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,270
Yes.

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,690
So you can run a regression.

47
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,980
So you run this regression and what is the beta?

48
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,110
Beta is up there and you made a call.

49
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,850
And right now I&#39;m not doing estimates.

50
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,630
We&#39;ll do estimates.

51
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,950
So there&#39;s no hats on top.

52
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,020
What is sigma im?

53
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,180
Sigma im is the relationship between Amazon,

54
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,790
which is i and the market portfolio measured by the S&amp;P 500 or

55
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,670
Russel 2000 depending on your choice.

56
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,490
In today&#39;s world I would use global market portfolios, not because

57
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,380
forms are global but in investors are globally diversified, remember

58
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,570
whenever you link this analysis looking from the standpoint of an investor.

59
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,000
These things are extremely important, but many people don&#39;t understand fully and

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,070
therefore they do wrong analysis or think incorrectly, right?

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,670
So quick question, how many relationships.

62
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,488
Come again, how many relationships are being measured?

63
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:51,120
By this guy.

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,570
&gt;&gt; So your arm is on, your 500 say S and

65
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,024
P 500 how many relationships have been measured?

66
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:07,320
&gt;&gt; 499 &gt;&gt; Because one of those 500 is Amazon.

67
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,008
So when you do Amazon with itself, what do we call that?

68
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:13,840
Sigma i squared.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,750
The rest are sigma i.

70
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,870
Somebody else do [INAUDIBLE].

71
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,660
So what&#39;s going to dominate this, not this.

72
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,880
But this 499 representative.

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,190
It turns out the symmetrics that you&#39;re capturing.

74
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,910
Basically, many more.

75
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,470
Twice as much, okay?

76
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,710
So sigma squared m is the variance.

77
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,770
Sigma m is the covariance of m is on with that.

78
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,450
So the awesomeness of this beta is the slope of our regression but

79
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,710
in the context of finance it measures what we want to which is called

80
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,860
the risk of Amazon in a portfolio.

81
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,990
The risk of Amazon by itself makes no sense,

82
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,365
it only makes sense in a portfolio, and guess what?

83
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:05,240
[LAUGH] This measure of risk is called beta,

84
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,430
because regressions, the slope parameter is called beta.

85
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,820
So you see why I think finances are awesome because

86
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,000
it takes something that was conceptualized by humans and makes it real.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,420
It&#39;s almost like regressions.

88
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,470
We&#39;re waiting for finance to happen.

89
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,850
Let&#39;s take a break here and think about this a little bit.

90
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,570
And the thing I want you to think about it is the awesomeness

91
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,770
of the correlation of the, sorry.

92
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,970
But not intended.

93
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,530
Awesomeness of the relationship between the concept.

94
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,710
And your ability to measure it, not perfectly but to measure it.

95
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,590
That&#39;s what so awesome about finance.

96
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,650
This is not just equations in your head.

97
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,110
It&#39;s the ease with which you can actually measure stuff.

98
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,230
One caution, one major footnote, whenever you&#39;re estimating stuff,

99
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:03,380
like betas, we can do it quick and dirty and we learn how to do it.

100
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,370
But many times the assumptions you&#39;re making about stuff are not right.

101
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,290
You don&#39;t use the right data, you use wrong samples, only uptime and so on.

102
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,950
So there are professional, this is where I would use warm

103
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,140
up on statistics, or use professional services like Morningstar.

104
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,700
Which is an arms lend company that does all this work.

105
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,690
It also estimates betas with accuracy and so on.

106
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,330
So let&#39;s come back, think about it.

107
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,450
Beta matters, sigma square doesn&#39;t matter for Amazon.

108
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,480
I hope I&#39;ve convinced you that.

109
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,920
And when we come back, I&#39;ll go one step forward and show you, go from the measure

110
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,320
of risk to what we eventually want is the rate of return that relates the two.

111
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,134
See you in a minute.
