00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,110
Okay, let&#39;s do some data.
https://youtu.be/OXoNupVop6c
1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,100
We&#39;re having fun?

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,110
We have three assets.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,178
You have a stock.data.

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,860
You have three securities for sure, 1, 2, 3.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,420
And let&#39;s assume for simplicity what are the weights in all three.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,800
Something that I forget mentioning but is important, equally weighted.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,913
So you&#39;re just weighting a third, a third, a third.

8
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:30,974
You can off course choose to distribute the weights,

9
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:33,976
that&#39;s another way of how diversification works.

10
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:38,995
So take an extreme example, I have three securities in my portfolio but

11
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:44,970
I put weight on only one of them, that&#39;s not diversification, right?

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,894
Anyway, what are the average returns of securities 1, 2, and 3?

13
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:51,254
And I&#39;m going to write them down and

14
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:54,880
this should be pretty straightforward to figure out.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,182
2.18, we already did, 3.25, we already did,

16
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:05,490
and 2.26, you should have done while I was talking.

17
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:08,786
It&#39;s just the average function.

18
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:15,848
What is the average return of the portfolio of the three securities?

19
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:20,710
If you&#39;re [INAUDIBLE] a portfolio of three securities, what will you do?

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,729
Create a new column called Rp.

21
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:33,455
Put a third R1 + one-third R2 + one-third R3,

22
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:39,510
they are sitting in some columns, see?

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,810
And you start with two because that&#39;s the first data item,

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,710
c2, d2, e2, third, third, third.

25
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,030
That&#39;s the portfolio.

26
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,980
You&#39;ve got the first number in column, whatever you call it.

27
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,880
Item, row number two.

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,950
Drag down bring it back to 61.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,570
So you&#39;ll have column 2 through 61.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,700
I hope you&#39;re understanding what I&#39;m talking about and doing it because to me,

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,370
that&#39;s the fun part, is that I&#39;m not always writing out everything.

32
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,083
And you&#39;re actually actively engaged rather than sitting back drinking in

33
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,290
your class of wine and watching me,

34
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,842
which is fine too if that&#39;s what makes you learn faster.

35
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,724
What is the average journal portfolio?

36
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,065
See, you call the portfolio and then calculate the average.

37
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:30,656
Turns out this number will be 2.56%.

38
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:32,982
And very quickly, since we&#39;ve done this before,

39
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:34,616
we are beginning to get a hang of it.

40
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:37,829
How is it related to these?

41
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:49,028
And the answer will be, they are the, Same.

42
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:49,783
Why?

43
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:54,887
Because averaging is linear, and a portfolio is a linear

44
00:02:54,887 --> 00:03:02,240
combination of the returns of three securities, in this case equally weighted.

45
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,670
Does that make sense?

46
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,574
Do it, and if I stare at it, it makes sense, right?

47
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:12,229
So you have 2.18, 2.26, and 3.25, pretty far off.

48
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:19,000
So the answer is likely to be somewhere between 2.26 and 3.15.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,240
And answer turns out to be 2.56.

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,410
Now of course if I make silly mistakes, what will you do?

51
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,304
Gotham is a silly guy, we&#39;re gonna fix it, no worries.

52
00:03:28,304 --> 00:03:31,516
If I make a conceptual error, that&#39;s a problem.

53
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:36,150
And I doubt I will because I&#39;m trying very hard to make sure I&#39;m well prepared, but

54
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,080
I&#39;m human I could make a mistake.

55
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,780
And we can then fix it and keep going, right?

56
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,540
That&#39;s the beauty of the digital world.

57
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,600
Whereas in the real world, sometime I feel like if I said something wrong in the real

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,070
class, the class of 50, and I didn&#39;t even realize it, is there a possibility

59
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,030
that one point may stay with them and make them confused.

60
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,260
Less opportunity to go fix it.

61
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,060
And that&#39;s another advantage of digital education.

62
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,740
So why don&#39;t we do this?

63
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,800
Let&#39;s keep going and talk about variances.

64
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,071
I will assume you have already created a portfolio of three

65
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:22,443
securities in a column 2 through 61, to make life simple.

66
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:24,863
What are the risks of the three securities?

67
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:29,290
And here, let&#39;s talk about risks in terms of variances.

68
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,706
So write out the variances.

69
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:35,820
Sigma square hat, 0.0127,

70
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,934
sigma 2 square hat 0.0102,

71
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:44,002
sigma 3 square hat,

72
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:48,616
it should take you as much time.

73
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:56,519
Sorry, 116.

74
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,560
So which function are you using?

75
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,607
And the function you wanna use is VAR.S.

76
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:06,380
.S is because you&#39;re using a sample,

77
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,000
we don&#39;t have all the data on all these companies.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,690
That&#39;s almost impossible, right?

79
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,210
So, okay, so you&#39;ve done these three.

80
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,248
What is the risk of the portfolio of the three securities?

81
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:22,663
Now this is very easy to do if you&#39;ve calculated the portfolio return,

82
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:25,022
which I&#39;m assuming you have.

83
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:32,581
And it&#39;ll work out to be 0.0053.

84
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:35,093
So what is the risk of the portfolio of the three securities?

85
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:37,180
0.0053.

86
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,370
How did I calculate it?

87
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,520
I just went to the column, did VAR.S, 2 through 61 of

88
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,460
the column in which portfolio of the three securities you&#39;ve created.

89
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,330
First, create the portfolio return and

90
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,480
then worry about variances, otherwise you&#39;ll go nuts.

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,230
How many items will you have to add up?

92
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,370
9, right?

93
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,625
How is it related to the average of the three securities?

94
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,966
Now the average of the three securities is pretty straightforward.

95
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:11,135
Remember, I just have to average the top three numbers and

96
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:16,949
it turns out to be 0.0115, very similar to 0.0016.

97
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:17,517
Why?

98
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:23,402
Because the average of the first two was already around 0.000114.

99
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:25,560
So, something like that number.

100
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,701
So you&#39;re not changing the average very much going from 2 to 3.

101
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,890
Quick, can you please compare the risk of

102
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:41,380
the sigma square hat b with the third item, 0.0015?

103
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,720
Which is much lower.

104
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,900
This is much lower than this.

105
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,675
But the question I&#39;m asking is, go back and

106
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:56,562
compare this with the portfolio of 1 and 2.

107
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,510
How much was that?

108
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,060
I think that was 0.0061.

109
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:12,130
So, the drop from combining one and two was drastic.

110
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:20,390
The drop from going from 1, 2 to 1, 2, 3 is not as much.

111
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,090
And the reason will back to what, you have already gotten a lot of diversification.

112
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,790
Simply because you started over two securities,

113
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,690
which correlation was very low.

114
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,610
And then you added a third and the correlation is not as low.

115
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,010
So there are those reasons, I would ask you to mess around the data.

116
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,200
I&#39;m asking good questions here, I think.

117
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,640
And what your goal should be, I&#39;m giving you the answers, which in sometimes is

118
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,680
dysfunctional, but I&#39;m doing that simply because numbers are very cool to compare.

119
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,590
You can talk concept forever and you bang your head against the wall.

120
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,872
And the beauty of finance is you can at least calculate numbers for

121
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:05,240
most of the concepts we talk about.

122
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,470
The tragedy of finance is, I believe,

123
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:14,070
that we haven&#39;t included a lot of people in society

124
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,720
into the beauty of how to create value through financial thinking.

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,610
And part of the reason I&#39;m doing MOOCs, or I love MOOCs,

126
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,600
is hopefully I&#39;m changing that a little bit in my own way.

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,720
But talk about that later.

128
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,220
See you soon.
