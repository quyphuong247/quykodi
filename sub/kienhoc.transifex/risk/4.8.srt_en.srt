00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome back, so now let&#39;s get into some number crunching.
https://youtu.be/HqfUAWmMGh8
1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:17,578
Okay, focused mainly on valuation, but also mainly on cost of capital.

2
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:23,440
To me, that needs more emphasis, because we have spent a lot of time,

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,340
especially over, in finance, we spend a lot of time on time value of money,

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,470
and bond pricing, and stock pricing, a lot of examples.

5
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,750
But risk and return, I think,

6
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,460
are much more powerful because of compounding at huge impacts.

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,798
So we need to get that right.

8
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:43,093
Really right, at least the way we think, and

9
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:46,810
then refine our practical applications.

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,170
Okay, so let&#39;s get started.

11
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,590
Question number 1, what is Kitchen Inc&#39;s cost of capital

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,680
before it undertakes the construction business?

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,000
So important, I&#39;m not asking you the cost of capital of the new business, But

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,455
what is Kitchen Inc&#39;s cost of capital?

15
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:05,546
Remember, no taxes.

16
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:07,440
Simplicity, let&#39;s keep it simple.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,056
So, let&#39;s draw a graph first.

18
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:17,940
And let&#39;s call it K Business, Kitchen Inc., I mean Kitchen business.

19
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,510
You have assets, and what do you have?

20
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,510
Kitchen stuff.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,087
And what do you have on your liability side?

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,850
You have only equity, you have debt zero.

23
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,480
Do you remember that?

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,880
Yeah?

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,050
You also know or have estimated the beta equity equals one.

26
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,320
What else do you need to know here?

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,113
I want to figure out what, cashflows I&#39;m not interested in right now.

28
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:57,968
I&#39;m interested in cost of capital.

29
00:01:57,968 --> 00:01:59,899
Which is equal to what?

30
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:00,629
WAC.

31
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:06,535
But because debt is zero, it is equal to Re.

32
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:09,762
And Re is equal to what?

33
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:14,140
Rf plus Rm minus Rf.

34
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,630
I&#39;m not using the expectation signs, beta equity.

35
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,807
But of which business?

36
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,270
Kitchen business.

37
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,640
Do I know the numbers?

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,295
Yes.

39
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:28,274
2.5.

40
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:32,900
This much is 5 percent.

41
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,030
And since I&#39;m figuring out beta equity, how much is it?

42
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,280
One.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:49,237
Answer is Pretty straightforward, pretty easy, right?

44
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,953
And that&#39;s what I meant,

45
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:55,327
the beauty of a powerful idea is how parsimonously you capture it.

46
00:02:55,327 --> 00:03:00,200
Meaning, how simply you can capture it, and how far it can take you.

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,490
Of course, you don&#39;t wanna make things so simple that you basically trivialize them.

48
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,310
But I think capital is not doing that.

49
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,990
Capital is extremely powerful, making assumptions, not right,

50
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,930
perfectly, but on the right track in such a simple equation.

51
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,100
Dangerous to abuse that, okay.

52
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,040
So, we got that first question.

53
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,610
I&#39;ll do a couple of questions at a time, and

54
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,940
then take a break, because I want you to work along with me, okay.

55
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,650
Question number two.

56
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,860
What is the IRR of the new project?

57
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,178
So, let me just qualify that, and remind you, what is the new project.

58
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:41,305
Construction.

59
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:48,720
So, construction is not equal to, I&#39;m giving you a hint, Kitchen.

60
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,190
Okay. They are not the same business.

61
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,190
You may require construction to put in Kitchen staff.

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,960
Sorry.

63
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,640
I thought that was really funny.

64
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,530
But they are very different businesses, right?

65
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,900
So, even though, kind of we could&#39;ve taken a totally different business, but

66
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,560
I thought, let&#39;s start with construction.

67
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,340
Okay, quick question.

68
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,296
Why am I asking to do calculation of IRR?

69
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:13,450
For two reasons.

70
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,630
The real world does it.

71
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,486
And secondly, I have given you the cashflows and they&#39;re well-behaved.

72
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:22,810
What do I mean by well-behaved cash flows?

73
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,770
Negative, positive, positive, positive.

74
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,070
Point number one, so IRR will be well behaved.

75
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,614
Point number two, I&#39;m not comparing two different projects of different lives.

76
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:37,135
I could have problems there.

77
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:38,710
I just have one project.

78
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,190
So if the well-behaved cashflows are there, and one project is there,

79
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,900
IRR greater than R will work, right?

80
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,830
Or NPV positive.

81
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,420
Okay, let&#39;s write out the cash flows.

82
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,460
If you recall the numbers, how much are you spending at time 0?

83
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,900
Negative $100

84
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:07,513
million, right?

85
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:08,490
Yeah?

86
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,960
That&#39;s the easy part.

87
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,590
Now what&#39;s new is the cashflow in year one could have three components.

88
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,730
The first one was what?

89
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:27,130
Its expected c1, not c1, is what we need to calculate.

90
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,497
So the three components,

91
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:35,399
the first one is 0.40 times 15.

92
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:47,880
Let me double-check whether this is the right number, or not.

93
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,310
I knew I was off by a little bit.

94
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,309
So, this was 25 million.

95
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,778
So .4 times 25 million?

96
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:58,959
But 30 percent probability.

97
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,008
That&#39;s the part I was thinking of, 15 million and

98
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:08,150
30 percent probability, was how much?

99
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,570
Nada, nothing.

100
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,345
The good news is that my analysis,

101
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:20,455
probabilities add up to 1, and on average, how much do I get?

102
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:22,600
.4 times 25 million is?

103
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,645
10 million.

104
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:25,650
.3 times 15 million is?

105
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,506
5 million.

106
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:30,960
So my expected cashflow in period 1 is 15 million.

107
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:34,970
Yeah?

108
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:38,690
Let me make sure, 15 million.

109
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,370
So I am making 15 million in the first year, but what is the good news?

110
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,090
These cashflows are expected to remain the same.

111
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,620
So C1 is equal to C2, is equal to C3, is equal forever.

112
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,560
So you&#39;re going to get $15 million every year, till infinity, more or less.

113
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,740
More or less I say, there&#39;s no such thing as infinity, right?

114
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,980
So the question I&#39;m asking you is, what is the IRR?

115
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,680
Tricky, no?

116
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,698
You should be able to tell me.

117
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:13,650
I&#39;ll pause.

118
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,070
IRR Is that rate of return which makes NPV 0.

119
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:24,990
IRR is that rate of return which makes NPV 0.

120
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,726
So, quick question.

121
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:33,813
What is NPV?

122
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:39,650
C/R- I0 should be = 0.

123
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,538
Why did I add C over R?

124
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:42,038
Sorry.

125
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,490
Expected C.

126
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,140
And this is IRR.

127
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,410
So E(c) over IRR- I0 should be 0.

128
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,720
If I solve this equation, I get IRR.

129
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,720
Why did I write expected C over IRR?

130
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,170
Because I know it&#39;s a perpetuity, and what&#39;s the formula for a perpetuity?

131
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,540
C over R.

132
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,080
Substitute, do I know this, do I know this?

133
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,230
Yes, and yes.

134
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,254
And the answer, IRR is 15 percent.

135
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,000
You see how cool it is.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,906
So I&#39;ve always, I&#39;ve almost done a review of the whole finance course,

137
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,325
the one thing missing is.

138
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:22,680
[LAUGH] Sorry.

139
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,828
The only thing missing is, I don&#39;t have a G in this.

140
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:31,064
So we&#39;ve figured out the IRR of this project is 15 percent.

141
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:33,380
I&#39;ll ask you one more question.

142
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,590
Pause there, come back.

143
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,750
Should Kitchen Inc take the new project?

144
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,070
See you in a minute.
