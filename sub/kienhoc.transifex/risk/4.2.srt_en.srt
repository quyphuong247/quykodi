00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:09,382
Welcome, so we are talking about now a firm that has assets that
https://youtu.be/zrwBoRhs87k
1
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:12,160
are financed by both equity and debt.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,446
Please remember things are gonna get a little tricky.

3
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:17,720
In fact, quite tricky.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,590
But if you stay focused on where value&#39;s created, you&#39;ll understand.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,320
Why one of the things we&#39;ll talk about now got another Nobel prize.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,310
You see, that&#39;s the amazing thing about finance, is it&#39;s the only

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,440
discipline in business that has gotten Nobel prizes repeatedly.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,640
And the reason is because it is very framework strong.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,180
And it provides you ways of looking at the world that are not necessarily

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,630
give you the right answers because right answers are tough to come up with but

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,200
gives you the right way of approaching things.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,920
A much better way.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,670
Okay, so it&#39;s discipline, it&#39;s framework oriented, and it&#39;s extremely practical.

14
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,610
Things that you would want to like, right?

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,950
About any subject matter.

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,900
So let&#39;s assume a firm is financed by equity and debt.

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,060
As you learn in the financing course, those are the only two instruments.

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,400
They can be many different kinds.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,160
Convertible debt, referred equity, name it.

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,150
But the neat thing about debt and equity is that there are two things,

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,800
combinations of them describe everything else.

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,000
So in the notes I call them hybrids.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,700
So if you understand equity and debt,

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,900
you&#39;ll be able to understand any other instrument.

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,670
Not automatically.

26
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,140
You have to think about it.

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,680
But debt and equity I talked about most because they characterize the entire

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,280
spectrum of possible kinds of financing you could have.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,750
Equity and debt capture most important aspect of financing,

30
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,358
and they&#39;re also called the capital structure of the firm.

31
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:59,080
A path-breaking result, and this got the Nobel Prize.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,920
Please stare at the screen while I talk.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,380
In a world with competitive markets and no frictions.

34
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,720
What does competitive markets mean?

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,970
That the money flows to the best ideas.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,910
And the best ideas are not monopolistically controlled by any firm.

37
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,730
Not true most of the time.

38
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,800
Competitive markets, if they existed, we won&#39;t have many big companies

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,113
become bigger and bigger but we are very close to competitive markets and

40
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:35,430
that&#39;s the pressure we have like democracy is

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,060
kind of a law of nature almost among humans beings wanting democracy.

42
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,020
Markets are similar in nature.

43
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,800
So we&#39;re going to assume more or less competitive markets.

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,940
Because if you assume markets are not competitive,

45
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,470
a lot of what we are talking about becomes almost irrelevant.

46
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,650
It&#39;s a good way of thinking, but doesn&#39;t become practically very useful.

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,490
And markets are competitive, the less there are frictions.

48
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,210
So frictions are things that prevent competitiveness.

49
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,560
So let me give you an example.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,400
An obvious friction is taxes.

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,620
So what does taxes do?

52
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,390
They throw distortions that create problems of stuff.

53
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,100
And we&#39;ll talk about it in a second, what that happens.

54
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,590
So friction taxes is one form of friction there are other forms of friction,

55
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,510
extremely important so for example we will assume here

56
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,230
that the manager is working in the interest of the company and

57
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,790
the company is owned by shareholders who work in the interest of the long term.

58
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,200
So we are making a lot of assumptions which are fundamental foundational

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,810
assumptions of modern man so that you understand what&#39;s going on.

60
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,900
And those are the kind of things that get Nobel Prizes.

61
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,560
And then you tweak the system based on reality and

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,098
know which direction and what magnitude effects you&#39;ll have.

63
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:58,620
If you can&#39;t understand the basic world

64
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,580
in a competitive environment with very little friction, I don&#39;t think you can go

65
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,730
to the more complicated world as easily, or in fact, you may get confused.

66
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,610
So here&#39;s the path-breaking result.

67
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,520
It&#39;s called M&amp;M.

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,160
Not as in chocolate.

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,290
But it has Modigliani-Miller.

70
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,120
A very profound, Nobel Prize winning idea.

71
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,160
It says the following, regardless how you finance your company

72
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,700
or in this case your project, your project&#39;s value will not change.

73
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,700
When this was said it was in the late 50s, 60s people talked including academics.

74
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,790
Are you kidding me?

75
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,600
This can&#39;t be true.

76
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,420
We&#39;ll not prove it but I&#39;ll give you an intuition for it and

77
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,510
then you&#39;ll see it over and over again, but then with frictions.

78
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:58,410
So you&#39;ll see more and more frictions come in more advanced courses or

79
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,380
even more basic courses on financing because that&#39;s the real world.

80
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,860
And we&#39;ll end off with some frictions here as well.

81
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,280
But as you see more and more frictions, you&#39;ll be able to understand why the world

82
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,850
changes with frictions, because you understand this word.

83
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:21,205
Value is created by your ideas, and not how you finance them.

84
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,570
This is what got the Nobel Prize.

85
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,920
So let me give an example.

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,730
We just valued Amazon with or without debt.

87
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,840
We assumed it had close to zero debt and

88
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,160
its value turned out to be whatever, $350 billion.

89
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,501
What this says is that if there were no frictions in the world,

90
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:48,072
then even if Amazon had debt, its value would still be

91
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:53,172
created by its real assets and remain at $350 billion.

92
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,332
Why?

93
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:59,336
Because where exactly is your value being created, and how?

94
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:03,240
And I&#39;m not gonna put up that one page because you&#39;ve seen it so many times.

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,270
It&#39;s on the left hand side, from my side.

96
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,530
The left hand side, where the real assets sit.

97
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,170
Financing is the way to make it happen.

98
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,100
But the real idea generates cash flows, and

99
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,680
you discount it by the return on assets.

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,610
Not return on equity.

101
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,280
Not return on debt because that&#39;s what you take your asset return and

102
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,570
split up between the two.

103
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,580
Extremely important and I can prove it and talk about it forever.

104
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,420
What&#39;s extremely important about this is its intuition.

105
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,870
And intuition says the following.

106
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,530
Very simple.

107
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,770
You create value by coming up with an idea.

108
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,890
And then if you put in only your money or

109
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,080
raised equity, your money will go only to equity.

110
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,370
And what&#39;s the difference between equity and debt?

111
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,650
You know a little bit about it.

112
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,860
You&#39;ll know a lot more as you go into financing.

113
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,680
Debt is a fixed contract and

114
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,540
equity is not a contract, it&#39;s an expectational relationship.

115
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,810
So which is more risky equity, which is less risky debt.

116
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,120
And here&#39;s your cost of capital and stare at the next equation please write it down.

117
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,710
Cost of capital is also in this world called rated average cost of capital.

118
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,220
I again emphasize, what do I mean by this world?

119
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,550
I mean a world in which there are no frictions, there are no taxes.

120
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,010
We&#39;ll understand this world completely and

121
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,220
then we&#39;ll start messing with taxes and so on.

122
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,970
And there developments have happened that you can go pretty deep

123
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,040
even in the introductory set of courses.

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,930
For now, no taxes.

125
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,260
So this is what you cost of capital will look like.

126
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,300
The first proposition was that the value of your firm

127
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,130
will not change based on financing.

128
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,980
The second proposition is the following, that your return on assets will be called

129
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:11,640
weighted average cost of capital, which is WACC, weighted average cost of capital.

130
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,130
Please stare at the screen while I talk, this is one of those moments So

131
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,023
return on assets will be D over E+D.

132
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:22,470
What is that?

133
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,410
D+E is the value of the whole firm.

134
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,390
Why?

135
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,520
Because in a balance sheet, remember and

136
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,200
let me just draw a little balance sheet on the side.

137
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,090
You have assets.

138
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:41,510
And you have equity and you have debt.

139
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,880
So, the value of the return on the assets.

140
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:55,050
And the cash flow of you assets, cash flow determine the value of the firm.

141
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,140
So cash flow, I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve estimated, we&#39;ll do an example later.

142
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,990
Now you focused on return on assets.

143
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,960
So how do you determine your return on assets?

144
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,540
If there is no debt your return on asset is equal to return on equity.

145
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,060
Why? Because D is zero and E is everything.

146
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,980
Now you are ready so now stare at this.

147
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,720
What is D over E plus D.

148
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,490
It&#39;s the proportion of the value of the firm, total firm that is financed by debt.

149
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,620
Do you see that?

150
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,110
Because E plus D will be what?

151
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,540
The value of the firm, total firm we&#39;ll call that V.

152
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,720
So very straightforward this balance sheet has to balance.

153
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,160
The value for whole firm has to be split between equity and debt.

154
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,930
In fact that&#39;s the notion that&#39;s pretty straightforward.

155
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,990
The critical notion here is what generates value.

156
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,890
People think equity can generate, no, no, no.

157
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,800
Value generated by cash flows of the firm and the discount rate.

158
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,680
And we know this we&#39;ve done this, we&#39;ll do more at the end.

159
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,750
So what is the cost of capital?

160
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,230
The cost of capital is the weight of debt in your capital,

161
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,030
multiplied by return on debt.

162
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,470
Why this E and we are dropping it here simply because it&#39;s expected return.

163
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,230
Right, as soon as you go to corporate you don&#39;t have RF.

164
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,250
What do you have?

165
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,880
Risk and therefore expected return.

166
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,370
And what is this, expected return on equity.

167
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,600
What does this stand for?

168
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,100
A little bit superfluous But

169
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,490
this stands for leverage and many people call it leverage, leverage, whatever.

170
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,060
But leverage means the following.

171
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,810
It means an equity of a firm that also has debt.

172
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,330
Because if the firm has no debt the E will be by itself.

173
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,100
So this is just emphasizing that you&#39;re looking at a capital structure which has

174
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,250
both debt and equity.

175
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,660
One more time.

176
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,289
Ra expected will be a weighted average of Re and

177
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,981
Rd where the rates will add up to one.

178
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,772
If you stare at this without any numbers what are the weights?

179
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:16,020
One, which makes sense, because the whole firm is financed just by equity and debt.

180
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,190
Now if there&#39;s perfect equity, if there is convertible debt, what will it become?

181
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,710
More terms with rates that all add up to one.

182
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,390
Take it from me that has to be true because the balance sheet has to balance.

183
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,315
Take it with me a more complicated point for the time being.

184
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:40,340
Rd, Re, our debt and equity capture almost all characteristics.

185
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,940
If you combine the characteristics you can create new types of securities.

186
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,170
So what I want to do is take a pause here, when we come back I&#39;m going to

187
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,270
focus on one element on the right hand side before we go there and

188
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:01,370
I&#39;ll talk about what on this equation will not change, and the things will change.

189
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,100
So let&#39;s take a break, come back, please write down this equation.

190
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,560
I hope you already have, and we will go back and forth.

191
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,020
This is one of the most famous equations in the world right now, no taxes.

192
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,250
So don&#39;t get too confused when you see the real world equation with taxes.

193
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:18,850
See you in a minute.
