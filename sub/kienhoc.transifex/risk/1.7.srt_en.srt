00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:08,790
Welcome back, and now things get fun.
https://youtu.be/cAn3P2TYk3s
1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,210
I will keep my hands tied a little bit because I want you to

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,260
first get a flavor of stuff before we do data analysis right?

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,190
So I&#39;m keeping data separate for the time being.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,680
So now the question becomes, what else do we need to know?

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,370
We know return, we know risk.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,550
We know mean returns, we like them, the higher the better.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,490
We dislike standard deviations.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,000
So what&#39;s left to talk about?

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:41,810
And that&#39;s where folks got Nobel Prizes, two of them, specific to this notion.

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,140
And, let&#39;s talk about it.

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,240
So, the question becomes,

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,840
if each one of us were holding just one security, are you holding IBM?

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,550
I was holding Xerox, we are done.

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,030
We know how to measure the return and risk of IBM.

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,050
Just get the data, calculate, and we&#39;ll do that in detail.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,050
And I call to IBM and we are all having fun.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,350
Turns out we are not a risk-loving people

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,000
because only a risk-loving people would put all their eggs in one basket.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,960
What are we?

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,900
Risk averse.

21
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,580
So it becomes very complex, but beautiful at the same time.

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,910
So if we are risk averse, what will we hold?

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,190
We will never hold one thing.

24
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,230
We&#39;ll hold multiple things.

25
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,620
And who is we?

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,230
The investor.

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,600
Remember, we could be a manager of a company, but

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,580
we in our real life will also behave like that, in our investments, right?

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,440
So we hold a multiple thing, and that multiple thing is called portfolio.

30
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,980
And I&#39;m going to first give you intuition, and

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,524
then you&#39;ll go into a lot of detail on diversification because diversification

32
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:07,330
can get very complex with the math in there and so on.

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,820
But it&#39;s so intuitive that I want to go there.

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,740
So imagine, that you have IBM.

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,550
If you are holding only IBM what is its risk?

36
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,545
What is its expected return?

37
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,370
And let&#39;s put hats, because you estimate this.

38
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,740
Done.

39
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,800
But you&#39;re not holding IBM by itself.

40
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:35,380
You&#39;d be silly to hold IBM by itself.

41
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,130
Why?

42
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,240
Because if you&#39;re risk averse, what are you taking on?

43
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,510
Lots of risk, for no reason whatsoever, as you&#39;ll see.

44
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,167
Because we are risk averse what do we do?

45
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:51,640
We combine IBM with Xerox another company.

46
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,230
We combine it with Walmart.

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,240
We combine it with a lot of firms and

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,890
many times people buy index and this is becoming very common.

49
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,320
Index investing.

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,080
So, you could invest in a portfolio that looks like the S&amp;P 500.

51
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,570
What is S&amp;P 500?

52
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,180
Just for those who don&#39;t know it&#39;s Standard and Poor&#39;s 500 stocks.

53
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,910
Portfolio that trades, and you can follow it.

54
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,655
Go to Yahoo Finance, you can follow it.

55
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:27,460
You can also follow Dow Jones, you can follow, which has only 30, or 10,

56
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,940
depending on which one you&#39;re looking or, you can follow Russell&#39;s 2000,

57
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,240
which means, how many stocks are in there, and so on, and so forth.

58
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,320
So, people, hold, now, large portfolios, up to 500, and for two reasons.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,210
One, that they want a portfolio

60
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,565
because they don&#39;t want to put everything in one basket.

61
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:46,738
But, why S&amp;P 500?

62
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:53,590
Because you could hold only 60 stocks, but you&#39;ll have to pick them up individually.

63
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,820
So if you&#39;re going to pick them up individually you might as well hold

64
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,242
an existing portfolio because transaction costs will go down drastically.

65
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:07,310
So Vanguard among others started this whole wave and

66
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:14,730
this is a very controversial issue is that a lot of investing companies are creating

67
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,320
portfolios where it&#39;s not very obvious they&#39;re giving you more returns.

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,000
They are doing it because they are making money every time you

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,510
turn a portfolio that is buy and sell stocks within.

70
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,860
The transaction costs are paid by you, but who&#39;s making money?

71
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,284
The broker, both sides.

72
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:32,974
Whether you&#39;re selling for a gain or

73
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:37,333
selling because you worry about loss or whatever, right?

74
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,430
So S&amp;P 500.

75
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,070
But how many stocks are there?

76
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,470
500 in the S&amp;P 500.

77
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,920
I actually asked this in class and, how many stocks are in?

78
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,280
So, what happens then?

79
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,880
So think of IBM now, not by itself, but

80
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,620
within a portfolio of 500 and

81
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,420
that changes the definition of risk of IBM.

82
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,970
IBM&#39;s risk can no longer be just its own standard deviation, it turns out.

83
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,310
And I&#39;m jumping ahead, and we&#39;ll come back to it,

84
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,700
because it&#39;s really cool, really awesome but also a little bit complex.

85
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,045
IBM&#39;s risk no longer is it&#39;s standard deviation, but

86
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:28,280
it&#39;ll depend on how IBM fits in this portfolio.

87
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,264
In other words, it will depend the return of IBM relates to the other 499.

88
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,180
One more time.

89
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,890
If you were holding IBM to return by itself, its risk is very obvious.

90
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,090
But you&#39;ll never, you&#39;ll always hold it in a portfolio.

91
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,780
Once it&#39;s in a portfolio, the movements of IBM that are relevant will

92
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,980
become those that are related to the other stocks and not the movement by itself.

93
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,450
And recall, I said there are two types of risks, market risks and

94
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,320
specific risks and it&#39;s related to that.

95
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,850
So what I am going to do now is statistics needed to understand how to measure

96
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,190
relationships because IBM will never be held by itself but in a portfolio.

97
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,840
And once in a portfolio its relationships with things inside the portfolio

98
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,850
start mattering and we&#39;ll come back measure them conceptually.

99
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,410
We&#39;ll wrap up stuff with that stuff for

100
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,830
this segment, which is, I would say more on the conceptual side.

101
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,010
But as I said, if you don&#39;t know concept,

102
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,460
especially in risk and return, if you don&#39;t know why we are studying them,

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,010
you&#39;ll have a tough time just implementing or worse, you&#39;ll be thrilled with

104
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,290
the statistics with the data I gave you, but you won&#39;t know why you&#39;re doing it.

105
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,840
I think the second problem is worse.

106
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,300
I worry about being able to execute without understanding a lot more

107
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,280
than a person who comes and says, you know I would rather understand what I&#39;m going

108
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,510
to do with the data before I start running with it.

109
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,620
There&#39;s a lot of data available.

110
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,620
It&#39;s awesome, but it&#39;s also very scary.

111
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,500
The amount of not thoughtful analysis done even at the best of institutions

112
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,730
which led the data dictate the analysis rather than thinking is scary.

113
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,380
See you soon.
