Welcome.
https://youtu.be/MS7v4x-JACE
1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,430
We have done standard deviations,

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,630
we have done means, now let&#39;s talk about covariance.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,950
And the reason we are talking about covariance it is the fundamental basis of

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,860
measuring relationships.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,990
It has issues.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,960
Why?

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,332
Because it&#39;s unit dependent and it can, magnitude doesn&#39;t mean much.

8
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:32,407
So let&#39;s ask what is the covariance between securities 1 &amp; 2,

9
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,910
and how would you calculate it?

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,940
I think we have done the calculation definition, but let&#39;s go slowly.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:48,223
Remember, we have two distributions and

12
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:52,593
one&#39;s mean is 4.7 and

13
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:56,557
one mean is 3.35.

14
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,880
And now we are trying to see how do they move together.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,940
In other words, when security 1 is above, is this above or is this below?

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,510
That&#39;s the question we are asking, so let&#39;s do the covariance.

17
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,500
The covariance, I will write as sigma 1,2 hat.

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,370
So imagine if you were doing covariance with yourself.

19
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,720
One with one, what would we call it?

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,790
Variance, so let&#39;s write the formula out.

21
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,030
sigma pi.

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,648
But now what are you summing?

23
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:38,110
R1i- R1 bar times R2i- R2 bar.

24
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,770
Do I know r1 bar, r2 bar?

25
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,726
Yes.

26
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:50,022
Do I know r1i, r2i?

27
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:50,673
Yes.

28
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:53,960
But the problem is how many of them are 4?

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,130
So they are going what?

30
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,570
We are measuring whether they are going together.

31
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,440
But remember, you are measuring them in four states of the world.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,440
So don&#39;t combine state world one with the fourth, because you&#39;re just seeing

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,460
the same depression, recession, expansion, normal.

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,010
You&#39;re seeing symmetric periods to measure this.

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,047
Turns out if you do it, the answer turns out to be 5.81.

36
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, so remember it&#39;s very similar to doing a variance.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,770
So for example, if you&#39;re calculating variance, what would 1 and 2 become?

38
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,200
Either it&#39;ll be 1, 1, or 2, 2.

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,960
And what will happen?

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,820
It&#39;ll become squared.

41
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,090
We have done that.

42
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,350
This however, as you know, has got issues.

43
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,275
So therefore we&#39;ll go on to talk about in attrition of this, which is what?

44
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:45,160
What is the correlation?

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,280
What is the correlation between securities 1 and 2?

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,340
And let&#39;s define correlation.

47
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,560
Correlation hat 1,2.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,970
There&#39;s not a P.

49
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,830
This is as in the Greek symbol.

50
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,790
Okay, it&#39;s sigma 1,2 hat.

51
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,570
Many times, what do I also call it?

52
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,390
Covariance (1,2).

53
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,980
So sigma, covariance.

54
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,120
We use them interchangeably.

55
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,220
And by the way, this stuff you see in textbooks and so

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,910
on, so forth, so you&#39;ll get used to it.

57
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,910
However, I want to standardize this.

58
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,845
I&#39;ll standardize it by what?

59
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:36,010
Times Question, do I know the numbers?

60
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,552
Yes, the first number is 5.81

61
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:46,580
on top, which tells you, is the relationship positive or negative?

62
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,030
That&#39;s the beauty of covariance.

63
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,550
Covariance tells you it&#39;s positive because the sign is positive.

64
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,390
That means they tend to move together.

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,340
Now, the question is what is the intensity of that relationship?

66
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,070
We can&#39;t tell, right, because it&#39;s based on unit dependent.

67
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,330
It&#39;s a strange number.

68
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,670
Percentage, percentage, two percentages.

69
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,310
But more importantly, you can scale it any which way you want.

70
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,580
You can make it bigger or smaller and you don&#39;t know what the heck is going on.

71
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,320
So what do you do?

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,317
You scale by 1 and 2 standard deviations, okay?

73
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:29,911
And so we know that the standard deviation of 1 was 3.41 and

74
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:35,213
the standard deviation of 2 was 1.70,

75
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:38,090
3.41, 1.70.

76
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,840
If I make a mistake by copying the wrong number, say Gautam made a mistake.

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,650
We&#39;ll fix it.

78
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,860
That kind of mentality.

79
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,880
It&#39;s great because I could have, and I do probably, make mistakes.

80
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,370
Hopefully they are just minor ones.

81
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,918
What does this work out to be?

82
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,197
Ooh.

83
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:58,930
1.00.

84
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,720
So I purposely picked the example,

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,780
because I want to ask you this.

86
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,800
What are the chances, okay, first, mechanically, can you calculate it?

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,320
The answer is yes.

88
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,510
Second, more important question.

89
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,360
What are the chances of you picking IBM and

90
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,300
Xerox and them moving perfectly together?

91
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,000
What are the chances?

92
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,390
Zero, essentially.

93
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,290
So I want you to confront that fact that I&#39;m

94
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,290
creating a concocted example where I&#39;m forcing you to think about things.

95
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,600
And when we go on to more realistic data, this is concocted data.

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,150
Real data,

97
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,780
you will see that it&#39;s impossible to pick two securities with perfect relationship.

98
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,990
Positive, okay?

99
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,370
But the other thing I want you to recognize also,

100
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,040
is that perfect negative is even less likely.

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,550
And the most likely is somewhat positive, but not perfect.

102
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,580
And we talk about it why?

103
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,340
I&#39;m just postponing that for a second.

104
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,360
In other words, I&#39;m postponing why the heck would two securities randomly chosen,

105
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,240
tend to have a positive relationship, not perfectly positive.

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,270
Think about it.

107
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,210
Keep it at the back of your minds because I think that if you understand that,

108
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,940
you will understand the deeper implications of finance for

109
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,500
the rest of the world and the real world.

110
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,820
I&#39;ll come back in a second, do some calculations,

111
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,860
do 1.3, 1.4, mess around with the data.

112
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,962
See you in a bit.
