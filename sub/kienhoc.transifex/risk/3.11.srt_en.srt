00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:10,430
Welcome back, and now comes the punchline, which I have been excited about.
https://youtu.be/b5tJBmyxNHQ
1
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,070
So here&#39;s the equation, and one caution.

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,140
I&#39;m leaving out some symbols, which I&#39;ll ask you to just kind of keep in mind.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,970
They&#39;re shown in bold.

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,000
So stare at this one equation up there, and what does it say?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,290
The expected return Ri.

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,210
So when I say expected, you technically should write it like this.

7
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,950
So quick question.

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,090
What is expected return Ri?

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,580
It&#39;s on average what will happen to Ri.

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,050
You can never know what will happen to RI in a specific day.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,940
In our case, what are we looking for?

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,270
Amazon.

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,360
Right, remember, we&#39;ll go back to that, towards the end of this.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,660
We&#39;re looking at Amazon to figure out the cost of capital of rainforests,

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,310
which is very similar.

16
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,550
So expected RI it is not one return, you&#39;re trying to predict.

17
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,420
You&#39;re trying to predict on average what it will be.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,540
You&#39;ll never know what it&#39;ll be tomorrow.

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,640
You&#39;re trying to get an estimate.

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,880
Quick question.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,230
Why don&#39;t I say expected rf?

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,165
First of all, what the heck is rf?

23
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:24,588
Rrf is the return on the risk free security.

24
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:29,328
So this is risk

25
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:34,870
free security.

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,910
Beauty of finance, can you measure it?

27
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,850
Do we know what the risk free security is?

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,010
Yes!

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,680
It&#39;s idly a zero coupon treasury bill and

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,430
it&#39;s issued in America, it&#39;s issued zero coupon bond.

31
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,330
Why zero coupon?

32
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,760
Because if you hold it to maturity,

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,060
you will surely get the face value unless the government decides to go bankrupt.

34
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,800
Highly unlikely, so therefore we call that a generic risk for security.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
So because we know it, there&#39;s no expectation there.

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,550
What is this?

37
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,240
Remember, we talked about the market return.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,300
So this, again, is is expected.

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,340
So it should technically, if you look at books, it&#39;ll show up like this.

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,880
Let&#39;s make it cap just for the heck of it.

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,650
Sometimes I use caps, sometimes I use lower case,

42
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,950
but both you&#39;ll see, so it&#39;s not a big deal.

43
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,860
So here is CAPM, what does CAPM say?

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,793
CAPM says that the expected return on Amazon, or Google, or

45
00:02:36,793 --> 00:02:42,609
whatever, is equal to expected return, which is rf plus the premium.

46
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:48,000
This is a premium.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,910
Why do we pay this premium?

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,450
We pay this premium because people are risk averse.

49
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,480
And the premium has two components.

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,390
One is the average market risk premium.

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:07,820
Meaning on average, what was likely to be the difference between the market

52
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,600
portfolio, which is the total portfolio, minus the risk-free asset.

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,429
So what are we using for the market portfolio in our data?

54
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,410
This would be 500.

55
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,000
In the real world, you can use 2,000 and so on and so

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,930
forth in today&#39;s world, right?

57
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,200
So the average difference between the two.

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,360
And you know what?

59
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,930
This number is very, very tough to estimate.

60
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,040
And for example, as I&#39;ve mentioned before,

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,780
in the US many people used to think it&#39;s 7% based on data, and history.

62
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,740
Because you can&#39;t predict the future right?

63
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,190
So you use the history.

64
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,348
Now people are thinking it&#39;s more like 5%.

65
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:51,962
This is an extremely important variable to everything we do,

66
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:55,700
and it&#39;s very tough to estimate.

67
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,430
And if you use 7% instead of 5, huge dramatic difference in your analysis.

68
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,257
Why? Because of compounding.

69
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:08,640
Because even a 2% difference will make a huge difference.

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,360
So okay, so this is the market risk, what is this?

71
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,280
This is the risk of Amazon.

72
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,180
But what, inner large portfolio.

73
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,600
So let me ask you this.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,450
Can you measure all of this?

75
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,680
And that&#39;s the beauty of the answer is yes.

76
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,380
You can look up the treasury bill and we&#39;ll do it.

77
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,355
You can look up the risk premium,

78
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:39,040
we&#39;ll actually don&#39;t even need to do it I&#39;ll ask you to take a number like 5%.

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,270
Where most people are thinking that&#39;s a much more realistic number for the future.

80
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,210
Because 7% was just too high.

81
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,370
And as I said, people are still working on it,

82
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,410
and there&#39;s a lot of disagreement about what this number should be.

83
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,660
And it has a huge impact on how we work.

84
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,170
Can we measure Beta i?

85
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:58,670
Sure.

86
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:03,034
If I gave you Amazon&#39;s return instead of Security One, or

87
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:07,890
if I told you security one was Amazon, you already know the number, right?

88
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,050
So the beauty of returns, it&#39;s so simple, it&#39;s so simple to calculate.

89
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,770
And we can and we will in a second.

90
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,230
Let me show you a graphical representation of CAPM so

91
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,890
that you understand what&#39;s going on.

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,670
So, the graphical expectation of

93
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,660
representation of CAPM is very straight forward.

94
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,720
It&#39;s a straight line, and it&#39;s the same equation I just showed you.

95
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,210
Quickly, how would you draw a straight line?

96
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,097
How many data points do you need?

97
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:39,179
You need one, and two, and

98
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:45,450
then you can draw a straight line between the two.

99
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,960
Can I figure out Rf?

100
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,460
Yes.

101
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,000
Most people use a 10 year

102
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,390
treasury bond and we&#39;ll do that.

103
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,480
You put it in here one number you know.

104
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,600
Do I know this?

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,990
Sure.

106
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,480
And herein lies the institution for capital.

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,890
What will be the beta of the market portfolio?

108
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,170
Remember what is beta.

109
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,240
Sigma im over Sigma m squared.

110
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,120
So what will be the beta of m with n?

111
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,150
Sigma MM over sigma M squared.

112
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,067
This is for the market portfolio.

113
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,468
Sigma MM, sigma MM 1.

114
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:35,720
And that makes sense.

115
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,980
How, if the market moves by 1%, how much will the market move by?

116
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,480
1%.

117
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,110
So if I know this is going to be 1 and these are betas along this line.

118
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,860
And the beta here was 0 because it was risk free.

119
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,590
Do I know expected return on the market?

120
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,342
Yes, I can go and check out what the market portfolio return was on the S&amp;P

121
00:06:58,342 --> 00:07:02,470
500 over the last 90 years or more.

122
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,050
And that is the best guess I could possibly have for the future, right?

123
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,190
Because I&#39;m doing forward analysis.

124
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,530
You could use more information and so on so forth, but let&#39;s stick with this.

125
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,610
So once we have there two points, I have this.

126
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,800
But look at the straight line.

127
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,340
I&#39;m going to be geeky for a second.

128
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,620
What is the equation of a straight line?

129
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,240
B plus mc.

130
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:38,090
Okay, so b is the intercept of rf.

131
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,990
M is the slope.

132
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,910
C is what in this equation?

133
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,020
Beta i.

134
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,550
And what&#39;s the slope?

135
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,300
Of this.

136
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,571
Look how cool this is.

137
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:53,838
Slope is this over this.

138
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:54,390
This over this.

139
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,150
But what is this?

140
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,650
1.

141
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,790
So all I have to measure is this distance.

142
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,638
But what is this distance?

143
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:11,850
Rm- rf, rm- rf so CAPM, that&#39;s why I got the nobel prize.

144
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,555
It is so straightforward, you can measure everything or

145
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:21,847
at least attempt to and you come off with one of the most important

146
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:26,368
variables used in analysis which is expected return.

147
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:30,251
Which also is highly correlated to the cost of capital,

148
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:32,573
depends what your financing is.

149
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:38,580
If you can figure out expected return on Amazon stock, and Amazon had no debt.

150
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,510
What is the expected return on Amazon&#39;s assets?

151
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,630
The same.

152
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,800
Remember we assumed that for the time being we&#39;ll have no debt.

153
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,260
Let&#39;s come back.

154
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,770
Let&#39;s try to wrap it up.

155
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,760
Let&#39;s do an exercise very quickly.

156
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,970
And you&#39;ll see how it all fits together, and no wonder finance is awesome.

157
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,503
See you soon.
