00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,720
Welcome back.
https://youtu.be/G4W1tU-u1LE
1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,830
What I&#39;m going to do is, I&#39;m going to do a detailed example,

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,180
which takes all the stuff we have talked about, and put it together.

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,330
And I call this a mega example.

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,020
Before I do that,

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,400
I just want you to recognize graphically, again, what we are up to.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,805
So I&#39;m going to just write some stuff.

7
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:36,559
You have assets, liabilities and

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,441
I clearly keep saying real assets.

9
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,802
Because if you&#39;re not producing something like a product, or a service,

10
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:52,470
and you have money on both sides, how could it create value, right?

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,920
So, realize it&#39;s extremely important.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,690
These generate cash flows.

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,870
And they&#39;re evaluated at Ra,

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,670
which also turns out to be weighted average cost of capital.

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,950
In our world, we&#39;re going to change that towards the end and

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,790
then you can go into financing, you&#39;ll learn more and why, okay?

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,240
But for time being, as I said, let&#39;s keep frictions and taxes away.

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,657
They are man made.

19
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:21,844
They don&#39;t belong in the natural world and, therefore,

20
00:01:21,844 --> 00:01:24,930
let&#39;s understand the natural world.

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,970
In this world, we know that values created on the left-hand side

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,110
value sheet from my side and then you have only equity.

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,240
What will happen?

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,320
I&#39;m after cost of capital in this case.

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,400
I&#39;ve done my cash flows.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,390
I&#39;m just focused on this.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,430
This, And this will be the same.

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,710
How do I get this?

29
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,585
I go to Beta equity, calculate it from returns, put it in,

30
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:54,815
which equation to go from here to here?

31
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:55,315
Cap m.

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,100
That&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,190
However, life is a little bit complicated.

34
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,740
I can calculate beta equity, but turns out, I&#39;ve forced debt to be here.

35
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:12,890
And there will be a corresponding Rd and a corresponding Bd.

36
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,480
Many times, and I&#39;ve warned you of this, many times,

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,545
people assume beta delta is zero.

38
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:22,130
That&#39;s simply because in the original proof for

39
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,390
convenience assumed, let the debt be risk free.

40
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,070
That can&#39;t be true of all debt.

41
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,470
You just have seen the disaster in the last few years.

42
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,770
Because there is risk.

43
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:41,355
Phones, houses to default, whether that&#39;s due to bad practices or

44
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:47,790
due to general reasons, whatever, default can happen.

45
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,820
So beta debt, think of it as 0 all the time as a bad idea, okay?

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:59,860
So very quickly, I&#39;m going to now introduce debt,

47
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,390
but keep taxes out of the picture.

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,742
You&#39;ll see debt, in the real world,

49
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:08,750
does have an advantage that&#39;s given by the government to you in most countries.

50
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,850
Interest on debt is tax deductible.

51
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,950
We are assuming that&#39;s not the case right now for simplicity and actually for

52
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,580
understanding the basics.

53
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,686
Okay, how would you go from here to here?

54
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,513
Again, Cap m.

55
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:26,556
But the thing that now I&#39;ll have to do is I&#39;m valuing a company,

56
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:31,720
I go to my compatible, the compatible has equity in debt, imagine Amazon.

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,500
So what do I have to do?

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,971
I can&#39;t put this is Cap m and call this Re.

59
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:39,630
What do I have to do?

60
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,800
I have to remove the effects of debt from this.

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,970
And that&#39;s called unlevering.

62
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,670
And that&#39;s what I will do using an example, and

63
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,560
that&#39;s closest to the real word, but just a first peek on valuation.

64
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,495
And focus not on cash flows.

65
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:02,260
We&#39;ll have cash flows, but focus more on cost of capital.

66
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,230
So since we are going to do an example,

67
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,220
what I&#39;m going to do now is show you the details of the example and

68
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,730
I will let you write out the details while I talk through.

69
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,540
Then I&#39;ll take a break, and we&#39;ll do six or seven questions, which are very,

70
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,600
very interesting, keeping the calculation simple but

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,680
really digging deep into evaluation.

72
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,900
And by the way, venture capital, private equity do use complicated financial

73
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,890
models but often c over r minus g can be used.

74
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,160
Multiples is another way to look at c over r minus g.

75
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,730
Anyway, so Kitchen Inc is a high-end company that supplies kitchen fixtures.

76
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,430
Kitchen Inc has no debt and

77
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,200
their stock trades on the NYSE, New York Stock Exchange.

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,660
I&#39;m just trying to make it very interesting.

79
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,310
And it has an equity beta of 1.00.

80
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,462
Either you&#39;ve calculated it, or you&#39;ve gone to Yahoo fiance, or

81
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:01,689
you&#39;ve gone to Morningstar and you know this.

82
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,020
What do you infer from this?

83
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,810
That is what I do when I read something in finance.

84
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,640
What strikes you about Kitchen, Inc?

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,500
It strikes you that the beta asset and the beta equity will be the same.

86
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,260
And the reason is they have no debt.

87
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,640
The return on equity and the return on assets will be the same.

88
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,370
That should strike you right away.

89
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,690
That&#39;s the kind of capability I want you to develop is that you don&#39;t even

90
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,310
need to do calculations to understand what&#39;s going on.

91
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,930
The numbers will just confirm what your thinking is.

92
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,081
Okay, Kitchen,

93
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:41,392
Inc is considering investing in the home construction business.

94
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:46,300
So it was doing kitchen business now getting into home construction.

95
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,080
The project to that it&#39;s looking at is huge because construction requires

96
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,470
a lot of investment, you need buy all kinds of stuff.

97
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,550
So let&#39;s, to make it exciting, say that the investment is $100 million.

98
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,680
Okay, I many times forget how many zeros in a million,

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,630
I believe there are 6, so 100 million seems right.

100
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,800
If undertaken, meaning if they choose to do it, which we&#39;ll try to evaluate for

101
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,460
if they should, the construction business will represent 50% of the total business.

102
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,435
So right now, construction business is zero.

103
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:26,370
It will become 50% of the value of the firm if you choose to take it.

104
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,720
So what are the cash flows from this new idea?

105
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,330
To make matters simple, I&#39;m not going to give you a complicated spreadsheet.

106
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,325
I&#39;ll make life simple from a calculation perspective.

107
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:40,270
But you know how to do this.

108
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,420
So let&#39;s see what the cash flow scenario is.

109
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,690
Remember, the world is uncertain, so

110
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,820
with a 40% chance, you are expected to get $25 million forever.

111
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,130
Why forever?

112
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,310
Because I can do c over r.

113
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,240
Otherwise, I&#39;ll use a spreadsheet, and

114
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,960
there are many probabilities then and many possibilities.

115
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,360
Don&#39;t need to worry about that.

116
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,022
40% chance, 25 million.

117
00:07:05,022 --> 00:07:08,343
30% chance, 15 million.

118
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:11,254
30% chance, nothing.

119
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:14,130
This is a risky business, right?

120
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,680
So lets first stare at these numbers, I&#39;ll let you write them down.

121
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,490
I will do another page with some more information, and then we&#39;ll take a pause.

122
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,820
What I&#39;ll also do is, I put up these numbers in a separate note,

123
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,650
calling it the mega example.

124
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,326
Because whenever I do that, we have a lot of numbers like I had in risk,

125
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:41,660
I gave you either the spreadsheets, or I posted something.

126
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,370
And if there are a lot of formulas, I put up formulas.

127
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,160
If there are a lot of statistics, I put up formulas of statistics.

128
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,910
But I don&#39;t believe, I&#39;m sorry, in making copious notes and handing them out.

129
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,740
They work out to be a little bit dysfunctional actually.

130
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,619
So let&#39;s finish this example with some data.

131
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:01,991
So I&#39;ve given you all the data about the two businesses.

132
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:04,510
Some more about marketplace.

133
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:09,967
Companies solely in the construction business, have an equity beta of 2.50.

134
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:13,880
Remember, you are in the kitchen business, you are going into which business?

135
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,160
Construction.

136
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,230
You go to look at comparables and

137
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,334
you find that the equity beta of the comparables is 2.50.

138
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,520
Equity beta, why did I give it to you?

139
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,310
Because that&#39;s what you usually see.

140
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:32,854
These firms on average have a debt to equity, d over e, ratio of 1.

141
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:35,960
And the yield on their debt is about 10%.

142
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,860
For simplicity, keep that number in mind.

143
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,930
What is another name for a yield on debt Rd?

144
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,295
Kitchen, Inc is forecasting that the average market risk premium, remember 5%,

145
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,948
and the long-term bond is paying, treasury bond is paying about 2.5%.

146
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,018
I&#39;ve changed numbers.

147
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,750
Yesterday, we saw a real number from the Wall Street.

148
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,550
Here, I&#39;m keeping numbers round so that we can do the calculations.

149
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,220
So what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to let you think about these issues.

150
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,175
Please remember that in this page,

151
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:14,800
the important variables that lenders offer are Rd 10% for what?

152
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,405
The construction business debt but the Cap m numbers are fixed across everything,

153
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:26,325
which is 5% risk premium, 2.5% Rf.

154
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:31,350
When we come back, we will dig in and start doing some work.

155
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,910
There are multiple questions, and

156
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,240
at the end of it, we&#39;ll wrap up this whole module.

157
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,870
See you in a minute.
