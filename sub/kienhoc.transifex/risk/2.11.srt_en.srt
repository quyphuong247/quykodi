Welcome back.

1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,430
I&#39;m going to wrap up this section with a small snippet

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,600
of some data that&#39;s supposed to tease you as much as try to explain things.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,880
And that&#39;s setting us up for

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,410
the next section, and please think a little bit about it.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,330
So what I have up there is from 1989 to 2008.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,420
Some stocks and S&amp;P 500, and I&#39;m just reporting standard deviation.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,680
And the reason I&#39;m doing standard deviations alone,

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,345
as we&#39;ll see later, is that mean returns are very easy to calculate.

9
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:41,400
They&#39;re simply the average of what&#39;s in your portfolio and we&#39;ll do the next time.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,271
The much more interesting story is about the risk,

11
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:49,333
standard deviation of portfolios, or securities.

12
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:54,060
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,075
I believe Disney, AT&amp;T, Pfizer, General Motors, Alcoa,

14
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:05,650
Home Depot, General Electric, Exxon, Intel, Citibank, Proctor &amp; Gamble.

15
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,530
Very recognizable names, all be it all from the American Stock Market.

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,080
What do you notice?

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,240
I&#39;ve calculated standard deviations for a long 20 year period.

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,190
It&#39;s not just five year period.

19
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,520
I&#39;ve reported the standard deviations and then,

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,024
I&#39;ve also reported the standard deviation of S&amp;P 500.

21
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:32,720
The first question I want to ask you is,

22
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,770
are the standard deviations different across the different securities?

23
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,200
And the answer is what?

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,480
Yep.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,110
They&#39;re pretty different.

26
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,850
In fact the highest is what?

27
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,993
Intel during that period, about 40% and the lowest is what?

28
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:59,260
I believe 16% if I&#39;m is Exxon.

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,100
And this is what the returns.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,480
Remember this is what the volatility or

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,240
square root of the variance of the standard deviation, individual securities.

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,960
Question number two.

33
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,930
Will anybody ever invest in only one of them?

34
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,985
Answer is, if you are allowed to you shouldn&#39;t.

35
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:20,710
Assuming you are risk averse.

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,790
Even Bill Gates shouldn&#39;t put all of his money in buying the stocks at Microsoft

37
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,000
alone or an employee of Microsoft shouldn&#39;t be invested in Microsoft

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,680
alone fully, if he or she is risk averse.

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,280
And the reason is very simple you work for

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,920
Microsoft so all your work risk is with Microsoft.

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,640
And then on top of it, your financial risk is also in Microsoft.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,850
And if you&#39;re risk averse, that&#39;s not a very smart thing to do.

43
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,590
And most people are very risk averse.

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,510
So what is the extreme case here?

45
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,469
We have standard deviations varying between 16% and 40%,

46
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,390
and I would encourage you to try to think about why is one standard deviation

47
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,210
higher than the other little bit wise until the highest wise?

48
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,160
Citibank pretty high and so on and so forth.

49
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,170
But more importantly, I would like you to ponder the relationship between

50
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:26,070
the standard deviation of S&amp;P 500 and its relationship to everything else on top.

51
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,120
What do you notice as the one thing that jumps out?

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,210
And I will say what that is and then we&#39;ll leave the question open-ended as to why?

53
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,610
Turns out the lowest standard deviation, among all the returns shown there,

54
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,870
is S&amp;P 500 and it&#39;s at 15% a year.

55
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,670
The next highest, 16%, Exxon.

56
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,760
And everybody else is much higher.

57
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,690
So the question is, why is this the case, and what&#39;s going on?

58
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,480
Remember, I didn&#39;t book all the stocks from one industry.

59
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,110
I picked stocks from pretty much all industries.

60
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,610
In other words, the main difference between S&amp;P 500 and

61
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,150
the other ones is not simply because I picked them all from the one industry.

62
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:23,600
Have a random, well distributed set of industries in the top in securities.

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
So the question I&#39;m asking you and leaving you with,

64
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,020
is how come the standard deviation is the lowest?

65
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,180
Another way of thinking about it is please calculate the average standard deviation.

66
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,030
Please calculate the average standard deviation of the introduced

67
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,960
securities and tell me how much higher it is than 15%.

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,130
And we&#39;ll talk about why that gap, how does it matter,

69
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,534
what are the people doing when we see each other next time.

70
00:04:56,534 --> 00:05:03,890
And we&#39;ll ponder all this, put it all together in two modules that will cover

71
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,640
diversification where this is headed, and then capital as a pricing model.

72
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,970
All of the data all of the time and that&#39;s the beauty of finance.

73
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,510
See you next time, bye.
