00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:06,240
Welcome back.
https://youtu.be/i7YckPRQNyw
1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,080
So here&#39;s the trick question.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,708
What is love in these graphs?

3
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:13,152
I would claim it is the one on the right top two, and

4
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:17,997
that&#39;s why I love finances, that same answer you get about.

5
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,850
The thing is, you want a positive relationship, right?

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,245
Otherwise, what&#39;s the point?

7
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:26,130
However, it can&#39;t be perfect.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,420
If you&#39;re looking for

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,590
perfect relationships, I think we are missing the point.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,120
Let&#39;s move on.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,940
Enough deep thoughts.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,320
Okay, so diversification: 2 Assets, Choices.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,679
Let&#39;s go through it quickly.

14
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,048
Then we&#39;ll move on to three.

15
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:47,380
Was combining Google and Microsoft a good choice?

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,930
Here, remember, essentially it&#39;s not a question of good or

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,470
bad choice because you make your choices that are good for you.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,820
However, from a diversification standpoint, perhaps not.

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,260
And the reason is, there&#39;s likely to be a lot in common between these two

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,550
because they tend to be in similar businesses.

21
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,860
Let me give an example.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,180
Would Google and Walmart be a better choice?

23
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,500
Answer&#39;s yes.

24
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,410
Perhaps better, because Walmart&#39;s business is quite different from Google&#39;s business.

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,740
And also, not as Internet dependant.

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,920
So, you see what I&#39;m saying.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,360
So, even if I threw in Amazon instead of Walmart,

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,840
one would start wondering about the extent of diversification.

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,500
That&#39;s the beauty of diversification.

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,920
I don&#39;t need to show you numbers to do that.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,730
We can think about it very intelligently.

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,880
The risk of the portfolio is affected by how many factors.

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,460
Let&#39;s go.

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,640
The rates are important, but they&#39;re given, right?

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,680
You decide the rates today, but when I say how many risk, risk is unknown part.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
So the rates are known to you.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,350
If you don&#39;t decide [LAUGH] how much you&#39;re going to put in Google and

38
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,520
Microsoft or Google and Walmart, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, right?

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,522
So, rates are decided today, so I&#39;m not viewing them as factors,

40
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:11,221
I&#39;m talking risk factors.

41
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,588
There are four.

42
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:16,994
Variance of one, variance of two, covariance of one with two,

43
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:19,550
covariance of two with one.

44
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:26,120
Or, a variance, b variance, covariance ab, covariance ba.

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,310
So four, but the last two are the same.

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,860
Why are these different than the average risk of the two assets held in isolation?

47
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,160
So why is it that this four factor

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,150
is different than the average of the two standard deviations?

49
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,830
And the reasons are very simple, the covariances.

50
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,560
And the covariances tend to do what to the portfolios?

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,570
Variance tend to reduce those portfolios as long they&#39;re

52
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,300
not perfectly positively correlated.

53
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,680
I&#39;m kinda losing it a little bit.

54
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,940
Okay, let&#39;s go to some data.

55
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,170
And here I will do data with two assets.

56
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,395
So, I&#39;ll do the two asset example.

57
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:15,925
Conceptually with Google or with Google and Microsoft or

58
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:18,685
Google and Walmart, covered all that.

59
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:20,735
Let&#39;s go to stock data.

60
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:24,275
I&#39;m not going to show you that whole Excel spreadsheet because it&#39;s just

61
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,425
going to be distracting as back and forth.

62
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,425
You know what I&#39;m talking about?

63
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:30,340
How many data points?

64
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,850
60.

65
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,018
How many stocks?

66
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:33,575
Five.

67
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:37,208
How many market portfolios?

68
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,558
There&#39;s one, S&amp;P 500.

69
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:43,577
Now you know why it&#39;s there because what&#39;s common to both of them?

70
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:44,720
The market.

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,370
What&#39;s common to most securities?

72
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,610
The market.

73
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,160
What is the measure of the market?

74
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,180
Very tough to measure but we are going to assume S&amp;P 500 is a good

75
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,150
representative sample for the whole market.

76
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,030
Not true, but that&#39;s the best you can do and by the way that&#39;s awesome, why?

77
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,290
Because we have traded securities with prices changing every day.

78
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,880
You know the value, you have some hope that you&#39;ve publicly available

79
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,255
market data to be able to study this stuff.

80
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,897
So consider securities one and

81
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:22,250
two in the file called Stock-Data.

82
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,350
Calculate the average returns of Securities 1 &amp; 2 held by themselves,

83
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,360
and you should be able to do this as I&#39;m talking.

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,820
So which function will you use?

85
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,170
So let&#39;s write, you&#39;ll use function average.

86
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,630
And you&#39;ll give data in some column, let&#39;s call it column.

87
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,018
And data point what?

88
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:57,285
2, 2 column,

89
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:07,686
I don&#39;t how I&#39;m spending stuff anyway, 61.

90
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:14,302
And the reason was a new dataset file the column stands for a, b, c, d, e, f, g.

91
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:15,980
It&#39;s whichever way they are sitting.

92
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,787
And I think if I had a call, security one is sitting in c,

93
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:25,459
security two is sitting in d, month is in first one, second column is S&amp;P 500.

94
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,300
But you can move those around.

95
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,397
The reason I&#39;m ignoring row one and starting with two is

96
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:37,719
because the row one is the labeling of the various things.

97
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:39,176
One to 7,500.

98
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:41,150
One, two, three, four, five, right?

99
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,229
Very straightforward.

100
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:45,083
And the numbers, if I may,

101
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:50,310
should work out to be 2.18% and 3.25%.

102
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:57,330
And putting it in percentage terms simply for ease.

103
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,840
In the data files they&#39;re in actually decimal form.

104
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,650
So when you calculate them, remember that, I&#39;m just reporting.

105
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:13,120
What is the average return of the portfolio of the two securities?

106
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,202
Now I&#39;ll have to wait for a second and see how you would calculate it.

107
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:23,027
I would encourage you to do it two ways,

108
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:27,310
the first way is to just create a portfolio return.

109
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,043
So create a new column, and do this.

110
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:36,040
Assume xa = half and xb = half.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
I&#39;m just going back to our formulas, xa and xb.

112
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,630
Here, what is xa?

113
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,410
Half xb half.

114
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,290
Well what is a?

115
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,290
Security 1.

116
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,860
What is b?

117
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,830
Security 2.

118
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,330
So create a portfolio.

119
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,900
How will you do that?

120
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,599
Very straightforward.

121
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,675
Take the column datapoint, say it&#39;s c2 and d2, right?

122
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:05,850
Let&#39;s assume c2 and d2 are the first two datapoints for Securities 1 and 2.

123
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,560
Again, a column is what?

124
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,120
Just the month number.

125
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,150
B column is S&amp;P 500.

126
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:19,190
So, just make xa half, xb half, but you understand what I&#39;m talking about, right?

127
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,275
So you do this.

128
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:27,670
xa Ra + xb Rb, that&#39;s the formula.

129
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,050
You have decided this is half, this is half.

130
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,090
So in the new column, just put equal sign and write this equation out.

131
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,470
Where for Ra, what will you say?

132
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,760
C2.

133
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,010
For Rb, what will you say?

134
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,021
D2.

135
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:50,071
And then you just drag the whole column down from 2 to 61.

136
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,610
And you&#39;ll have a new column.

137
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,073
And that&#39;ll be the portfolio return of a, b,

138
00:07:56,073 --> 00:08:01,460
which is also portfolio return of securities 1 and 2.

139
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,052
So do it this way.

140
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:10,601
Spend some time, and you should be able to get a new column of portfolio returns.

141
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:13,383
But this portfolio combines what?

142
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:17,700
One and two securities, where we have replaced a and b by one and two.

143
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
It could be Google and Microsoft, right?

144
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,360
So a and b are kind of the generic thing and

145
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,930
you&#39;re replacing with the real data, okay?

146
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,168
Once you get this portfolio return, what do you do?

147
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:32,599
You do the average of that

148
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,877
column where it&#39;s sitting.

149
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:39,660
Again 2 to 61, right?

150
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,475
Because you can&#39;t get more than 60 portfolio returns.

151
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:45,790
[LAUGH] Basic two securities have.

152
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,870
Okay, yeah?

153
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,350
Now calculate the average.

154
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,480
What will it be?

155
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,149
Turns out it&#39;ll

156
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:59,821
be 2.71%.

157
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:07,360
This is the way you should calculate portfolio returns.

158
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,179
And the reason is if you do it this way and

159
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:15,839
then calculate things like variances, life will become very, very simple.

160
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,721
However, you need to understand what will this be equal to.

161
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:22,560
So let me ask you the following question.

162
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,320
How will this be related to the average of these two?

163
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,590
So if I were to average this and this, what number would I get?

164
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,660
I&#39;ve already calculated them, I don&#39;t even need to calculate the portfolio return.

165
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,448
I&#39;m asking you the average of this will be what number?

166
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,841
2.71.

167
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:50,531
So the average of individual security averages, or

168
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:57,470
expected returns are the same as the average of the portfolio return, okay?

169
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,388
So let me write it out.

170
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:03,595
Expected Rp, which in our case is what?

171
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:06,267
2.71%.

172
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:12,484
We know, we have calculated it, has to be equal to XA,

173
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:18,360
expected Ra + Xb, expected Rb, plug and chuck.

174
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,440
What is Xa?

175
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,530
Half.

176
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,580
What is Xb?

177
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,720
Half.

178
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,253
What is Ra?

179
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:27,437
2.18.

180
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:29,738
What is expected Rb?

181
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:31,928
3.25.

182
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:34,914
And the answer has to be 2.71.

183
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:38,946
So whether you catch your nose this was the other or the other way, this way,

184
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:44,170
the direct way is creating the portfolio return and treating it like one thing.

185
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,641
You are done.

186
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:49,707
When we come back, we&#39;ll now mess with variances.

187
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:51,380
Because the expected return, they&#39;re easy.

188
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,830
They&#39;re linear, they add up, nothing to worry about.

189
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,620
Variances, because they are non-linear, become complex.

190
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,434
See you in a minute.
