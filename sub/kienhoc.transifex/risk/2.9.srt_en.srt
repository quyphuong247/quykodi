Welcome.
https://youtu.be/bXd9aQ8FbuY
1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,140
As you know we are doing a lot of data analysis especially for

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,460
those of you who haven&#39;t done this before.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,620
It&#39;s capturing various things, right?

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,920
You&#39;re understanding concepts, you&#39;re applying data, you&#39;re learning Excel,

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,270
you&#39;re learning statistics.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,950
So it can be somewhat overwhelming sometimes but

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,490
the good news about digital education is you can take breaks, go back,

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,580
figure out what you didn&#39;t understand and so on and so forth and run with it.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,270
So right now, what we&#39;re doing or we have been doing is using simple statistics to

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:49,350
try to use a large data set and make sense of it in the context of risk and return.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,490
So what did we just do?

12
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,682
We did average returns which you&#39;d rather have them higher than lower.

13
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:04,087
We did standard deviations and variances to understand risk of them stand alone.

14
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:08,816
But then we are doing a lot of covariances, and correlations, and

15
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:13,884
betas to understand relationships, because, as you&#39;ll see later,

16
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:19,040
in stock reality, but right now a little bit of faith is involved.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,260
That when you are risk adverse your whole portfolio, so it doesn&#39;t make much sense

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,600
to look at the risk of security by itself, because you never hold a security.

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,900
Now, the ultimate of that is that you&#39;ll hold a large portfolio.

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,040
And one of the largest portfolios out there is the market portfolio.

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,000
Now remember when you say market portfolio technically means everything in the world.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,900
But for the time being let&#39;s call it S&amp;P 500 as reflecting

23
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,780
all the things that are possible to do in the real world.

24
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,690
And I&#39;ve given you that data for how many periods?

25
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:01,453
60 months starting with grow number two, going into 61.

26
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:06,364
And I believe the market data is not column one, like the month numbers, but

27
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:07,224
column two.

28
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:12,300
So assuming it&#39;s column two, let&#39;s calculate average market return.

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,130
And let&#39;s go through this relatively quickly, and

30
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,860
then what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll do a wrap up secondly for this whole thing.

31
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,370
Put it all back together contextually then we jump into diversification

32
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,428
portafolio theory applying all of this to design probably the best

33
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:34,594
model the world has seen called Capitalistic Passing Model Again.

34
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:37,467
Again, for its simplicity and its beauty,

35
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:42,090
and its applicability to some extent, not perfect extent.

36
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,400
So, what is the average return on the market portfolio?

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,940
Very simple to calculate.

38
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,890
Let&#39;s write out the numbers.

39
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,640
I&#39;ll write it as RM bar, m stands for here,

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,640
market, But specifically I&#39;m measuring it as S&amp;P 500.

41
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:07,120
This turns out to be 1 / N summation Rm, okay?

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,710
And I believe the returns turns out to be 1.30%,

43
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,350
and how did I calculated average give B2 through B61 answer.

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,143
Pretty straight foward.

45
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:25,960
The fact that&#39;s different from securities one and two is obvious why,

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,851
because one and two are just securities and

47
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:32,470
this is combination of a large number of securities.

48
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:40,575
It&#39;s relatively low if you look at history but that&#39;s function of the times.

49
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:44,940
Variance/Standard Deviation of the Market portfolio, very easy introduce,

50
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,490
so let&#39;s do it.

51
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,410
In Excel, what function will you use?

52
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,970
You&#39;ll use VAR S, I think it&#39;s in caps.

53
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,042
Let&#39;s write out more.

54
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,670
Rm squared hat.

55
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,490
What is Excel doing?

56
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,400
It&#39;s adjusting for degrees of freedom, but it&#39;s calculating

57
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,450
Rm- Rm bar, and these change.

58
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,780
And how many of them are there?

59
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,590
60 of them, and squared.

60
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:22,230
Otherwise, you would sum something up that adds up to zero.

61
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,933
And this number, I think,

62
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:30,124
works out to be 0.0021.

63
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:33,205
The first thing you&#39;ll realize is that it&#39;s much

64
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:36,285
lower than the variance of integers securities,

65
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:40,337
and that&#39;s just teaser for you to think about when we get into it.

66
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:47,975
So okay, then the number that I will calculate is standard deviation,

67
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:52,330
take a square root and 0.0457%.

68
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,660
Okay, so we have calculated the standard deviation, the variance of the market.

69
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,250
Why are we doing this?

70
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,010
Because, let me throw out an idea.

71
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,930
Who, imagine three situations.

72
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,570
You could have held security one by itself, security two by itself,

73
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,310
or the market portfolio by itself.

74
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,690
Which one of these are you most likely to hold,

75
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,080
if these were the only three options?

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,400
Answer should be very obvious, it depends on your tolerance for risk.

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,880
And most of us are risk-averse, and most of us will do what?

78
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,900
Diversify.

79
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:32,030
Know one day you see, that people who can save tend to save in not only portfolios

80
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,010
but index portfolios, where the preconceived portfolios.

81
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,554
You don&#39;t have to buy and sell and pay a lot of transaction costs,

82
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:43,960
it&#39;s become very, very common.

83
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,980
Let&#39;s keep going and let&#39;s ask you the following question.

84
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,210
What is the covariance between security one and the market?

85
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,760
And this will again, huge amount of significance as we move forward and why.

86
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,700
And the reason is very simple, remember security ones risk standard deviation

87
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,970
of variance or whatever, doesnÂ´t mean anything for a risk adverse person.

88
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,460
Think of a person who&#39;s holding a very large diversified portfolio.

89
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,550
And let&#39;s imagine that&#39;s the market portfolio.

90
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,750
Then, how that security one behaves as everything in

91
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,790
the market portfolio becomes an extremely important thing to measure.

92
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,110
Because that&#39;s what will be the measure of its risk.

93
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,870
So, let&#39;s see relationships, how will you measure this covariance?

94
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,020
Let&#39;s measure it.

95
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,941
So the covariance 1,m

96
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:48,269
hat will be equal to 1

97
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:56,270
/N-1 Summation R1- R1i.

98
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:06,830
Sorry, R1 bar times Rm- Rm bar.

99
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,030
Apologize for that little slip up.

100
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:17,020
So bar is the mean, bar is the mean, Two means, I know, very easy to calculate.

101
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:23,853
And the answer turns out to be, if I have my numbers right, 0.0017.

102
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:28,492
Again, what function will you use correl for

103
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:32,390
correlation, covariance cov.

104
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,730
And remember, you&#39;re using sample data, so remember that piece of.

105
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,200
But you can also do this by hand, and learn what it means.

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,040
This is not a very useful measure, in terms of interpretation, but a absolute

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,530
necessary step, you cannot calculate relationships Unless you know this.

108
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,350
What do you recognize, what is the one thing you can say, that this security

109
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,030
on average is positively correlated with the market, okay.

110
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,763
And again, I repeat and deze you,

111
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:07,710
this is much more likely to happen than a negative correlation or

112
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:13,110
a zero correlation of any randomly selected security.

113
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,500
So, since this is just telling you relationship sign, let&#39;s go and

114
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,670
try to figure out correlation.

115
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,737
What&#39;s the correlation between security one and two?

116
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:28,453
And, correlation between security 1 and

117
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:32,383
2 is, covariance 1 having one and

118
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:37,370
market divided by sigma 1 hat, sigma m hat.

119
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,710
So it&#39;s standardizing by both the variables, okay?

120
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:49,415
And I think the correlation turns out to be 0.32, I know all the numbers,

121
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:55,313
so you know all the numbers, just plug, and it should be 0.32.

122
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:57,380
So, quick question.

123
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,530
What does this mean?

124
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:05,700
Positive, does it mean closer to one than the before of 0.06?

125
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,768
Answer is yes.

126
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,910
0.06 was between one and two.

127
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,478
This is between one and the market, so

128
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:17,410
0.32 means it&#39;s positive and it&#39;s reasonably strong.

129
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,849
Given in the real world we&#39;ve never seen one, we&#39;ve never seen really,

130
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:24,224
really high numbers, this is not bad.

131
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:28,860
Good news is between minus one, plus one.

132
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,290
More interpretation plus one highly unlikely negative range.

133
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,370
Also likely in the real world, why therefore mostly positive.

134
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,500
Okay, so one way to think about it is most security returns will have

135
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,550
positive correlations with the market the extent of the correlation with change

136
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,670
will tend to be positive.

137
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,390
Please carry that and think about it.

138
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,670
Let&#39;s keep going, because we haven&#39;t been done.

139
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,812
This, to me, now becomes the key variable that we&#39;ll use later on,

140
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:02,303
and I&#39;m gonna introduce it now.

141
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:07,574
So the question is, what is the beta between 1 and S&amp;P 500?

142
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,570
So, let&#39;s write out the regression.

143
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,690
And this is what I&#39;ve been waiting for for a long, long time.

144
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:23,728
Beta 1 with m, Rm + Epsilon i.

145
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:27,462
Or, 1i, right?

146
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,790
Actually since 1 is there, i wouldn&#39;t be there.

147
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,680
Okay, so let&#39;s figure out how to calculate this.

148
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,905
The function you&#39;ll use is slope.

149
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:44,849
But, let&#39;s write out the formula,

150
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:50,169
beta 1m hat = covariance 1m, which we know,

151
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:57,490
hat, not divide by sigma 1, sigma m, but by sigma m square hat.

152
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,950
And this interpretation is so

153
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,450
awesome because it&#39;s saying, how does one related with m?

154
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,010
And inside m is who?

155
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,880
Everybody in your portfolio, if you&#39;re holding the market portfolio.

156
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,700
Relative to what, the movement in the market portfolio itself.

157
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,310
Do we all these numbers and these two numbers?

158
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,770
The answer is yes.

159
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:25,406
And here, it will turn out to be 0.79.

160
00:11:25,406 --> 00:11:27,050
So, what does that mean?

161
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,740
It means something great, that if the the whole market moves by 1%,

162
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,736
how much does this security move by?

163
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,322
0.79%.

164
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:41,740
So, it&#39;s not moving perfectly with the market, but it&#39;s pretty close to.

165
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:48,420
And it turns out most betas are within a tight distribution, not very extreme.

166
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,400
But it also depends on lifecycle of the firm, where is it at?

167
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,690
What kind of film is it?

168
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,810
What kind of business does it do?

169
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,190
If it&#39;s very luxury this number will be high, and we&#39;ll talk about it why.

170
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,245
Whether it&#39;s needed all the time then it&#39;s beta&#39;s would be low,

171
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:09,450
built-in to be positive, and so on.

172
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,800
What am I going to do now is I&#39;m going to request you to take a break.

173
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,910
I would request you to calculate beta two M, beta three M, beta four M, beta five M.

174
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,440
See what you gain from it,

175
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,810
then it familiarize you with getting your hands dirty with data.

176
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,420
Do it with the Excel function, do it without the Excel function.

177
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,720
If you&#39;re more advanced,

178
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
you probably don&#39;t need to do much, you&#39;ve set up regression functions.

179
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,470
Whatever your learning is at, where ever it&#39;s at,

180
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,850
in statistics, in finance and so on try to combine it with the on speed but

181
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,370
do the data analysis that&#39;s the beauty of this.

182
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,370
I&#39;m wanna take a break and

183
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,130
what I&#39;m going to do now when I come back is I&#39;m gonna wrap things and bring them

184
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,410
back to why the heck did we do data analysis for such a long period of time,

185
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,210
using statistics but mostly using financial data.

186
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,328
See you in a minute.
