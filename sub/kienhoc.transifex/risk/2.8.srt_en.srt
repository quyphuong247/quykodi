Welcome back.

1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,270
I hope you&#39;ve been doing fun stuff.

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:16,620
I hope the data is so interesting that you&#39;ve been glued to where you&#39;re sitting.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,050
If not, I hope you have been following, and understanding, and

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,040
taking the the time to practice stuff.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,420
By the way, this practice will help you a lot in doing the assignments too,

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,070
I mean this specific assignment, the data set.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,380
So let&#39;s talk about regression now.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:39,160
And regression is trying to measure the relationship between Securities 1 and 2.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,400
So let me write out the equation again.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,751
So it&#39;s R1i alpha

11
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:53,850
i+beta R2i+epsilon.

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,546
And I&#39;ll call this 1, 2.

13
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,720
Okay just for symbols.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:08,246
So let&#39;s write the equation for this.

15
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:12,116
And I will for this also, tell you how to calculate it on special.

16
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:16,535
It says this is standard deviation covariance I told you which function to

17
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,970
use here You could go many ways.

18
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,250
You could use a data analysis pack, or we&#39;ll stick with simple stuff for now.

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,200
Okay, so let&#39;s do it first, the formula.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,480
What will it be?

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,190
Same culprit, covariance.

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,470
Do we know it?

23
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:31,970
Yes.

24
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:38,540
Now, what will we divide it by?

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,120
We&#39;ll divide it by the variance of this guy on the other side.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,470
Do we know that variance?

27
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,179
I think we do, it&#39;s zero.

28
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:07,047
And beta 1, 2 if I&#39;m correct will work out [INAUDIBLE]

29
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,270
0.069.

30
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,740
So when you stare at this beta, what is it telling you?

31
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,850
It&#39;s not telling you the same thing as the correlation, right?

32
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,890
Because correlation was measuring the strength.

33
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,630
So the first question, was the correlation far off from one?

34
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,138
Yes, 0.062.

35
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:28,340
What could you say about the strength of the relationship?

36
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,050
Positive, but not very strongly positive.

37
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,950
Closer to zero than it is to one by a huge margin, right?

38
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,840
Now, beta one two, what is that telling you?

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,670
I think it&#39;s saying this, it&#39;s not telling you the strength of the relationship,

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,848
it&#39;s telling you more about If security two were to change by 1%,

41
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:55,850
and let&#39;s call it 0x again, how much does security one change by?

42
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:02,820
Clearly not by 1% but changes by 0.069.

43
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,510
Okay?

44
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,370
So it&#39;s telling you how one changes, how much will the other change by, right?

45
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,450
Okay, my trick question for you as always is this.

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,020
Can you calculate Beta 2, 1 i?

47
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,320
And the answer is, please do it.

48
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,080
Question, will it be the same as this number?

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,910
And then answer is, the numerator will be the same, but the denominator will not.

50
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,346
What will be in the denominator?

51
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:38,730
Sigma1 squared hat, right?

52
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,780
So the answer of beta will change.

53
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,330
So, beta depends on what&#39;s on which side, whereas correlation is symmetric.

54
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,960
So that&#39;s the first thing I would like you to remember.

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,400
The second thing I would like you to remember is that when we come back,

56
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,120
I hope you have done enough of 1-2, 2-1, 1-3, 3-1 and so

57
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,230
on and so forth, and see which numbers are changing and covariances and so on.

58
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,540
But stay restricted too, though I can&#39;t force you to.

59
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,270
And you&#39;re most welcome to do whatever you want.

60
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,210
Stay within securities one and five.

61
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,580
And then we will come back and talk about market portfolio.

62
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,556
In the segment ,I am focused largely on data application, data application,

63
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:22,830
data application.

64
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,960
But I am throwing in another twist.

65
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,580
I am throwing in the market there.

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,330
And you will see the benefit and why its important.

67
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,380
Before I leave, the function that you want to use to calculate beta

68
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,600
is if you know regressions, you can download the pack, do it whatever way.

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,570
But the function is slope.

70
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,620
And when you&#39;re calculating covariances or correlations or

71
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,040
slope, how many variables do you need to tell it?

72
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,960
For a standard deviation or for a mean or for a variance, you tell it only one.

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,400
Remember, C2 through C361.

74
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,900
But for covariances, co-relations and betas,

75
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,510
what do you need to tell that function?

76
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,110
You need to tell it the two different variables.

77
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,106
Y&#39;s and X&#39;s here And one will be what?

78
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:18,450
Sitting in column B, the other will be sitting in column C,

79
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,850
or one will be sitting, sorry, in this case C and D, and so on.

80
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,110
So those columns will change, but they&#39;ll all go from 2 to 61.

81
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:34,470
So, I will encourage you in our data sets to keep doing some more practice,

82
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,310
and we&#39;ll be back in a minute meanwhile, to do one final segment,

83
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,820
which is focused on the relationships between,

84
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,450
primarily focused on relationships between the market portfolio and

85
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,760
a specific security and for ease of execution.

86
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,330
We&#39;ll pick one.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,070
Security number one.

88
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,883
See you in a minute.
