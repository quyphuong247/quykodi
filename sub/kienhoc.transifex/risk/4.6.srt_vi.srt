1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,520
Staring at a graph, one of my favorite, if not the favorite all time graph.

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,870
So what do all do we have?

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,472
We have returns on the y-axis and

4
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:23,238
we have debt to equity ratio on the x-axis.

5
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:28,900
Let&#39;s start off with the firm that has debt,

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,590
but it&#39;s riskless.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,720
If it has no debt, what is rD?

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,270
Zero, you&#39;re not paying any, and so on.

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,210
So, first of all, as you go along, initially your debt is riskless.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,840
I&#39;m just making a claim, it probably for a corporation never is, right?

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,040
But, close to riskless.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,750
Now, remember we talked about Amazon.

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,200
So there was a very interesting article, and

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,170
you may want to Google finance, Yahoo Finance or Google in general.

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,170
When Amazon issued debt,

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,240
which was a miniscule part of its capitalization of equity, remember?

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,000
Miniscule, two rating companies had very dramatically different interpretations.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,450
So one rating company rated it as risky.

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,370
The other said, almost as risky as the government bond.

20
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:28,110
So the fact that the two had different ratings is pretty peculiar and

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,720
interesting.

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,150
But the fact that one of them said, almost like a used treasury,

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,740
should seem appealing to you, right?

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,800
So even if you promise to pay a lot of coupon, and

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,150
a very small amount of debt, face value.

26
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,160
You&#39;re not gonna cover so much, you won&#39;t need so

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,360
much cash to pay it off, before you use other things.

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,840
So, risk free, close to risk free, is possible.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,840
If Google take on debt, most people will say, almost surely they will pay.

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,730
Doesn&#39;t have to be the case, right?

31
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:06,200
So you could for some reasons have a risky debt,

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,910
even from the beginning and by risky it means chances of default.

33
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,750
Anyway, so you start off with rf, and

34
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,720
as you notice what&#39;s going to happen is as you start off with rf, rf, rf,

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,920
rf, rf, for this range, I am not increasing it much.

36
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,106
But look what&#39;s happening to return on equity, it&#39;s taking off.

37
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:30,990
Why is it taking off?

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,200
It&#39;s taking off because equity holders are facing two risks now.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,260
Where there was no debt they had only business risk.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,870
Now they are doing what?

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,040
They are taking out all the financial risk.

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,440
But at some point debt holders will start also facing risk.

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,710
These are called junk bonds.

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,773
And junk bonds are where the probability of default is high because the value

45
00:02:55,773 --> 00:03:00,612
of the whole firm is converging to less, as much as the value of the debt.

46
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:02,505
Or improbabilistically,

47
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:07,640
maybe you won&#39;t even be able to pay off all the debt, and so on, so forth.

48
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,520
So debt is risky on the right hand side, and it&#39;s close to less risky on this side.

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,880
I love this graph for the following reason.

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,080
Remember there are no frictions and no taxes.

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,030
And this is just unbelievably cool.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,011
So as you go along this axis, this axis,

53
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:32,306
what happens to WACC, which is rA?

54
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:35,250
It remains the same, this is what got the Nobel prize.

55
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:35,920
Basically saying,

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,700
return on assets can&#39;t change, regardless of how you finance them.

57
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,097
What changes though, return on equity changes and

58
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:47,630
rD also changes but here&#39;s the cool part.

59
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,250
The weighted average of the two are always the same.

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,845
So in some senses,

61
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:59,796
it&#39;s wrong to think of return on assets equal to weighted average of rA and rD.

62
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:02,624
Because you&#39;ll start thinking that rA and rD are changing,

63
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:04,014
therefore RA should change.

64
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:06,679
No, yes, rA and rD are changing.

65
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,675
But what are changing, as well?

66
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:11,222
D over E.

67
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:16,490
So even though rA is taking off, its weight is going down.

68
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,870
And therefore, the weighted average of the two is a different animal.

69
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,230
Because rates are changing, rA is changing,

70
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,650
after a while rD is changing and they all balance out to rA.

71
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,850
This is such a profound result and it&#39;s so intuitive.

72
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,490
That is unbelievable, so let&#39;s look at the graph again.

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,045
You can do whatever you want on this side in a world without taxes and frictions.

74
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:46,864
You can have Re, you can have Rd and you can have the weights E,

75
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:49,481
I mean the total amounts E over D.

76
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:55,230
And the capital structure is D over E, or E over D, whatever you want.

77
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,315
Typically we say D over E.

78
00:04:57,315 --> 00:05:01,915
But Ra and value of the firm are unaffected by all

79
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:05,060
the action going on here.

80
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,522
What is being affected?

81
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:13,020
This, why, because beta equity is being affected.

82
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,350
Why is this important?

83
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,290
Because it will also help you understand the business of banks.

84
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,350
So banks, by definition, are highly levered entities.

85
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,125
And if you want to read about banking and why there&#39;s a failure,

86
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:34,756
is because a default will happen when you&#39;re 90% [LAUGH] in debt, right?

87
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:39,462
Chances are, so banking is a highly levered play, and

88
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:42,160
therefore highly risky play.

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,980
And people have been writing about this a lot, and

90
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,160
you&#39;ll see how it&#39;s important to have buffers in risky business.

91
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,570
And the buffer really is having a lot of equity.

92
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,670
Because equity is something that buffers what happens to the debt, right?

93
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,050
And there&#39;s a whole misunderstanding about how this works, and so on.

94
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,760
And there&#39;s a colleague at Stanford, writing with another

95
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,780
colleague in Germany about how we need to understand banking

96
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,660
from a miller perspective, to have good regulation.

97
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,735
So I really think this is a very profound thing.

98
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:24,975
And the cost of capital issue that we need to worry about before doing the example.

99
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:30,686
And I&#39;ll take a break after covering all this, is to evaluate investment projects,

100
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:34,750
we must find the beta and the return on the assets of the firm.

101
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,520
Since the beta of assets are not observable, we have to go

102
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,570
the beta equity of the firm, because that can be calculated using returns on equity,

103
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,850
and return on market big difference.

104
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,817
So you want to see return on assets, you want to see beta assets,

105
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:55,132
because that&#39;s what you need to figure the value of.

106
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:59,364
Your firm or your idea, or your cost of capital is rA, but

107
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:03,530
you cannot observe it, you cannot see it.

108
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,410
Luckily, if you have a publicly traded firm that has equity and debt.

109
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,470
If it has no debt, return on equity through CAPEM and you get return on asset.

110
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,380
But if there is debt, what you have to do is you have to remove the effects

111
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,790
of financial risk from return on equity.

112
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,280
You cannot take the return on equity and make it the cost of capital.

113
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,270
Think about it.

114
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,970
If you did that, what would you do to the present value of your cash flows?

115
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,430
I&#39;ll leave you with that part.

116
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,520
Suppose you systematically just put beta equity and CAPEM and

117
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,480
ran with rE to evaluate the cash flows of rainforest.

118
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,750
What will you do to the pres bv of your cashflows?

119
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,490
Will you overestimate them or underestimate them systematically?

120
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,772
When we come back, we&#39;ll answer that question briefly.

121
00:07:56,772 --> 00:08:02,641
And we&#39;ll get into an example that will have somewhat more choppiness to it,

122
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:05,820
but not in terms of concept or execution.

123
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,210
But I will stop and repeat that example and the concepts over and

124
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,980
over again, because we are wrapping things up and we are doing a evaluation exercise.

125
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,703
See you in a minute.
