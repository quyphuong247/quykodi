Welcome back.

1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,790
Let&#39;s get to the trickier, fun part.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,940
We are still with two assets but this time with data.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,410
And the data file is stock data.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,950
And for ease of exposition and so that you get used to it,

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,420
sometimes I&#39;ll jump around with variance or standard deviation.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,950
But what&#39;s the relationship between the two?

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,990
One, first important principle.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,630
I have to calculate variance before I can calculate standard deviation.

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,230
A lot of people are comfortable talking about variances most of the time.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,784
Some deal with standard deviation simply because it&#39;s the square root and

11
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,525
similar to a return, okay.

12
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:47,142
So if I flip around between variances and standard deviations,

13
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:49,886
that shouldn&#39;t bother you, right?

14
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:52,030
You should be able to go between the two.

15
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,918
But important,

16
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:56,986
you cannot calculate standard deviation before you calculate variances.

17
00:00:56,986 --> 00:01:02,561
So two assets, what was the average return on the portfolio?

18
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:04,630
It was the average of the two averages.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,890
So the expected return on the portfolio is a rated average of the two

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,090
expected returns.

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,510
Very simple, very linear.

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,374
And our rates for the time being are often half.

23
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:20,100
Quick question.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,140
You already calculated the portfolio return, right?

25
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,960
You created a new column going from two to 61 because there are 60 data

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,900
points which is a combination of the two securities, first two.

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,710
So let&#39;s keep going.

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,390
Again, using those two securities, what are the risks of securities one and

29
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,000
two by themselves?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
And let&#39;s talk about variances.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,130
This is what I meant is that I&#39;m going to sometimes use variances,

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,420
sometimes standard deviation.

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,970
Don&#39;t use them, variance of one and standard deviation on the second one.

34
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,930
That doesn&#39;t make sense.

35
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,930
Let&#39;s write it out.

36
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,820
So, sigma square hat, sigma two square hat.

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,400
You should have done it last time.

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,865
I believe the numbers are 0.0127,

39
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:17,258
and this is 0.0102, okay?

40
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:20,130
So, remember, this is the variance,

41
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,440
you calculate the variance of the two securities and you&#39;re all set to go.

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,270
Now the question is, this is not very interesting, right?

43
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:33,430
Because you are holding a portfolio, have you created the portfolio of return?

44
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,730
Answer is, yes you have.

45
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,620
So let me ask you the second question.

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,560
What is the risk of the portfolio of the two securities, right?

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,470
And how would you do that?

48
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,150
You would calculate sigma p hat square.

49
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,554
Very simple, you will do variance, function and

50
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:59,285
you will give column var.

51
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:04,801
The portfolio return is sitting, column 61.

52
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:08,910
And the column, you substitute the column where the portfolio return is sitting,

53
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,230
wherever you&#39;ve created.

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,410
Very straightforward.

55
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,150
Very simple.

56
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,626
What will the answer be here, if you&#39;ve calculated it.

57
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:21,710
It will work out to be this.

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,818
Remember, what was sigma 1 square hat?

59
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:29,237
I&#39;m putting a hat just because these are estimates now.

60
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:34,271
What was sigma 2 hat square?

61
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,800
So I calculated three numbers.

62
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,730
Something must jump out at you right now.

63
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,940
And I&#39;m not going to say what it is there, I&#39;m just going to ask the question.

64
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,555
How is it related to the average of the risks of the two securities.

65
00:03:55,555 --> 00:04:00,532
So if I simply average the top two, what would I get and

66
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:05,300
the answer is, let&#39;s answer it, 0.0114.

67
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,130
You see, I&#39;m averaging this two,

68
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,030
so it has to be something in between and I&#39;m averaging them as half and half.

69
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,000
What do you notice?

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,698
What&#39;s the relationship between the second number I calculated and

71
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:19,318
the portfolio return.

72
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:25,345
I think you could see, you can say one thing very obviously,

73
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:28,076
one is less than the other, which you knew.

74
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:32,792
You should have guessed, the return portfolio variance is less

75
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:36,210
than the variance averages of the two, okay?

76
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,050
Same will be we too if you do standard deviation.

77
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,120
But one is dramatically less than that.

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,570
So the portfolio returns variance is dramatically less than 0.114 right?

79
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,400
It&#39;s about half.

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,360
Why is that happening?

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,380
Why so much lower?

82
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,980
Where will you go looking for the answer?

83
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,630
And I will pause after doing this and I&#39;ll force you to go looking for

84
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,610
the answer, please do.

85
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,810
And may the force be with you as always, when you&#39;re looking.

86
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,890
Where should you be looking?

87
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,920
What should you be looking at?

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,720
See you in a minute.
