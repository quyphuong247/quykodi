00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,710
I've been discussing the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964, especially

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,780
in relation to the expanding television network on the one hand,

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,080
and on the other hand, in relation to the urban development

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,290
process from prewar and postwar era.

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:30,650
But where are the people who are living in this process?

6
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:37,205
Finally, I need to discuss the relationship between the people who

7
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:42,670
were living in Tokyo and the process of redevelopment

8
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,200
during the Tokyo Olympic Games.

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:54,150
In Tokyo, many high buildings were started to constructed.

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:01,020
One of the symbolic examples of these buildings, or construction,

11
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,350
was the Tokyo Tower, which was constructed in 1958.

12
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,030
And Tokyo Tower became the symbolic tower in Tokyo

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,520
after the end of the 1950s.

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,840
But at the same time, some of the roads or main streets

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,160
were expanded, especially before the Tokyo Olympic Games.

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,550
And alongside with these expanded roads, new high buildings were constructed.

17
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,240


18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,670
One of the best examples of this expanding

19
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,420
was the case of Aoyama Street.

20
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,900
Next film was produced by Iwanami Film Productions.

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Iwanami Film Productions was one of the most important documentary film

22
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,920
producers in the postwar era.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,580
They produced many important films, especially documentary films,

24
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,480
in the 1950s and 1960s.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,970
Next is one of their works, and that focus on the change of the people's

26
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,165
live in the district which was redeveloped in the Olympic Games

27
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:17,315
in 1964.

28
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:18,548
-

29
00:02:18,548 --> 00:06:01,520


30
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,540
This film features the people's lives around the Aoyama Street district

31
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,370
just before the redevelopment.

32
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:16,370
But the work, or film, also featured the people's lives after the redevelopment,

33
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,560
too.

34
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,231
So the next one is very short, but please look at the people's lives

35
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,230
after the redevelopment.

36
00:06:24,230 --> 00:07:43,080


37
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,160
Similar change of the people's lives occurred

38
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,100
in many areas in Tokyo in the 1960s because, throughout the 1960s,

39
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,630
Tokyo was a city under construction.

40
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:01,390
So many new buildings or new roads or road expansion were proceeded.

41
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,110


42
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:11,860
So the interaction between the people or way of thinking or way of life,

43
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,630
and new construction of the city was very important

44
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:24,720
and a very big process throughout the 1960s.

45
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,910
In 1968, the new skyscraper in Kasumigaseki

46
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:36,220
called Kasumigaseki Building was constructed.

47
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:43,919
And after that, at the end of 1960s or early 1970s, in western Shinjuku area,

48
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,620
many new skyscrapers were constructed or built.

49
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:56,540
Western Shinjuku area has changed completely after late 1960s.

50
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,690
So the case of Aoyama Street was one example

51
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,090
to reconsider about the relationship between the peoples

52
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,680
and these kinds of new construction.

53
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Maybe documentary film is one of the best examples or best perspectives

54
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,200
to consider about these kinds of relationships

55
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,620
because documentary films focus on the people and people's lives in the city.

56
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,660
So we are going to consider a little bit more in detail

57
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,090
about the people or lives in the city under construction

58
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,410
in the middle of the 1960s.

59
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:41,967
