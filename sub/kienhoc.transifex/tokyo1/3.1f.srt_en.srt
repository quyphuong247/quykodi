1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:09,890
The reconstruction plan of Tokyo after the war was not realized.

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,760
There were many obstacles in this plan.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,510


4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:20,200
One is slow arrangement, because Tokyo was a very big organization,

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,610
and the negotiation between these different organizations were necessary,

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,300
but it takes more time.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,500
And secondly, the negative attitude of the local governor.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,190
The governor of Tokyo in those days was quite

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,290
reluctant to support this urban planning.

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,960
He only emphasized the economic necessity,

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,520
and he had no interest to support the new urban planning in the 1950s.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,540
And also, the occupation army was not so much supportive

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,700
to this kind of the new urban planning.

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,370
Occupation army was very keen to facilitate

15
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,060
the democratization of Japanese society, but they were not

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:15,280
so much supportive to reconstruct, or to make other kinds of beautiful cities

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,460
in Tokyo.

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:26,710
And also, the change of tax system had negative effect on urban planning,

19
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:34,300
because after this change most of the budget for the reconstruction

20
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:40,620
and urban development had to be used for road construction.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,820
So after the 1960s, Tokyo became more and more efficient city.

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,780
But in this process, the rivers and canals were destroyed.

23
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,670
For example, in order to construct the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway,

24
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,320
this expressway was constructed on the river and on the canal.

25
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,770
So the landscape of these rivers and canals

26
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,550
was very much damaged by this construction.

27
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:19,030
And also, the green belt, which was imagined in the reconstruction

28
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,180
plan in postwar era, was not realized.

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,140
So Tokyo became more and more efficient city, rapid transportation system

30
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:34,260
and high skyscraper, but the green belt city, or university town,

31
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:43,700
or the city of canals and river was continuously lost.

32
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,050
We can see some of the development process

33
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,450
when the Tokyo Olympic game was prepared in next film.

34
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,439


35
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,230
FILM NARRATOR: Plans were established to build roads from the Tokyo

36
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,000
International Airport to the Olympic village in central Tokyo,

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,300
and from the village to the various sites of the Olympic games.

38
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,510
Some 160 billion yen, equivalent to $450 million US,

39
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,190
was earmarked for the construction of these roads, totalling 138 kilometers.

40
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:25,350


41
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,820
This project will save Tokyo from traffic congestion,

42
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,830
and will pave the way to the success of the Tokyo Olympics.

43
00:03:31,830 --> 00:04:01,020


44
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,420
At present, it takes more than an hour and a half for a car

45
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,230
to reach the main stadium from the airport.

46
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,300
But when this road is completed, the distance

47
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,100
will be covered in less than half an hour.

48
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:18,570


49
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,290
Through and after the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964, new rapid transportation

50
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,800
system changed the spacial formation of this city a lot.

51
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,910
This is a picture of the Metropolitan Expressway,

52
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,720
which was constructed in the central Tokyo.

53
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:46,330
So as you can see, the canal was almost damaged by this expressway.

54
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,210
Also this is a picture of the expressway with monorail.

55
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,990
So these kinds of automobile rapid airport transportation system

56
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,180
were expanded the area of Tokyo much.

57
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:08,420
I've been discussing about two preceding event before Tokyo Olympic

58
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,100
Games in 1964.

59
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,010
One is the preparation of the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1940,

60
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:22,940
and the other is the reconstruction plan for postwar Tokyo.

61
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,020
In terms of the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1940,

62
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,500
Aoyama, Komazawa, Yoyogi, and waterfront area-- all of these areas

63
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,580
were discussed as the possible venue for Tokyo Olympic Games, and World Fair.

64
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:51,770
So there's a continuity of this location of the site, from 1930 or 1940 to 2020.

65
00:05:51,770 --> 00:06:02,450
And beforehand, these kinds of venues or areas had been often military grounds.

66
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:09,680
So there is a continuity from military ground, or a military facility,

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,210
to a facility for the sports or the Olympic Games.

68
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,090
On the other hand, I discussed about the idealistic plan

69
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,460
for the reconstruction of Tokyo in postwar era.

70
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:31,940
So road or land use system, so wide boulevards and the green belt

71
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,610
and university town and the special district

72
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,530
for the entertainment or culture and education

73
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:45,060
was discussed and designed in the plan.

74
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,450
But most of these idealistic plans were not realized at all.

75
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,680


76
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:00,540
So actually, the Tokyo after 1960 was basically transformed and designed

77
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:09,610
based on the development which was occurred in 1964, the Tokyo Olympic

78
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,780
Games.

79
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,930
Many of the areas and many of the transportation system

80
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:20,260
was developed and organized after 1964.

81
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:28,400
So these preceding events, and what was imagined in this event,

82
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,180
was half-way realized, but half-way not realized.

83
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,680


84
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,160
But at least, when we consider what we discussed about the the Tokyo Olympic

85
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,330
Games and transformation of Tokyo after 1964,

86
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:52,530
we also need to consider about these preceding process of the Tokyo Olympic

87
00:07:52,530 --> 00:08:01,560
Games, or reconstruction plan of Tokyo at the same time

88
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,950
so that we can understand the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964

89
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:13,040
was not a very short term transformation.

90
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,070
It is one part of long-term transformation of Tokyo,

91
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,780
which was started in early 20th century.

92
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,767
