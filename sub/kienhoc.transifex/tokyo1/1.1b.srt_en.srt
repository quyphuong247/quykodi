00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:09,190
The view from American air force and the view from ordinary Japanese people

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,190
were completely different.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,310
American view of Tokyo was like a bird's-eye view.

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,030
The view of ordinary Japanese people was on the street.

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,476
I will show some photos taken by Japanese photographers.

6
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:31,720
Ginza District.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,420
Ginza was a fancy and luxurious area from before the war.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,550
This is a central district in Ginza area.

9
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,365
So you can see, some buildings were burned out.

10
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:53,570


11
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,830
Very famous pearl luxury shop, Mikimoto-- Mikimoto

12
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:04,670
was already famous from before the war.

13
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:10,695
This is an area around National Diet, central administration district.

14
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,130


15
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,770
It was completely destroyed.

16
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,650
Around Ikebukuro-- northwest centeral Tokyo.

17
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,220
The area around Asakusa.

18
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,780


19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:37,810
Asakusa was one of the central and very busy districts in northeast Tokyo.

20
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,580
Completely destructed.

21
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,540


22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,870
People running away from bombing and destruction.

23
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,440


24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,950
Many people tried to run away from bombing.

25
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,530


26
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,130
So many dead body on the street.

27
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,400
Also many dead bodies in the river.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,060


29
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,730
Dead bodies were collected in some places.

30
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:33,730
The bombing was done March 10, April 13, April 15, May 24, and May 25.

31
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,640
In March 10, northeast of downtown Tokyo was completely burned out.

32
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:47,080
In April 13, northwest of downtown Tokyo was burned.

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,660
April 15, southeast of downtown Tokyo was burned.

34
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:02,110
May 24 and 25, exactly central Tokyo were burned.

35
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:09,760
So throughout these several bombings, one third of whole Tokyo area

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,810
was burned and destroyed.

37
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:21,880
This woman is overcome by destruction and loss.

38
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:31,510
This man lost everything, and he covered himself with straw mat.

39
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,840
The woman is trying to make her garden in the burned-out area,

40
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,430
trying to make something to eat.

41
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,940


42
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,370
The last two photos were taken by American army just after war ended.

43
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,170


44
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,940
That is why they are in color.

45
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,400
The Americans brought many cameras with them,

46
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:09,030
and they took many photos and moving image of occupied Japan.

47
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:18,034
So we can trace many landscape and events based on these documents.

48
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:18,534
