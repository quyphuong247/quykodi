1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,760
The transformation of the Emperor's image after the war

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,760
also corresponded with the change of meaning

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,970
and the special formation of the Imperial Palace itself.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,020
This is an image of the Imperial Palace in occupation era,

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,590
as I've shown in last module.

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,320
This Imperial Palace was guarded by American army,

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,810
so it was under the control of American occupation army.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:40,060
And Imperial Plaza but also transformed in special construction

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,130
with special structure very drastically.

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,950
This is one of the image of the celebration, or ceremony,

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,210
of British Army's.

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,190
Not only the British army, American army, and other occupation army

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,830
used this Imperial Plaza for their ceremonies and parade.

14
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,380
But the important point in this photograph

15
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:11,510
is all the soldiers face towards headquarters of occupation army.

16
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,230
So as they turned their backs toward the Imperial Palace.

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,310
This kind of attitude was impossible until the war.

18
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,350
As I already said, that Tokyo station originally

19
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:33,620
had only western gate, the gate in the Western side.

20
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,710
The reason why that station didn't have the eastern side gate

21
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,320
was if it has that kind of gate, the people

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,430
turned their backs toward the Imperial Palace.

23
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,650
It was completely impossible to do that because it

24
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,580
would be considered as profane and disrespectful.

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,320
So all the special structure until the war ended

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,800
is basically structured towards the Imperial Palace.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,949
But as present in these picture, the soldiers

28
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:15,510
never mind such kind of program or under strict cover of behavior

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,130
because is the important direction for soldiers

30
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,800
is the direction towards headquarters of the occupation army.

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:33,180
So they can easily turn their back toward the Imperial Palace itself.

32
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,470
Also, the Imperial Palace Plaza became a kind

33
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,710
of space of love or intimate behavior.

34
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,210
The many occupation army people, or occupation soldiers,

35
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:58,070
enjoyed to walk and sit and they spent leisure time in this Imperial Plaza.

36
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,680
So the Japanese young guards and women gathered around them

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,660
to make a kind of the intimate relationship with them.

38
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,470
So the Imperial Palace became a kind of area

39
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,990
where some kind of the love affairs or even the sexual affairs

40
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,880
occurred very often.

41
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:30,340
It's a kind of a notorious area of these kind of the activity often occurred

42
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,260
in this area.

43
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:40,650
So on the one hand, the Imperial Palace became the ceremonial space

44
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,430
of the occupation army.

45
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,730
On the other hand, the space also became the place

46
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,520
for the intimate relationship or activity

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,650
between the occupation army and the Japanese women.

48
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,850
But this is this Imperial Palace or Plaza also

49
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:12,310
became the space for the working class activity or a space

50
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,910
for political resistance or political demonstration

51
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,990
for Japanese young or working class people.

52
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:27,190
Because until the 1950s, especially on May 1,

53
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:35,080
the working class people, or the labor class or labor movement or labor union,

54
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,110
could make the huge demonstration in ths Imperial Plaza.

55
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,760
In this case, this Imperial Plaza was called as People's Plaza.

56
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,240
And in this People's Plaza, again and again, people gathered

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,650
and they demonstrated their new opinion or their new request

58
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,400
to the government and the occupation army.

59
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,980


60
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,520
We can see some of the images of this demonstration in their plaza

61
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,025
after the war in moving image.

62
00:05:12,025 --> 00:07:06,710


63
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:12,100
As shown in this movie, the Imperial Plaza, or People's Plaza,

64
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,710
was very famous for these demonstrations,

65
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:21,100
or important and popular space for these demonstrations.

66
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,860
But the situation about the demonstration

67
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,590
has drastically changed before and after 1950s.

68
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,620
During the late 1940s, people enjoyed demonstration

69
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,840
in Imperial Plaza or People's Plaza, in especially May 1.

70
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,670
A kind of celebratory and joyous atmosphere

71
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,870
can be observed in many photographs.

72
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,200
For example, these photographs show such kind

73
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,830
of a little bit celebrating image of demonstration

74
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,430
in Imperial Plaza in the late 1940s.

75
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:07,830
But after the 1950s, the direction or policy of the occupation by US Army

76
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,350
has completely changed, because they start

77
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,650
to-- because it was era of the Cold War--

78
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:22,910
and they start to prohibit to do the demonstration in this Imperial Plaza

79
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,510
anymore.

80
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:32,250
So there is a strong confrontation, or clash, between the occupation regime

81
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:41,140
and the people's movement or labor class or workers' union movement in May 1.

82
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:51,120
Especially in 1952, there is a very hard, violent clash between police

83
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,460
and workers' movement occurred in Imperial Plaza.

84
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,780
Some of the people died, were killed by police.

85
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:08,000
And also, there were so many people injured and arrested.

86
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,160
So it is very famous as Bloody May Day in 1952.

87
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,820
And after 1952, this Imperial Plaza cannot be the place for demonstration

88
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,040
for working class people any more.

89
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,660
So it was a very bloody and very violent clash between police

90
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,480
and people's movement in the city.

91
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,400
An interesting point about this clash is American soldiers,

92
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,000
because the occupation was already ended just before that.

93
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,520
And American soldiers observed from very high building that clash

94
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,570
and the violent fighting between police and the labor class movement.

95
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,570
So there is some confrontation and some observation.

96
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,510
The Japanese police and the people who demonstrate,

97
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,050
people who were doing democratic demonstration,

98
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,190
fight against each other in Imperial Plaza.

99
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,730
But at the same time, US occupational army

100
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:26,050
observed all this event which has happened in Japan.

101
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,940
This kind of relationship did continue after the occupation.

102
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,834
