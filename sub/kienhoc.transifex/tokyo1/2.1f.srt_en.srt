00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,810
In the autumn of 1958, Life Magazine in the U.S.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,490
managed to get the scoop about the upcoming

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,320
marriage between Prince Akihito and Michiko Shoda.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,120
After this scoop, all the Japanese mass media,

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,100
including newspaper and magazines and so on followed the scoop.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,020
By those mass media in Japan, there was an expansion of the news

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,800
and the stories about this marriage.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,110
People wanted to hear or people wanted to read every kind of story

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,400
about this marriage people were so much interested in.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,940
There were three symbolic episodes or icons of this marriage.

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,930
First, it was reported that Prince Akihito and Michiko

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,590
Shoda met for the first time on the tennis court.

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,440
This marriage is the result of their love on the tennis court while playing

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,720
tennis.

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,870
So tennis became a kind of icon of this marriage.

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:17,050
And secondly, this marriage was called a marriage

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:23,852
between a royal family and commoners, or ordinary people.

18
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:28,240
Actually, Michiko Shoda was a daughter of a very rich president

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,510
of Japanese company.

20
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,030
So she already belonged to upper class people.

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,790
But the marriage between the aristocrat, or royal family, and commoners

22
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,100
was very much emphasized.

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,690
Finally, this marriage was said to be a love marriage, not

24
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,705
an arranged marriage.

25
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:59,220
But actually, this marriage was designed by some people to be emphasized,

26
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,990
so a new relationship between the royal family and the people in this nation.

27
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:14,800
So in all these icon and symbols, the royal wedding or royal marriage in 1959

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,980
has a strong meaning to reintegrate the new relationship between royal family,

29
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,750
or especially the emperor, and the people in this nation after the war.

30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,080
In the spring of 1959, actually, the royal wedding was taken place.

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,840
And the parade of this couple, Prince Akihito and the princess

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,910
was moved or toured in the city of Tokyo.

33
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,610
And all the process of this parade was widely documented

34
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,640
and filmed and broadcasted by all the TVs and news

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,390
and all the other mass media.

36
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,020
So the celebration of the royal wedding in 1959,

37
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,210
Spring, was a very big media event of those days,

38
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:17,680
maybe one of the largest media events in the postwar era.

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,290
And through this process, the image of the royal family and even the emperor

40
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:30,300
started to change completely or structurally from base.

41
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,220
Let's take a look at a news film released just after the royal wedding.

42
00:03:35,220 --> 00:05:20,330


43
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,770
As we saw, the parade of the royal wedding

44
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:31,810
attracted so many people on the road and in front of the TV screen.

45
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,080
And we also have many photographs of this parade.

46
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,090
This is one example.

47
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,770
And one of the interesting points in this photograph

48
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:49,420
is many people watched the prince and princess from second stories

49
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,540
or from above.

50
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,900
This is a little bit different from the relationship from before the war,

51
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,910
because before the war or until the war ended,

52
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,090
the people looked up at the body of the emperor.

53
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,500
Or people were requested to look up at the emperor's body.

54
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,150
But in this photograph, in some sense, the people

55
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,260
on the second story of the building looked down,

56
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,430
observed from above, the parade and the carriage

57
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:34,240
in which the prince and princess were seated.

58
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,580
So in this kind of visual relationship, the prince and princess

59
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:51,140
could easily become a kind of image or commodity to be consumed.

60
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,040
Actually, the image of the Princess Michiko

61
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,130
became duplicated in many different ways.

62
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,730
This is one of the reproduced images of Princess Michiko,

63
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,300
because a mannequin in a department store--

64
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,720
this mannequin imitated her hairstyle and the image.

65
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,170
And the department store appropriated to promote

66
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,660
their selling of Princess Michiko's image.

67
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:34,320
And many people want to buy the similar wear or jewelry

68
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,430
or hairstyle which the Princess Michiko really did.

69
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,260
So many young women wanted to imitate Princess Michiko

70
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,670
with some kind of the jewelry and hairstyle wearing, clothes.

71
00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:01,350
So the company or stores promoted their selling

72
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,110
based on this kind of image of Princess Michiko.

73
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:10,615
Princess Michiko became a very, very influential commercial image

74
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,030
of the day.

75
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,960
Also, after the new kids were born, the image

76
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,450
of the family under the Princess Michiko became

77
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:29,500
an idealistic image of the family people tried to pursue.

78
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,190
This is one of the photographs in which the Princess

79
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:42,640
Michiko and her daughter and Snoopy were sitting.

80
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,090
So this image is one of the very typical and idealistic image

81
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,480
of the American way of life.

82
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,760
So the connection between the new royal family

83
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,210
and the image of the American way of life is very much integrated

84
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,540
or corresponded with each other.

85
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,400
And these kinds of the new image of the family life or consumable life

86
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:17,990
was widely delivered or widely expanded or consumed so many Japanese people.

87
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,600
