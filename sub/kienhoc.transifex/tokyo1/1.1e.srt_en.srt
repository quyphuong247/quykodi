1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,150
In the previous unit, I talked about expansion

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,910
of the image of American home life, American kitchen,

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,040
and American conversation and dreamy American way of life,

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,830
in Japanese mass media.

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,940
So Americanization process in this sense,

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:38,250
means a new way of life and consumer life and new kitchen.

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,900
So American military force, was not visible in these mass media,

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,325
in occupational era.

9
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:53,140


10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,620
But the story was very different, if you see on the street, in the city.

11
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,849
America military force was completely invisible, in the mass media.

12
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:13,290
But on the other hand, it was visible on the street, in the central Tokyo.

13
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,500
Here is a map of central of Tokyo.

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,200
Black color shows American military facilities.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,160
So there are some districts where American military facilities were

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:34,390
concentrated, which are circled with red lines.

17
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:45,590
So Yoyogi, Minami-Azabu, Roppongi, Aoyama, Hibiya -

18
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,194
these areas were districts where American military facilities were

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:51,735
concentrated.

20
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:54,660


21
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:03,110
Where American soldiers and American bases, and other kinds of building

22
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,830
was very clear, evident to be seen.

23
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,420


24
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,830
A very important thing for these military facilities

25
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,960
was, there was a kind of continuity from Japanese military facilities

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:26,490
to American military facilities, because these districts were

27
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,590
military districts from before the war.

28
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,970
In this area, Japanese military facilities

29
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,330
were already concentrated from before the war.

30
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,730
All of these Japanese military facilities

31
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,600
were taken over by American military facilities, after the war.

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,650
So there is a kind of continuity from before the war

33
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:02,520
to after the war, Japanese militarism to America militarism.

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,490
We can see what kinds of military events took place in these areas.

35
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:18,170
Even the Imperial Palace was guarded by Americans, or occupational soldiers.

36
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:24,010
And in front of the Imperial Palace, occupational army

37
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,390
was gathered in many events.

38
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:35,700
This is a ceremony of American Independence Day in 1949,

39
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,600
in front of the Imperial Palace.

40
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,290
This is also the ceremony that celebrated

41
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:51,680
the wedding of Queen Elizabeth by British armies.

42
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,080
This is a ceremony of Scottish army in front of Imperial Palace.

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,360
This is military parade taken place in front of Imperial Palace,

44
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,430
by occupational army.

45
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,140


46
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,920
And American soldiers were very evident.

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,130
And there were so many American soldiers.

48
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,080
And they enjoyed to talk with Japanese women, and so on.

49
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,580
These kinds of scene were very evident and popular

50
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,030
in the post-war era in Japan.

51
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:44,370
So the contrast between inevidence or invisibility of American soldiers

52
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,310
and the occupational army in Japanese mass media

53
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,010
and visibility of American soldiers and American military-- occupational

54
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,910
military force on the street was very clear.

55
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,330
And there's a big contrast between these two levels.

56
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,460
Even the service stations were renamed with English names.

57
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,670
In this case, Times Square-- this is actually

58
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,460
the subway station on Shimbashi subway station.

59
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,550
But Shimbashi subway station was titled as subway station Times Square,

60
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,260
from American perspective.

61
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:31,550
The street was titled in English names-- Ginza Street.

62
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,950
This is Ginza Street.

63
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:38,690
But some of the street was titled as X Street or Y Street, and so on.

64
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,150
On the street in the city, the occupation

65
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,870
was clear reality to ordinary people.

66
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,970
But the military was not visible in the mass media.

67
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,140
In order to understand this occupation era,

68
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,590
we need to think about these kinds of the contradictory relationships

69
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,710
between these visibility and invisibility.

70
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,020
Visibility of American home life and American way of life on media,

71
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,730
and invisibility of American military force.

72
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:24,180
Visibility of American military force in the street.

73
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:31,750
And invisibility of itself in the mass media.

74
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,540
This kind of the contradictory relationship

75
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,260
of visibility and invisibility is in some sense, a very key point

76
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,760
to understand.

77
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,090
The continuity of America, pro-Americanism and sentiment

78
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,900
toward America in postwar Japan.

79
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,400
