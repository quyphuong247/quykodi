1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,425
I've been discussing about the popularity and background of the Tokyo

2
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:12,390
Olympic Games in 1964.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,230
Through my discussion, we understood that television

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,240
is the most powerful media through which people experienced the Olympic Games.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,270
But, on the other hand, Tokyo Olympic Games, in 1964,

6
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,840
was strongly connected with urban development process, or the history

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,540
of the city formation of Tokyo, in postwar era.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,310
From this point of view, I need to mention about two preceding events

9
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:53,550
which occurred in prewar era and, at the same time, just postwar era.

10
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,800
One is the preparation process of the Olympic Games in 1940.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,930
The other is the plan for the reconstruction of Tokyo,

12
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,780
just after the war.

13
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,250
Many of the locations of the Olympic venues-- especially stadium

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,500
and other kinds of facility-- were already

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,810
imagined in the process of preparation of the Olympic Games in 1940.

16
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,940
At the same time, some of the road construction or expressway network

17
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:37,130
was the result of the failure of plan for, reconstruction plan of Tokyo,

18
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,620
in occupation era.

19
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,980
Let me start about the discussion of the preparation of the Olympic Games

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,500
in 1940.

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,020
This is a picture in which the young people--

22
00:01:53,020 --> 00:02:00,050
maybe the students in the school-- showed their practice or training

23
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,290
their own body, in front of the emperor's gaze.

24
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,699
Emperor was watching the people train their own body.

25
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,940
And these kinds of relationship-- because, on the one hand,

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,850
people tried to strengthen their bodies, and, on the other hand,

27
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,206
emperor watching those kinds of people-- these kinds of relationships

28
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:29,460
was the basic relationship between the emperor and people, in Meiji society.

29
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:36,940
And this relationship expanded or penetrated in many schools, especially

30
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,090
the Sports Day.

31
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,810
Sports Day, in Japan, was called as "undokai."

32
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,710
And in this occasion, people show or compete

33
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,720
the strength of their athletic ability-- other kinds of sports abilities.

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,040
And this kind of athletic competition, or sports competition,

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,300
spread out from school to many companies.

36
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,750
In prewar era, not only schools but also companies

37
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,490
eager to organize these kind of athletic competition,

38
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,995
in some of the Sports Days.

39
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,680


40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,580
So in military, or schools, or companies,

41
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:34,090
people trained their strength-- body or physical strength-- in many occasions.

42
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:43,190
And in the state level, after the 1930s, the Meiji Jingu Sports Festival

43
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,570
took place, every year.

44
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:53,310
It was the largest event for these kinds of sports competition.

45
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:59,800
And this event was held in the stadium in the outer gardens of the Meiji

46
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,300
Shrine.

47
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,820


48
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,410
This outer garden of the Meiji Shrine was transformed from military ground

49
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,370
to these kind of sports facilities, after Taisho era.

50
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,640
Until the Meiji era, it was Aoyama military ground,

51
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:27,740
where many military ceremonies or parades were held.

52
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:35,570
And at the same time, this ground became the site

53
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,880
for the funeral of the Meiji emperor.

54
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:45,400
But after that, it changed to the area of the stadium of-- the sports stadium

55
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,400
area in Tokyo.

56
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,600
So in this area, the athletic stadium, baseball stadium,

57
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,470
and swimming pool and sumo wrestling hall--

58
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,920
those kind of different types of the stadium and hall, and so on,

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,120
was constructed, after Taisho era.

60
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:17,600
So when the first Olympic Games was planned to host in Tokyo,

61
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,800
these Aoyama-- former military ground, but it

62
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,890
changed to the outer garden of the Meiji Shrine--

63
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:32,065
was supposed to be the first venue for the Olympic Games in Tokyo.

64
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,870


65
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:46,160
This process had started from 1909, when Jigoro Kano, the founder of the Judo

66
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,790
wrestling, became one of the committee of IOC.

67
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,460


68
00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,800
But in 1930, the mayor of Tokyo, Hidejiro Nagata,

69
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,650
proposed to host the Olympic Games in 1940, to Tokyo.

70
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,160
And after the many negotiation process, in 1936,

71
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:23,580
Tokyo was selected as an Olympic Game city in the Olympics of 1940.

72
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:31,060
So throughout this process, the many different places or sites

73
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,540
were discussed to be the Olympic venues.

74
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,350
Waterfront area, outer garden of the Meiji Shrine,

75
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:46,240
or Komazawa golf course, and Yoyogi military ground; all of these places

76
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,072
were discussed to be Olympic sites.

77
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:58,950
For example, this is a poster for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1940.

78
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,960
This poster were printed in 1930s and distributed.

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,090
This is a map of site, or venue, of the Tokyo Olympic Games and World Fair

80
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,760
in 1940.

81
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,070
Because, in 1940, it was supposed to be held, not the only Olympic

82
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,685
Games, but also World Fair, together.

83
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:24,220


84
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,580
And in terms of the Olympic Games, finally,

85
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,830
Aoyama area, or outer gardens of the Meiji Shrine,

86
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,640
was supposed to be the Olympic site.

87
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,930
But on the other hand, the World Fair was

88
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:46,390
supposed to be held in waterfront area.

89
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:53,130
But, at the same time, Yoyogi and Komazawa was another possibility.

90
00:07:53,130 --> 00:08:02,900
So in 1935, once the Tokyo City Government proposed the possibility

91
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,270
to host the Olympic Games in waterfront area,

92
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:15,750
just beside the site of the World Fair-- in the red circled area.

93
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,170
And also Komazawa golf course was the other possibility

94
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,020
to be the Olympic site, in 1940.

95
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,540
This kind of plan for the Olympic stadium was discussed.

96
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:36,270
And also, in those days, the outer garden of the Meiji Shrine

97
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,720
and other Yoyogi area and-- Aoyama area and Yoyogi area--

98
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:51,600
these two areas are spaces for big event-- not actually the spaces,

99
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,660
but it was discussed to be this kind of big event venue.

100
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:10,510
So not only Aoyama, but also Yoyogi were imagined to be the place for big event.

101
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,960
This is a map for the World Exposition-- or this

102
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,210
is a map-- one of the imaginary plans for the World Exposition,

103
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,710
or World Fair.

104
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:27,130
But all of these kind of location, including Aoyama, Yoyogi,

105
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:34,070
and the Komazawa and waterfront area was already discussed, in 1930s.

106
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,130
In 1964, many of these venue was realized,

107
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:48,550
because the Olympic Games in 1964 was held in Aoyama and Yoyogi and Komazawa.

108
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,690
All of these three venue was already discussed in the 1930s.

109
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:06,620
And in 2020, it is also discussed now-- the Olympic Games in 2020

110
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,530
would be held in waterfront area.

111
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,910
But the Olympic Games in waterfront area was already discussed in the 1930s,

112
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:26,175
so there is a continuity of the imagination about Olympic site,

113
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,730
from 1930s to 2020.

114
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,840
That kind of continuity are related with the formation, special formation

115
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,235
of this city of Tokyo, in the 20th century.

116
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:43,760


117
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,850
We need to discuss a little bit more about the formation of this city

118
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,868
before and after the war.

119
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:53,367
