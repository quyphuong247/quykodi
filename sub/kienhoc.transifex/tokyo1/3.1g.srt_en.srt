1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,170
Although the reconstruction plan in Tokyo was not realized,

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:16,430
in some of the other cities, that reconstruction plan in postwar era

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,950
could be successful relatively.

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:24,970
For example, in Sendai, or Nagoya, or Hiroshima and Kagoshima,

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,520
in these cities, the green belt, or green open space,

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,850
were actually created in postwar era.

7
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:42,630
For example, in Nagoya, this city has a wide green belt, or green boulevard,

8
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,220
in the center of the city.

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,250
And in Sendai, also there are beautiful green road

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,520
in the downtown area of this city.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,180
So the reconstruction plan in postwar city has some of the successful cases.

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,940
But Tokyo was not.

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:12,270
But at the same time, in Tokyo, there are many large green areas,

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,150
nothing to do with the failure of this reconstruction plan.

15
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,930
So, one of the reasons why Tokyo still has

16
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,570
a green area-- green park and large green park and so on--

17
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,580
was the fact that in Tokyo there are many military ground

18
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,320
and military facilities from prewar period.

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,230
And many of these military ground had changed to park and green area

20
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,760
after the war.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,640
There's a general tendency in which some military field

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,520
has changed to green area and green park after the war.

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,500
In case of Fukuoka, the army barrack, or the U.S. Army residence in postwar era,

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,020
has changed to the park and stadium in Heiwadei area.

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,650
In case of Hiroshima, military facilities

26
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,640
have changed to Peace Park in central city.

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,250
In Sendai, the Miyagino Army Ground has changed to sports park.

28
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,260
And in Shiga, Ojiyama Army Ground-- it's a famous army ground in prewar era--

29
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,230
has changed to sports field.

30
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,270
So in many cities, that kind of the transformation has happened.

31
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,430
Actually, more than 60% of the postwar park

32
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,520
had been military ground or military facilities in prewar era.

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,140
So there is a continuous change from military facilities and ground

34
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,720
to green park or green area.

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,150
In case of Tokyo, Tokyo has many military ground from Meiji era.

36
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,890
First military ground was Hiibiya Military Ground.

37
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,950
It was a military ground in early Meiji period.

38
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,500
But after that, it has changed to public park.

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,070
Hibiya Park was established.

40
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,760
And military ground moved from Hibiya to Aoyama.

41
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,290
But as I already explained, Aoyama Military Ground

42
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:34,070
has changed to the outer garden of Meiji Shrine, after it was a green park.

43
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,076
Then, after that, the military ground moved to Yoyogi.

44
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:41,830
And after the war, Yoyogi Military Ground

45
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,370
was changed to Washington Heights, and this Washington Heights

46
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,620
has changed to Yoyogi Park and Olympic stadium area.

47
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,240
Even recently, the Tachikawa Air Base, it

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,140
was the air base of the Japanese military before the war,

49
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,380
but it has changed to the U.S. military base or air base after the war.

50
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,540
But recently, the U.S. air base in Tachikawa was returned to Japan,

51
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,870
and it has changed to the Showa Memorial Park.

52
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,120
It's a big park in Tachikawa.

53
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,110
So, many of the large parks in Tokyo were

54
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,560
originally or formerly the military grounds in prewar and postwar period.

55
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,680


56
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,250
So this is one of the reasons why in Tokyo there are some large parks.

57
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,800
It was not the result of the urban planning, in some sense.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,710
It wa the result of the transformation of the military park to new green area.

59
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,540


60
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,740
We can see some of the cases or examples of this transformation, especially

61
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:10,600
when the Tokyo Olympic Games was held in 1964 in Yoyogi.

62
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
FILM NARRATOR: The Olympic Village is to be located two kilometers west

63
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,770
of the Olympic Park, only 20 minutes' walk from the main stadium.

64
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,830
It is a magnificent housing complex situated in central Tokyo.

65
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,190
In the 80 hectare-lot stand 230 one-to-four-family houses of wooden

66
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,190
structure, and 15 four-story feral concrete apartment houses,

67
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,275
four of them for women.

68
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:38,400


69
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,540
It is almost miraculous that such a delightful place and facilities

70
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,670
are readily available for the Olympic athletes near the heart of Tokyo,

71
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,860
which is suffering from terrific overpopulation and housing shortage.

72
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,820
The miracle was wrought by the simple fact

73
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,280
that this huge housing complex has been maintained

74
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,650
for the dependents of American army personnel in Japan.

75
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,760
Of course, the Olympic contestants will not be billeted in American homes,

76
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,360
because the present tenants will move to a new housing area in suburban Tokyo

77
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,580
long before the next Olympics.

78
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,950
Remodeling of these houses, as well as construction of restaurants,

79
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,790
a shopping center, a community service building,

80
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,260
and other necessary facilities, is expected to begin shortly.

81
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:31,180


82
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,270
From this film, we can imagine the atmosphere

83
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:44,370
of Yoyogi Park and Olympic Village area in early 1950s, 1960s.

84
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:51,210
This image includes very strong nuance of American military base.

85
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,700
Actually, this area was constructed as American residential area

86
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,790
by American occupation army.

87
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,240
So the traces of the American occupation was very clear and evident

88
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,290
in these films.

89
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:15,240
We can not differentiate between the Olympic Village and Washington Heights.

90
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,320
But after that Olympic Games in 1964, gradually

91
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,400
the connection between the American occupation and this area--

92
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,650
the Olympic Village and the Yoyogi Park-- was disappeared.

93
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:38,500
Or the image of this area-- Yoyogi Park and Olympic Village

94
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,240
and Olympic stadium-- was more and more connected only

95
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,130
with the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964.

96
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,090
This erasure of the image of the occupation

97
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:04,990
might be intended by American Government itself, because before the 1964,

98
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,550
American Government was very keen to return this Washington Heights

99
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,020
area to Japan.

100
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,560
There's a debate between American Government and Japanese Government

101
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:29,115
about which area could be returned to Japan in the occasional of the Olympic

102
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:29,890
Games.

103
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:37,500
Because from Japanese Government, the Olympics can be the best, or very good,

104
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,535
excuse to request the return of American military base to Japan.

105
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:46,410


106
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:54,250
But there's several possibilities, or several possible base in Tokyo

107
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,420
which could be returned in that moment.

108
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,710
Actually the three large American military areas

109
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,710
in downtown Tokyo in those days.

110
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,690
One is, of course, Washington Heights.

111
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:16,470
Washington Heights in Yoyogi was 0.9 square kilometers.

112
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,160
But there are also Grand Heights in Narimasu,

113
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,600
which was 1.8 square kilometers.

114
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:34,670
And Camp Drake in Asaka was the largest area of American military force,

115
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,320
and that was 3.2 square kilometers.

116
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,510
And that was Asaka, Camp Drake, which Japanese Government

117
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,390
request the U.S. to return.

118
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,970
But from American side, American Government

119
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,320
wanted to return Washington Heights in the first place,

120
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:06,880
because Washington Heights and Yoyogi was located in very close to downtown

121
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,960
area.

122
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,770
So if the Olympic Games in 1964 was held,

123
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,340
so many visitors and tourists and the media from foreign countries

124
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,830
come to this area.

125
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:28,530
So from American perspective, the occupation, or the military facilities

126
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:35,360
in Japan, need to be invisible from those kinds of the gaze,

127
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,770
from foreign countries or media and visitors to Japan.

128
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,710
Because if such kinds of military facilities or American military

129
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,690
was so evident from foreign countries, it is very easy

130
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,770
to imagine to be accused by these media, because it

131
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:05,440
can be said that American army still occupied some of the area in Tokyo.

132
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:14,190
Such kind of criticism is not desirable from American perspective.

133
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,760
So Edwin Reischauer, the U.S. ambassador in those days,

134
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,540
maintained that a large American military base in downtown Tokyo

135
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,350
is undesirable, even from the U.S. perspective.

136
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:38,720
So American Government will propose the full-scale return of Washington Heights

137
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,070
to Japan.

138
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:50,050
The American military want to disappear, or want to be invisible,

139
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,850
from downtown Tokyo.

140
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,250
So they want to erase their trace from these areas.

141
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,310


142
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,870
So after the 1960s, after the Tokyo Olympic Games, collaboratively,

143
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,340
the Japanese Government, or American Government, or many organizations,

144
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:23,380
wanted to erase the basic traces or memories of American military base

145
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,160
in Washington Heights, or American military facilities in Washington

146
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,240
Heights in Yoyogi, and they wanted to connect the old image of this area

147
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,590
to Tokyo Olympic Games more and more.

148
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,200
