1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,180
After the late 1960s, most of the Japanese family

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,190
already bought the TV setting in their own household.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,960
People already enjoyed many different kinds of TV programs

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,680
in their own living room or kitchen or other kind

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,210
of family rooms in their own houses.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,210
And this kind of the consumption of the TV program

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,150
was already ubiquitous in those days from Hokkaido

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:44,280
to Kyushu, from north end to south end, everywhere, people, in the same time

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,090
and in the same way, people consumed the same or almost

10
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,070
same TV programs very much.

11
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,190
That was the lives of Japanese people in 1960 and 1970.

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,800
So the consumption of the TV program was already

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,860
very much a ubiquitous phenomena in those days.

14
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:20,920
But there is a very clear contrast or imbalance

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:31,040
between dispersion of TV consumption and concentration of TV production.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:40,610
Because the key station of TV network in private or public Japanese broadcasting

17
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,220
network, key station on those network was very much concentrated

18
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:52,330
in Tokyo, especially concentrated in south downtown area of Tokyo--

19
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,940
very small area.

20
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,070
This is a map of the location of TV key stations.

21
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:07,880
Blue point was original or early location of these TV key stations,

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:16,520
and red point shows the locations where they moved after.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,250
But anyway, some of the TV key stations like Fuji TV

24
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,650
moved from west to waterfront area.

25
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,450
And NHK moved from south downtown area to Yoyogi Park area.

26
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,160
But most of Japanese key station TV network

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:45,050
was located in south downtown Tokyo around Roppongi, or Akasaka,

28
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,540
or Minami-Azabu or these kinds of areas.

29
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,530
And they stayed in this district.

30
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:00,910
So the centericity of TV key station was very evident phenomena.

31
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,850
And this district was very close-- this district

32
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,865
is very close to Imperial Palace and Nagatacho.

33
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:17,640
Nagatacho is a central district of the political process or politics in Japan

34
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,620
and very close to the house of the prime minister or the National Diet

35
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,750
and many major ministries and headquarters of the big companies.

36
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:39,660
So the TV key station was located continuously in this small district

37
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:47,300
although all the program was consumed nationwidely.

38
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:53,020
But the program was produced from this small district.

39
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:59,220
This is a very interesting photograph taken from above

40
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,080
of Kasumigaseki Building.

41
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,590
Kasumigaseki Building was the building of the center.

42
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,790
And this is the first skyscraper building in Tokyo.

43
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:17,000
But in this small photograph, you can see the major broadcasting towers.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,610
In these one photograph, right side red circle

45
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,870
shows the broadcasting station of NTV.

46
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,920
NTV.

47
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,690
Was the first private broadcasting network in Japan.

48
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:39,430
The red circle in center was the broadcasting tower of NHK.

49
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,300
Of course, NHK is a major public broadcasting network in Japan.

50
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,080
Left one was the broadcasting tower of TBS.

51
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,480
TBS was the second private broadcasting network in Japan.

52
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,880
So TBS and NTV and NHK, these three were the major national broadcasting

53
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,320
networks in the late 1960s.

54
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:13,090
And all the key centers of this network was located within this small district.

55
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,020
The amazing thing.

56
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,445
And also, the other interesting point was this location

57
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:24,880
of the broadcasting key station was corresponded

58
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,650
with the location of the American military base formation--

59
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,800
or location of American military base.

60
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,560
I already discussed about these in the previous module.

61
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,160
Because after the war, the American military base

62
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,870
was located in south downtown area in Tokyo.

63
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,480
Yoyogi or Minami-Azabu and Ropongi or Aoyama or Akasaka-- and this area

64
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,745
was the area where more American military base

65
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:01,940
facility was concentrated.

66
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:09,220
And first, or early broadcasting key station was located in these areas.

67
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,330
So there might be some kind of a connection between these two phenomena

68
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,980
or a geographical and structural relationship.

69
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:27,280
We also need to think about the relationship between these broadcasting

70
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:35,180
stations and Imperial Palace or other locations of ministries.

71
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,810
In the 1960s and 1970s, the TV image or TV network

72
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,970
became the major infrastructure or bases of Japanese culture.

73
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,420
That means that what people imagine or what people consume

74
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,150
- every kind of image was produced and consumed

75
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,090
through TV network in the 1960s and 1970s.

76
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,280
And consumption of these TV programs and the images

77
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,680
was very much ubiquitous and very much widespread.

78
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,220
But I again want to emphasize that the production of these images

79
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,540
was very much concentrated.

80
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,510
And in this process or in this infrastructure, as I explained,

81
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,810
the image of the royal family, an image of the emperor,

82
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:32,580
was again and again produced and consumed through these TV networks

83
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,034
until 1970 or '80s.

84
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:35,534
