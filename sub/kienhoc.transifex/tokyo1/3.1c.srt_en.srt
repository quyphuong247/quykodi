1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,495
The Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964 finally succeeded to get great popularity.

2
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:12,610


3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:20,560
But this popularity was not predictable in the first stage, when the Olympic

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,175
Games was decided to be hosted in Tokyo.

5
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:25,810


6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,930
Many articles in the newspaper shows relatively negative attitudes

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,090
toward this hosting.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,270


9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,260
Some newspapers said that the Japanese people tend to be easily capricious.

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,290


11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,975
In war time, they supported the war.

12
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:46,210


13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:53,160
And after the war, the people tend to be easily to support Olympic Games again.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,550
So there is a continuity of this capriciousness.

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,480


16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,319
As the article wrote, the decision of hosting of the Olympic Games

17
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:13,860
were not clearly decided in an open way, that this decision

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,905
was done in a very opaque manner.

19
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,090


20
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,800
And also, as the article said, this hosting

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,980
means heavy load to the lives of citizens in Tokyo.

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,420


23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,030
Especially some of the female writers or artists

24
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,020
showed a relatively negative attitude.

25
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,430
For example, very famous actress Hideko Takamine ,

26
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,790
showed the negative comment about the Olympic Games.

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,990
And also Michiko Inukai, she is a very famous critique,

28
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,435
and she showed also negative comments on the Olympic Games.

29
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:54,620


30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,830
So hosting the Olympic Games was not a completely popular thing

31
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,260
in late 1950's or early 1960s.

32
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,120
But it has changed after that.

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,240
In 1962, by the survey of the Tokyo Municipal Government,

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:20,110
the survey asked, "Do you know that the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo?"

35
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,620
More than 30% of the people answered no.

36
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,930
So the recognition of the Olympics itself are not so prevailed.

37
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,210
And in this survey, it also asked the people's attitude towards this hosting.

38
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,440


39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,280
It asked, "Do you agree with hosting the Olympic Games in Tokyo?"

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,420
38% of the people answered, strongly agree.

41
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,600
But 34% showed negatively agree.

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,010
And 11% negativity disagree.

43
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,330
And 9.7% strongly disagree.

44
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,930
So 20% of the people disagreed with the hosting.

45
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,670


46
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:10,410
Also, in 1962 the people who answered to agree with the hosting

47
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,760
explained the reason.

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,940


49
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,230
And most of the people answered, for example, appeal of Japan

50
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,340
for foreign countries, and development of the physical strength of Japan's

51
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,835
people, and also facilitation for the urban development in Tokyo.

52
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,230


53
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,580
But on the other hand, some of the people

54
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:41,330
who expressed the disagreement against the Olympic Games

55
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,570
explained their reason.

56
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,830


57
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,260
And they said, there are many other important problems,

58
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,850
more important than the Olympic Games.

59
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,130


60
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,040
And some of the other people said, to host

61
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,640
the Olympic Games is too early for Japanese society.

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,380


63
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:09,080
So there are many different opinions until 1962.

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,660
Also, people didn't believe that the Tokyo Olympic Game would succeed,

65
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,279
or it could be successful.

66
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,730


67
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:27,187
This graph shows the many people who see that the Tokyo Olympic Games will not

68
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:27,770
be successful.

69
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,370


70
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,210
That red line shows the people who believe

71
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,040
that Olympic Games will not be successful.

72
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,390
Blue line shows the rate of the people who

73
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,490
believe that Olympic Games will be successful.

74
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,600


75
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:54,180
So in 1960, 1961 and 1962, at least two years before the Olympic Games

76
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,327
took place, so many people believe that the Tokyo Olympic Games will not

77
00:04:59,327 --> 00:04:59,910
be successful.

78
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,700


79
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:08,240
But at the same time, the public opinions towards the Olympic Game

80
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,640
are changing because, from the spring of 1964 to the autumn of 1964,

81
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,550
the rate of the people who has strong interest of Olympic Games

82
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,950
increased rapidly.

83
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,160


84
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,570
According to this graph, such kinds of people

85
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,495
increased almost twice in these several months.

86
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,000


87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,160
This change of the people's attitude was related

88
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,085
with the news, or articles, in newspapesr, and programs on TV.

89
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,240


90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,690
This graph shows the increasing of the number

91
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:56,520
of articles in the newspapers from 1959 to 1964.

92
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,410
So it is very clear that after 1963, the number of articles about the Olympic

93
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,435
Games rapidly increased, almost expandingly.

94
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:12,420


95
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,700
There is a process to promote the image and interest towards the Olympic Games

96
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,370
in this nation from 1963 to 1964.

97
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:30,300
Just before the Olympic Games started, the Olympic Torch

98
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,720
did a tour all around this nation.

99
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,820


100
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,580
The Olympic Torch came from Athens and firstly landed to Okinawa.

101
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,970
Okinawa was still under the American occupation.

102
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:51,430
But from Okinawa, the torch moved to Kyushu and Hokkaido simultaneously.

103
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,520


104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,420
And from Kyushu and Hokkaido, the torch did a great tour all around Japan.

105
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,620


106
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:09,780
So we can see four different routes of the torch in the autumn of 1964.

107
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:20,320
And in each area, or each village and town, where the torch visited,

108
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,330
the local newspaper did a huge article about that,

109
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,070
wrote many, many stories about the torch in each region.

110
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,600


111
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:42,740
On TV, NHK, TBS, and major TV networks, organized and broadcasted the program

112
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,250
about the Olympic Games just before it started.

113
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,280


114
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,040
So this graph shows how long these programs

115
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,520
were broadcasted, how many hours these kinds of programs were broadcasting.

116
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,900
So these kinds of the Olympic programs expanded in 1964.

117
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:11,430
So all this information distributed by newspapers and TV

118
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,010
changed the attitude of the people towards the Olympic Games.

119
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,470
After the Olympic Games, the survey asked

120
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,820
"What is the most important media by which you experienced the Olympic

121
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,070
Games, or about the Olympic Games?"

122
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:39,250
And 91.7% of the people answered the television was the most important media

123
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,330
to understand, or to experience, the Olympics.

124
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,790
So this Olympics was experienced, or people's attitudes

125
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:53,100
towards the Olympics, was strongly influenced by television.

126
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,820


127
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,840
Actually, all the scenes in the Olympics was featured or filmed

128
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:09,640
by a television camera like this, and broadcasted in some broadcasting

129
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:16,120
towers in Tokyo, and consumed by people.

130
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,530
This graph shows the diffusion rate of the TV in each household.

131
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:28,850
So already in 1962, almost 90% of the Japanese people

132
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,070
already had television sets in their own household.

133
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,320
So almost every family has their own TV.

134
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,370
And they can experience, they can view the Olympic programs

135
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,310
through their own TV.

136
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,190
The situation is completely different from the middle of the 1950s.

137
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,530
And after 1960s, the major historical events

138
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,760
had been experienced by TV in many times.

139
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,320


140
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,910
The Royal Wedding was already experienced in 1958.

141
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:15,960
In 1964, the Olympic Games, but in 1969, university dispute, in 1970 Osaka EXPO,

142
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,710
and 1972, Asama Sanso Incident.

143
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,470
So all the national events, all historical incidents,

144
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,650
were experienced through television.

145
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,440


146
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:38,230
Television was already saturated in this society until early 1960's.

147
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:50,300
But even in this situation in 1964, with the question on one survey, this survey

148
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,970
asked the people, "Did you discover your identity as a Japanese person,

149
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,040
or did you discover your Japanese identity or so through the experience

150
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,930
of Olympic Games or not?"

151
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,350
And 34% of the people answered yes.

152
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,530


153
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,410
35% of the people answered no.

154
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,405
And no answer was 31%.

155
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,520


156
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:23,200
So people were more and more involved in the television viewing.

157
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,690
But at the same time, the attitude, or people's opinion, were not the same.

158
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,480


159
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,250
That kind of difference became more and more clear in the late 1960s.

160
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,634
