00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,182
In the last unit, I talked about the image of Harajuku and Omotesando.

2
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:17,560
Our image of Harajuku and Omotesando spread out from American military base.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,700
But after the 1960s, that America military base

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,030
disappeared in those areas.

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,170
But the image remained and people enjoyed

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,540
to consume the image of this area.

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,850
Not only Harajuku and Omotesando, but also Shonan

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:44,270
was a very popular and fashionable area for Japanese young people,

9
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,800
especially after the 1960s.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:56,270
But we also can trace back the origin of this image to American military base.

11
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,510
In other words, the connection between the American military

12
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,480
and young, consumable pop culture was very strong in these areas.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,540


14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,490
Actually, Kanagawa Prefecture or Shonan area

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:21,660
was one of the important areas where American military facilities remained

16
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:28,950
after the 1960s.

17
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,950
There are some prefectures where American military facility remained

18
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,880
even after the 1960s.

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,650
Okinawa is a typical prefecture where American military base still remains.

20
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:50,870
There's a huge amount of the area of American military base still today.

21
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:56,210
In case of Kanagawa Prefecture, there is some military base

22
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:02,530
which continue after the 1960s.

23
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:13,080
And from these military facilities, sporting culture, marine culture, music

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,260
culture, many kind of the American military cultures spread out,

25
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,130
and people enjoyed.

26
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,080


27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,670
So we can see similar connection between military and pop culture in Shonan

28
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,820
Beach and some of the other areas in Kanagawa Prefecture.

29
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,010
If I go back to the story of military facilities in Kanagawa Prefecture,

30
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,910
this is a picture of the Navy landing to this sea side,

31
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,640
to this Kanagawa Prefecture, just after the war.

32
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,620
Shonan Beach became a training ground for American Navy.

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,260
But at the same time, in the 1950s and early 1960s,

34
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:10,900
because of many American soldiers, prostitution

35
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,700
became a serious problem in this area.

36
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:23,890
And also, the younger people want to gather around this area,

37
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,920
because of American military culture.

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:36,650
The image of Shonan, fashionable and the pop image, or American image of Shonan,

39
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:43,510
was constructed in this process, from the 1950s to 1960s.

40
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,270
One of the popular images of this Shonan Beach

41
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,570
were connected with image of Hawaii.

42
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,700
It is a very much interesting correspondence

43
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,620
between Shonan and Hawaii, that both of these areas

44
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:10,710
include military facilities and very popular beaches where people enjoy

45
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:16,850
swimming, and surfing, and other marine sports, and also beach sound.

46
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,779
It is interesting to compare Shonan Beach with other beaches

47
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:28,530
in the Pacific-- Guam, Hawaii, and the Philippines.

48
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:36,000
In these beaches, military bases, beach culture, and consumption

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
are connected with each other.

50
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,960
In case of Shonan in the 1950s and 1960s,

51
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,970
Hawaii is very strong and impressive image to ordinary Japanese people.

52
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:57,860
Some of the people want to go to Hawaii, and some of the company campaign

53
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,540
to promote their commodities, their goods.

54
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:12,680
In this advertisement, if consumer wins a lottery, they could go to Hawaii.

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:23,160
So this is a campaign of a whisky company connected with Hawaii image.

56
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,130
Also, Shonan image was consumed in many Japanese cinema and music.

57
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,140
This film is called Season of the Sun.

58
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:42,950
Young people who enjoyed their life on this beach

59
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,300
were called the people of season.

60
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,910
The title was come from the famous novel written by Shintaro Ishihara.

61
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,960
He became a very right-wing person later.

62
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,110
Many of the popular phenomena in the 1960s

63
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,690
developed this beach culture, which in turn

64
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,735
emerged from American military base.

65
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:11,234
