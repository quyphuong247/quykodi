1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,870
On January 7 in 1989, Emperor Hirohito, Showa Tenno, died.

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,240


3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,700
But his critical situation on his health was already

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:25,720
announced in September, 1988, five months before.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,320
And after this announcement, the huge self-imposed control movement,

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,710
in Japanese we call jishuku, was started.

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,980
So many parades, ceremonies, concerts and other kinds of big events were

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,990
cancelled from the organizers themselves.

9
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,260
Because such kinds of events, people thought

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:56,990
it might be a little bit disrespectful for the Emperor.

11
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:02,790
And also every day TV news talked about his condition.

12
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,060
And people understand X Day was coming.

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,210
X Day means the day of Emperor's death.

14
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,270


15
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:20,480
Because Showa really started from 1925, and it continued more than 60 years.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,180
And Emperor's death means the end of this long Showa.

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,840
So some people have a very strong feeling about this ending.

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,530


19
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,122
And actually in January Emperor died.

20
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:45,400
And after his death, so many people gathered in Imperial Palace

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:56,920
to pray or to register their own names for the Emperor or Emperor's funeral.

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,060
I conducted an interview survey in the Imperial Plaza

23
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,310
about how people felt about Emperor's death.

24
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:11,020
But the third day after we started our research to the people,

25
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,360
a policeman come to me and I was taken to the policeman

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,920
and interrogated about the reason, and so on, what I am doing.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,460
And finally I was said, you should not do that because this Imperial Plaza was

28
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,990
only the place for the people to come here to pray

29
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:41,560
or register for emperor's funeral, and also some of the journalists

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,170
who are authorized by government.

31
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,010
As I do not want to be arrested, I needed

32
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,310
to finish my research or my interview in Imperial Plaza.

33
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,640
But after the research we already published

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,360
about the document of the Emperor's death in 1989, in those days.

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,530
But anyway, the many people have different feeling,

36
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,480
and different vision, and different voices about Emperor Hirohito

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,060
and days of Showa.

38
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,950
And some of them are documented in films.

39
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,450
So the next film is a very interesting film,

40
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:33,450
focused on one old man who is 100 years old, and who lived in Sanya district.

41
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,150
Sanya is a very poor district at the fringe of Tokyo.

42
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,960
And his narrative and his vision towards Showa and Emperor

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,365
is very insightful for us even today.

44
00:03:51,365 --> 00:06:36,090


45
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,250
This old man living in Sanya is quite unique

46
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,380
because he has a strong confidence with himself.

47
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:51,440
And he speaks about Emperor, something like an old man like him.

48
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,870
And he emphasized that the Emperor should

49
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,770
have chosen a better date of death.

50
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,110
Because January is a New Year's celebration.

51
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,230
And for him, New Year celebration is much more important

52
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,496
than Emperor's death.

53
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:12,680
This is quite different from the other peoples' view.

54
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:22,710
Because as I explained, from September 1988 to January or February of 1989,

55
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:29,190
many people in this country cancelled their celebration and their event

56
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:36,540
because of Emperor's critical situation and death.

57
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,030
So celebration was cancelled because of Emperor.

58
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,170
But that old man emphasized the celebration

59
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,870
is more important than Emperor.

60
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:55,630
So there's a big difference between the dominant view and this old man's view.

61
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:03,710
In dominant view, after the death of the Emperor, in mass media,

62
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:13,290
we have a huge amount of the image about funeral or the grief and mourning

63
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,830
and people's long lines to registration and to pray, and so on.

64
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,050
So all of these kinds of, the mass media image,

65
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,590
implicitly signified the Emperor's gaze.

66
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,539
In other words, the people's attitudes and behavior and consciousness

67
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:42,340
in this country was integrated with implicit gaze of Emperor

68
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,400
in this moment.

69
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,750
But the old man who has no money and almost nothing,

70
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,950
and who lives in a very poor area, still has a strong sense

71
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:03,460
of his own identity outside of this Emperor's gaze system,

72
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,765
or the system of Emperor's gaze.

73
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:08,860


74
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,240
So throughout this module, I've been talking

75
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
about the development of the gaze system or visualing

76
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,920
system under that Emperor's gaze.

77
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:26,250
And that kind of system transformed and changed and restructured.

78
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,960
But throughout this process, we also need

79
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,530
to understand there's a kind of limit of this gazing system.

80
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:46,140
And this story of this old man can make us understand that kind of limit.

81
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,840
And we also think about the many different kinds

82
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,920
of limit of this gazing system from many different documented

83
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,070
film and photographs.
