1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,400
I have explained the structural difference

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,550
of urban core between premodern and modern times.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,860
But urban core or cultural core after the 1920s

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,260
are different from both of these cases.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,340
The population of Tokyo expanded gradually from the late 19th Century.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,890
But after the 1910s or '20s, it expanded more rapidly, especially after 1923

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,330
when the great Kanto earthquake occurred.

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,630
More and more people moved from the central area

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,490
to the area in the West in this city.

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:51,220
So this is Tokyo until late 19th Century.

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,910


12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,410
But after the 20th Century, especially in the 1920s,

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,700
Tokyo was expanded to the West.

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,780
And huge suburban district or areas emerged in these areas.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,810
So people who started to live in these West area

16
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:25,010
needed to move to downtown to work or to study and in some other purposes.

17
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:34,900
So the transportation system from these suburban area to central area

18
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,700
was developed.

19
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,380


20
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,615
And people need to transfer the station at the hub of this transportation

21
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:48,390
system.

22
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,150
That was Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Ikebukuro

23
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,700
So Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Ikebukuro developed very rapidly

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:08,395
after the 1920s as new urban core or new hub of this transportation system.

25
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,030


26
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:17,320
We can see some of the concrete images of this transportation system

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,570
and development of this new urban core after the 1920s.

28
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,560
Shinjuku was already developing urban core from the 1920s.

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,630
This is an image of Shinjuku in the 1920s and '30s.

30
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,770
So in this district, there are some department stores and restaurants

31
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,890
and movie theaters.

32
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:51,820
But in the war, as I already taught in first module,

33
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,990
Shinjuku and other central area of this city was completely burned out.

34
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,360
And after the war, especially in the occupational era,

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,460
Shinjuku emerged as black market areas.

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:10,730
The first black market was appeared only five days after the war ended.

37
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:17,610
Ozu market, which was located in eastern Shinjuku, and other market, Wada market

38
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:23,340
and Yasuda market, surrounded station area of Shinjuku.

39
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,420
So Shinjuku was very famous for these kinds of black markets.

40
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,050
The black market is a scattered area by merchant

41
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,190
and other kind of the Yakuza people.

42
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:44,310
So in the black market, all commodity was buy and sell illegally.

43
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,420
Or, illegal distribution was very common in this area,

44
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,190
and it was open air district.

45
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,450
For people, it is very easy to join and go out.

46
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,030


47
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,250
But after the 1950 or 1960s, Shinjuku gradually

48
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:09,210
developed as huge transportation hub.

49
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,800
This is a graph of population in Tokyo after the war.

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,310
Red line means the city area or downtown area of Tokyo.

51
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,560
And blue line means metropolitan area, including suburban area.

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,150
So you can see the suburban area-- in the suburban area, the population

53
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,980
increased more rapidly than downtown areas.

54
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,390
Because of this expansion of suburban area, the number of passengers

55
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,270
also increased.

56
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:53,420
The red, blue, green line shows the number of the passengers who transfered

57
00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:05,790
or who passed the area of our station in Shinjuku or other transportation hub.

58
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:14,320
So the number of these passengers increased very much after the 1950s.

59
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,200
Also, the transportation system developed very much.

60
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,500
In 1904 in Tokyo, there are very few railway system.

61
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:35,370
But after 1938, the transportation system expanded towards suburban area.

62
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:43,830
And in 1968, even in downtown area, many subway systems were developed.

63
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,330
So Tokyo became the huge network of these transportation system.

64
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,930
And importance of the hub in these transportation system

65
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,920
became more and more increased.

66
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,510


67
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:06,980
This is an image of a new town in western suburb called Tama New Town.

68
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,850
And this new town became, until the 1980s,

69
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,770
very big suburban district like this.

70
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:24,980
So we can see some of the moving image of Shinjuku Station in the 1960s.

71
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,830
This film was produced by Tokyo Metropolitan Government in 1961.

72
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,300
And you can understand how crowded this area was.

73
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,270
Or, huge amount of people move around this station.

74
00:06:42,270 --> 00:08:22,367
