1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,380
REPORTER: Designated Allied Supreme Commander

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,316
to accept the surrender of the Japanese.

3
00:00:11,316 --> 00:00:15,244
He was met by Lieutenant General Eichenberger commanding the Eighth

4
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:15,744
Army.

5
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:22,640


6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,940
The war ended on fifteenth of August, and General MacArthur

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,340
landed at the Atsugi Airport at the end of August.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,980


9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,710
There are many pictures and moving image which document this landing.

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,160
I will show one of them.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,270
There are many symbolic and important images of this landing.

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:01:00,620
This is an image of Douglas MacArthur who exit from his airplane-- Douglas

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,850
MacArthur and his army walking.

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,080


15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,580
So the question is, by whom were these photographs taken?

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,410
Of course, the answer is American journalists and photographers.

17
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:30,870
But the more important question is, for whom were these photographs taken?

18
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,510
Japanese people or American people?

19
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:42,280
MacArthur landed at the Atsugi Airport at the end of August, as I said.

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,100
But the images of Douglas MacArthur's landing

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,760
did not appear in the newspaper the next day.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,120
So the images of Douglas MacArthur were not

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,090
so much appeared in Japanese media in occupational era.

24
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:08,060
This is very strange because Douglas MacArthur has a strong power.

25
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,580
He's very much powerful, and every Japanese people knew that.

26
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:22,320
But his visual images were not appear so much.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,290
One of the reason of disappearance was American censorship system.

28
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:38,320
American censorship system prohibit to show the image of America as occupier.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,825
The media was required to pretend the occupation did not exist.

30
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,970


31
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:57,136
So the answer of former question-- for whom were these photographs taken--

32
00:02:57,136 --> 00:03:02,970
the answer is these photographs were taken

33
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,800
for American spectators and readers.

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,260
So the third question is, what kind of role

35
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,320
did Japanese people play in this context?

36
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,370
In order to think about this question, we

37
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,840
need to analyze the photograph itself in more details.

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,070


39
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,820
This is a picture of General MacArthur exiting from headquarter building.

40
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,090


41
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:50,280
But in front of him, there are many Americans with cameras.

42
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,590
So these cameras try to take the picture of him.

43
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,740


44
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:06,700
But behind these Americans with cameras, there are many Japanese spectators too.

45
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:14,290
So first, Americans with camera-- and second, Japanese spectators.

46
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,040


47
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:26,680
But thirdly, behind Douglas MacArthur, there

48
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:34,790
is a third camera-- a bird's eye camera-- that recorded from above,

49
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:45,940
took all these scenery-- relationship between General MacArthur and American

50
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,290
photographer, and the relationship between Japanese spectators

51
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,820
and Douglas MacArthur and Americans.

52
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,570
All these relationships were taken by another camera

53
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,410
behind General MacArthur.

54
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,420
So there are three different gaze.

55
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:15,210
One is Americans' with cameras, and second is gaze from Japanese

56
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:23,730
spectators, but thirdly, there is another camera from behind.

57
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:29,290
This relationship between-- this relationship of gazing

58
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,910
is one of the important structure of gazing in the occupational era.

59
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,860


60
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:49,830
So gazing, or viewing, is very important moment of occupation and power

61
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,575
in this period.

62
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:53,340


63
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,970
Actually, Americans brought many cameras in occupational Japan.

64
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,975
And camera was one of the important tools

65
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:18,860
to document, and to analyze, and to control Japanese society.

66
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:27,170
Occupational Japan was documented and analyzed by many cameras

67
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,025
and with many photographs.

68
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:32,570


69
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:41,750
On the street, American soldiers watched Japanese very poor merchant

70
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,830
and his goods.

71
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:50,410
Also on the street, American women watched

72
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:56,460
Japanese children and Japanese small merchants' goods.

73
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,650
So throughout this process, Japanese people and Japanese society

74
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:10,210
became a kind of object to be taken by American camera and gaze.
