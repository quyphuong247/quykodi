1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,580
During the American occupational era, the sudden Americanization process

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,790
happened.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:18,210
This process includes Americanization of our ears, our eyes,

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,620
and our whole way of life.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:29,980
In terms of Americanization of our ears, only one month after the defeat, Ogawa

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,225
Kikumatsu, a publisher published a book titled Anglo-Japanese Conversation

7
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:35,725
Manual.

8
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:38,500


9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,120
This book, very short and very small book,

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:54,700
but it became great seller, great bestseller, it sold 3.6 million copies.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,590
You can see the picture of the book, it's

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,590
quite simple, because some of the sentences is, good morning, thank you,

13
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:12,890
how do you do, and so on, so this is completely basic American conversation.

14
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:21,990
Also NHK radio program titled Come Come English, directed by Hirakawa Tadaichi

15
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,400
became very popular after 1946.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,280
The opening song of this program started like this, "Come come everybody.

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,930
How do you do, and how are you?

18
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,850
Won't you have some candy?

19
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,490
One, and two, and three, four five?

20
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:51,420
Let's all sing a happy song", this is the introduction of this program.

21
00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:01,590
And also radio program titled News from America directed by Sakai Yoneo

22
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,480
became very popular too.

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,090
So all these programs and conversation book

24
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:15,650
are some of the examples of Americanization of ears.

25
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:23,630
The comic book Blondie was serialized in weekly Asahi and Asahi newspaper

26
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:33,650
after 1946, that became very popular, and also American Exhibition

27
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,890
were taken place in Nishinomiya and collected more than 2,000,000 people

28
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,630
within three months.

29
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,165
These are examples of Americanization of our eyes.

30
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,960


31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,980
So this Americanization process include our ears and eyes, and also

32
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,130
our whole way of life.

33
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:06,600
Also the film was the most effective media for this Americanization process.

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,480
CIE was a strong facilitator of this process.

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,010
One of these films was a For a Bright Home Life.

36
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:21,350


37
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:28,580
This film was a corroboration between CIE and Japanese filmmaker.

38
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:36,330
This film is very informative and at the same time insightful

39
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,960
for this Americanization process including whole way of life.

40
00:03:40,960 --> 00:04:10,410


41
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,380
The contrast between new efficient American home

42
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,220
life and old conventional Japanese home life was very clear,

43
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,280
especially contrast between American kitchen and Japanese kitchen

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:32,860
was very evident and Keiko who come from urban tiny house

45
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:40,270
and Mitsuko who come from rural old house, both of these two girls

46
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:50,580
tried to promote Americanization of their home life and like these films,

47
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:59,000
young women in postwar era were shown as promoter for democratization

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,100
or Americanization of Japanese home life.

49
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,480


50
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,700
Through these media, radio, film, book, exhibition,

51
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:20,130
and so on, American way of life was promoted during occupational era.

52
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,090
After the 1950s and 1960s, Japanese people

53
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,415
became more and more pro-America.

54
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:30,830


55
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:37,630
We can see how Japanese sense of affinity towards the U.S.

56
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,600
became so stable and so strong.

57
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,540
Blue line shows affinity to America, this means pro-American sentiment,

58
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:59,140
so this pro-American sentiment continue very stabily from 1970 toward today.

59
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:07,060
It is very different from affinity to China because in the 1970s many people,

60
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,430
almost same rate of people preferred China,

61
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:19,310
but the rate decreased very much and today many of Japanese people cannot be

62
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,950
so pro-China, basically anti-China.

63
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,470


64
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,710
This is current situation.

65
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:34,790
So compare with other countries, even with South Korea or Philippine, East

66
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:41,450
Asian societies, Japanese anti-Chinese sentiment is very strong.

67
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,010


68
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:50,200
On the other hand, Japanese people are stably pro-America.

69
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,130
Today, for example, we have Tokyo Disneyland in water front area

70
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:02,050
and we have many Statue of Liberty even in Tokyo.

71
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,150


72
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,070
The important question is why Japanese people

73
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,695
are so continuously pro-America more than 50 years.

74
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:16,440


75
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,920
Maybe one hypothesis to answer this question can be Americam mass culture,

76
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,870
but American mass culture is very strong not only in Japan but also

77
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:35,550
South Korea, Taiwan, Southeast Asian countries, even South Asia or Middle

78
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:42,070
East Asian countries, Latin America, Europe, everywhere,

79
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,210
so the American mass culture can not be the only reason why

80
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,950
the U.S. continues to be popular in Japan.

81
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,710
The other answer might be democracy and economic support.

82
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,750
It is true that during the late 1940s and 1950s,

83
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:14,050
American democracy and economic support was very popular in Japanese society.

84
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,080
But it was 50 years ago.

85
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:26,000
So democracy and American economic support cannot be the only reason why

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,695
postwar Japanese society continuously have strong pro-American sentiment.

87
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:38,590


88
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,669
Third hypothesis might be Japanese society

89
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:50,260
was colonized completely by American power.

90
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:57,950
It is true that American hegemony is in some sense a form of colonization

91
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:05,980
but it is spread all around the world but this element also

92
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,270
widely spread all around the world.

93
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:17,550
For example Philippine and some of the South East

94
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:26,860
Asian countries are maybe culturally and economically colonized by America,

95
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:33,150
and also South American, middle and South American society

96
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,820
were colonized by American hegemony.

97
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,690
But in case of Japan, compared with those countries,

98
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:51,175
it is a little bit different, so colonization and colonization

99
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:56,550
of Japanese society by America hegemony can not be only reason.

100
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,850
I think the popularity of America can be explained

101
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,790
by the continuity of imperial unconsciousness of Japan.

102
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:16,360
Because after the war American hegemony or American power

103
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,830
made Japanese society possible to reconstruct

104
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,570
a kind of imperial identity of Japanese society.

105
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:37,270
In other words, Japanese culture and economic hegemony, or centricity

106
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,980
can be reconstructed under American gaze,

107
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:50,680
and Japanese society can develop without facing the other in Asian society

108
00:10:50,680 --> 00:11:00,060
where imperial Japan had embedded in prewar and inwar period.

109
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,110
So we need to think about these kinds of the continuity

110
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,760
from prewar and inwar period, and postwar period along

111
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,780
with American hegemony or in other words,

112
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:22,250
Japanese imperial regime continued and reformulated in cold war regime

113
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:28,460
from the late 1940s toward 1960s and 1970s.

114
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,567
