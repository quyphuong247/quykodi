1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,920
In this module, I've been talking about the continuity

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,460
from American military facility to the consumption of popular culture

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:23,170
by young people in Harajuku, Omotesando and Shonan Beach.

4
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,950
In postwar Tokyo, there's some very major district

5
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:34,230
for the consumption of popular culture of young people, especially

6
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,300
Omotesando, Harajuku, Roppongi, and Shonan Beach

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,870
were the very typical spaces for this kind

8
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,560
of popular consumption of American culture.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,450
But this consumption of American culture was historically

10
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,300
connected with the culture of the American military base.

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,730
Of course, the young people after 1970 or 1980

12
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,760
may never think about this kind of connection

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,690
with the American military base.

14
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:20,980
They only consume American culture in those places.

15
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:28,360
In Harajuku, people want to dance and people want to buy American fashion.

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:35,420
And people want to dance rock and roll and other kinds of music.

17
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,230
Also, in Shonan people only want to consume

18
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,480
surfing and other kinds of marine sports, and beach sound.

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,090
So they never think about the connection with the American military base.

20
00:01:53,090 --> 00:02:00,080
But from historical perspective, one of the reasons why these kinds of areas

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,170
became such kinds of fashionable spaces was the connection

22
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,380
with the American military base.

23
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,350
After the 1960s, these areas were returned to Japan

24
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,000
and changed to other kinds of spaces for cultural consumption.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,790
So the military base itself basically did not

26
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,850
exist so much after the 1960s and '70s.

27
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,650
We need to think about the historical background of these spaces in depth.

28
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,480
This is a map of the center of Tokyo I've already

29
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,670
showed in the occupation era.

30
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:47,930
The black color shows American military facilities in those days.

31
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,510
And some of the districts were very much concentrated area

32
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:59,190
of American military facilities, Yoyogi, Roppongi, Aoyama,

33
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,020
and some of the others.

34
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:09,990
And many of these areas became very much fashionable and trendy areas

35
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,950
for young people after the 1960s.

36
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,920
But as I already explained, many of these areas

37
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,810
had been Japanese military facilities until the end of the war.

38
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,130
So there is a kind of continuity from Japanese military facilities

39
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:42,060
and American military facilities, and culture of consumption after the 1960s.

40
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,000
What is the relationship between Japanese military facilities,

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,810
and American military facilities, and cultural consumption?

42
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,300
This is exactly what I'll be explaining.

43
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,980


44
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:06,820
If I focus on some areas in Tokyo, for example,

45
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:15,320
Roppongi, Hibiya, Aoyama, and Yoyogi, all these areas,

46
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,630
and all these districts were located in the centeral Tokyo.

47
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:25,520
And all these districts had been once a Japanese military field,

48
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,820
and concentrated area of Japanese military facilities.

49
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,630
For example, Hibiya was the first military ground in the Meji era.

50
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:44,130
And it changed to a national park after the late Meji period.

51
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,050
In the related course, Visualizing Japan,

52
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:55,310
Professor Andy Gordon discusses about Hibiya riot in late Meji period.

53
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,600
In that moment, Hibiya was already a national park.

54
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,290
But before that, until the early Meji era,

55
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:11,600
Hibiya had been the first military ground for the Meji government.

56
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,400
After the Hibiya, this military field changed to Aoyama.

57
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,110
So Aoyama had been the military field until early Showa.

58
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,010


59
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,300
And after that, Aoyama changed to a national park

60
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:39,715
again to be the main stadium for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1940.

61
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:49,520
The Showa government tried to take place the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1940.

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,470
It was not realized.

63
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:58,360
But if it were realized, the Aoyama area would

64
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,460
have been the main stadium for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1940.

65
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:15,800
So the military field changed to a park for the Olympic Games in prewar period

66
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,920
already.

67
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,580
Before the war,

68
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:26,220
after Aoyama area changed to an Olympic field,

69
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,020
the military field moved to Yoyogi area.

70
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:38,130
So Yoyogi became the military field for the Japanese military until the war.

71
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,790


72
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:47,030
And after the war ended, I explained Yoyogi military field

73
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,780
changed to Washington Heights, American military facilities.

74
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,760


75
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,430
And Washington Heights was returned to Japan

76
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,020
just before the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964.

77
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:11,930
So in the case of Yoyogi, the Japanese military field

78
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,830
changed to Washington Heights, American military facility area,

79
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:22,770
and changed to an Olympic park, and the Yoyogi Park.

80
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:32,240
In all of these cases, the military field has changed to a national park.

81
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,170
There's a kind of stereotypical pattern of these changing

82
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,980
from a military field to a national park.

83
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:51,280
Also, in case of Roppongi, today we have many museums, new types of museums,

84
00:07:51,280 --> 00:08:01,110
in Roppongi because the New National Museum, and Mori Art Museum,

85
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,160
and Tokyo Midtown.

86
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,280
And Roppongi is a very much fashionable area for young people today.

87
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Maybe Roppongi is the most fashionable and trendy area in Tokyo today.

88
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,350
But the origin of Roppongi was military facilities.

89
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:30,150
After the late Meiji period, most of the Japanese military people

90
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,520
moved from around the Imperial Palace area

91
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,270
to the Roppongi area, or the Azabu area.

92
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,130
So Azabu and Roppongi area became one of the most concentrated areas

93
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,400
of military facilities in Tokyo.

94
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,370
And all of these Japanese military facilities

95
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,890
were taken over by American military facilities.

96
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:04,630
So Roppongi and Azabu area changed from a Japanese military town

97
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,610
to an American military town.

98
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,750
That is why this area became very fashionable,

99
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,160
because around this American military culture,

100
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,960
people want to consume these kinds of American culture very much.

101
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,970
So young people gathered around the American military base,

102
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,720
and American military facilities.

103
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,480
And they enjoyed American music, and American fashion,

104
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,270
and other kinds of American culture.

105
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:47,630
But also after the 1960s and '70s, most of the American military facilities

106
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,750
in Roppongi were returned to Japan.

107
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,330
Today, we can still see the American military facilities

108
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,660
for helicopters in downtown Roppongi.

109
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,450
It still remains.

110
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,390


111
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:12,290
So there is a continuity from American military facility, to national park,

112
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:19,000
and other kinds of cultural areas in postwar Tokyo.

113
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,520
It is the same as suburban Tokyo, if we look at the suburb of Tokyo

114
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,030
in Tachikawa and Yokota.

115
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:35,340
In Yokota, the American military base still remained.

116
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,972
Yokota Airbase was one of the largest air

117
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:43,880
bases in the Tokyo metropolitan area.

118
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:52,340
In the case of Tachikawa, in Tachikawa, before the war

119
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,510
there was a Japanese military base.

120
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,370
And it changed to an American military base.

121
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,780
So Tachikawa base was one of the largest bases of American military

122
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,120
until recently.

123
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,960
But recently, it changed to a national park.

124
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,640
So today, there is a very huge national park.

125
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,960
Showa Memorial Park was constructed.

126
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,410
So even in this case, Japanese military facilities

127
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,050
changed to American military facilities and national park.

128
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,080
This is also a typical case.

129
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:40,590
So today, people in Tokyo enjoy these kinds of green parks, or big parks.

130
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:48,260
And also young people in Tokyo enjoy American pop culture, or very much

131
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,190
cosmopolitan culture in Roppongi and Harajuku.

132
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:58,790
But the origin of these cultures was spread out

133
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,840
from American military bases, as I explained.

134
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,660
These American facilities were based on the preexisting Japanese military

135
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,440
facilities.

136
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,200
So on the one hand, we need to understand this kind of continuity.

137
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,560
And on the other hand, why these kinds of continuity

138
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,060
were not so evident, because this kind of continuity

139
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,840
was not visible in Tokyo at all.

140
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:37,660
So in the final unit, I'm going to explain about what is this continuity?

141
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,650
And what is the continuity of all these kinds of traces of these areas?

142
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,667
