1
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:06,680
Now we move to Showa Emperor.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,190
Showa Emperor is Emperor Hirohito.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,800
There's a kind of continuity from Emperor Meiji to Showa Emperor in terms

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,980
of his body and gazing system.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,660


6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,680
Emperor Showa is also the center of this gazing system which

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,360
expanded to whole region this Japanese empire, including

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,800
the Korean peninsula, and Manchuria, and other regions in Asia.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,890
So as the center of this gazing or visual system,

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:53,930
Emperor Showa as the masculine or supreme body of military system.

11
00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:00,680
In this picture he's riding the horse as a top person

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,995
of military system with other military people.

13
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:07,810


14
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,940
Even in this picture-- because this picture is just before the war ended--

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,680
all the city was already burned out and something like ruin,

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,320
Emperor Hirohito go around to observe the situation.

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,000
But he still act as a supreme body of military system,

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,190
or in a very military and masculine figure.

19
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,730


20
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,550
But after the war, the image of emperor body

21
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,520
has drastically changed, especially after the meeting

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,540
with General MacArthur in September 27.

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,720


24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,810
Emperor Hirohito visited General MacArthur on the day

25
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,120
and they talked a lot.

26
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,530
And the end of this meeting, American photographer,

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,360
or occupation army's photographer, took a picture of them together.

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,920


29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,600
And this photograph was shown in the newspaper two days

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:33,620
after, on 29th of September, and made great shock among Japanese people.

31
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,680
Because the relationship between the US and Japan

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:47,860
was clearly shown in this one photograph, in this one picture.

33
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,600
Very clear.

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,070
On the one hand, General MacArthur was very tall, and mature,

35
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,460
and very relaxed, was here in his military suit and so on.

36
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:09,570
On the other hand, Emperor Hirohito was relatively small, and formal suit,

37
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,140
and very much tense.

38
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,880


39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,860
On the one hand, General MacArthur closed his mouth,

40
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,950
but Emperor Hirohito a little bit opened his mouth.

41
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,230
So all of the contrast between these two figures.

42
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,430
The American side was mature and strong.

43
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,230
Japanese side was young and weak.

44
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,330
So this photograph was the representative image.

45
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:47,930
It was said that this photograph was a representative, or symbolic image

46
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,410
of the relationship between US and Japan.

47
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,560


48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
Japanese people were shocked.

49
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,650
And at the same time, this image, in some sense,

50
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:11,825
very strongly hurt, or destroyed the image of Emperor Hirohito, or Emperor

51
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:16,899
Showa, which continued from Meiji era to early Showa era.

52
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,210
Because the masculine and military image of the Emperor

53
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:28,870
Showa was already almost destroyed by this one photograph.

54
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,000
The photograph of Emperor Hirohito with Douglas MacArthur,

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,490
which appeared in September 1945 , damaged the Emperor's image very much.

56
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,730
And this damage was not a good thing for occupation armies themselves.

57
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,690
So it is a lot of the reason why Douglas MacArthur did not

58
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:00,980
want to appear in front of Japanese people so much after the 1940s.

59
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,790
And he did not want to appear especially with Emperor Hirohito

60
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:12,720
because he did not want to damage Emperor's image anymore.

61
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,870
However, the popular discourse continued to damage the Emperor's image.

62
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,660
One of the very famous examples of this is this placard

63
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,860
that appeared in the May 1st demonstration in the Imperial

64
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,290
Palace in late 1940s.

65
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:45,080
The placard in this picture was again and again mentioned in many discourse,

66
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,360
but it is also mentioned by Professor John

67
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,110
Dower in his very famous book, Embracing Defeat.

68
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,590
And he mentioned and he analyzed the meaning of this placard

69
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,240
in Chapter Eight.

70
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,950
Let me quote, "The placard involved was a crudely lettered sign

71
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,300
brought to the demonstration by Matsushima Shotaro,

72
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,820
a Communist employee of precision tool company.

73
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:28,050
Couched partly in colloquial language and partly in the language reserved

74
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:36,260
for the august sovereign himself, it read, 'Imperial Edict.

75
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,720
The national polity has been maintained.

76
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,970
I am eating my fill.

77
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,870
You people, starve and die.

78
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:53,850
Imperial sign and seal.' The other side of the placard contained a less often

79
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:03,800
quoted statement, 'Why are we starving no matter how much we work?

80
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,430
Answer, Emperor Hirohito.'" Quote end.

81
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,640
This image of the Emperor was considered to be a kind of blasphemy

82
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:22,020
because the Emperor was sacred and religious figure until war end.

83
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,160
Not only this case, but also in some of the other cases.

84
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,230
This is a cover over the magazine titled, Real Story.

85
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:40,500
Because he is standing on the skulls of the people who died in the world.

86
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:48,730
And he's standing wearing the business suit because before the war

87
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:55,330
he was always almost he wore the military suit,

88
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,960
but he changed his suit to businesses suit.

89
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,250
And he bow toward American occupational army.

90
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,020
So this image of the Emperor Hirohito can also

91
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:18,860
be considered very much blasphemy among the popular discourses.

92
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,440
Some of the other examples also include the pseudo-emperor,

93
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,520
because after the war there are some people who start to say,

94
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,260
I am real emperor and Emperor Hirohito is a pseudo-emperor.

95
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,919
So such kind of discourse also became very popular.

96
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,049
So there's a kind of the continuous attack

97
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:52,080
to the sacred image of Emperor Hirohito throughout the occupation era.

98
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,490
And the sacred, or religious image of the Emperor Hirohito

99
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:05,250
was damaged again and again in occupation era.

100
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,220
So from the perspective of the occupational army,

101
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,440
along with the Japanese government, they felt the necessity

102
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,830
to reconstruct the image of the Emperor Hirohito in other way.

103
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:25,465
I'm going to discuss about the process of reconstruction of the Emperor's

104
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:31,860
image throughout 1940s and also 1950s.

105
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,800
