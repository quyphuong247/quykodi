00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,540
The relationship between high skyscrapers

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,230
and the people who are living under these skyscrapers

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,070
was filmed in many TV programs.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,440
I'm going to show two very impressive documentary

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,600
programs broadcast on NHK in the 1980s.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:32,940
First one is titled Kaleidoscope of New Urban Center broadcast in 1980.

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,560
It is a 30 minute program, but I only can show one minute and a half.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,623
But please enjoy the program.

00:00:45,060 --> 00:02:18,410


11
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,250
As shown in this film, even after the development of Western Shinjuku

12
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,150
business centers, some of the areas under these skyscrapers

13
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,400
have not changed so much.

14
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,370
Please remember these photographs.

15
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,630
This photograph shows the district before urban development

16
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,670
in Western Shinjuku area.

17
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,130
So some of these landscapes of this district still remained

18
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,290
or people's lives in those areas were still

19
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,980
continued even after the development of huge business

20
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,940
centers in Western Shinjuku.

21
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,260
Next program I will show is Skyscraper in My Neighborhood,

22
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,768
Western Shinjuku through the eyes of children.

23
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:15,170
[SCHOOL CHIMES]

24
00:03:15,170 --> 00:06:01,210


25
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:09,230
This program was broadcast in 1987, directed by Kei Nishikawa.

26
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,830
This director also filmed some of the important films

27
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:23,020
about scars and the photographer in Nagasaki who suffered by atomic bomb.

28
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:30,700
But in this film, the film shows the relationship

29
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:37,130
between the children who live around the skyscraper and the viewpoint

30
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,640
from these small children toward skyscrapers.

31
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,040
Again, please remember this photograph I already showed.

32
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:56,260
This is a photograph of children who play in the field of Western Shinjuku

33
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,500
before development.

34
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,420
So the everyday life or the landscape for these children

35
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,970
are not so much different, or very different

36
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:16,370
but continued before and after the redevelopment.

37
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,100
In other words, the prospective home these children

38
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,670
continued from and after the development in Shinjuku.

39
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,720
So there's a sharp contrast between the change

40
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,170
of the landscape or construction of huge buildings

41
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:42,020
and a kind of continuity of everyday life of these kids in this area.
