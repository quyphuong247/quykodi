00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,710
NARRATOR: Succeeding bomber groups add their devastation

2
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,521
to the smoking targets.

3
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:55,980


4
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,860
SHUNYA YOSHIMI: World War II was the first war

5
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,200
where area bombing played a central role in the battle.

6
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,390


7
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,006
German Air Force bombed London, and London was destroyed completely.

8
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,610


9
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,585
British and America air force bombed Dresden and other German cities.

10
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:17,305


11
00:01:17,305 --> 00:01:20,202
NARRATOR: The bombers turn and go downwind.

12
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:26,400
Japan's air force bombed Chinese cities: Shanghai, Nanjing, and Chongqing.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,970


14
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:38,260
And the US air force bombed Okinawa, Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki,

15
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,730
and more than 200 cities in Japan.

16
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,430


17
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,890
And by this bombing, 330,000 people died.

18
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,390
Most of this bombing was done after March 1945.

19
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,755
At the moment, Japanese air defense had already collapsed.

20
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:03,150


21
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:11,215
So American air force could do the bombing from low altitude at midnight.

22
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,610


23
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,275
These bombings include fire bomb and also napalm bomb.

24
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,310


25
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,855
This kind of the air force bombing continued even after the war.

26
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,240


27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:34,630
During Korean War, Vietnam War, and even Gulf and Iraq War.

28
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,570
So we can consider the continuity of air force bombing

29
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,750
throughout 20th century and early 21st century,

30
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,930
especially during Cold War era.

31
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,680


32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,160
I'm going to show some of the pictures of destroyed Tokyo

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,890
by air force bombing at the end of the war.

34
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,440


35
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,210
This is a picture of destroyed Tokyo after March 10 bombing.

36
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,560


37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,970
You can see the center of Tokyo was almost burned out.

38
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:22,280


39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,880
This is northeast downtown Tokyo.

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,100


41
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,920
You can see the river of Sumida River.

42
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,600


43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,525
Sumida River is the widest river which goes through northeast Tokyo downtown.

44
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:40,740


45
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,040
This is an area of northeast downtown Tokyo,

46
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,340
and you also can see the Sumida River.

47
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,370


48
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,010
These pictures were taken by American Air Force.

49
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,755
So this is the landscape viewed by American Air Force.

50
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:04,310


51
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,105
The number of Japanese victims in World War II.

52
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:09,510


53
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,250
So in Hiroshima, more than 200,000 people

54
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:23,360
died because of atomic bomb in August 1945.

55
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:38,490
In Okinawa, more than 150,000 people died by the battle in June 1945.

56
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:48,820
But in Tokyo, around 100,000 people died by the bombing by American air force.

57
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,190


58
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,620
So Tokyo, Okinawa, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki,

59
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,850
these four areas were the area where most of the people died by the battle

60
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,530
at the end of the war.

61
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,320


62
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,620
This map shows the burned-out area of Tokyo by the bombing.

63
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,020
So one-third of this city was completely burned and destroyed

64
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,692
by the end of the war.

65
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:21,900


66
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,490
This was the starting point of post-war Tokyo.

67
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,500
And I'm going to explain and discuss about what

68
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,940
happened after this complete destruction during post-war era.

69
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,067
