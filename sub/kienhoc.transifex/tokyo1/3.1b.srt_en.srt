1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,265
The Tokyo Olympics in 1964 was televised Olympics.

2
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:14,520
The average viewing time in each day was eight hours and 15 minutes.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,330
So people watched TVs so much, especially the opening ceremony.

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,020
and women's volleyball matches and men's gymnastic matches

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:33,230
were very popular games people enthusiastically watched.

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,810
The viewing rate of the opening ceremony was 95%,

7
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:45,740
women's volleyball match was 85%, and men's gymnastics was 79%.

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,990
So almost all Japanese people watched the Games

9
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,300
among many different types of matches and games,

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,780
women's volleyball became very popular just before the Olympics started.

11
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,390
According to this graph, in 1962, the popularity of women's volleyball

12
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:17,390
was not so high compared with some of the other major genres of the games,

13
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,730
including athletics or swimming.

14
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:27,170
But the popularity of volleyball increased very much.

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:34,760
So after the O;ympic games finished, a survey asked what was the most

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,130
impressive sport in the Olympics.

17
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:48,290
And people selected three major sports they were so much impressed.

18
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:57,490
So many people selected women's volleyball match and men's gymnastics

19
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,970
and marathon.

20
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:10,020
So these three games were outstandingly popular programs

21
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,300
in all the Olympic Games.

22
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,840
In women's volleyball the team was called as the Oriental Witches.

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,850
The team was formerly organized as a team in female factory workers

24
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,590
in textile industries.

25
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,470
In the 1950s, many textile industries organized female volleyball teams

26
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,800
among their workers.

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,120
The textile industry was one of the major industries that

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,836
supported Japanese economic growth, especially

29
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,500
in the 1950s and the early 1960s.

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,080
The company needed to organize the recreation of female workers.

31
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,050
So Kanebo organized six teams, Nichibo organized five teams,

32
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,200
Kurabo organized 4 teams, and Toray organized three teams.

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,090
All of these are major textile companies.

34
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:15,930
Among these teams, one team in Nichibo, the Kaizuka Factory team

35
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,510
in Nichibo Company was extremely strong.

36
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,850
And they won the national championship in 1958.

37
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,170
And they also got the silver medal in the World Championship in the 1960s.

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,560
And they won 22 consecutive victories in European tours.

39
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,140
And in 1962, they also won the gold medal in World Championships.

40
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,185
So they were amazingly strong.

41
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:56,580
And in the Olympic games in 1964, they also won the gold medal.

42
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,320
So all this process was so much amazing.

43
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,070
But at the same time they were female factory workers.

44
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,480
So their dream was not to be the celebrities.

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,550
Their dreams were to marry with average men.

46
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:24,210
Their dream was to be a housewife in a middle class family.

47
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:30,430
So after the Tokyo Olympic Games ended, they married with, for example,

48
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:38,500
members of the SDF, Self-Defense Force, or some of the workers

49
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,660
in Japanese companies.

50
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,450
And they changed their lives to be housewives in middle class in Japan.

51
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,170


52
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,740
Especially their title, Oriental Witches,

53
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:02,020
needs to be considered because this name was titled by European journalists.

54
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,710
In 1961, when they won the title in USSR,

55
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,520
they were called the Typhoon from Orient.

56
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,830
After that, they were called Oriental Witches by European media.

57
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,450
But in European language, or in Christian civilization,

58
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:28,730
or in Christian culture, the witch means negative sense or evil sense.

59
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:35,123
But in Japanese, because this title was appropriated by Japanese media as "Toyo

60
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:42,420
no Majo -- the Oriental Witches--," although the meaning of witch includes

61
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,530
a negative sense.

62
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,590
But when it's translated into Japanese, "majo"

63
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,260
is the Japanese word for witch that doesn't

64
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,250
have such kinds of negative sense as European languages.

65
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,960
So in the Japanese context, "majo" means witches

66
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,870
but it doesn't mean a negative sense.

67
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:16,900
So "majo" means a daughter who has a strong power or mediocre power.

68
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:24,130
And the manager of this volleyball team was Hirofumi Daimatsu.

69
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,940
And he was called as "oni" manager.

70
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,390
"Oni" means in European language in some sense devil.

71
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,990
But it is not devil because the relationship between "oni" and "majo"

72
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,630
means a kind of relationship between the father and daughter.

73
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:54,250
So this volleyball team was seen as some kind of big family, father

74
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,970
and daughters

75
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,570
and they have a strong power.

76
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:05,220
After the Olympic games, the image and victory of this volleyball team

77
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,980
became a kind of the legend of these Olympic games.

78
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,030
And it was featured in many TV drama and animations.

79
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,675
In 1968, from Fuji Broadcasting Network, Attack No.

80
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:25,890
1-- this is the tittle of the animation series-- was broadcasted.

81
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:31,490
That featured the story of the volleyball team

82
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,900
in the Tokyo Olympic Games.

83
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,350
And that series got a great popularity.

84
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:44,340
In 1969, from TBS Broadcasting Network, V Sign, this drama,

85
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,040
this was a TV drama, and it also featured

86
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,260
the story of the volleyball team in the Tokyo Olympic Games.

87
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,220
Even after the 1980s, Attacker You!-- this

88
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:05,860
is the title of the animation series from the TV Tokyo Network.

89
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,980
And this also featured the volleyball team in the Tokyo Olympic Games.

90
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,490
And this animation became very popular in China

91
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:22,020
and other southeast Asian countries, especially in China.

92
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:28,890
So the image and story of the volleyball in the Tokyo Olympic Games

93
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:37,190
became or influenced very much after 1960 or 1970 or even the 1980s.

94
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:45,770
On the other hand, marathon was another very popular game people watched.

95
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,170
And in this marathon, Kokichi Tsuburaya got the bronze medal.

96
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,950
But he was born in a very poor family in Fukushima

97
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,160
in the Tohoku area, the north area in Japan.

98
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,260
And after that he joined the SDF-- one of the members of the Self-Defense

99
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,180
Force.

100
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,870
And in the SDF, they organized the special training program

101
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,680
for the Tokyo Olympic Games.

102
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,190
And he was selected.

103
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,800
And he was trained.

104
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,380
And he had a strong ability for running.

105
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,210
So he got the bronze medal.

106
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,100
But after that, after the Tokyo Olympic Games,

107
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,800
he could not continue his success because there

108
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,050
was a big gap between-- he was so much focused on the media

109
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,680
and as a kind of the, by the people.

110
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,530
But he could not continue his success after the Tokyo Olympic Games.

111
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:55,080
And finally in 1968, he committed suicide.

112
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,270
So there were many different kinds of stories.

113
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:06,320
But on the front stage, there appeared many star players.

114
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,260
But behind that, star players, like the volleyball team, or Kokichi Tsuburaya,

115
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,440
and so on.

116
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,060
But behind that, the lives of people were still very poor.

117
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,159
And there was a big gap between the life, or the background

118
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:32,350
life of those players and appearance or stories

119
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,080
which was performed on the stage of the Olympic Games.

120
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,510
The relationship between the Self-Defense Force and the Tokyo

121
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,670
Olympic Games needs to be mentioned a little bit more

122
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:51,170
because SDF organized a special division for supporting the Tokyo Olympic

123
00:10:51,170 --> 00:11:00,550
Games on the one hand and they included 5,000 Land and Air Force and 2,500 Navy

124
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,870
and other people.

125
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,980
So it was a big division.

126
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,360
And that division supported all the organizing process

127
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,550
of the Tokyo Olympic Games.

128
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:18,580
So one commander in SDF explained, this is a big Naval battle.

129
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,160
And one soldier explained, I'm very proud of being

130
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,500
selected in the division.

131
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,690
On the other hand, SDF also organized the physical training school

132
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,800
and special program for the Tokyo Olympic Games.

133
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,010
So they produced some of the star players in the Tokyo Olympic Games,

134
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,720
including Yoshinobu Miyake-- he got the gold medal in weight lifting--

135
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,190
and Kokichi Tsuburaya-- he got the bronze medal in marathon--

136
00:11:48,190 --> 00:12:00,520
and other players who got good places in the race and games.

137
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:07,190
So the situation and background formation of these Olympic Games

138
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,580
was a little bit different from front stage.

139
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:19,800
In those days in the televised games people watched

140
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,390
did not include these kinds of background stage.

141
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:31,980
The people as the audience only enjoyed the drama and performance

142
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,680
which was shown on TV in 1964.

143
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,050
So this was a process of the consumption of the Olympics

144
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,890
in each family and each household.

145
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,120
But it was a huge consumption.

146
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,860
And this huge consumption included the consumption of the Oriental Witches

147
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,690
and the consumption of the marathon runner, like Kokichi Tsuburaya.

148
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,167
