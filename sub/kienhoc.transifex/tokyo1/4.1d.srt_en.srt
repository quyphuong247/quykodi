00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:11,710
Culture in Shinjuku in the late 1960s was incredibly chaotic and energetic.

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,750
Many performers, activists, artists, and avant garde people

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,070
gathered in Shinjuku.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,090
And they performed different type of cultural and political activities

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,690
around the Shinjuku Station area.

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,700
One of the representative images of Shinjuku in those days

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,770
can be seen in the film of Nagisa Oshima.

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,110
Nagisa Oshima is one of the most famous avant garde, or New Wave,

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,790
film directors in those days.

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:49,750
One of his films, directed by him in 1960, titled Night and Fog in Japan,

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,830
criticized Japanese hypocrisy in the 1960s

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,760
US-Japan treaty-- Security Treaty.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,050
And also, in 1968, he directed Death by Hanging,

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:11,500
and he also criticized the issue of Koreans in Japanese society.

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,560
In his films, he uses images of murder, and violence, and rape,

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,710
and act of blackmail, and so on.

17
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:28,480
He used the image of violence to indict the hypocrisy of this society.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:37,690
One of his masterpieces about the city was Diary of a Shinjuku Thief.

19
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,720
This film was directed in 1969.

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,860
His film shows the image of Shinjuku in relation

21
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,630
with the sexual dynamics of the people who gather in this city.

22
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,930
In this film, many important artists and performers

23
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,440
and other kind of important cultural people appeared in the film.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,830
So this film is a very good example to understand the atmosphere of Shinjuku

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,085
in the late 1960s from today.

26
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:17,720


27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,780
In this film, Juro Kara appeared as an actor, almost naked,

28
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,810
was wearing only a loincloth.

29
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,630
He was a very famous theater director also, in those days.

30
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,540
He organized Jokyo Gekijo Theater.

31
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,220
It is one of the representative theaters in the 1960s.

32
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,780
And he performed many plays around Shinjuku-- Hanazono Shrine, and Western

33
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,190
Shinjuku Central Park, and so on.

34
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,090
So he was already very popular, and he was

35
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,690
one of the representative avant garde artists in Shinjuku.

36
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:09,110
Also, in this film, Tadanori Yokoo, a very famous artist, painter,

37
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:16,410

many of the avant garde artists in Shinjuku.

40
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,770
So in Shinjuku, there's some kind of connection

41
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,880
between artists and activists, and many spectators,

42
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,100
also-- have close relationship, or they share the atmosphere

43
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,730

So in Shinjuku, many different types of artists and people

52
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,414
gathered and interacted, and made some kind of intimate network

53
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:34,080
with each other.

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,610


55
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,710
