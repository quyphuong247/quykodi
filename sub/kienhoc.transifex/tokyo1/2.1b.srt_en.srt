1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,420
The visual relationship in this society was also

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,070
materialized in many city spaces, and the spaces of the nation,

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,160
and railway systems in the Meiji, and Taisho, and Showa eras.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,020


5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,580
In terms of railway systems, the first railway

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:34,340
was constructed in the early Meiji era between Yokohama an Shimbashi.

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,950


8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,685
And this railway was a kind of window for Western civilization.

9
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:42,810


10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm going to explain in more detail in other modules.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,310
But all the Western goods and information

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,630
was imported from Yokohama in the Meiji era,

13
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,260
because Yokohoma was the first international port,

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,500
and moved to Shimbashi and Tokyo.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,340
So this railway was a window for Western civilization.

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,306


17
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:16,230
But after the 1910s, the terminal over this railway

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,880
changed from Shimbashi to Tokyo.

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,010


20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:25,770
And also the railway extended toward Osaka, and Kyushu,

21
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,880
and many other regions in this nation.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,010


23
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:38,380
In this process, the meaning of railway has changed from window toward the West

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:46,200
to the window or gate towards all the other regions over this nation.

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,020


26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,170
This kind of spatial relationship, or visual relationship,

27
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,450
embedded in the space was very clearly shown

28
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:07,340
in the formation of Tokyo station, which was established in 1914.

29
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,710
When the station, this terminal station, was established,

30
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,520
this station only had the gate in the West side.

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,610


32
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:27,070
It had no East side entrance or gate, because this central station

33
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:34,545
was placed, or rotated, east of the Imperial Palace.

34
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:38,590
Or in other words, the relationship between the Imperial Palace

35
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,010
and this Tokyo station was quite important.

36
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,140


37
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:51,120
And on the West side, there were three entrance gates, North gate,

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,240
central gate, and South gate.

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,420
But ordinary people cannot use the central gate.

40
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,740
Only the royal family or emperor could use this central gate.

41
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,820


42
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,720
So people who got to the train and who went up from the North gate,

43
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,720
if he wanted to move to the South gate, maybe he

44
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,560
would pass in front of the central gate.

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,310
But there is a big rule towards the Imperial Palace-- like this.

46
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:35,970
This is a picture of today, but in this picture

47
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,800
Tokyo station has the three gates.

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,840
You can see.

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,910
And in front of this central gate, there's a big road, the Imperial Road,

50
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,275
towards the Imperial Palace.

51
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:48,890


52
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:54,900
So the people who arrived in front of the central gate of Tokyo Station

53
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,040
were expected to watch, and look up, and bow,

54
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,350
and even to worship to the Imperial Palace.

55
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,290


56
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,720
So these kinds of relationships, to watch, or to look at,

57
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:25,010
or to worship the Imperial Palace was structurally or unconsciously organized

58
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,860
in the spacial structure of this station.

59
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,580


60
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,200
More than this, some of the novelists already

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,880
understood the meaning of this railway system in the Meiji--

62
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,700
in the Taisho era.

63
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,990


64
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:51,460
Soseki Natsume is one of the most important novelists in modern Japan.

65
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,590
And he wrote a very famous novel, Sanshiro.

66
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,960


67
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,230
And this novel was already translated in English,

68
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:08,070
and it is very easy to read, all of you.

69
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:15,150
And in this novel, Soseki explained, or analyzed,

70
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,360
the relationship or meaning of the railway that extends from Tokyo Station

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,780
all around this nation, because the first scene of this novel

72
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,470
starts-- in the scene-- when Sanshiro, the main character

73
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:39,005
moves from the Kyushu area, the South area of Japan, to Tokyo by train.

74
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,850


75
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:49,180
And the conversation in the train mentions

76
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,940
the landscape in the Korean peninsula, in Manchuria,

77
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,305
and other regions outside of this country.

78
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:58,300


79
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:05,200
So in this novel, the imagination of the railway was explained.

80
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,570
And that kind of that imaginative space of this country

81
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,700
goes beyond the Japanese archipelago, that

82
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:20,210
includes the Korean peninsula, and Manchuria, and other regions where

83
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:27,405
the Japanese Imperial Army invaded and tried to include in this nation.

84
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,420


85
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:36,610
So Tokyo station was a kind of center of this Imperial relationship.

86
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:42,380
And this relationship was organized as a kind of visual relationship,

87
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,880
from the center to the periphery, or from the center to the colony,

88
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,140
or from the center to other regions, through the Meiji, and Taisho,

89
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,710
and Showa eras.

90
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,167
