1
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:28,050
In May 1959, Tokyo was selected as the venue for the 18th Olympic Games

2
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,750
In 1964.

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:36,380
In the General Assembly of International Olympic Committee, IOC,

4
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,830
the people in the Sports Association and Japanese Government

5
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:49,080
were very eager to host the Olympic games again from 1950s

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,590
because Tokyo was already selected as the Olympic venue in 1940.

7
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:03,330
The Olympics in 1940 was prepared but canceled because of war.

8
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,200
So just after the occupation ended, the government

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,830
and the people in the Sports Association wanted

10
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,940
to invite the Olympic Games in this city again.

11
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,170
They started to contact key people in IOC.

12
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,520
They argued Tokyo had the ability to host the Olympic games even

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,230
after the war.

14
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,710
So there's a kind of continuity from prewar period

15
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,430
to postwar period in terms of hosting the Olympic Games or the Olympic

16
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:43,730
Games in 1940 and the Olympic Games in 1964.

17
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,110
But at the same time, the Olympic Games of 1964

18
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:54,810
was held at the exact moment when the Japanese postwar economy was

19
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,650
rapidly growing.

20
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,630
So there's a strong connection between the celebration of these Olympic Games

21
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,610
and the celebration of Japanese rapid economic growth.

22
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,570
Especially because of Japanese rapid economic growth,

23
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,830
these Olympic Games became a very important occasion

24
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,700
to promote many urban constructions, construction

25
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:27,770
of new roads, a new expressway, and new buildings, and new stadiums.

26
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,960
For example, this photograph shows the celebration

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,560
of the decision of this hosting.

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,240
But this photograph also on the one hand shows such kind of the celebration

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,370
but at the same time you can see that many small old houses,

30
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,850
crowded houses in downtown Tokyo.

31
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:58,160
So you can see the sharp contrast between the new big buildings

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,750
and at the same time small tiny old houses in Tokyo.

33
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,230
This is the landscape of Tokyo in late 1950s.

34
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,330
Many people were living in small, old houses.

35
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:20,027
But at the same time new construction was going on.

36
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:23,010


37
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,560
In this process of preparing for the Olympic Games,

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,700
many new roads and many buildings were constructed,

39
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:40,680
including Yoyogi Olympic Stadium and Olympic Village, and also

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,440
Komazawa Olympic Park, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway.

41
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,580
The network of this expressway changed the landscape of Tokyo very much.

42
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,820
And Shinkansen.

43
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,430
Shinkansen is a super rapid express railway between Tokyo and Osaka.

44
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,930
And other streets and the Tokyo Monorail,

45
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,310
which brings the people to Haneda Airport.

46
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:14,070
So all of this new transportation system and new stadium

47
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,540
were constructed in this process.

48
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,330
This is a photograph of the National Stadium in Aoyama.

49
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,900
This stadium was already constructed before the decision.

50
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,370
But it was reformed.

51
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:40,740
And this national gymnasium was a new construction designed by Kenzo Tange.

52
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,880


53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,920
When the construction was accomplished in Yoyogi,

54
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,750
these two buildings were so impressive and became very famous

55
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,030
of this architecture.

56
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,680


57
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,470
Also this is Komawaza Olympic Park.

58
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,850
This Olympic Park became the very familiar place for the many citizens

59
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,650
in Tokyo.

60
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,410
And this is Aoyama Street under construction in 1963.

61
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:28,640
So some of the main streets in Tokyo were constructed or rebuilt

62
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,310
in that moment.

63
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,670
And this is the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway on the river

64
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:41,190
or on the canal, because this new highway system was constructed

65
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,245
basically on the river and canal in Tokyo.

66
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:47,770


67
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:57,030
And besides this expressway, the monorail toward Haneda Airport

68
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,300
was also constructed.

69
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,410
And of course, Shinkansen, the super express railway to Osaka.

70
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,910
So after all this kind of the construction,

71
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:18,170
the Tokyo Olympics was started with this opening ceremony.

72
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,390
This photograph shows the lighting of the Olympic flame.

73
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,190


74
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,610
So we can see some of the moving images of Tokyo

75
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,980
just before the Olympic Games started.

76
00:06:32,980 --> 00:09:29,380


77
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,100
The most important point of the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964

78
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,310
was its relationship with rapid economic growth in Japan in the 1960s.

79
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:48,430
This graph shows the increase of GDP in Japan in the 1960s.

80
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,240
And you can understand the Olympic Games took place

81
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,120
exactly when the Japanese economy was growing.

82
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,070
This relationship repeated in the Seoul Olympic Games and the Beijing Olympic

83
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,260
Games again and again.

84
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:14,650
This graph shows the Korean GDP and the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988.

85
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,470
The Seoul Olympic Games took place exactly when

86
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,430
the Korean GDP or economy was growing.

87
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,640
And also this graph shows the relationship

88
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,720
between the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008

89
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,590
and Chinese economic growth after 2000.

90
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,990
So you also can understand that the Beijing Olympic

91
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:46,070
Games was held when the Chinese economy was rapidly growing.

92
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,900
In all of these three cases, there were relationships

93
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,310
between the Olympic Games and economic growth.

94
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:02,770
And in Tokyo in the 1960s, through holding the Olympic Games,

95
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:11,830
the Tokyo city was developed and expanded in many ways.

96
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:19,340
So we are going to consider or discuss the relationship between the Olympic

97
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,890
Games in 1964 and the expansion of Tokyo in the 1960s.

98
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,700
Through considering this relationship we can understand

99
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,270
or we can get some kind of insight to consider about the Seoul Olympic

100
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,060
Games or Beijing Olympic Games, too.

101
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,767
