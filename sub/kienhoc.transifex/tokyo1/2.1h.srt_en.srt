1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,760
As I said, the wedding ceremony and parade of this royal wedding in 1959

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,450
was widely featured by TV station and broadcasted in many TV programs.

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,580


4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,395
So it was a huge media event in postwar era.

5
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:26,110


6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,290
But very important point of this featuring and broadcasting

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:36,540
was not only the program or the scene of the wedding

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,280
was featured and broadcasted, but also the context itself

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,560
that means the TV set in the household, or TV network itself

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,940
was expanded through this ceremony.

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,030


12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,460
This is the graph of the rate of diffusion of television.

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:10,190
So you can see that diffusion television expanded from 1958 to 1959,

14
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,920
because so many people tried to buy the new TV in order

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,280
to watch the ceremony and parade of this royal wedding.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,890
And so many people started to accept or to welcome

17
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,885
or to invite a new TV set within their household in this process.

18
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:34,870


19
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,910
So the big media event is the big occasion

20
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,765
to expand the TV network in this society.

21
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:46,530


22
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,400
Also, in this process, the commercial broadcasting network

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:02:04,960
was expanded in this process or in this field from late 1950s to 1960s.

24
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,830
This is the picture of broadcasting station until 1955.

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:20,560
But this broadcasting station or network increased and expanded after late 1950s

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,240
until 1960s.

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,560
So blue points show the new broadcasting network.

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,630
So you can understand until 1960s, these kinds of broadcasting network

29
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,150
expanded very much rapidly in Japan.

30
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,490
So in this context, the royal wedding could

31
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:47,850
be a very big media event, or nationwide big event in 1959.

32
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:57,760
Because in 1959, this kind of network of television was mostly already operated,

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:06,651
and these media network could be a basis for the people's fandom or people's

34
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:07,150
excitement.

35
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,380


36
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,440
And this is until 1970.

37
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,150
So you can understand that so many TV network was expanded from late 1950s

38
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,070
to 1970s.

39
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,200
And these network was saturated in this archipelago,

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,020
or Japanese archipelago was the society which

41
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,300
was completely penetrated by these TV networks.

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:41,370
Everything or every image was already mediated by TV network.

43
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,460
Or Japanese society became the TV society until 1970.

44
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,070
This process was started by the street corner TV.

45
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,330
I will talk about this story in more details in Part 2.

46
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,990
So in the beginning, people enjoyed to watch the TV

47
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:08,885
on the front window of electronic shops or on the street corner.

48
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:10,240


49
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,649
And in this street corner, people also enjoyed many sports

50
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:21,890
program or professional wrestling match, or baseball match and so on.

51
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,070


52
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,100
And after this kind of the street corner TV,

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:35,080
the TV got into or came into the household at the end of 1950s.

54
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,540
So the royal wedding was taken place exactly

55
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:44,030
at the moment when the TV network or TV as media

56
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,330
was newly placed within the household.

57
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,200
And new image of the family, as I explained,

58
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:00,490
was consumed through this new media, or this new domestic media in each living

59
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,925
room or in each household.

60
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,660


61
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,930
But the television was not, or the royal wedding and new royal

62
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:16,910
image of the royal family was not only mediated and consumed by TV network.

63
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,075
It was also mediated and consumed through weekly magazines.

64
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:22,930


65
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,370
Especially weekly magazines for women.

66
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,800


67
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,680
The weekly magazines were also expanded after late 1950s.

68
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,490
And these new kinds of weekly magazines also featured

69
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,360
and the commodified that image of the royal family.

70
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,380


71
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,230
So so many readers enjoyed to consume the image of the royal family.

72
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,530


73
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:57,050
This kind of consuming royal family tradition was started from that decade.

74
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,850


75
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,930
So we have been discussing about the relationship of media

76
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,620
and the consumption of the royal image.

77
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,240


78
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:20,310
But Tokyo was the major place where all these kind of the image

79
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:28,310
was produced and edited and broadcasted or distributed,

80
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,800
because in Tokyo so many TV stations and publishers of all

81
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,900
these weekly magazines, were consentrated.

82
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,570


83
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,825
The Tokyo is a city of media industry.

84
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:43,880


85
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,670
That means all these kind of the image of the royal family

86
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:55,690
and so on was featured and edited and broadcasted and distributed

87
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,350
through the city of Tokyo.

88
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:07,450
The relationship of media and Tokyo was reformulated after the late 1950s.

89
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:12,975
Let me summarize what I already discussed in this module.

90
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,210


91
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:21,130
Because during the occupation era, the image of emperor

92
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:26,270
were documented by many cameras of the U.S. Army

93
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,630
and featured, and also printed out in Japanese newspapers

94
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,820
and magazines and other kinds of medias.

95
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,260
So the new relationship between the emperor's image and people

96
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:47,140
tried to be deconstructed through these kinds of mediated image of emperor.

97
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,850


98
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,970
But transformation of the emperor's image was only one stage, I think.

99
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,980


100
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:06,300
Because the more rise (*radical) change was occurred after the royal wedding

101
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,980
in 1959.

102
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,650
Through this process, the image of the emperor's family

103
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,160
became a kind of the commodity, which can

104
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,320
be consumed by many different kind of media.

105
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,920


106
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,375
Because the image of the royal family became

107
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:30,960
an image of the father and mother and grandfather

108
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,020
and grandmother and the children.

109
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,954
And this is just an image of-- ideal image

110
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:40,549
of a family associated with the American way of life.

111
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,630
And this image was an exactly what people

112
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,455
tried to pursue in the process of rapid economic growth.

113
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:50,440


114
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,250
So Japanese society are coming to be a more and more consumerlike society,

115
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:02,460
or consumer society became widely penetrated and saturated

116
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,250
in people's lives in this society.

117
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,260


118
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,970
So people want to consume something like Princess Michiko,

119
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,240
or people want to imitate something like royal family.

120
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,360


121
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,880
All the process of this consumption of ideal way of life

122
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,950
is divided or expanded and consumed in each household.

123
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,380


124
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,630
So in this society, basically there are no center,

125
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,530
and very much decentralized and very much divided and multiplied.

126
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,750


127
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,780
So this process was occurred, even in relation

128
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,340
with the image of the emperor in postwar era.

129
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,740


130
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:04,040
And in this process, the television, and newspapers, and weekly magazines

131
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,540
especially, played an important role to transform

132
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,630
that relationship between the emperor's image

133
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:20,730
and the everyday lives of the people in this city.

134
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,867
