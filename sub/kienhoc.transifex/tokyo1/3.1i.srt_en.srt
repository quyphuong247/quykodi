1
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,040
This film was directed in a very experimental manner,

2
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,860
in some sense, very progressive.

3
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,410
This film was directed by Naoya Yoshida.

4
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:43,100
He was one of the most representative or influential directors in NHK.

5
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,980
He was born in 1931.

6
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:54,260
and after he joined NHK, he directed many programs in the 1950s.

7
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,380
And after that, he directed some of the programs like this.

8
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:06,710
This is one of his important programs titled "Tokyo."

9
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:12,030
And after this program, he moved to the historical drama,

10
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,620
or he directed some of the historical dramas, and he did many works in NHK.

11
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:26,470
In this documentary program, the woman who was looking for her parents

12
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,220
was the symbolic image of the isolation in big cities

13
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:40,670
because the sheer contrast between the expanding Tokyo and isolation

14
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:47,720
in this expanding city was very clear in this film.

15
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:55,110
So documentary film is one of the interesting perspectives

16
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,710
towards the people in the city.

17
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,100
Tokyo is expanding, but people cannot expand like a city.

18
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,810
People stay in the city.

19
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,050
And people looking for some other people, especially her families,

20
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,290
or lovers, and other kinds of important people in the city.

21
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,130
So people, documentary film, stayed in the city

22
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:30,010
and continuously focused on some of the lives in the city.

23
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,970
I've already discussed the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964

24
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,680
and transformation of the city of Tokyo in the 1960s.

25
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,530
The Tokyo Olympic Games and its consumption

26
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,100
was strongly connected with the expansion

27
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,020
of the TV network in the 1960s.

28
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,350
And many scenes and many events and many people

29
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,670
were consumed by the TV networks.

30
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,590


31
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,540
But at the same time, the Tokyo Olympic Games

32
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,930
are connected with many different elements, especially urban development,

33
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,690
from the prewar period.

34
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:18,970
There were some different layers of the city, or in terms of Olympic Games,

35
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,670
in Tokyo city.

36
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,930
For example, underneath the Tokyo Olympic Games

37
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:32,540
and that stadium in Aoyama or Yoyogi or Komazawa,

38
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,140
there was a layer of occuptions that occupied the city.

39
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:44,692
Because underneath of the Yoyogi Olympic Park or Yoyogi Olympic Village

40
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:50,690
and Olympic Stadium, Yoyogi Olympic Village or Stadium

41
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,530
was Washington Heights, which was occupied by the American Army.

42
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,040
And also, there's some kind of issue about the relationship

43
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,010
between Washington Heights and Camp Drake and so on.

44
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,660
And again, underneath of this layer of occupied city,

45
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,720
there was a layer of the military city of prewar Japan.

46
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,687
Many of the parks, many of the green areas after the 1960s in Tokyo

47
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:26,520
had been military grounds or military field.

48
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,540


49
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,310
Aoyama area, the outer garden of the Meiji Shrine,

50
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,780
had been Aoyama Military Ground.

51
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:44,430
And Yoyogi Park had been Yoyogi Military Ground, and so on.

52
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,500
So in this Olympic city, many different layers of the history

53
00:07:50,500 --> 00:08:01,890
were existing and co-existing in different landscapes of the history.

54
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:08,500
And in this process, some of the possible or idealistic urban plans

55
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,450
were designed but were not realized.

56
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,510
Most important failure of this urban planning

57
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:25,400
was the postwar reconstruction plan in late 1940s and 1950s.

58
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:34,900
Some of the idealistic plan in those days was not realized.

59
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,780
So on the one hand, there are some historical layers in this city.

60
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,460
But on the other hand, there are still some imaginative layers, also.

61
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,720


62
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,310
Throughout this process, the human life or the social life

63
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,860
of the people in this city was most important.

64
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,590
And still, it's most important.

65
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:10,556
Documentary film is one of the most insightful media

66
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:18,460
to understand how people lived in this city from the 1950s to 1960s.

67
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:27,410
So it's, in some sense, I think, ironic that on the one hand,

68
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,980
television networks are the most important media which

69
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,560
make people possible to consume the spectacular Olympic images.

70
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,650
But on the other hand, the same television network or documentary film

71
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:50,250
in the same television network can be the other perspective about the people.

72
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,850
The television image or televised image includes

73
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:04,270
both of these spectacular images and more human or more focused

74
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,355
critical images of this expanding city.

75
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:11,140


76
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,850
Documentary film, or documentary programs,

77
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,880
are very important to consider about the history of Tokyo,

78
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,450
again, from a contemporary perspective.

79
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:32,990
It explains some of the lives of the people in this city under construction.

80
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,525
The last program we watched, directed by Naoya Yoshida,

81
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:44,030
is one of the good examples to make us consider

82
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,590
the situation of the people in the 1960s.

83
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:54,550
We can discuss more about this film or more about the other films

84
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,940
we watched, that we are going to watch, in this course.

85
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,534
