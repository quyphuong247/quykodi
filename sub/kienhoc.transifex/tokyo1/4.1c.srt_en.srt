1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,110
As we saw, the development of Shinjuku after the 1920s

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,030
was based on the expansion of suburban area.

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:21,290
Many commuters, who move from suburban area to downtown, transfer in Shinjuku.

4
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:29,550
But they also enjoy shopping, department store, movie theater, and restaurant.

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,070
So commercial facility in Shinjuku also developed,

6
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,130
along with the expansion of these commuters.

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,730
But all of these things happened in eastern Shinjuku,

8
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,660
east side of Shinjuku Station.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:55,910
So west side, western Shinjuku remained undeveloped until the 1960s.

10
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,690
This is an image of western Shinjuku, the big pond

11
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,480
and shrine and old district.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:13,310
This kind of landscape remained basically until the 1960s.

13
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,750
Shinjuku, especially western Shinjuku was famous for Kumano Shrine.

14
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,950
Kumano Shrine is a shrine for travellers.

15
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:29,240
And around this shrine some of the district, including some kind of--

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,920
How do I say it?

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,650
--the restaurant and some kinds of hotels

18
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,180
and such kinds of district, a little bit developed.

19
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,190
But this image with the district is basically almost

20
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,720
same us prewar and postwar period.

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,380
Most of the important facilities, or most

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,490
of important spaces in western Shinjuku was water purification center.

23
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,620
It was a very huge water purification center,

24
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:04,300
by which most of the water for Tokyo's citizens were provided.

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,010


26
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,760
This is an image of this water purification center

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,400
so you can imagine how huge it was.

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:25,440
This purification center occupied almost all the area in western Shinjuku.

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,650
But new plan for redevelopment started at the middle of the 1960s.

30
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,970
This is an image after the water purification plant was closed.

31
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,890
And in the 1960s, it was so huge area, so small kids

32
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,365
enjoyed to play around this big field.

33
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:51,790


34
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,600
At the end of 1960s, new redevelopment process started.

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,850
So it was so huge area.

36
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:09,260
And this huge area was tried to transform toward a business center.

37
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:16,820
In the 1970s, first skyscraper, Keio Plaza Hotel, started to build.

38
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,210
And until 2000, many of the huge skyscrapers

39
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:28,520
were already built on the ground of former purification plant.

40
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,830
At the center of this picture you can see Tokyo metropolitan government

41
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,900
building.

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,300
It was a very big, huge skyscraper.

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,650
It is.

44
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:49,110
And today, in western Shinjuku there are many big companies' buildings

45
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,670
and skyscrapers and the hotels and so on.

46
00:03:52,670 --> 00:04:00,690
So this is one of the newest area in Tokyo today.

47
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:07,540
I've been discussing about two important moment of Tokyo and also Shinjuku.

48
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,950
Shinjuku was an area of population concentration,

49
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,040
especially along with the development or expansion of western suburb.

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,520
Shinjuku became transportation hub, and so many commuters

51
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,010
concentrate in this district.

52
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,120
It was the base of the development of this area.

53
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,120
But at the same time, after the 1960s, western Shinjuku

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,270
was redeveloped as business center.

55
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:45,420
Former purification plant was transformed to this huge business

56
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,970
center.

57
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:57,520
So Shinjuku is concentration center, or Shinjuku is a place of concentration,

58
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,480
on the one hand population, and on the other hand economic activity.

59
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:09,490
But what is the third element because I explained the concentration of the city

60
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,440
consists of three elements, population, economy, and culture.

61
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,990
So what is a cultural element of Shinjuku?

62
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,650
What kind of cultural activity was performed in Shinjuku

63
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,370
in the 1960s and 1970s.

64
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:37,790
I'm going to explore some of the major cultural activity in this area

65
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,770
at the end of the 1960s and the 1970s.

66
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,334
