1
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:08,490
It was exactly this process of the new constructions of the prince

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,150
and princess image through which the image of the Emperor Hirohito

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:23,470
was completely transformed because the new image of the family of prince

4
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:33,020
and princess was willingly accepted by so many Japanese people in a very

5
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,040
positive way.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,360
And the image of Princess Michiko and Prince Akihito

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,950
became the idealistic image of new family

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,580
for all or for most Japanese people.

9
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,840
In this context, Emperor Hirohito found a new way

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,920
to rehabilitate his image by becoming a grandfather.

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,320
There are many photographs about this new family,

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,090
including not only Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko and their kids,

13
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:22,130
but also Emperor Hirohito and the Empress, too.

14
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,750
This is one example.

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:32,160
So they have new kids and a small boy was playing in their home.

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:40,250
But the image of Emperor Hirohito here is completely

17
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,780
the image of the grandfather in a very happy family.

18
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,930
This is, too, the child, and mother and father.

19
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,810
This is the princess and prince and the child.

20
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,800
But at the same time, Emperor Hirohito and the Empress.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,900
They were not at the center anymore.

22
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,085
They were beside the family.

23
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:11,360
Emperor Hirohito found his place as the grandfather.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,980
Here, too, because the center of this new family might be child.

25
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,815
And the father and mother look after this child, also

26
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:26,500
the grandfather and grandmother.

27
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,050
So this is a very rich and happy image of the new family.

28
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,390
This is also the image of the royal family,

29
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,020
including the grandfather and grandmother.

30
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,192
And they're looking at or watching the family album.

31
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:47,630
And the center of this photograph was the grandson

32
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,630
of this family, the child among them.

33
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,800
So all the people in this family were surrounding this small boy.

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,810
And in this photograph, the prince and princess, they already have three kids.

35
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,360
And these three kids were the center of this photograph.

36
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,360
And all the others, including the Emperor and Empress,

37
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,530
or grandfather and grandmother, seated surrounding these three kids.

38
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,780
So this is the image of the royal family after the war.

39
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:32,430
And Emperor found his place, or his new identity as grandfather.

40
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,750
And he enjoyed this new identity very much.

41
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,140
But again, we need to think about the continuity and discontinuity

42
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,100
from prewar and postwar era because as I've discussed,

43
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:54,200
the image of the Emperor had changed from prewar period to postwar period.

44
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,790
In prewar period, the image of the Emperor

45
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,230
was a supreme body of the military system and empire.

46
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,370
And that image was damaged, corrupt after the war.

47
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,420
And under that American gase, the Emperor

48
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:20,459
tried to reconstruct his new image through the tour around the archipelago

49
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,900
or around the nation.

50
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,830
But attitude towards him was very much diverse.

51
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,030
And I think the reconstruction or the reformation of his image

52
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,370
was not completed only by the royal tour or Emperor's

53
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,700
Tour in the occupational era.

54
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,190
But after the royal wedding, the Emperor Hirohito

55
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:56,730
found his new identity as grandfather in this new family.

56
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:02,280
So in this sense, the image of the emperor was discontinuous.

57
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,750
But in some sense, there's a continuity from prewar and postwar eras.

58
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,240
Because in this picture, it is very clear

59
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,680
that the Emperor Hirohito-- or maybe he was still

60
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:26,210
Prince Hirohito, played and enjoyed tennis very much,

61
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,390
with, maybe, the Empress or Princess.

62
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:38,055
So the image or connection or the package

63
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:44,430
of connection between the image of the prince and playing tennis

64
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,470
was not only for Prince Akihito and Michiko Shoda

65
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,580
but also for Emperor Hirohito and the Empress.

66
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:03,930
Or image of the emperor had already been a kind of western.

67
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,300
Even before the prewar period.

68
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:14,290
This is a photograph of Emperor Hirohito and Empress with their new baby.

69
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,740
So this image was quite western and modern.

70
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,350
This is an image of Emperor and Empress with their four children.

71
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,890
So I wonder-- there's a very strong difference

72
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:32,030
between the image of the new family of Prince Akihito and Michiko Shoda

73
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:38,370
and this image of the family of Emperor Hirohito and Empress

74
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,640
in the prewar period.

75
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,950
This is also the image of the Emperor's family in prewar period,

76
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:51,390
in 1939, just before or in the war period.

77
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,430
So still, the image of the emperor's family

78
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:02,190
was very much western and modern in the in-war period.

79
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,800
And this is an image of the emperor's family after the war.

80
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,340
So in some sense, the image of the emperor's family

81
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:21,190
was much more modern and western in the prewar period than postwar period.

82
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:27,060
So the continuity and discontinuity of the image of the emperor and his family

83
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:36,280
was much more complicated, but the main image of the emperor and his family

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,590
still remained, and we can analyze it in a historical process,

85
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:52,320
so we can extend many different archival project or research

86
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,530
about the image of the Emperor and Empress

87
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,170
or Prince and Princess, and also many different images of their power.

88
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,670
Because always, political or cultural power

89
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,230
are visualized in many different media.

90
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,930
And these processes of visualization is very much entangled

91
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,540
with the historical and political context.

92
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,050
So through this image, we can reconstruct or reconsider

93
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,080
the transformation and the continuation of the political power

94
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,290
and that impact itself from the later period.
