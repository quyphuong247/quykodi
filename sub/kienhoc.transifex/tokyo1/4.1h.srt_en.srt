1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,230
In the beginning of this lecture, I started

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,070
to define the city as a place of concentration.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,600
Cities are places of concentration in many different ways.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,160
This concentration includes concentration of population

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,410
and economic activity and cultural activity.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:32,439
Cities are place of concentration in many different meaning.

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:41,100
This concentration is concentration of commuter people in one sense.

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,540
Tokyo had expanded toward western direction,

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,490
and a huge suburban area appeared after the 1920s

10
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,750
and especially after the 1960s.

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,260
So many commuter people gathered in Shinjuku

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,220
because Shinjuku was a major transfer station, and so they get off the train,

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,790
and they'd get on the other train, go to the downtown.

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,010
So they go around this area.

15
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:17,730
And they start to enjoy shopping and movie-going and eating in this area.

16
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:25,400
So Shinjuku became urban core based on these concentration of commuters.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,095
But concentrations of people in Shinjuku can be considered in a different way.

18
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:37,657
Because through the expansion of Tokyo or through the modernization

19
00:01:37,657 --> 00:01:43,030
and the industrialization of Tokyo, many immigrant and migrant

20
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,390
gathered in Tokyo.

21
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,660
People from outside, countryside, and foreign countries

22
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,230
gathered, entered and gathered in Tokyo.

23
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:59,450
And so many of these kinds of immigrant people

24
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,990
concentrate in this kind of urban core area, especially in Shinjuku.

25
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,080
So concentration of the population in Shinjuku

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,660
also means this concentration of the immigrant or urban immigrant people

27
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,880
in this area.

28
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,170
So there are two different kinds of concentration in Shinjuku,

29
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,580
concentration of commuters and concentration of immigrant or migrant

30
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,480
in this area.

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,880
These two different phases of concentration

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,030
also related with the confrontation between economic concentration

33
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,630
and cultural concentration.

34
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,650
From the perspective of economic development,

35
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,490
Shinjuku became new urban core after the late 1960s,

36
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,080
especially after the redevelopment of western Shinjuku area.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:00,155
The former water purification plant transformed to huge business center

38
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:02,410
in western Shinjuku.

39
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,470
Many new skyscrapers and many office buildings were established.

40
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,940
So many workers, especially office workers, concentrated in this area.

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,690
And a huge amount of economic activity concentrated in this area.

42
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:28,340
But until the early 1970s, Shinjuku was a center for cultural activities,

43
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,000
especially by young people.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,230
The young people's cultural activities were concentrated in this area.

45
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:45,060
I already explained what had happened by those young people.

46
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:52,150
The important point was these two concentration, the concentration

47
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,050
of economic activity and concentration of cultural activity,

48
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,590
was very hardly confronted.

49
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,560
And violently clashed around 1970.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,770
In some other cities, these two elements, cultural and economic

51
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:19,560
concentration, might collaborate with each other.

52
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,920
But the case of Shinjuku was not.

53
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,670
These two different spheres, contradict, confront, and clash.

54
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:39,925
And after the middle of 1970s, cultural element in Shinjuku district

55
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:45,920
was spread out of this central zone.

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Many of the cultural activities, which was performed in Shinjuku area

57
00:04:52,920 --> 00:05:01,970
was moved out from this urban core area toward, for example, Shinokubo, Koenji,

58
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:09,810
Shimokitazawa, and Nakano, some of other areas around Shinjuku area.

59
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:19,450
So after the late 1970s, these areas, including Nakano or Koenji

60
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:26,690
or Shimokitazawa or Shinokubo, these districts surrounding Shinjuku district

61
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,260
became new cultural zone for young people.

62
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:41,910
But center in Shinjuku was degraded in terms of cultural activity,

63
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,500
especially after the late 1970 or 1980s, because these kinds

64
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:56,062
of the cultural activity was excluded by the expansion

65
00:05:56,062 --> 00:06:02,720
of economic activity in western Shinjuku or other places of Shinjuku.

66
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,900
This is a story of Shinjuku in the late 1960s and the early 1970s.

67
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,470
We can think or we can consider this example

68
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,010
in a more wider context of Japanese urbanization or modernization,

69
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,630
in relation with a city.

70
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:31,320
I think the urbanization in Japan has been, consists of two

71
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,550
different processes.

72
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,850
One is a process of immigration or migrant to the city.

73
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:45,370
And the other is expansion or penetration of Western civilization.

74
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,470


75
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,930
In case of the urban immigrant or concentration of those migrant people

76
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:01,720
to the city, city can be thought as a kind of asylum

77
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,290
because many different kind of people gathered and concentrated

78
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:13,110
and start to live in downtown or core area of the cities.

79
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,880
In the late 19th century or early 20th century,

80
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,890
maybe Asakusa had been one of these centers

81
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,370
because Asakusa accepted many different kinds of migrant and immigrant

82
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,260
from outside.

83
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:36,540
But after the war, Shinjuku became the most busy and crowded center

84
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,860
for these kinds of migrant people.

85
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,790
But on the other hand, the city's a space of gazing and viewing,

86
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,980
especially, modern Tokyo was a space to view

87
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,290
or to gaze the western civilization, as I explained.

88
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:04,800
So this place of gaze or a gateway or window for Western civilization

89
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,150
expand throughout the process of the development of Tokyo.

90
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:20,480
Until the 1920s or 1930s, Ginza had been one of the most important areas

91
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,490
in terms of the window for Western civilization.

92
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,840
But after the 1970s or 1980s, some of the other districts,

93
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,669
as I explained in the first module, Harajuku, Shibuya,

94
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,440
or some of the other American towns became the window

95
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,950
for Western civilization.

96
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,330
So throughout the history of modern Tokyo,

97
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,735
there is kind of a confrontation between the process of migration,

98
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:57,455
immigration and the process of that penetration of Western civilization

99
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:01,170
or American culture in Tokyo.

100
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,800
Shinjuku is one of the examples.

101
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,620
What is the confrontation?

102
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,300
What kinds of clash between these two elements has happened?

103
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,915
And what is the result?

104
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:14,600


105
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,610
Throughout this module, I deeply explained

106
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,200
about the history of Shinjuku.

107
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
But this is not only the history of Shinjuku,

108
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,380
but also the history of Tokyo itself.

109
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,867
