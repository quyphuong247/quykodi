1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:08,680
Also, these two films focus on the sharp or create

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,990
contrast between high skyscraper and everyday life

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:20,035
by the people who live around the district or huge transformation

4
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:25,330
of Shinjuku and continuity of the life of people.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:32,119
But I think one of the greatest masterpieces focused on this contrast

6
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,570
was directed by Toshiki Kudo.

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,670
Toshiki Kudo is one of the most important directors in film

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:46,190
and documentary film and he directed many, many important documentary

9
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,950
programs from late 1968 to the 1970s.

10
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:59,290
In 1967, he directed the program titled Waga-gun Waga-machi.

11
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:05,260
And in this program, he focused on a small town in northern Japan

12
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:15,880
and he drew the history of this town and, at the same time, memory of war

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,730
and the transformation or change of the postwar era in this town.

14
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:31,240
And in 1968 also, he directed one program

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,820
focusing on the postwar history in Okinawa.

16
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:44,770
In 1969, Kudo directed the documentary program titled Scrapped Ship.

17
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,860
This is a program about Lucky Dragon.

18
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,160
Lucky Dragon is the name of the ship that suffered American hydrogen bomb

19
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,760
testing in 1954 and people on the ship suffered by the radiation.

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,160
In 1970, he directed one of his important programs

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:13,780
titled Shinjuku that reported about the relationship between city and human.

22
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,540
He directed this film when he was 38 years old,

23
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:29,010
but this film explained very well about the very strong confrontation

24
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:36,030
between the development and continuous people's lives in this city.

25
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,830
Please enjoy this film very much.

26
00:02:38,830 --> 00:05:31,312


27
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:34,798
[MUSIC PLAYING]

28
00:05:34,798 --> 00:06:32,060


29
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,490
[MUSIC PLAYING]

30
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:45,780


31
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,870
Throughout these three documentary programs,

32
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:54,520
we can see that in Shinjuku there is a strong confrontation between these two

33
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,876
different social spheres.

34
00:06:56,876 --> 00:07:02,300
After the late 1960s, Shinjuku became the big concentration area

35
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,390
of business and economic activities.

36
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,210
The development of the Western Shinjuku area

37
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:16,340
makes it possible to expand the economic and business activity in this area.

38
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,750
But at the same time, people who immigrate in this area

39
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:27,175
still continue to live and still continue to watch around their city.

40
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:30,200


41
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,580
This continuity still exists among the people of old women

42
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,580
or small children or neighbors in Western Shinjuku area.

43
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,330


44
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:51,190
So Shinjuku was an area of confrontation between view from above

45
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,980
and view from below.

46
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,480
In Western Shinjuku, from skyscrapers, businesspeople, and the commuter

47
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,940
started to enjoy the view from above.

48
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,360
They watch around the Shinjuku area and they consume

49
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,140
and they work in this area.

50
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,400
But at the same time, there are still many different kinds

51
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,560
of people who migrate in these places and they still

52
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,370
keep their own view point from below.

53
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:33,130
Especially the work by Toshiki Kudo-- the old woman has a kind of view

54
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,179
from below.

55
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:45,450
And the late 1960s or around 1970 was exactly the time

56
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,400
when these two different kinds of perspective or view

57
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,600
clashed with each other.

58
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:01,380
So it was a very interesting era when the city or a different element

59
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,980
of the city was confronted and clashed.

60
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,690
And we can understand the meaning of this clash from these masterpieces.

61
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,467
