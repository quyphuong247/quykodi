1
00:00:03,157 --> 00:00:07,370
The urban culture in Shinjuku after the 1960s

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,510
was very much energetic and chaotic.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,820
The basic characteristic of this urban culture

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,440
can be described in three different ways.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,570
First, chaotic hybridity-- Shinjuku is often

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,880
described as ameba, jungle and explosion.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,860
The young people could easily explode at any time

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,140
or place here, like open air concerts, performances on the street,

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,940
and collisions between the students' movement and riot police.

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,710
So Yasunori Okadome, a critic in those days,

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,690
described this city like this-- "In spite of the lack

12
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,830
and elegance and delicacy as in Ginza, Shinjuku

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:10,370
has the atmosphere of something like a stomach where country folk, outsiders,

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:16,560
radicals, gang members, vagabonds, homeless people, prostitutes, and all

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,280
kinds of young people could easy feel free."

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
Second characteristic might be continuous fluidity.

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,740


18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:36,410
One of the famous essayists in those days, Mitsusada Fukasaku,

19
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,030
described Shinjuku culture.

20
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:48,650
He said, "In Shinjuku, while there emerged every new kind of movement,

21
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,100
they soon disappeared."

22
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,720
Shinjuku was always in the vanguard of the era.

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,860
Or, in other words, it was a town of present tense,

24
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,860
not a town of past tense.

25
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,320
The third characteristic of this urban culture might be violent confrontation.

26
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:20,700
Juro Kara, the theater director I already mentioned, wrote in his essay,

27
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,380
"The vanguard atmosphere of Shinjuku in which many avant garde

28
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,860
movements emerged has something in common with Asakusa of former times.

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,530
But unlike Asakusa, Shinjuku lacks the background of its culture."

30
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,070
So in this sense, background means some kind of a theoretical term

31
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:51,160
to explain the collaborative relationship between the performers

32
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,390
and town or spaces around these performances.

33
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,260
In the case of Asakusa, there is a kind of coincidence

34
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,880
between the spatial formation and cultural activity.

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,660
Every kind of space and culture are circulated

36
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,850
and collaborated in one district.

37
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,550
But in the case of Shinjuku, the cultural performances

38
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,350
are already separated from spatial formation.

39
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:28,810
Or in other words, spacial formation in Shinjuku

40
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:36,530
was going to a different direction from cultural activities in those days.

41
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:43,690
So the three characteristics I described are strongly

42
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,570
related with the people who gathered here.

43
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:54,900
I explained these characteristics as chaotic hybridity and continuous

44
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,740
fluidity and violent confrontation.

45
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:05,540
All of these characteristics are related with the people who entered Shinjuku.

46
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,410
I can say these people are something like immigrants.

47
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:18,050
In the word "immigrant," I refer both of the people of foreign immigrants

48
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,899
and migrant people from the countryside because I

49
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,650
think there is some kind of similarity of those people.

50
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:33,270
The people who come to the city from countryside

51
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,320
and the people who come to Tokyo from foreign countries

52
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,910
have some kind of connection and all of these kind of people

53
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,990
tend to gather in the city or in the district around Shinjuku area.

54
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,500
So I want to include both of these people,

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,210
the migrant people from the countryside and the immigrant people from outside,

56
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,510
in the same time as I called urban immigrant-- immigrant from countryside,

57
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,690
immigrant from foreign countries-- because city

58
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:15,110
is a place where the people who come from outside gathered.

59
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,330
City is a place full of the people who are not

60
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,620
so much familiar with the place from long days ago.

61
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,390
So the immigrant from outside include many different kinds

62
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,550
of people with many different cultures.

63
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,180
And these kinds of many different kinds of people

64
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,710
gathered and concentrated in Shinjuku in the 1960s.

65
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,510
So this kind of cultural characteristic of Shinjuku

66
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,650
was emerged from this kind of concentration

67
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,630
of these immigrant people.

68
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,460
These immigrant people are quite different from commuters,

69
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,800
who also concentrate in Shinjuku, because commuters

70
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,150
come from suburban areas and they moved to business district or schools

71
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,770
and others places in downtown.

72
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,380
Immigrants came from countryside and foreign countries and other places

73
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,090
in this society.

74
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,790
So there are two different kinds of concentration.

75
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:32,740
One is a concentration of immigrant, the other is a concentration of commuters.

76
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,750
Both of these concentrations were confronted with each other in Shinjuku

77
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,200
in the late 1960s.

78
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,750
So the question is how we can visualize or how

79
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,900
we can describe this kind of confrontation

80
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,260
in Shinjuku, in the late 1960s and 1970s.

81
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,790
I'm going to show some of the very talented or very well done

82
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,850
documentary films which focus on these kinds of confrontation

83
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:14,967
between two kinds of people and two kinds of concentration.

84
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:15,467
