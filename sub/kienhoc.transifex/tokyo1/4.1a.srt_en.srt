1
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,210
In the first and second modules, I discussed the city

2
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,490
as the place of "gazing."

3
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:31,290
The visual relationship between occupier and occupied or the relationship

4
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,600
between emperor and the people in this nation.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,640
As I talked in the first week, American occupation army

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,980
came to Japan with their new visualizing technology,

7
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,120
especially a huge number of cameras.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,250
And by these cameras, the people, activity, landscape in occupied Japan

9
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,340
was precisely documented.

10
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,840
But on the other hand, the people and occupation army

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,270
who documented in this society were not so much visualized.

12
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,000
In other words, the fact of the occupation

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,330
itself was not so much visualized.

14
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,020
The image of the Douglas MacArthur or the image of occupation

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,070
are prohibited to be visualized.

16
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,310


17
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:43,020
Instead of this lack of visualization, the image of Emperor Hirohito

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,810
did appear in front of people.

19
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,300
So the image of Hirohito or image of emperor

20
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,000
and his visit in many cities and countries

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,520
and the relationship between emperor and the people in this nation

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,120
again and again visualized and performed in many media and events.

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,260


24
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,430
So there's a kind of continuity from before the war

25
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,570
and after the war in terms of visual relationship between emperor

26
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,470
and the people in this nation.

27
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:30,580
Throughout all of these discussions, I consider the city as a place of gazing.

28
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:38,930
But here I want to emphasize that the city is not only the place of gazing

29
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,730
but also it's the place of concentration.

30
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,170
What I mean by the word of "concentration"--

31
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,600
concentration of culture, economic activity, and of course, population.

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,270
Population concentration and economic concentration

33
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,010
and cultural concentration interact and related with each other.

34
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,760
In some cases, these different dimensions

35
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,410
contradict and clash with each other.

36
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,190
Tokyo, especially postwar Tokyo, was a huge metropolis

37
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,880
to which people concentrated and economic activity concentrated,

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,790
and also cultural activity concentrated.

39
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,420
But more than that, also within this huge metropolis

40
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:41,060
there is some district where many cultural and economic activities

41
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,300
concentrate and the people gathered very densely.

42
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:53,580
Here, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, or Asakusa or Ginza--

43
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,710
all these kind of district is a place where

44
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:02,690
more and more people concentrated and cultural and economic activity

45
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,970
concentrated, more than many other districts.

46
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,640
So we can say these kind of the district as urban core.

47
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,959
There are many urban cores in Tokyo throughout modern and postwar history,

48
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,810
but the structure of these urban cores are different with each other

49
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,840
from a historical perspective.

50
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,700
I will explain about the difference of these urban cores.

51
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,200
Tokyo was called Edo until the middle 19th century.

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,370
The population of Edo was already more than one million,

53
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,390
so it was a huge metropolis already.

54
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,890
But the center of this city-- this is Edo.

55
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,130


56
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:04,100
The center of this city was occupied by ruling class samurai people--

57
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,550
so merchants, artisans, or religious people,

58
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,830
or ordinary citizen cannot get into this center.

59
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,700
It is quite different from European cities.

60
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,350
So urban core-- I mean, urban core is a concentrated area

61
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,830
of people and activity and so on.

62
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:32,300
So urban core of this city were located at the fringe

63
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:41,340
of this city-- this is Asakusa, this is Ryogoku, and this is Shiba.

64
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,360
All these districts were a kind of cultural center

65
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,860
or cultural core of the city.

66
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,460
But this area was at the fringe of this city.

67
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:59,920
That means border of inside and outside of the city.

68
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:07,930
This is a typical pattern of urban core or cultural core of premodern cities.

69
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:15,570
But after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, new type of urban space

70
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,770
was implemented in this city.

71
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:30,030
Edo was renamed to Tokyo after the late 1860s.

72
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:44,810
And here a new space, Ginza Red Brick District, was constructed in 1872.

73
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,770
It was a western-style brick district.

74
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:55,180
Before that, most of the Japanese buildings and houses were made of wood,

75
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,300
so Red Brick District was quite new and quite western style.

76
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,900
But this Red Brick District was connected to Yokohama

77
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,040
by first railway from Shimbashi to Yokohama.

78
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,310
And Yokohama-- this is Shimbashi and this

79
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:23,670
is Ginza-- so Yokohama is the first International port in Japan.

80
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,660
So every foreign people from Western countries and commodities

81
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,690
and information first landed at Yokohama and then moved to Shimbashi

82
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,770
by this railway.

83
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:47,280
And they got off the train and they moved in this Ginza Red Brick District.

84
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,890
After that, there was a foreign concession or settlement

85
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,925
for foreign people in Tsukiji.

86
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:00,310


87
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,720
Today, Tsukiji is famous because of the fish market, but in those days,

88
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,810
Tsukiji was a foreign settlement.

89
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,180
So Tsukiji, Ginza, Shimbashi, and the railway

90
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,730
to Yokohama-- all of these urban spaces were

91
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:25,980
new package of gate for Western civilization.

92
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,340
This kind of a gate, or a window for the West,

93
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,789
is a basic image of this district.

94
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:41,659
We can see many woodblock print pictures about these different kind

95
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,200
of urban spaces and urban cores from those days.

96
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,520
There are many pictures of these districts in ukiyo-e, woodblock print,

97
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,980
lithograph, and the photographs from Edo era.

98
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,800
This is a picture of Ryogoku.

99
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,240
Ryogoku was one of the most busiest areas from Edo era.

100
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,260
And at this center of the picture you can see Sumida River.

101
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,550
Sumida River is a border of Edo.

102
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,330
So this bridge, that is very important.

103
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:20,920
And this bridge was a border from inside and outside, and around this bridge

104
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,500
the many theaters, merchants, and restaurants,

105
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,020
and a huge amount of people are gathering.

106
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,970
This is a typical image of cultural core in Edo era.

107
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,840
After the 20th century, Asakusa became one of the busiest cultural cores

108
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,330
in Tokyo.

109
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,130
This is an image of Asakusa.

110
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:50,710
So you can see many movie theaters and opera houses, and also

111
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,326
Asakusa's amusement park.

112
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,430
All these kinds of amusement facilities are

113
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,200
concentrated around a pond of Asakusa.

114
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,310
This is an image of Asakusa and the attractiveness

115
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,570
of Asakusa in those days.

116
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,790
This is an image of railway station of Shimbashi.

117
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:22,400
Shimbashi Station was started from the 1870s and, for the people,

118
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,680
this station was entrance gate towards the West.

119
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,070
This is the foreign settlement of Tsukiji.

120
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,330
Here you can see the first semi-Western style

121
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:40,090
hotels and some of the embassies and other foreign facilities.

122
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,990
Tsukiji was a very much Western-style district in those days

123
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,790
and some of the Christian hospitals and also

124
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:57,560
a Christian school and the university was started from this district.

125
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,710
And this is an image of Ginza Brick District.

126
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,880
At the end of this brick district, you also

127
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,640
can see the locomotive train moving from left to right.

128
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:19,070
That means this locomotive train is moving from Shimbashi to Yokohama.

129
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:26,260
And beyond this locomotive train, you also can see Yokohama port and the sea.

130
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,650
And on this sea, there are some ships.

131
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:36,800
So maybe these ships came from America or European countries

132
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,950
and moved out from those foreign countries.

133
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,810
So this is an image of Ginza Red Brick District

134
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,990
and this image explains how people accept

135
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,328
that image of gate toward new civilization.

136
00:11:56,328 --> 00:12:06,760
Ginza became one of the most fashionable and fancy and trendy cultural areas

137
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,990
after the 1920s.

138
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,410
So many department stores and the restaurants, other kinds of facilities,

139
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,810
established in this district and modern boys

140
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,470
or modern girls enjoyed to walk around district.

141
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,610
This is an image of this district after the 1920s.

142
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,930
In the related course of "Visualizing Japan," Professor Andy Gordon and John

143
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,800
Dower and those professors explain about the history

144
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,820
of this district in more detail so we can

145
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,868
remember what happened in this district in modern times.

146
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,367
