1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,300
After 1946, Japanese government collaborated

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:14,710
with the American occupation Army, organized the tour of Emperor Showa

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,080
again.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,220
Similar to the tour of Meiji emperor, the Emperor Hirohito

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,800
visited many different regions, and villages, and towns all

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,860
around the nation.

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:36,980
And this tour was documented in many photographs and documentary films.

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,710
This is one of the photographs which document

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,310
the visit of Emperor Hirohito in local villages.

10
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,210
So you can see many different attitudes toward the emperor

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,080
from the local people.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,940
Some people bowed.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,310
Some people watched.

14
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,610
Some people stand.

15
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,820
This is another photograph of his visit.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:13,430
One lady bows to the emperor but a man stands at attention to him

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,510
like a military person.

18
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,680
And the small girl just looked at the emperor.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,410
Each attitude towards the emperor were different with each other.

20
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,990
These kinds of differences of the attitude of the local people

21
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,210
are quite interesting.

22
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,870
We also have the very interesting documentary film of this tour.

23
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:46,980
So please watch this documentary film of the emperor's tour.

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:03:57,170


25
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:04,210
One of the most important elements of this tour is, from our perspective,

26
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:10,170
is all the attitudes or the behaviors of the Emperor Hirohito

27
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:18,079
was documented or recorded by the American Army or American people,

28
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,160
or journalists with their cameras and also observed by them.

29
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,520
This is one of the photographs of his visit.

30
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,710
You can see, within the red circle, that his attitude or his behavior

31
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:43,360
was taken in the picture or photograph by maybe journalists and also the man

32
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,450
with the camera.

33
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,470
This is a photo of the engineering division of Mainichi Shimbun in Osaka

34
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,460
where Emperor Hirohito visited.

35
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,280
And behind him, there are two American soldiers observing him.

36
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,330
This is also his visit to Yokohama Harbor.

37
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:12,170
And his behavior was captured by camera, by two American people.

38
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:18,300
And this is also in the school of Kumagaya city,

39
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,440
located in the Saitama Prefecture.

40
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,680
And he was welcomed by great many people in this prefecture.

41
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,540
But the Emperor Hirohito on the stage was documented by cameras

42
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,165
by the US Army or US journalists.

43
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:45,650
And this is also in the factory in Sakai in Osaka.

44
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:52,570
And his attitude was observed by the Army in a red circle.

45
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,440
Emperor Hirohito was observed by American soldiers.

46
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,720
Please look at the relationship between Emperor Hirohito

47
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,040
and the American soldiers behind him.

48
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,150
This is the picture of his visit in Wakayama.

49
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,580
And his behavior was observed by American gaze.

50
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,360


51
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:26,110
And Japanese people very much welcomed and willingly accepted his visit.

52
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,200
This is a photograph of Iwate Prefectural government.

53
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,290
And when the emperor visited Iwate, a huge amount of people

54
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,620
celebrated his visit.

55
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:49,270
In Hyogo Prefecture, so you can see huge amounts of people welcome his visit.

56
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,430
Kobe city.

57
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,510
So huge amount, great many people welcomed him

58
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,290
with celebration of the war victory.

59
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,050
But this is a photograph just after the defeat of the war.

60
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,180
So it is, in some senses, very strange.

61
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,120
But the popularity of the emperor still remained even after the war.

62
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,780
They had defeat of the war, but his popularity still remained.

63
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,540
And this is a picture of the Fukuoka city.

64
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:31,620
So also the emperor's visit was celebrated and welcomed

65
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,970
by the people in the city.

66
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,640
This is a carriage or Emperor Hirohito and the empress.

67
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,050
Because Emperor Hirohito and the empress were seated in the carriage.

68
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:52,690
And a great many people in the Imperial Palace, Imperial Plaza, welcomed him.

69
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,950
So all of the photographs and documentary films

70
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:05,350
explain or show how the Japanese people welcomed and accepted

71
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,190
the visit of the Emperor Hirohito.

72
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,880
So throughout this emperor's tour, a kind of new image of Emperor Hirohito

73
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:22,030
was reconstructed or reestablished with the visit itself

74
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:28,110
and, at the same time, many films and photos of this visit, which

75
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,599
was appearing in newspapers and other news films.

76
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,120


77
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,280
So this the kind of process of the reconstruction of the emperor's

78
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,330
image throughout the occupation era.

79
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,210
I can summarize all of this process.

80
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,760
Because throughout the pre-war period, the gazing relationship,

81
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,960
or visual relationship, between the emperor and people

82
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,790
was constructed and became a little bit invisible.

83
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,190
But after the war, Emperor Hirohito or Showa Emperor,

84
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,560
again reappeared in front of people.

85
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,790
And this visual relationship was recorded and documented

86
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,040
by the cameras of US Army and journalists

87
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,170
and appeared in the newspapers and in some of the other mass media

88
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,860
again and again.

89
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,320
So the relationship between the emperor and people

90
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:39,990
was again appearant in many visual images of mass media, again and again.

91
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,260
This is a new relationship between the emperor

92
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,670
and the people after the postwar era.

93
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:52,410
And this relationship also included a kind of power relationship.

94
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,160
But this power relationship is a little bit different from prewar period.

95
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,460
I'm going to explain about this in a latter unit.
