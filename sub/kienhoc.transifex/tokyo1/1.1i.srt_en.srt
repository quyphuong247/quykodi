1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,120
In this lecture, I've been talking about continuous pro-American sentiment

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,490
in postwar Japan.

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,780
I discussed some of the reason of these pro-Americanism.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:28,470
American mass culture, economic development and American support,

5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,650
or colonization by America.

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,810
Of course there are many different reasons.

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:43,280
But I emphasize that there is a kind of imperial unconsciousness,

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,710
or continuity of imperial unconsciousness from prewar

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,810
period to postwar period.

10
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,570
I think Tokyo has two different faces.

11
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,890
One is imperial city.

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,650
Until 1945 Japan had to be empire in East Asia.

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,620
And Tokyo was a capital of this empire.

14
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,610
So some of the cultural structure of Tokyo

15
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,440
was constructed based on this imperial regime.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,750
But on the other hand, after 1945 Japan defeated

17
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,010
and American occupational army came to Tokyo.

18
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:35,280
And there's a strong influence by American military facilities

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,990
in many areas.

20
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,860
In this sense, Tokyo had the other face of colonial city.

21
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,870
I've already discussed about Shonan Beach

22
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,860
and that kind of similarity between Shonan Beach

23
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,900
and some of the other beaches in Pacific, in Philippines,

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,695
in Hawaii, in Guam.

25
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:02,600


26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,060
In this sense Tokyo has a face of colonial city,

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,480
because the connection between American military base

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:21,640
and consumption of beach culture is common in those areas.

29
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,970
So the problem is what is the connection and the relationship between these two

30
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,240
faces, imperial city and colonial city?

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,560
What is a continuous, and these continuous connection

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,670
between these two?

33
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,180


34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,730
I think we need to discuss a little bit theoretically

35
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,685
in these connections in this last unit.

36
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:53,270


37
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,880
Until the 1950s, there's a kind of similarity and correspondence

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,500
between mainland Japan, and Okinawa, and South Korea, and the Philippines.

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:11,270
All of these area was entered under the American hegemony.

40
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:18,290
And all of these areas-- in all of these areas-- Japanese military facilities

41
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,260
have changed to American military facilities.

42
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:30,030
So in this area, American culture, and American military base,

43
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,360
was connected with each other.

44
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,770
In other words, American military culture

45
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,350
was always connected with American military violence.

46
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,860


47
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:50,820
In this sense, Roppongi, and Harajuku, Washington Heights, and also

48
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:59,530
Tachikawa, Yokosuka, and some of the Okinawa bases was relatively similar.

49
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:06,370
But after the 1960s mainland Japan, in mainland Japan,

50
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,300
many of American military base was returned to Japan and disappeared,

51
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,570
especially in Tokyo.

52
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,459
Washington Heights was returned to Japan.

53
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,920
And most of the American military facilities in Roppongi

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
was returned to Japan.

55
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,604
So most of the American military facilities in central Tokyo

56
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:28,270
was disappeared.

57
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,250


58
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:38,730
But some of the influence remained-- especially cultural influence

59
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:44,170
in Harajuku, in Roppongi, and some of the Shonan Beaches.

60
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:50,910
This area continuously be very fashionable and very popular

61
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,430
for young people because of American culture.

62
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,170
So cultural consumption and military bases, or military violence,

63
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:06,910
was different stories after the 1960s in mainland Japan.

64
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,820
But it was only in mainland Japan.

65
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,410


66
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,290
In Okinawa, in South Korea, in Philippines,

67
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,400
in some of the other areas of imperial city,

68
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,040
the story was very much different.

69
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,680
Because in those areas military violence and the consumption of American culture

70
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,460
was connected with each other.

71
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,675
In that case, people cannot be so much pro-America because consumption

72
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:44,140
of American culture was in some sense connected with presence of American

73
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,280
military violence.

74
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,650
But in mainland Japan the dimension of American military violence

75
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,650
was basically disappeared from metropolitan areas.

76
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,590
So people can enjoy only the consumption of

77
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,210
American military-- American consumer culture.

78
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:17,720
As we watched, we enjoyed what we pursued American new way of life,

79
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:30,410
and American kitchen, and American electric goods-- like refrigerator,

80
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,930
washing machine, and the new kitchen, and the consumer culture.

81
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:41,500
Also we can pursue-- we could pursue new American pop

82
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,150
culture-- music, and fashion, and so on.

83
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,800
So all in these cases the consumption of American culture and presence

84
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,430
of American military base was a different story in mainland Japan,

85
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,990
or in Tokyo in postwar era.

86
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,070
Harajuku, Omotesando, and Roppongi, and other places

87
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:12,170
became cultural districts for young people.

88
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,030
And these young people never think about the relationship

89
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:23,240
between with military crisis or military past.

90
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,280
The important question is how could Tokyo

91
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,580
separate cultural elements from military violence.

92
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:41,140
Because Tokyo has been the center of Asian region

93
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:49,540
as the imperial capital Tokyo can enjoy the closeness of-- because

94
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,610
of this imperial past, Tokyo can enjoy the closeness

95
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,490
with American hegemony, which is very different from other Asian countries.

96
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,750
I'll show this.

97
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,680
This is a graph of America military bases in Japan.

98
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:18,690
So after the 1960s the area of American military bases in mainland Japan

99
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,480
was decreased rapidly after the 1960s.

100
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,100
But it is quite different from Okinawa's case,

101
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:34,470
because even after the return of Okinawa to Japan,

102
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,490
the spaces of American military bases did not decrease in Okinawa.

103
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,100


104
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,570
They decreased a bit, but not so much.

105
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,930
In case of mainland Japan after the 1960s,

106
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:59,050
the area of American military bases decreased a lot and very rapidly.

107
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:04,970
So mainland people-- in mainland people need

108
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:13,020
not to experience America military violence after the 1960s so much.

109
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,980
This is very different from Okinawa's case.

110
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:23,960
So in conclusion I'm going to talk about how this kind of the separation

111
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,720
can be possible.

112
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:33,160
Before the postwar in Pacific, there were two different empires.

113
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,430
One is an American expansionism in Pacific.

114
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,000
And the other is a Japanese expansionism in Asia.

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,690
And these two imperial force confronted with each other.

116
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:54,680
Japanese empire invaded many Asian societies-- and in Korea,

117
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,810
in China, and in Southeast Asia.

118
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:05,400
But after the war Japan was entered into American hegemony.

119
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,800
In other words, Japan accepted American hegemony and Americanism.

120
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,670
And under the Japanese-- under these American hegemony,

121
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:23,420
Japan tried to enjoy the closeness to America-- especially Tokyo.

122
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,770
So connection with Americanism became one of the most important factors

123
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,590
by which Tokyo constructed its new identity.

124
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:46,630
And because of that the people in Tokyo can reconstruct our identity

125
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,950
without facing with other Asian societies.

126
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,010
Especially in the era of the Cold War there

127
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,240
is a strong confrontation between Americanism and communism.

128
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,740
And all of the identity of Tokyo and culture was connected with Americanism.

129
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:18,900
So by accepting these American cultures we reconstructed our own identity

130
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,520
as a center.

131
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,520


132
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,560
The question which remains after these lectures

133
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,600
is I discussed about the documents which was taken by American cameras

134
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,600
and many images under the American gazes,

135
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,770
and relationship between camera and gazes.

136
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,170
So I think there's a different kind of the images

137
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,730
and gazes throughout postwar Tokyo history.

138
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,500
I only focused on some kind of imperial and colonial element of Tokyo

139
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,690
in this lecture.

140
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,930
But I need to expand our vision and our practice of visualizing

141
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,690
beyond this kind of the very much imperial and the colonial relationship

142
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,980
with American hegemony.

143
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,570


144
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,620
In the next module, I'm going to discuss the relationship

145
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,300
between the people and the city.
