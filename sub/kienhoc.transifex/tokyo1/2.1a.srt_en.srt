https://youtu.be/wyuye-57SbM

1
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:20,630
Tokyo was the imperial city.

2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,960


3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,765
Imperial city means the city where the emperor lives.

4
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,570


5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,730
But the meaning of the emperor, in Japanese,

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,940
and the meaning of the emperor in the Western world

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,410
is a little bit different.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,300
In Japanese it is called tenno.

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,360


10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,920
But tenno was very different, in two ways, from Western world.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,010


12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,740
First, tenno was a religious and cultural center

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,495
who is confined in Kyoto area.

14
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:57,940


15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,880
The political center of Edo era was shogun, who lived in Edo.

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,560


17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,160
And secondly, tenno was a sacred figure or sacred body,

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,420
which cannot be seen or touched by other people.

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,920


20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,360
So the body of the emperor, or tenno, should

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,305
be concealed in some very limited spaces.

22
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:30,140


23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,600
For example, after the Meiji Restoration, the body of a tenno

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,220
was moved from Kyoto to Edo, because the new political leader of the Meiji

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,070
government wanted to bring his body to Tokyo

26
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:54,090
and tried to transform his centricity from not only the cultural

27
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,500
and the religious center, to but also political center.

28
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,680


29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,330
So this moving was necessary for them.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:12,130
But even in this tour, from Kyoto to Edo, the palanquin concealed his body.

31
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:18,320
You can see this palanquin, or carriage, in this picture, or woodblock print.

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,340


33
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:29,250
Gray and black and yellow carriage is emperor's carriage.

34
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,600
But we cannot see his body at all.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,250


36
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,550
So, in this stage, there are no visual relationship between emperor

37
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,600
and ordinary people in this society.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,550


39
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:51,670
But after the 1870s, the new visual relationship between emperor

40
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,085
and the people in this nation was invented and promoted.

41
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:56,160


42
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,860
In the 1870s, emperor toured all around the area in this nation.

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,610
And in this process, because he visited in many villages and towns,

44
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,463
people were ordered to watch the emperor directly.

45
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:14,680


46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,190
In Edo period, the people should not watch the emperor, or shogun.

47
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,270


48
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,955
But in this process, they were ordered to watch.

49
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,470


50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,715
And after the 1880s, for example, in this woodblock print,

51
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:35,985
the emperor is a person who is behind.

52
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:37,520


53
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,270
But he watched the map of the Korean Peninsula.

54
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:45,220
Because this is a picture just before first Sino-Japanese war.

55
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,810


56
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,710
And all the political leaders in Meiji government

57
00:03:52,710 --> 00:04:00,380
watch this map with strong desire, or intention of invasion and imperialism.

58
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,650


59
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:11,180
On the other hand, many performances and bodies and area

60
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,435
was watched by emperor's gaze.

61
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:15,840


62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:27,420
In this woodblock print, people who are training the body in athletic movement

63
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,025
was watched by emperor.

64
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:31,710


65
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:40,440
And this watching, or this gazing, legitimized their athletic movement,

66
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,045
or their performance.

67
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:44,270


68
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,730
The visual relationship between emperor and his subject

69
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:56,315
was very much important moment of constructing the power structure

70
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:58,875
in this nation, after the Meiji era.

71
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,120


72
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:12,570
So after the middle of Meiji era, the portrait of emperor was taken by photo,

73
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,030
and distributed all around the nation in elementary school,

74
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,805
or local government, and many other official institutions.

75
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,910


76
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,162
This is a portrait of Meiji Emperor.

77
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:35,410
Actually, this portrait was drawn by Italian painter named Chiossone.

78
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,000


79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,960
And this picture, or drawn portrait, was taken by photographer.

80
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:54,330
And the photograph of portrait was distributed all around this society.

81
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,930
In this photograph, elementary or junior high school students

82
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,990
bowed in front of the emperor's photograph.

83
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:09,490
But the emperor's photograph in the white monument

84
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,170
was not shown to the students at all.

85
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,310


86
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,500
So the relationship between the emperor's photograph or portrait

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:24,400
and students became a kind of invisible relationship, which

88
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,405
is different from the visible relationship between these two

89
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:29,580
in Meiji era.

90
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,420


91
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,625
So there are two stages.

92
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,080


93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,470
On the first hand, on the first place, the invisible sacred relationship

94
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,840
has changed towards the visual relationship

95
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,640
between emperor and his subject.

96
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,800
But again, in Showa era, that this visual relationship

97
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,390
between emperor and his subject was turned

98
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,090
to some kind of invisible relationship.

99
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,270


100
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,510
In order to summarize what I discussed in this unit,

101
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,220
we can understand the relationship between the people

102
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,250
and emperor in the picture left side.

103
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,640


104
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,880
Because there is a kind of a cloud between people and emperor.

105
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,910
So the gazing, or other kind of the perspective from the people, cannot go,

106
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,850
or cannot reach, to emperor.

107
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,820


108
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:37,000
They only can feel or can imagine the sacred body of emperor

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,840
beyond this cloud.

110
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,090
But after the Meiji Restoration, the government

111
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,320
tried to construct the direct visual relationship between people and emperor

112
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,300
because it is so important to construct the new political order

113
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,600
of this modern nation.

114
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,430


115
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,470
But at the same time, after the 1920s or 1930s,

116
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,670
this direct visual relationship has changed a little,

117
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:10,960
or in some way toward, in some sense, invisible relationship.

118
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,300


119
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,650
So visuality and invisibility, or visibility and invisibility,

120
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,550
between ruling class people and ordinary people,

121
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,870
or emperor and the people in the nation, was

122
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:32,539
quite important to think in a whole understanding of the power

123
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,480
relationship of this society.

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,000
