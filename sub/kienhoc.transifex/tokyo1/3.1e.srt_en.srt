1
00:00:03,728 --> 00:00:07,960
The other important preceding event to reconsider

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,120
about the relationship between the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,140
and the urban planning or development in postwar era

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,140
was war damage reconstruction plan in postwar Tokyo.

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,160
In August 1945, Japan was completely damaged by war.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,980
Devastated area was 630 square kilometers

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,110
and more than 2 million houses were lost,

8
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,310
more than 9 million people were victims.

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,700
But the reconstruction planning was started very quick,

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,630
because August 12-- three days before the war

11
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,230
ended-- some of the urban planners already

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,390
started discussing rebuilding before the end of war.

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,210
In September, major urban planners in local government

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:14,660
gathered to discuss about the city planning in postwar era.

15
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:21,340
In November, the War Reconstruction Board was organized in government.

16
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,490
And already in December 30, the grand plan for reconstruction

17
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,120
was already decided.

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,120
So only four months later than war ended,

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,790
the Reconstruction Plan was already authorized in the government.

20
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:47,270
In this grand plan for reconstruction, there are three major principles.

21
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:53,580
First one is a land planning, or this grand plan

22
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,000
emphasized the importance of land planning.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,410
And secondly, very wide boulevards and open space

24
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:09,800
should be created in many cities for disaster protection.

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,550
And thirdly, green network were also emphasized.

26
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,860
It was said that more than 10% of urban area

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:27,760
should be green-- trees and grasses and forests and so on.

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,040
In the case of Tokyo, Hideaki Ishikawa-- he's a famous urban planner--

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,270
became the leader of this new planning.

30
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:51,380
In 1946, he maintained or he organized, and he decided the new plan

31
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,630
for the road and land use in postwar Tokyo.

32
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:05,300
In this plan, under Hideaki Ishikawa, seven 100 meter wide roads

33
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,820
were supposed to be constructed in Tokyo.

34
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,660
And at the same time, in 1948, the Green Belt planning

35
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,760
was also designed or decided.

36
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,950


37
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:30,560
In order to disaster protection, 33% of urban area in Tokyo

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:39,870
need to be green, including the forests and parks and other green area.

39
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,720
And also-- because Hideaki Ishikawa was strongly interested

40
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,281
in the relationship between space and culture

41
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:55,030
or entertainment and other culture activity in the city--

42
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,600
he was so much interested in those kinds of the cultural activity.

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,930
So his planning included many elements of the cultural activities.

44
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,510
And he proposed that the special districts focusing on or related

45
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,769
with culture, education, entertainment, consumption,

46
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,655
those kinds of the special districts should be planned in Tokyo.

47
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,930


48
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:33,150
His planning in Tokyo was very much idealistic, and in some case,

49
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,820
it was tried to be realized.

50
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,470
This is a map of war damaged area in Tokyo after the war.

51
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,220
So almost one third of urban area was damaged here.

52
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,150
So upon this damaged area, new street network

53
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,940
were going to be designed and contracted.

54
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,850
This urban street network included very wide roads and boulevards.

55
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:14,640
So some of the road was 100 meter wide, and many roads were very wide road.

56
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:23,820
If this urban street network were already realized in postwar era,

57
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:35,270
maybe in the Olympic Games in 1964, the urban expressway network

58
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:43,200
are not so necessary to be constructed on the river or on the canal.

59
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,670
But this urban street network could not be realized in early 1950s.

60
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:57,370
On the other hand, the Green Belt and open space were included in his plan.

61
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,645
This is a map of the Green Belt in the planning.

62
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:08,380
The area that are completely blue were the intended Green Belt.

63
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:15,870
So you can see that so many areas are going to be green.

64
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:22,710
Forest, park, and other kinds of trees and grasses.

65
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:30,520
So if this plan for Green Belt had been realized,

66
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,780
Tokyo could have been very green city that

67
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,350
might be completely different from the city of Tokyo today.

68
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,755
About the special district for entertainment,

69
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:48,310
for culture and education.

70
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,520
For example, Shinjuku was designed as a special district

71
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,450
for entertainment and shopping.

72
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,690
One of the experimental case or experimental area

73
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,220
for this designing, Kabukicho was designed as a special model

74
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,300
area for the entertainment and shopping.

75
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,190
So Kabukicho was created according to his plan

76
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,730
of special district for the culture and the entertainment in Shinjuku.

77
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,070
Also some of the university area was designed

78
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,180
as special district for the education and culture.

79
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:36,110
In the case of Waseda, the surrounding area of the Waseda University

80
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,310
should be designed as a university town.

81
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,470
So many Green Belt and parks and many of the facilities for the education

82
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,650
and culture was designed to be constructed.

83
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,260


84
00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:02,130
Most challenging plan of these special districts was Hongo-Ueno district.

85
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:07,380
This district was designed as special district for education and culture,

86
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,850
initiated by Shigeru Nanbara, President of Tokyo University in those days.

87
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,400


88
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,930
Under the initiative of President Nanbara, the architect Kenzo Tange

89
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,880
and some of the other people joined to this project.

90
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,780
The plan was drawn by Kenzo Tange.

91
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,620
This was strongly influenced by Le Corbusier,

92
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,525
and this plan was one of the first plans designed by Kenzo Tange in postwar era.

93
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:44,290


94
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:52,680
President Nanbara maintained that these Hongo and Ueno and Koishikawa area

95
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,790
could be the new Oxford or some kind of that university town in Tokyo.

96
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:08,110
In 1946, he announced that this special district for education and culture

97
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:17,330
are now being discussed and planned in board meeting.

98
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,740


99
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,650
He maintains that university should play the central role

100
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,560
for creating new cultural nation.

101
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,110


102
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:37,140
And Hongo and Ueno and the Koishikawa area can be a kind of Oxford in Tokyo.

103
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:45,820
That means campus town with large dormitories of professors and students.

104
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,840
And he organized planning committee, including Kenzo Tange, Hideto Kishida,

105
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:59,500
and Eika Takayama and other important people in the University of Tokyo.

106
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:07,540
In August 1946, the planning was accomplished by these people.

107
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,130
And negotiation process with Tokyo Municipal Government

108
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,920
and other administrative institution was started.

109
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,800
At the same time, they tried to collect a donation

110
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,780
from other many different people to build the dormitories in these areas.

111
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,630
This plan included four major districts.

112
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,520
Ueno district should be the special district for art.

113
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,670
Hongo is the district for, of university.

114
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:50,950
But Yushima and Koishikawa area also included in this planning.

115
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:58,270
Yushima district could be the international exchange area, including

116
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,420
the conference hall, museum, and other kind of the international facilities.

117
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,310
And also Koishikawa district could be the area

118
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,225
for district for the recreation.

119
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,800


120
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,210
Also these special districts include three boulevards

121
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,020
that connect between Yushima, Hongo, Yanaka,

122
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:33,260
or Koishikawa, Hongo, and Ueno, all of these different districts.

123
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:43,520
So if this planning was realized in postwar era,

124
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:51,740
Tokyo would have a kind of the university town in this city.

125
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,060
In this university town, university, museum,

126
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,400
and some of the parks and international facility was integrated.

127
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,980
And also the Green Belt or green area, trees and grasses,

128
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:16,530
were included in this university environment.

129
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:22,330
Maybe this was too much idealistic plan.

130
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:28,720
And that was one of the reasons why this plan was not realized.

131
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:38,780
But we need to remind the possibility of these idealistic plan in postwar Tokyo.

132
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:46,790
In Hongo or Waseda or Shinjuku or some of the districts in Tokyo,

133
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:57,700
because if some of the plan in these districts were realized,

134
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:05,395
maybe the Olympic city Tokyo, after 1964, would have been very different

135
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:15,130
form from the city which is actually realized after the 1960s.

136
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,520
We can imagine some of the alternative possibility of this city

137
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,380
from these idealistic planning in postwar era.

138
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,367
