1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,005
In the previous unit, I talked about invisibility

2
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:18,800
of American military force in the media, and at the same time, visibility

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,360
of American military force on the street in the city.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,910
In the centeral Tokyo, American soldiers and American bases

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,520
and other kinds of facilities were very much evident fact for ordinary people.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,240
If you go to the Imperial Palace, if you go to the other kind of district

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,090
where American facility are concentrated, you could experience,

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,500
or you could see, American soldiers and the impact of American military base.

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,310
And what happened next?

10
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,066
I'm going to talk about some of the examples

11
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:06,230
of this change in transformation of Tokyo after the late 1950s.

12
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:13,180
This is Washington Heights in Harajuku and Yoyogi area.

13
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,130
Washington Heights was a huge American military area.

14
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:27,900
But before the war, this area was Japanese military field

15
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,840
in early Showa period and inwar period.

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:41,420
Japanese military did practice, and parade, and other things in this area.

17
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:49,330
After the war, Japanese military field was taken over by the American military

18
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,800
and it became American military residential area

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,720
called Washington Heights.

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:04,170
In Washington Heights, houses and other kinds of facilities were constructed.

21
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,530
So Washington Heights was a kind of a huge American town

22
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,720
in centeral Tokyo in those days.

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,960


24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,560
One of the typical examples of these American facilities

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,250
was dependent house.

26
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,200
Dependent house is a special term for American military housing.

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,940


28
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:42,350
Within these houses, we already saw CIE film titled For a Bright Home Life.

29
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:50,260
In that film, you saw the beautiful American style kitchen.

30
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,170
This is a typical kitchen in this dependent house.

31
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:00,400
For ordinary Japanese people, dependent house was a dream house.

32
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,730
Not only these dependent house, but also other kind of culture and education

33
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,010
facility was concentrated in Washington Heights and other American bases

34
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,930
in Tokyo from the late 1940s, 1950s.

35
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,950
But these kind of American facilities, especially around centeral Tokyo,

36
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:32,540
was returned to Tokyo, or returned to Japan, after the late 1950s.

37
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,410
In case of Washington Heights, Washington Heights

38
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:46,590
was returned to Japan just before the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964.

39
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,370
After the return of Washington Heights, this area

40
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,190
became Olympic Park and Yoyogi Park.

41
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,720
But during the occupation era, and Washington Heights era,

42
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:07,550
many of the American cultural elements spread out from Washington Heights.

43
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,770
American music culture, or American fashion culture,

44
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,250
and other kinds of American military culture

45
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,920
spread out from Washington Heights.

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,710
From the late 1950s, this area became very fashionable and popular

47
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:32,590
for Japanese youngsters because of the spread of American military culture.

48
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,860
And this cultural element remained even after the military facility

49
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,770
disappeared from this area.

50
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,760
So until the early 1960s, Harajuku and Omotesando area

51
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,140
was an American army town with Washington Heights.

52
00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:00,680
But after the late 1960s, it changed to American cultural town,

53
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,340
or international cultural town.

54
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,270
In trying to consume this kind of the cultural element of Americanism,

55
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,890
many young people gathered around this area.

56
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,100
So we can trace how Harajuku and Omotesando area

57
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:28,780
changed from an American military town to a cultural town for young people.

58
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,700
For example, this is Omotesando area in the 1970s.

59
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,140
So some of the young people tried to sell something on the street,

60
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:45,630
and also Omotesando area in the 1970s.

61
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,960
Some streets became very popular for young people

62
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,600
to buy American goods and fashion.

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,820
This is Takeshita Street, very near from Omotesando area.

64
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,640
It's very crowded.

65
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,360


66
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,950
And some of the young people want to dance on the street.

67
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,190
These people were called rock and roller people,

68
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,920
because they preferred to dance with rock and roll music.

69
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:27,130
This is also rock and roller in Harajuku in the 1980s.

70
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,570
So many young people preferred to dance on the street in Harajuku.

71
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,440


72
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,680
Some people had Mickey Mouse with himself.

73
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,470
Harajuku became the town for young people.

74
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,730
And the young people preferred to gather around this area.

75
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:55,090
And they enjoyed consumer lives, and American culture, and pop culture,

76
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,010
after the 1970s and '80s.

77
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,520
So they don't know this area had been American base.

78
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,820
They don't know the impact of American military base.

79
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,950
But they enjoyed consumer culture based on American military base,

80
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,270
or military facilities.

81
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:25,770
So after the 1960s and '70s, American military force and facilities

82
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:34,015
became more and more invisible, even in Tokyo city, even from on the street.

83
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,570


84
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:44,480
But a kind of the impact, or influence, of these American military base,

85
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:52,120
or military facilities, remained, for example in Harajuku or in Roppongi,

86
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,330
and some of the busy areas for young people in Tokyo.

87
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:05,400
So there's a kind of continuity from American base culture to Japanese youth

88
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,180
culture after the 1960s.
