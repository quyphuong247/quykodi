0
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:10,972
- How many times have you heard someone say,

1
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:13,340
I&#39;m just not good at math?

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,513
Or, I&#39;m terrible at this, I will never get it.

3
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:20,502
What about, oh, you&#39;re a natural at that,

4
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:23,997
or, she&#39;s such a gifted musician.

5
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:25,861
These statements represent a point of view

6
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:28,944
that assumes high performance and achievement

7
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:33,111
are due mostly to talent, innate ability, or intelligence.

8
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:36,398
Students may even believe those are qualities

9
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:39,416
we&#39;re either born with or not.

10
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,901
Stanford professor Carol Dweck and her collaborators

11
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:45,555
call this perspective a fixed mindset.

12
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:48,498
The belief that our level of ability or intelligence

13
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:50,623
is essentially unchanging,

14
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:54,045
and that some simply have more than others.

15
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:55,787
On the other hand, you&#39;ve probably also

16
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,615
heard people say things like,

17
00:00:57,615 --> 00:00:58,987
I know I can get better at this.

18
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:01,210
Just give me a little more time.

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,300
Or, he got where he is through hard work.

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,779
Or, she&#39;s fearless.

21
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:09,669
She never seems to worry about making mistakes.

22
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,670
These statements reflect an alternate view,

23
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,321
one Dweck refers to as a growth mindset.

24
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:19,789
The belief that ability and intelligence are changeable,

25
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,006
and that we can increase them.

26
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:25,554
In other words, this view asserts that high performance

27
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:29,137
is due mostly to hard work and persistence.

28
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:32,177
During the last 30 years,

29
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:35,132
scores of research studies in school settings,

30
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:37,796
often involving rigorous randomized trials,

31
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:39,201
longitudinal tracking,

32
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:41,463
and carefully-controlled interventions,

33
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:43,506
have shown that student mindsets,

34
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:46,800
their beliefs about intelligence and ability,

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,131
have important implications for their academic performance.

36
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:53,542
And among the most striking conclusions

37
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:56,280
is that students who possess a growth mindset,

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,636
that is, students who believe their intelligence

39
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:03,539
can grow as they learn, frequently perform at higher levels

40
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:05,289
than those who don&#39;t.

41
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,197
Let&#39;s begin by looking at one of the studies

42
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:12,151
demonstrating that growth mindsets help students learn.

43
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:16,292
In 2007, researchers from Stanford and Columbia Universities

44
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:18,629
began to follow almost 400 students

45
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,948
as they entered junior high school.

46
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:24,418
Now, any transition like that can prove difficult.

47
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:27,307
As students enter middle school, high school, or college,

48
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:30,100
they&#39;re suddenly confronted with increasingly complex

49
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,626
and unfamiliar work.

50
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:33,182
The whole experience can leave them feeling

51
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:35,522
vulnerable and unsure.

52
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,368
Therefore, it&#39;s reasonable to conclude

53
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:40,801
that student mindsets might have some influence

54
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:43,359
on how well they transition.

55
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,507
To test this hypothesis, these brand-new seventh graders

56
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:48,594
were given an assessment that measured,

57
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:50,789
in a valid and reliable way,

58
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,286
whether they possessed fixed or growth mindsets.

59
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:57,186
It&#39;s important to note the students in both groups

60
00:02:57,186 --> 00:03:00,141
had entered junior high with similar achievement scores

61
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:02,843
in math grades in the years prior.

62
00:03:02,843 --> 00:03:07,617
So, what happened to those students over the next two years?

63
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:11,896
Those with growth mindsets showed continuous improvement,

64
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:14,946
while those with fixed mindsets didn&#39;t.

65
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,966
Also, as shown in this graph,

66
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,047
a gap in their math performances,

67
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,395
as measured by grades and achievement,

68
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:25,105
developed and continued to widen between the groups

69
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,237
during the two years they were studied.

70
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:32,857
The results are striking and important to us as teachers.

71
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:34,642
What was it that helped some to excel

72
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:38,749
in the midst of challenges, while others lagged behind?

73
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,613
Through interviews with the students,

74
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:44,587
the researchers discovered some noteworthy differences.

75
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:48,406
The growth mindset students valued hard work

76
00:03:48,406 --> 00:03:50,400
as a way to improve.

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,411
If they performed poorly, for example,

78
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:55,433
they more often said they&#39;d work harder the next time,

79
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:58,533
perhaps also trying a different strategy.

80
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:02,164
And for them, mistakes and struggle along the way

81
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:06,466
signaled something positive, that they were learning.

82
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:08,776
Grades were still important to them, sure,

83
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:12,638
but it was the learning that mattered most.

84
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:15,019
On the other hand, the fixed mindset students

85
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,517
felt that smart people didn&#39;t have to try hard,

86
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:20,929
and for them, setbacks weren&#39;t chances

87
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,225
to work harder or differently.

88
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:26,267
Instead, they were a signal of their low ability,

89
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:30,077
something they felt they couldn&#39;t much change.

90
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:33,036
As a result, these fixed mindset students

91
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:37,172
often responded very differently to difficult situations.

92
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:40,834
They often avoided challenges for fear of failure.

93
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,607
And if they did perform poorly,

94
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,606
they were less likely to try harder the next time.

95
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:47,991
In some instances, they even said

96
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:51,692
they would study less in the future.

97
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,803
Here&#39;s another crucial finding:

98
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:57,132
Other studies have shown that fixed mindset students

99
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:59,050
often hide their effort,

100
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,012
worried it will confirm their low ability.

101
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:06,231
They tend to attribute their failures to external sources,

102
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:09,142
placing the blame on teachers or tests

103
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,190
rather than on themselves.

104
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,292
And they self-handicap.

105
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,806
If they don&#39;t try hard, then they&#39;ll have

106
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:19,658
a comforting reason for later poor performance.

107
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:21,332
It was no surprise, then,

108
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:23,252
that the two groups of students in the study

109
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:25,864
performed quite differently over those two years,

110
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:29,419
as you can see in the math grades depicted in the graph.

111
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,179
Notice that they begin from similar points,

112
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:34,096
but diverge thereafter.

113
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:39,540
As a teacher, I find this research remarkable.

114
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,348
Few things are as important in life

115
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:43,934
as pushing through challenges,

116
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:48,770
learning from mistakes, and being willing to risk failure.

117
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,035
And yet some students, even some of my most capable,

118
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,618
too often do just the opposite.

119
00:05:55,518 --> 00:05:58,075
Dweck&#39;s framework helps make sense

120
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:02,174
of why students respond in such starkly different ways.

121
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:05,422
If we believe that mistakes are chances to learn,

122
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:07,639
we&#39;re more likely to be okay with failure

123
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,674
and just try harder the next time.

124
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:13,104
But if struggling is a sign that we&#39;re not smart

125
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:18,010
and we can&#39;t get better, that is a really scary message.

126
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,001
And so, fixed mindset students may spend

127
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:24,891
enormous energy on ways to not feel bad about themselves,

128
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:28,093
rather on learning and growing.

129
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:31,663
We&#39;ve seen what can happen to students in just two years.

130
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:33,442
Imagine the cumulative effect

131
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:36,641
of a lifetime of such decisions.

132
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:39,981
So, can we help our students who enter the year

133
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,839
with fixed mindsets?

134
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,852
The answer seems to be yes.

135
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:47,811
Many studies have focused on interventions,

136
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,880
teaching students about the plasticity of the brain

137
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,993
and malleability of intelligence,

138
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:57,698
and that effort and hard work lead to higher performance.

139
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:00,017
These programs have been delivered in various ways,

140
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:03,798
by teachers, peer mentors, and even online programs,

141
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:08,319
such as Brainology, developed by Dweck and her colleagues.

142
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,484
The results from over 30 years

143
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:13,804
all point to the growth mindset as a powerful factor

144
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:16,800
in enhancing the performance of a wide variety of students

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,789
of all ages and backgrounds.

146
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,473
Interventions have even been shown

147
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:24,636
to help close achievement gaps for girls in math,

148
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:29,176
and students of color in a number of academic contexts.

149
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:30,184
In his recent book,

150
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:33,544
Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise,

151
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:36,894
Anders Ericcson summarizes a related line of research

152
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:39,323
similar to the role of growth mindset

153
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:42,997
in enhancing our students&#39; academic performance.

154
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:45,151
Ericcson describes decades of research

155
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,743
on the development of expertise,

156
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:50,146
revealing that, in almost every domain,

157
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:53,231
it is not innate talent or intelligence

158
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:57,022
that mostly determines whether someone becomes an expert.

159
00:07:57,022 --> 00:08:00,323
Rather, Erikkson demonstrates that the primary determiner

160
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:03,832
of why some people develop into world-class experts

161
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:08,091
is actually something he calls deliberate practice.

162
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,840
Deliberate practice is a special form of learning,

163
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,372
and includes regular spaced practice

164
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:15,883
with timely and informative feedback,

165
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:20,710
all invariably overseen by a mentor, coach, or teacher.

166
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,466
So, what&#39;s this have to do with our students?

167
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:27,583
It&#39;s true, we&#39;re not developing world-class experts

168
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:31,253
in various professional fields, at least not yet.

169
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:33,777
But we are striving to develop expert learners

170
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:36,142
at whatever age we encounter them.

171
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:39,199
And by helping them develop a growth mindset,

172
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:43,085
emphasizing hard work and effective effort,

173
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:45,238
we significantly increase the chances

174
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:48,879
they&#39;ll become high performers in school and beyond.

175
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,067
In other words, effective effort in the academic realm

176
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,501
is analogous to deliberate practice

177
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:58,087
in the development of expert performers.

178
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,466
Next, we&#39;ll discuss strategies for developing

179
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:03,383
the growth mindset in our students.
