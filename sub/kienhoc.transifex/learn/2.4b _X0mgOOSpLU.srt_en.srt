0
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:15,824
The power of yet.

1
00:00:15,824 --> 00:00:17,928
I heard about a high school in Chicago

2
00:00:17,928 --> 00:00:22,771
where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate,

3
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:28,077
and if they didn&#39;t pass a course, they got the grade &quot;Not Yet.&quot;

4
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:30,445
And I thought that was fantastic,

5
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:34,340
because if you get a failing grade, you think, I&#39;m nothing, I&#39;m nowhere.

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,279
But if you get the grade &quot;Not Yet&quot;

7
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:40,798
you understand that you&#39;re on a learning curve.

8
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:44,142
It gives you a path into the future.

9
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:52,224
&quot;Not Yet&quot; also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career,

10
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,105
a real turning point.

11
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:56,093
I wanted to see

12
00:00:56,093 --> 00:01:01,098
how children coped with challenge and difficulty,

13
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:04,139
so I gave 10-year-olds

14
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:09,348
problems that were slightly too hard for them.

15
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:14,108
Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way.

16
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:17,839
They said things like, &quot;I love a challenge,&quot;

17
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:23,127
or, &quot;You know, I was hoping this would be informative.&quot;

18
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:29,273
They understood that their abilities could be developed.

19
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:33,218
They had what I call a growth mindset.

20
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:38,599
But other students felt it was tragic, catastrophic.

21
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,163
From their more fixed mindset perspective,

22
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:50,466
their intelligence had been up for judgment and they failed.

23
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:54,887
Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet,

24
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:59,166
they were gripped in the tyranny of now.

25
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,607
So what do they do next?

26
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:04,025
I&#39;ll tell you what they do next.

27
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:09,823
In one study, they told us they would probably cheat the next time

28
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:14,324
instead of studying more if they failed a test.

29
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,774
In another study, after a failure,

30
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:20,476
they looked for someone who did worse than they did

31
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:25,116
so they could feel really good about themselves.

32
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:31,046
And in study after study, they have run from difficulty.

33
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:36,692
Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain

34
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:40,130
as students confronted an error.

35
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,198
On the left, you see the fixed mindset students.

36
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,335
There&#39;s hardly any activity.

37
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:48,811
They run from the error.

38
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:51,694
They don&#39;t engage with it.

39
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:55,365
But on the right, you have the students with the growth mindset,

40
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:59,206
the idea that abilities can be developed.

41
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,310
They engage deeply.

42
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,445
Their brain is on fire with yet.

43
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:05,963
They engage deeply.

44
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:08,857
They process the error.

45
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:13,235
They learn from it and they correct it.

46
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,600
How are we raising our children?

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,205
Are we raising them for now instead of yet?

48
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:26,358
Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting A&#39;s?

49
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:31,642
Are we raising kids who don&#39;t know how to dream big dreams?

50
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:39,127
Their biggest goal is getting the next A or the next test score?

51
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:45,432
And are they carrying this need for constant validation with them

52
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:48,222
into their future lives?

53
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:51,886
Maybe, because employers are coming to me and saying,

54
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:55,204
we have already raised a generation

55
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:59,449
of young workers who can&#39;t get through the day

56
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,321
without an award.

57
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:05,469
So what can we do?

58
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:09,417
How can we build that bridge to yet?

59
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,284
Here are some things we can do.

60
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:18,406
First of all, we can praise wisely, not praising intelligence or talent.

61
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:20,211
That has failed.

62
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,275
Don&#39;t do that anymore.

63
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:26,506
But praising the process that kids engage in:

64
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:30,928
their effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance,

65
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:32,793
their improvement.

66
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,344
This process praise

67
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:39,344
creates kids who are hardy and resilient.

68
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:42,195
There are other ways to reward yet.

69
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:46,332
We recently teamed up with game scientists

70
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:48,838
from the University of Washington

71
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:54,077
to create a new online math game that rewarded yet.

72
00:04:54,077 --> 00:05:00,313
In this game, students were rewarded for effort, strategy and progress.

73
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,978
The usual math game

74
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:07,299
rewards you for getting answers right right now,

75
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:10,268
but this game rewarded process.

76
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,738
And we got more effort,

77
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:15,024
more strategies,

78
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:19,297
more engagement over longer periods of time,

79
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:25,280
and more perseverance when they hit really, really hard problems.

80
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,483
Just the words &quot;yet&quot; or &quot;not yet,&quot; we&#39;re finding,

81
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:32,280
give kids greater confidence,

82
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,266
give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence.

83
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:44,070
And we can actually change students&#39; mindsets.

84
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,236
In one study, we taught them

85
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:51,494
that every time they push out of their comfort zone

86
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:54,824
to learn something new and difficult,

87
00:05:54,824 --> 00:06:00,567
the neurons in their brain can form new, stronger connections,

88
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:04,192
and over time they can get smarter.

89
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:06,993
Look what happened: in this study,

90
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:10,592
students who were not taught this growth mindset

91
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:16,223
continued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition,

92
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:23,187
but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades.

93
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:29,302
We have shown this now, this kind of improvement,

94
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:35,839
with thousands and thousands of kids, especially struggling students.

95
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,541
So let&#39;s talk about equality.

96
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:44,553
In our country, there are groups of students

97
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:47,372
who chronically underperform,

98
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:50,354
for example, children in inner cities,

99
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:54,197
or children on Native American reservations.

100
00:06:54,197 --> 00:07:01,043
And they&#39;ve done so poorly for so long that many people think it&#39;s inevitable.

101
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:09,442
But when educators create growth mindset classrooms steeped in yet,

102
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,727
equality happens.

103
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:17,027
And here are just a few examples.

104
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:23,157
In one year, a kindergarten class in Harlem, New York

105
00:07:23,157 --> 00:07:30,634
scored in the 95th percentile on the National Achievement Test.

106
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:37,870
Many of those kids could not hold a pencil when they arrived at school.

107
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,126
In one year,

108
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:45,497
fourth grade students in the South Bronx, way behind,

109
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:51,266
became the number one fourth grade class in the state of New York

110
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:55,240
on the state math test.

111
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,179
In a year to a year and a half,

112
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:04,672
Native American students in a school on a reservation

113
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:11,471
went from the bottom of their district to the top,

114
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:17,193
and that district included affluent sections of Seattle.

115
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:24,484
So the native kids outdid the Microsoft kids.

116
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:27,731
This happened because the meaning

117
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:32,368
of effort and difficulty were transformed.

118
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:36,800
Before, effort and difficulty

119
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,743
made them feel dumb, made them feel like giving up,

120
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:45,207
but now, effort and difficulty,

121
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:49,203
that&#39;s when their neurons are making new connections,

122
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:50,968
stronger connections.

123
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:54,509
That&#39;s when they&#39;re getting smarter.

124
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:59,852
I received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy.

125
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:03,761
He said, &quot;Dear Professor Dweck,

126
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:10,395
I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research,

127
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:15,981
and that&#39;s why I decided to put it into practice.

128
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:19,736
I put more effort into my schoolwork,

129
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:22,867
into my relationship with my family,

130
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:27,302
and into my relationship with kids at school,

131
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:34,116
and I experienced great improvement in all of those areas.

132
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:39,435
I now realize I&#39;ve wasted most of my life.&quot;

133
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:46,785
Let&#39;s not waste any more lives,

134
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:50,727
because once we know

135
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:56,049
that abilities are capable of such growth,

136
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:02,498
it becomes a basic human right for children, all children,

137
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:08,933
to live in places that create that growth,

138
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:15,041
to live in places filled with yet.

139
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,718
Thank you.

140
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:19,499
(Applause)
