0
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:09,849
- Despite what we have heard about

1
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:11,655
the dangers of multitasking,

2
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:14,441
it is something we all do and have always done.

3
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:16,855
Our amazingly flexible and multi-talented

4
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:19,196
human brain assures this.

5
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:21,362
We constantly do a host of things at once,

6
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:22,959
both mentally and physically,

7
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:25,479
consciously and unconsciously.

8
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,514
For example, we can drive a car

9
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:29,896
or ride a bike on a familiar road,

10
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,675
while at the same time carrying on

11
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:34,700
a meaningful conversation with someone next to us.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,551
Or we can cook a delicious meal

13
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:38,618
and simultaneously help our child

14
00:00:38,618 --> 00:00:40,830
brainstorm a science project.

15
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,374
Even more impressively, we can read a novel

16
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:46,800
and readily immerse ourselves in its story.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,493
Yet we don't even realize the complexity of what we're doing

18
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:52,325
in terms of unconsciously decoding words,

19
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:54,749
instantaneously comprehending their meaning,

20
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:57,029
and then weaving them into a coherent narrative

21
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:59,874
that often inspires and moves us.

22
00:00:59,874 --> 00:01:01,377
Without this natural ability

23
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:03,996
to do a myriad of tasks at the same time,

24
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:07,409
we simply wouldn't get much done, even in basic ways.

25
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,905
To multitask is part of what it means to be human.

26
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,247
That's why it won't work to tell our students,

27
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:14,591
don't multitask.

28
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,558
It simply doesn't make sense to them,

29
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:18,947
and they can't help but do it anyway.

30
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:21,022
That said, there is little doubt

31
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:24,156
that the allure and possibilities for multitasking

32
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:28,001
are much different today than just 10 or 15 years ago.

33
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,985
This is because of the now almost pervasive availability

34
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:32,772
of our students' digital devices

35
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:34,769
to interrupt their thoughts.

36
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,649
As we all know, most of our kids spend a lot of time

37
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:39,350
attending to these devices

38
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,468
for social, entertainment, and learning purposes.

39
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,115
We also consider what this means

40
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:46,734
for their well-being and growth,

41
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:51,001
but we will focus on the cognitive implications here.

42
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,570
What we want to think about is how we can help our students

43
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,982
manage the almost boundless multitasking opportunities

44
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,785
now available to them,

45
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,440
as it might influence their academics.

46
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,062
The key word in what I just said is manage.

47
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:06,379
How do we help them make thoughtful choices

48
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,050
about when multitasking might be okay,

49
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,303
and when it will be detrimental to their learning?

50
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:14,256
Some of the confusion and controversies

51
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,905
surrounding multitasking

52
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:19,095
stem from differences in what we mean by the word.

53
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:21,006
For our purposes, we will focus

54
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:23,044
mostly in the cognitive realm.

55
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:25,754
So physical processes involved in multitasking,

56
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,858
like bike riding or driving a car,

57
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,052
won't be part of our discussion.

58
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:32,162
Most cognitive scientists will tell you

59
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:33,990
that it is virtually impossible

60
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,650
for the average person to perform

61
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,615
even two moderately complex mental processes simultaneously.

62
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,452
The only way it can happen

63
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:45,359
is when one of the processes has been automatized

64
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:47,726
through repeated practice.

65
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:51,247
The reading example earlier exemplifies that.

66
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:53,975
Usually what we do when we appear to multitask

67
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:56,512
is actually to task switch.

68
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,832
That means we switch from one task to the other

69
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:02,778
over a relatively short period of time.

70
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:05,208
Even with tasks involving different modalities,

71
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,750
like seeing and hearing,

72
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,587
unless one of those tasks is automatized,

73
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:12,298
task switching must still occur.

74
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:13,405
And it's in the switching

75
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:15,866
where the cost of multitasking can come.

76
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:18,214
Every time we switch from one task to another,

77
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,847
we must attend to the different goal and rules

78
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,109
for the completion of each task.

79
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:25,309
This means, as we switch from task to task,

80
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:29,021
a new goal and a new set of rules come into play.

81
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:30,689
The more complicated the task,

82
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,113
typically the more complicated the rules and goals.

83
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,767
This almost invariably slows things down,

84
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,844
sometimes by a lot,

85
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,608
and the two tasks take longer to accomplish

86
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:43,127
switching back and forth

87
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:48,064
than if done alone to completion one after the other.

88
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:49,588
Let's try to illustrate this

89
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:52,304
with a simple example shown here.

90
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:55,713
- One two three four five six seven eight nine 10.

91
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,380
A B C D E F G H I J.

92
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,773
A one, B two, C three, D four,

93
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:05,329
E five, F six, G seven, H eight,

94
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:08,217
I nine, J 10.

95
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:13,680
- One two three four five six seven eight nine 10.

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,347
A B C D E F G H I J.

97
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:19,474
A one, B two, C three, D four.

98
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:26,783
- One two three four five six seven eight nine 10.

99
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:28,450
A B C D E F G H I J.

100
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:32,736
A one, B two, C three, D four,

101
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:33,903
E five, F six,

102
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,017
G seven, H eight,

103
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:40,867
I nine, J 10.

104
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:45,898
- It was clear that saying the numbers

105
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:48,521
and then the letters separately in sequence

106
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,745
was fast and easy.

107
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:52,414
Just as clear to you, I'm sure,

108
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:54,342
was the fact that when we interleaved,

109
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,005
it took much longer to say the numbers and letters,

110
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,675
and that the accuracy of the performance also suffered.

111
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,230
This is because people had to switch goals,

112
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,342
get to 10, and get to J,

113
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:07,834
as well as rules, go in sequence,

114
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:10,611
begin with one, and begin with A.

115
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,336
This is exactly what happens when a student multitasks

116
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:16,049
doing his science homework while responding

117
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,347
to incoming text messages on his smartphone.

118
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:20,584
The goals and strategies

119
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,545
for effectively completing a science reading

120
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,882
are much different than for the intentions and social rules

121
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:28,419
in answering texts from different people.

122
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,503
As he switches from task to task,

123
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:33,654
new goals and rules have to be brought into working memory

124
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:35,667
to reengage with the task.

125
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,274
No wonder it takes longer.

126
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:40,994
Depending on the complexity of the tasks involved,

127
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:43,274
and the time available to complete them,

128
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:45,618
performance can also suffer.

129
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:48,046
But we do need to be careful before we generalize

130
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:49,470
this simple understanding

131
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,912
about multitasking's time and performance costs.

132
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:55,633
Know this that we asked people to do our exercise

133
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,373
as fast as they could.

134
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,578
In other words, we put time constraints

135
00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:01,636
on the completion of the tasks.

136
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,276
This makes sense because in real life

137
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,905
we often have limited time

138
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:08,120
to complete multiple tasks we have to accomplish.

139
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,223
But what if we don't have to worry so much about time?

140
00:06:11,223 --> 00:06:13,635
In other words, it's okay to take longer,

141
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:16,741
just as each task is completed effectively.

142
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:19,421
In our previous example, it would be like telling folks

143
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,154
that there was no time limit

144
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:23,771
on interleaving the numbers and letters.

145
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,600
In this case, they would undoubtedly

146
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,236
slow down and take longer,

147
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:31,593
but also probably make fewer mistakes.

148
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:33,122
In fact, most people,

149
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:35,593
when they slow down doing this exercise,

150
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:38,237
they can complete it flawlessly.

151
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:41,431
So the tasks get done, and they get done well.

152
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:44,819
Under these conditions, multitasking works fine.

153
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,892
But there are a couple of key qualifications

154
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:48,353
we need to make.

155
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:50,083
The first is that the ability to switch

156
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,866
from one task to another

157
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:54,366
should be under the control of the learner

158
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:58,024
in order for this form of multitasking to work well.

159
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:00,757
Studying alone, or responding to text messages,

160
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,563
could be an example.

161
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:05,424
Assuming the learner can ignore the notification sound,

162
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,190
she can decide when to respond to the texts,

163
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,016
and therefore control the switching

164
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:12,785
in ways it makes sense for her learning.

165
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:15,680
That ability to control the timing of the interruption

166
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,336
is important.

167
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,072
On the other hand, responding to questions from a peer

168
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,475
sitting next to you while studying is more problematic.

169
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:25,198
The unpredictable interruptions

170
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:27,507
can negatively influence learning,

171
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:29,217
which happens to be one of the challenges

172
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:31,750
of unstructured group studying.

173
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,885
Another qualification has to do with

174
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:36,452
the difficulty of the tasks involved.

175
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:38,842
The more difficult the tasks, the more likely it will be

176
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:42,490
that extended and concentrated focus will be required

177
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,751
to effectively complete the task.

178
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,708
Switching back and forth by multitasking

179
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,005
will likely compromise this.

180
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,586
For example, reading a history assignment

181
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:54,274
for comprehension of simple factual information

182
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,524
is different from a history assignment requiring

183
00:07:56,524 --> 00:08:00,656
higher order thinking, like synthesis or evaluation.

184
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:03,215
It would probably be much harder to multitask

185
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:06,407
while trying to do the challenging history assignment.

186
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,692
So how can we summarize this brief foray

187
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:11,312
into the complexities of multitasking?

188
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:13,510
An important reality check is that

189
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,508
our students are going to multitask,

190
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:17,559
almost no matter what we say.

191
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,581
In addition, if we try to

192
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:21,763
severely restrict them from doing it,

193
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:23,880
it may cause them so much anxiety

194
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,037
that it will negatively impact their learning.

195
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:29,905
This doesn't mean we surrender to the multitasking wars

196
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,668
of their digital world,

197
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:32,948
but it does mean we acknowledge

198
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,944
that multitasking will happen,

199
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:39,555
and it could be useful at times, especially motivationally.

200
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:42,109
Our role therefore, is to help them understand

201
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:45,113
when multitasking and digital technology used

202
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:46,282
is appropriate,

203
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:49,706
and when it may significantly interfere with their learning.

204
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:51,412
We need to help them learn how to make

205
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,527
thoughtful choices and manage it.

206
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,514
This means teaching them the meta-cognitive

207
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:58,592
and self-regulation skills to make this happen.

208
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:01,872
We'll be talking more about this in a later session.

209
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:04,284
In sum, what do we want our students

210
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:06,898
to understand about multitasking?

211
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:08,656
First, they need to realize that

212
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:11,096
multitasking costs them time.

213
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:12,978
It's invariably inefficient,

214
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:15,265
and they need to know that if they do it,

215
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:18,316
whatever they're doing is going to take longer.

216
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,942
So if time is limited,

217
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,480
multitasking will likely hurt their performances

218
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,413
because of being rushed or not finishing.

219
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,745
The other possible consequence is that they will end up

220
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:30,893
spending extra time doing the tasks reasonably well,

221
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:32,876
and later they will pay the price.

222
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,932
Sleep loss is the most common result.

223
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:38,710
On the other hand, if there are circumstances

224
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,386
when time is less pressing,

225
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:42,360
then multitasking might be okay,

226
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,536
especially if they control when to switch tasks.

227
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:46,948
They pace the task switching

228
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:49,807
in ways it makes sense for their own learning.

229
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:52,504
Otherwise, time and performance problems will be amplified

230
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:56,396
because of the costs of unpredictable interruptions.

231
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,759
Finally, if the quality of task completion is important,

232
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,155
or the task is especially challenging,

233
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:04,955
then simply not multitasking is key.

234
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:07,691
As hard as that will be, focusing singularly

235
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,739
on these high priority or difficult tasks is the way to go.

236
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:15,405
In other words, avoid multitasking for important things

237
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:19,572
that need to get done well, especially if time is limited.
