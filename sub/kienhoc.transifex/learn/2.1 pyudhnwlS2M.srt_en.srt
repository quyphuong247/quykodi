00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:11,221
- As teachers, we spend a good deal of time

1
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,461
thinking about what we want students to learn

2
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:15,244
and ways to teach them.

3
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:17,891
Our goal is to ensure their learning proves useful

4
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:20,731
and enduring beyond our classrooms.

5
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,897
Our previous session focused on how we make, store,

6
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:25,757
and retrieve memories.

7
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:28,581
Recall that learning is mostly about changes

8
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,806
in long-term memory, so effective teaching

9
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:34,303
is about making that happen.

10
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:36,941
This is why our focus up to now has largely been

11
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:39,506
on the intellectual and cognitive.

12
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,791
We&#39;ve discussed how the mind works to make sense

13
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,365
of what&#39;s happening in school, in order to learn the skills,

14
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:50,350
knowledge, and dispositions we want all students to possess.

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,804
How children learn in that cognitive sense

16
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:55,942
is what any successful teacher works to understand

17
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:59,703
and translate into useful teaching strategies,

18
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:01,887
but it&#39;s never easy.

19
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,620
We&#39;ve all taught students whom we&#39;ve given

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,874
lots of feedback and encouraged, cared for, worried about,

21
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:11,145
and who still seem to struggle to learn.

22
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:13,943
These same students frequently work hard,

23
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:17,415
but success remains fleeting, their motivation drops,

24
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:19,975
and then begins that self-amplifying spiral

25
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:23,523
of lowered expectations, diminished confidence,

26
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:25,592
and falling behind.

27
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:29,472
Now, many factors can cause this kind of negative cycle.

28
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:31,910
As a teacher, I know all too well the day-to-day

29
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,944
challenges kids face.

30
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:37,166
It can be heartbreaking to watch, and cognitive science

31
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,736
in the psychology of learning can&#39;t fix every case.

32
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:43,891
That said, research is now revealing what our most

33
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:46,781
effective teachers have long known,

34
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:49,945
psychological and social considerations,

35
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:53,614
what are frequently called non-cognitive factors,

36
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,470
can powerfully influence student motivation,

37
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,516
and therefore their learning.

38
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,747
What&#39;s more, these non-cognitive factors

39
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,774
can disproportionally affect students

40
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:06,034
who are not thriving in some way.

41
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:08,696
Now, the really exciting thing about this research

42
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:11,953
is that it demonstrates how relatively small strategies

43
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:15,107
we can bring to our classrooms can make significant

44
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:17,417
differences in our students&#39; learning

45
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,971
and academic well-being.

46
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:22,887
So, let&#39;s quickly introduce the non-cognitive factors

47
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:25,681
we&#39;ll be learning about in the following units.

48
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,647
You can learn more about this subject than we&#39;ll cover here

49
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:31,811
in the literature citations in our resources section.

50
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:34,749
You&#39;ll find some really useful articles there.

51
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:37,428
Here are five statements that represent student

52
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:41,029
mindsets or beliefs that capture the essence of the most

53
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:45,148
important non-cognitive factors affecting learning.

54
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:49,315
My ability and competence grow with my effective effort.

55
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,754
I belong in this community.

56
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,940
This work has value for me.

57
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:59,557
I can succeed at this.

58
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:03,697
Meaningful learning requires struggle, confusion,

59
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:05,873
and even mistakes.

60
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:08,069
That&#39;s a pretty simple set of statements,

61
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,551
but it&#39;s richly informative in so many ways

62
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:12,285
for our students&#39; learning.

63
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:14,968
Notice that they don&#39;t reflect skills or knowledge

64
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:19,505
in a classic cognitive sense, they are beliefs

65
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:23,201
and values that students develop about themselves

66
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,705
and their own intelligence, their feelings about school

67
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:30,794
and what causes success, the quality of their relationships

68
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,157
with peers and adults, and their understanding

69
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:38,344
about the very nature of what it means to learn.

70
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,614
These mindsets can be important motivators for students,

71
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:43,706
both to learn and to develop habits

72
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:46,519
that will promote their learning in school.

73
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,670
Our role is to help them develop these mindsets

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,899
in meaningful ways.

75
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:55,062
Now the first step in this process is to understand

76
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:57,966
how students are experiencing and approaching

77
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:00,333
their time at school.

78
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,951
In other words, what are they thinking

79
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,545
as they sit in our classroom?

80
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,759
They might be wondering, am I prepared enough?

81
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,185
Will people accept me for who I am?

82
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:13,154
Am I the only one struggling?

83
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:15,131
How will I fit in?

84
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,455
Am I smart enough?

85
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:20,035
Different students can experience the same classroom

86
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:22,863
environment in vastly different ways,

87
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,673
which in turn can affect their learning.

88
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:28,663
This is why being mindful of the non-cognitive factors

89
00:04:28,663 --> 00:04:32,771
that influence learning is so crucial for us.

90
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:36,429
Now, taking the student&#39;s perspective can go a long way

91
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:40,125
in helping us help them develop the mindsets

92
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,075
they need to succeed in school.

93
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:47,975
As we&#39;ll see, mindsets alone don&#39;t assure academic success.

94
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:50,751
Our biggest challenge is to ensure these mindsets

95
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:53,845
and beliefs are translated into positive

96
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:57,124
and real impacts on school performance through

97
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:59,871
the development of effective learning strategies

98
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:02,621
and other self-regulatory skills.
