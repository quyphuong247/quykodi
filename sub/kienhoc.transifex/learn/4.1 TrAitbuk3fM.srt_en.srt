00:00:07,997 --> 00:00:09,732
- How should the research about the science

1
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:12,286
of learning inform the way we teach?

2
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:13,946
How do we help students learn

3
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:16,013
the most important skills and knowledge

4
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:17,380
we hope they leave our classrooms

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,108
possessing and able to use?

6
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:22,047
How can we make learning enjoyable

7
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,922
while at the same time designing experiences

8
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:26,788
that challenge students to struggle

9
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:29,596
in the way we know deep learning requires?

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,032
Building on previous sessions in this course,

11
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,714
we&#39;re going to present a variety of teaching strategies

12
00:00:34,714 --> 00:00:37,593
and mindsets based on the science of learning.

13
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:39,256
We hope these strategies will help further

14
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:42,341
your understanding of these important questions.

15
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:44,570
We&#39;ll begin by doing a brief review

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,334
of a few of the important principles of learning

17
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:49,609
we discussed in previous sessions.

18
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:51,026
We&#39;ll help contextualize it using

19
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:54,718
our simple multi-store model of how memory works.

20
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:56,749
One of the key ideas we discussed

21
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:59,106
is that, to make memories that stick,

22
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:01,823
our students need to think to learn.

23
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:03,576
This is a truism of learning.

24
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:06,571
Students remember what they&#39;ve been thinking about.

25
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,787
As the cognitive scientist Daniel Willingham says,

26
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:12,260
&quot;Memory is the residue of thought.&quot;

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,977
In terms of our memory model, this means creating

28
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:18,634
a dialog between working memory and long-term memory.

29
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:21,351
The more we get students to cognitively process

30
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:23,545
what it is we want them to learn,

31
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:26,633
especially if we spread out the learning over time,

32
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,096
the more likely they&#39;ll be able

33
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,198
to recall and use it later.

34
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:32,554
This is because thinking in this way will link

35
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:36,246
the newly learned to what&#39;s already stored in our memory.

36
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:39,985
Not only do we want to create a memory residue that remains,

37
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:42,469
we also want it to be embedded meaningfully

38
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,279
in the prior knowledge that students posses.

39
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,996
As teachers, we help advance learning

40
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:51,589
by what we have the students do to learn.

41
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:54,677
This also means that learning shouldn&#39;t be too easy,

42
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:57,069
as much as we&#39;d like to make it so.

43
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:59,019
Struggle, and even confusion,

44
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,898
are important for making lasting memories.

45
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:05,184
We talked earlier about how to challenge students

46
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,656
while at the same time assuring them

47
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:08,806
we believe they can succeed.

48
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:10,757
The scaffolding and support we provide them

49
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:14,814
both cognitively and emotionally are there for a key.

50
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:17,786
We also emphasized that an important mindset

51
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:19,576
for students&#39; success is believing

52
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:23,712
they can increase their ability with effort and hard work.

53
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:26,380
And recall we emphasized that the quality

54
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,961
of their hard work counts.

55
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,399
It&#39;s crucial that their effort be effective

56
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,466
in moving their learning forward.

57
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,942
Hard work alone is not enough.

58
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:38,689
This is why giving students feedback is so important.

59
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,918
However, research shows that much

60
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:42,752
of the feedback provided in schools

61
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:45,759
is not very effective in helping students learn.

62
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,779
We all want our young learners

63
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:50,740
to close the gap between where we want them to be

64
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,690
and where they are with regard

65
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,722
to important skills and knowledge,

66
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:57,242
but how we close that understanding gap

67
00:02:57,242 --> 00:03:00,608
is not always easy for the diverse array of kids we teach.

68
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:03,778
In the next session we&#39;ll talk about important aspects

69
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:05,865
of effective feedback that are needed

70
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:07,978
to move student learning forward.

71
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:11,136
As a preview, one important but often neglected

72
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:12,680
feedback principle we&#39;ll focus on

73
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,302
is this: the only thing that matters about feedback

74
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:18,969
is what the students do with it.
