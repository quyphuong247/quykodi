0
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:11,176
- We are learning virtually all of the time.

1
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:14,095
From the moment we are born, throughout our lives,

2
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:15,900
and even in our sleep.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,935
If we watch a baby or a toddler interact with the world

4
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,832
around them, we see them constantly trying to make meaning

5
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:25,159
of sensory patterns in their environment,

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:29,159
consciously or unconsciously asking how and why.

7
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:32,672
What do we mean by learning?

8
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:35,047
While there are many definitions of learning,

9
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:37,711
Robert Sternberg, a cognitive scientist,

10
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:41,046
provides one that is clear and concise.

11
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:45,439
He says, &quot;Learning is any relatively permanent change

12
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,052
&quot;in the behavior, thoughts, or feelings of an organism

13
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:51,327
&quot;that results from experience.&quot;

14
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:54,042
Notice Sternberg mentions not only that learning

15
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:57,369
is reflected in visible behaviors and actions,

16
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:00,123
but learning is also reflected through changes

17
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:03,609
in interior thoughts and feelings that are indiscernible

18
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,834
by the outside observer.

19
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:09,343
And this is one of the biggest challenges of teaching,

20
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:11,854
trying to figure out what our students have learned

21
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:14,906
so we can respond accordingly.

22
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:19,219
Learning takes on many forms and occurs in many settings.

23
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:23,107
For instance, one form of learning called implicit learning

24
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:25,992
develops without our necessarily being aware

25
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,387
of its happening.

26
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,223
Examples would be first language acquisition,

27
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,973
and learning social norms a cues.

28
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:36,253
Much of what we learn in school, however,

29
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:38,391
is explicit learning.

30
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:40,938
In order for explicit learning to happen,

31
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:43,459
we have to consciously attend to learning

32
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,428
and make memories for later recall.

33
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:49,965
Learning develops in different contexts or settings.

34
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:54,271
In fact, learning often happens in informal situations:

35
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:58,985
on the playground, at home, in museums, and often with peers

36
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:03,420
during various forms of recreation and related activities.

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,029
Learning, of course, also occurs more formally.

38
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:10,148
Formal learning occurs in structured educational settings

39
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:12,419
like schools and colleges.

40
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,765
Our focus in this course mostly will be on explicit

41
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:19,731
and formal learning in schools.

42
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:22,441
Explicit formal learning is not always easy

43
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:26,103
for children to do, since they are most naturally inclined

44
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:29,594
to learn implicitly in informal settings.

45
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:34,039
Learning to read or write or think about abstract concepts

46
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,746
like metaphors, multiplication, Newton&#39;s Laws,

47
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:41,146
or dangling participles, is not usually intrinsically

48
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:43,446
motivating to most kids.

49
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:46,605
That is, kids don&#39;t usually gravitate to this kind of

50
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:48,618
learning on their own.

51
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:51,203
Additionally, many students don&#39;t find learning

52
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,075
within the confines of four walls of a classroom

53
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:57,919
for extended periods of time consistently alluring.

54
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,527
As a result, motivating a child to pay attention

55
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:04,781
and learn in school is often a challenge,

56
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,441
as any teacher will tell you.

57
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:10,558
Another reality of school learning is that deep thinking

58
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:13,430
is not something we usually do just for fun

59
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,313
or even naturally.

60
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:18,436
Cognitive scientist Daniel Willingham speaks to this

61
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:21,331
when he says, &quot;People&#39;s minds are not

62
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:23,711
&quot;especially well-suited to thinking.

63
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:28,173
&quot;Thinking is slow, effortful, and uncertain.&quot;

64
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:32,233
This means we tend to automatically rely on past habits

65
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:36,043
and memories to guide our actions, and are less likely

66
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:39,112
to think deliberately and deeply.

67
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:42,513
To further complicate matters, struggle and confusion

68
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,165
are usually necessary for deep and transformative learning

69
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:49,806
to happen, something that many students tend to avoid

70
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:52,317
or incorrectly interpret as a sign of

71
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:55,072
their ineffectiveness as learners.

72
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:57,485
We&#39;ll talk more about this later.

73
00:03:57,485 --> 00:04:00,316
It&#39;s no surprise then that teaching is

74
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:03,634
an incredibly difficult and demanding profession.

75
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:06,579
Lee Shulman, who for years headed the Carnegie Center

76
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,497
For Teaching And Learning, and spent his career

77
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:12,893
researching expertise in medical doctors and K through 12

78
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:17,076
teachers, said this near the end of his career,

79
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:20,810
&quot;I have concluded that classroom teaching is perhaps

80
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,645
&quot;the most complex, most challenging, and most demanding,

81
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:29,071
&quot;subtle, nuanced, and frightening activity

82
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:32,019
&quot;that our species has ever invented.&quot;

83
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,699
Daunting, yes, but reflective teachers all over the world

84
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,682
have been addressing these challenges for a long time.

85
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:41,725
So why are we here?

86
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:44,743
Cognitive science research about how people learn,

87
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,114
what we are calling science of learning,

88
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:50,806
has been going on for well over half a century,

89
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:53,800
but it is only relatively recently that this research

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,783
has reached a point where it can powerfully inform

91
00:04:56,783 --> 00:05:00,474
the day to day practice of any classroom teacher.

92
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:03,402
The really exciting aspect of this research

93
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:05,872
is that it can help students develop deeper

94
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,162
and more enduring understanding

95
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:10,530
of our important learning goals.

96
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,189
At the same time, developing such durable understanding

97
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,830
makes it more likely that students will be able

98
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,530
to use and apply that understanding to their lives

99
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,577
well beyond school.

100
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:25,568
And that&#39;s for all learners, not just the ones

101
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,707
who might struggle the most.

102
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:30,863
Finally, while our focus in this course

103
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,721
is on the science of teaching, it almost goes without saying

104
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:38,048
that effective teaching is also about much more

105
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,953
than the insights provided by cognitive science.

106
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:45,453
There is a creativity, empathy, an art to what we do

107
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:49,028
as we respond in the moment to a child before us.

108
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:52,275
No amount of science will replace the fundamentally

109
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:55,313
relational quality of great teaching.

110
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,094
This course, in providing an introduction

111
00:05:58,094 --> 00:06:00,429
to the science of learning and the brain,

112
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:04,409
aims however, to allow educators to develop knowledge

113
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:08,062
that puts their art and conversation with the robust science

114
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:11,358
of learning, all towards more deliberately impacting

115
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:13,660
the learners in their classes.

116
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,073
With that said, we&#39;re ready to begin.

117
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:20,156
Let&#39;s start with how we make and recall memories.
