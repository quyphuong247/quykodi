00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,798
- What are some effective learning strategies for students?

1
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:14,430
Research in cognitive science has identified three

2
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,541
that are particularly useful and easy

3
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,475
for students to apply.

4
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:21,889
They are retrieval practice, spaced practice

5
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,632
and interleaving.

6
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:25,708
The nice thing is that with some planning,

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,001
they all are also easy for our students

8
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,661
to learn and use.

9
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:32,078
Recall that learning we can transfer

10
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:33,715
beyond the immediate involves not only

11
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:36,905
encoding memories but also retrieving them.

12
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:39,717
All three of these strategies, to varying degrees,

13
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:42,567
involve getting information into students&#39; heads

14
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:44,499
as well as getting it out.

15
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:47,205
We&#39;ll begin with retrieval practice.

16
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:49,986
Retrieval practice involves calling information

17
00:00:49,986 --> 00:00:54,153
to mind that&#39;s been stored previously in long-term memory.

18
00:00:57,487 --> 00:01:00,129
When we say calling information to mind,

19
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:02,811
we mean bringing it into working memory.

20
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:05,411
Before we go any further, let&#39;s review the model

21
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:09,578
of memory we have developed previously in this course.

22
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,960
It&#39;s important to understand that we encode memories

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,395
through the dialogue between working memory

24
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:19,420
and long-term memory.

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,085
We previously used the phrase you have to think

26
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:25,644
to learn with regard to memory formation.

27
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:28,133
That&#39;s what active learning is all about.

28
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:31,164
Importantly, and perhaps not immediately apparent,

29
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:33,284
an active memory retrieval can actually

30
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:36,221
improve memory and boost learning.

31
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,799
For example, if a student is assigned a reading

32
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,970
as a homework assignment, they often highlight

33
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,750
or annotate the text or take notes,

34
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,910
then they may reread their highlights or notes

35
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,479
or maybe even reread the assignment.

36
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,360
But cognitive scientists would urge

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,513
us to reconsider this strategy.

38
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,289
They have found a far more effective way

39
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:58,212
to improve memory and learning through retrieval practice.

40
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:01,156
Retrieval practice involves the following:

41
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,786
after students read an assignment for the first time

42
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:06,712
and take notes, they would put the notes away,

43
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,014
and try to recall the most important ideas

44
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:11,336
and information they wrote down.

45
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:13,979
Or if they annotated their text, they would

46
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,965
keep the book closed and try to remember

47
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:18,117
what they annotated and why.

48
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,982
They could do both of these by trying to write

49
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:23,000
down what they retrieved, talk out loud to themselves

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,833
or someone else, sketch something or simply

51
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,511
think about it in their head.

52
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:29,560
That is, in their working memory.

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,468
Then they would go back to their text, notes

54
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:35,290
or annotations and see how accurate and complete

55
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,112
their retrieval practice was.

56
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:40,475
Trying to simply recall information is a lot

57
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:44,232
harder than rereading a text or looking at notes,

58
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:46,528
but it&#39;s precisely that struggle to recall

59
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:48,773
that improves our memory.

60
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:51,143
How does retrieval practice work?

61
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:53,076
Well, at least in four ways.

62
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:56,106
First, as we indicated, the act of retrieving

63
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:58,310
a memory modifies it.

64
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,222
We don&#39;t store memories like little video

65
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,775
and audio files.

66
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,766
Instead, when we retrieve a memory of any complexity,

67
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:07,209
we actually construct it from the memory traces

68
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,648
that constituted it when it was first made.

69
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,827
This means by struggling to retrieve a memory,

70
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:18,165
we usually strengthen it, since it&#39;s being reassembled.

71
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,178
Second, when we go searching for a memory

72
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:23,134
without the outside retrieval cues of our notes

73
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:26,048
or the text or a teacher&#39;s prompt, we&#39;re usually

74
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:29,931
creating a new retrieval pathway to find that memory.

75
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:31,800
That means the next time we can rely on our

76
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,915
own retrieval cues to find it, not some outside source.

77
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,211
Third, by searching for the memory, we&#39;re also likely

78
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:42,059
to activate related information, and this can

79
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:44,677
organize and create links in ways that might

80
00:03:44,677 --> 00:03:48,570
make it easier to retrieve the target information next time.

81
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,673
It&#39;s sort of like going into a storage room

82
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:52,600
and looking for something, and in the process,

83
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,305
you tidy things up a bit.

84
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:58,090
Fourth, when a student fails to retrieve the intended

85
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,962
information, this failure is actually useful.

86
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:04,652
It points out missing or inaccessible information

87
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:08,030
that needs to be remediated with further study.

88
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,917
All of this strengthens the memory and makes

89
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,276
it more likely to be retrieved in the future.

90
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:16,331
Retrieval of memories is therefore a learning event

91
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,505
and considerably more powerful than rereading notes

92
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:21,931
or highlights or annotations.

93
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,871
The most important reason for this is that

94
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:26,966
simply rereading our notes, the retrieval cues

95
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,723
come from those outside sources themselves,

96
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:31,796
and there&#39;s much less struggle, therefore,

97
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:33,643
to find the information.

98
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,384
This makes it seem easier.

99
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:38,084
There&#39;s less struggle, but the unfortunate result

100
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,593
is that this ease of recognition makes us feel

101
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:43,942
like we&#39;re learning more, when in fact, we&#39;re learning less,

102
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:46,804
especially in a long-term way.

103
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:49,172
The research is very clear about this for learners

104
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:51,895
of all ages and is most pronounced for memories

105
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:55,544
we want to retrieve weeks or months later.

106
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:57,813
A few suggestions and caveats before we move

107
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,350
on to the next learning strategy.

108
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,846
First, it&#39;s important that students receive

109
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:05,511
feedback about the accuracy and completeness

110
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,662
of their retrieval practice.

111
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:09,486
This feedback can come through discussion

112
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:12,846
with the teacher, through teacher-provided answer keys,

113
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,980
from peers or by students referring back to their own

114
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,948
notes, annotations and readings.

115
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:21,480
Another important aspect of retrieval practice

116
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,297
is that it shouldn&#39;t be graded.

117
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:24,985
It&#39;s a learning strategy that you want

118
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:27,952
to encourage your students to use whenever they can.

119
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,838
By grading it, the anxiety and other performance

120
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,072
issues become attached to what should be

121
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:35,911
a remarkably effective and flexible formative

122
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:37,879
tool for learning.

123
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,832
In fact, retrieval practice reduces test anxiety

124
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:44,635
because students become used to and more confident

125
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,637
retrieving what they know from their memory.

126
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:49,605
It&#39;s also important that students have something

127
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,890
in memory to retrieve in the first place.

128
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,058
If they don&#39;t know how to strategically read,

129
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:56,159
for example, they may come into class

130
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,666
with very little in their memory.

131
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,890
This means knowing how to create an ongoing

132
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,978
dialogue between working memory and long-term memory

133
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:07,084
as they do homework and classwork.

134
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:10,036
Finally, done appropriately, retrieval practice

135
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,541
is difficult and involves struggle.

136
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,474
We need to let students know that this struggle is good.

137
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:17,645
Struggle and even confusion are signs

138
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:20,273
that learning is going on, as long as you have

139
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:23,032
created a supportive and feedback-rich environment

140
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:24,906
for them to learn in.

141
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,872
If I had one learning strategy to teach my students,

142
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,424
it would be retrieval practice.

143
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,613
Our students&#39; most common way to study,

144
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:35,004
and study habit surveys confirm this,

145
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:38,858
is called massed practice, or more vividly, cramming.

146
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,695
It usually involves students intensively studying,

147
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:44,574
often the night before, and then taking a test

148
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:47,569
or turning in a paper and hoping for the best.

149
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,013
As we mentioned earlier, the problem from a learning

150
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:52,050
standpoint is that it actually seems

151
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,958
to work much of the time.

152
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,451
Students will often do okay or even excellent

153
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:59,521
on the test, but sad to say, they don&#39;t remember

154
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,901
much a few weeks later.

155
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:06,098
In this way, an ineffective learning strategy is reinforced.

156
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:09,114
This is because cramming, or massed practice, doesn&#39;t

157
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:11,793
work for creating long-term memories.

158
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:14,991
Unless we as teachers place a high value on enduring

159
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:17,523
learning, it will be difficult to change this

160
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:20,234
practice in our schools.

161
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:22,428
One of the oldest and most powerful research

162
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:25,121
bases in cognitive science has to do with the opposite

163
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:28,767
of cramming, spaced or distributive practice.

164
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,939
Over a century ago, studies demonstrated

165
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,928
that spacing out learning sessions in shorter

166
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:36,285
intervals is a much better way to develop

167
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:37,868
long-term memories.

168
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,981
The reason that spaced practice works so well

169
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:50,097
for creating durable memories has several explanations.

170
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:51,653
The first is that it takes advantage

171
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:54,277
of the usefulness of retrieval practice.

172
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:56,494
The more often we practice recalling memories

173
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,815
from long-term memory, the easier we are

174
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:01,127
able to access it, and the more resistant

175
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,961
it becomes to forgetting.

176
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:06,229
In addition, each new retrieval probably occurs

177
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,364
in a different context, unlike massed practice,

178
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,043
which usually happens in the same context.

179
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,365
These varied contexts of distributed practices

180
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:17,117
also help with retrieval in terms of providing

181
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:20,036
alternative recall pathways.

182
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:23,878
Another important reason, as we discussed previously,

183
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,156
is the act of retrieval is an act

184
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:29,604
of memory modification and reorganization.

185
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:32,107
Each retrieval consolidates in new memories

186
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:33,875
and strengthens them.

187
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,004
This implications for our students are clear.

188
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:38,733
We need to help our students space their

189
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:40,371
learning when they study.

190
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,641
There are several questions that teachers often

191
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,824
ask about helping students develop the habit

192
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,941
of spaced practice.

193
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:50,228
First, how long should the spacing gaps be?

194
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,208
It mostly depends on how long you want students

195
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,071
to remember the material.

196
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:55,787
If the information needs to be remembered

197
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:59,203
for a short time, then shorter gaps make sense.

198
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,890
For longer retention times, involving months

199
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,270
or even years later, the longer the spaced

200
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,959
learning gaps the better.

201
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,212
That is, as long as the gaps aren&#39;t too long

202
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:11,322
so that significant forgetting occurs.

203
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:15,013
Next, how frequent should the spacing gaps be?

204
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,923
Within the limits of classroom and student

205
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,635
study time, the more the better.

206
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,731
It is simply the nature of how our memory works

207
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:24,313
that forgetting is going to happen.

208
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,503
We know from our own personal learning experience

209
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:29,458
as teachers, that the more we review something

210
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,989
over time, the more enduring and usable

211
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:36,065
the memories are, and the easier relearning becomes.

212
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:38,299
Finally, how can we help our students

213
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:40,957
practice spaced learning?

214
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:44,488
Besides our own distributed practice teaching strategies,

215
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:46,578
which we&#39;ll discuss in another session,

216
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:49,090
helping students plan and manage their time

217
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,381
so they can build in spaced learning events is key.

218
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:56,617
You can even embed this as part of your homework regiment.

219
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:58,482
However you do it, students will soon

220
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:00,877
find that spaced practice is a powerful way

221
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:02,563
to enhance their learning.

222
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,502
It takes no more time than cramming,

223
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:08,864
and it results in much better long-term results.

224
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:10,959
Our third highly effective learning strategy

225
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,618
for students is a variation of spaced practice

226
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:15,591
called interleaving.

227
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:17,950
This involves not only distributing practice

228
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,552
over time, but also changing the order

229
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:24,302
of materials studied across different topics.

230
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,506
As a consequence, an hour of homework

231
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:36,143
in three subjects becomes six 30-minute sessions,

232
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:39,060
alternating the different subjects.

233
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:44,362
It may seem harder or less useful at first glance,

234
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:47,058
but switching from one subject to another

235
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:49,290
combines the memory advantages of both

236
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,648
spaced practice and retrieval practice.

237
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:55,619
A few caveats about interleaving, however.

238
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:59,486
Don&#39;t switch too much or have intervals that are too short.

239
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:03,904
Twenty to 30-minute blocks are probably the shortest to use.

240
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:06,811
Otherwise, the negative aspects of multitasking,

241
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:10,427
as we&#39;ve discussed previously, can come into play.

242
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:13,022
In addition, being efficient in the transitions

243
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:15,842
between study bouts that are interleaved is key.

244
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,175
Much time can be lost if you&#39;re not careful.

245
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:22,077
Interleaving is the most complicated and counterintuitive

246
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:24,162
of our three learning strategies,

247
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:26,540
but once students try it, they will immediately

248
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,446
see its benefits.

249
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:30,553
This ends our examination of three highly

250
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:32,573
effective study strategies that our students

251
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:35,572
can use to become more effective learners.

252
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:36,979
We hope you will try these strategies

253
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:39,473
in the coming days with your class.

254
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:41,426
You will see in the next series of sessions

255
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:43,239
how we will use these same strategies

256
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:47,406
to design more effective learning experiences for students.
