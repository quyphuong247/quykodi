0
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:11,022
- Memory has been the subject of speculation and wonder

1
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:13,454
for at least two thousand years.

2
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:16,107
As early Greek philosophers pondered the workings

3
00:00:16,107 --> 00:00:17,799
of our minds.

4
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:21,363
And it has only been during the last 100 years or so

5
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:23,956
that we began to scientifically explore

6
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:27,615
the biological basis of memory involving neurons

7
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:30,973
and synapses in the brain, and they form and change

8
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:31,806
as we age.

9
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:35,617
This science of the brain has taken great leaps

10
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,788
forward recently with the development

11
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,233
of new imaging technologies

12
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:44,378
like functional magnetic resonance imagine, or fMRI.

13
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,077
But our study of memory in this course

14
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:49,936
will not involve the neuro-physiological aspects

15
00:00:49,936 --> 00:00:52,489
of learning because at this point that field

16
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,945
of study doesn&#39;t yet inform the day-to-day

17
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:56,823
practice of teachers.

18
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,478
Rather, we will be learning about the research

19
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:02,950
emerging from cognitive science which now powerfully

20
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,566
informs us about how we can teach and learn more effectively

21
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,947
So what is cognitive science?

22
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:13,096
It involves a variety of different research disciplines

23
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:17,821
including psychology, computer science, linguistics,

24
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,979
artificial intelligence, anthropology, neuroscience,

25
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,256
and philosophy, all striving to understand

26
00:01:25,256 --> 00:01:28,820
through interdisciplinary study how human cognition

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,796
and intelligence develops and shapes our behavior.

28
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:35,516
By studying human behavior and performance,

29
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:37,765
we can learn much about how memory works

30
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,961
and how deep learning occurs.

31
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:43,050
We&#39;ll begin our study of learning and memory

32
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,047
through the lens of cognitive science

33
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:47,815
by looking at a simple schematic model,

34
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:50,280
acknowledging up front that we&#39;re simplifying

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,604
an enormously complex and dynamic set of processes.

36
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:57,197
The model we will present is a modified version

37
00:01:57,197 --> 00:02:01,364
of that first published by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968.

38
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:05,025
Let&#39;s start by imagining a science teacher

39
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,445
introducing a lesson about food pyramids and energy flow

40
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:09,528
to her class.

41
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:13,979
As she talks and points to images on the Smart Board,

42
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,462
her students initially perceive this auditory and visual

43
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:20,342
information and store it temporarily in their

44
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,372
sensory registers.

45
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:26,100
Then if attended to by each student, this information

46
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,532
is moved into what&#39;s called short-term memory for processing

47
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:33,397
Short-term memory can be thought of as our immediate

48
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:36,779
consciousness of where we do our thinking and reasoning.

49
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:40,955
Short-term memory holds a limited amount of information

50
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:43,510
for only short periods of time.

51
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,210
Usually five to 30 seconds.

52
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,512
It is similar to what you might have heard before

53
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:52,777
as working memory and it can be overloaded.

54
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:55,010
This overload diminishes student learning,

55
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,749
something we&#39;ll discuss in later units.

56
00:02:57,749 --> 00:03:01,025
Next, depending on how the information is processed

57
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:04,478
in short-term memory, it may or may not be moved

58
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:08,237
into long-term memory for storage and later use.

59
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:10,273
An important set of questions we will be addressing

60
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,517
throughout this course is one, how can we help our students

61
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:18,875
make memories that are enduring and durable?

62
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,294
And two, how can we help our students make memories

63
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:26,252
that can be transferred to new situations later?

64
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:29,026
Now let&#39;s look in more detail at how the different

65
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:32,065
components of this model of memory work together

66
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:33,148
and interact.

67
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:37,989
Incoming environmental stimuli are picked up by our

68
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,471
senses and enter what are called our sensory registers.

69
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:45,490
Of course, we do not perceive most of the stimuli

70
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,197
in our environment.

71
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:50,583
For example, compared to other mammals, our human

72
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,660
auditory sensory range is somewhat limited,

73
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,747
as is our sense of smell.

74
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:58,540
But our capability to pick up visual information

75
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,362
in our environment is pretty good.

76
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:03,826
Whatever information we do sense then goes

77
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,418
into our sensory registers and remains

78
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:09,279
for only a very short time.

79
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:12,700
Usually measured in fractions of a second.

80
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,894
Then some small proportion of what our

81
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:17,634
senses perceive is attended to.

82
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:20,725
And we become aware of it in some conscious way.

83
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,106
Although we certainly perceive our surroundings

84
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:25,441
in important ways even without becoming

85
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,080
consciously aware.

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,403
For example, the tactile pressure of the chair

87
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:32,208
you might be sitting on right now.

88
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,180
This information filters or bottlenecks,

89
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,022
is what we call selective attention.

90
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:41,137
In other words, to become aware of sense information

91
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:43,833
from our surroundings, we must pay attention

92
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,176
to it some way in order to move it into

93
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:49,395
our short-term memory for processing.

94
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:52,994
It is crucial to manage our attention in this way.

95
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:55,497
Otherwise, the world would be as the famous

96
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:57,730
psychologist William James expressed it,

97
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,932
&quot;One great blooming, buzzing confusion.&quot;

98
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:03,669
This explains why two people can be in the same

99
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,853
sensory environment, yet experience that environment

100
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:10,254
in sometimes very different ways.

101
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,416
Now let&#39;s go back to our three students

102
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,086
sitting in the science class.

103
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:16,427
All three students will hopefully perceive

104
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:19,936
the teacher&#39;s voice and watch what she is doing.

105
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,516
At least, in the beginning.

106
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:23,838
So this information will enter into each of their

107
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:27,101
visual and auditory sensory registers.

108
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:30,611
What happens next is where things can go right

109
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,926
or wrong from the standpoint of teaching.

110
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:36,835
For example, one student may quickly become

111
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:40,854
engrossed in surreptitiously looking at her smart phone.

112
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:43,923
Another may initially attend to what the teacher is saying,

113
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:46,659
but then the picture of the lion prompts him

114
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,269
to remember seeing the movie The Lion King,

115
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:52,312
and he starts thinking about that.

116
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:54,546
The third student on the other hand,

117
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:58,774
does what we hope all of our students do most of the time.

118
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,597
Pays attention to the teacher, and actively

119
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:06,563
engages what is being taught, in this case by taking notes.

120
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:09,430
For the cell phone using student, there is probably

121
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,146
very little if anything of what the teacher

122
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:15,058
is doing that enters into the conscious awareness

123
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:17,309
of her short-term memory.

124
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:20,189
This student may vaguely sense the teacher talking

125
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:24,848
but she is not comprehending her in any meaningful way.

126
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:27,042
This is because the student&#39;s attention is focused

127
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,133
on the smart phone.

128
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:32,353
However, she is paying attention and processing something

129
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:36,134
in her short term memory, but it&#39;s the wrong thing.

130
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:39,265
The information on her smart phone.

131
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,504
The second student also ends up attending very little

132
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:45,328
to what the teacher is doing because his focus

133
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:48,154
is on the thinking about The Lion King.

134
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:51,183
He&#39;s paying virtually no attention to his surrounding

135
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:54,384
environment but he is attending and cognitively

136
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:57,349
processing in short-term memory the memories

137
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:01,489
he is retrieving from long-term memory about the movie.

138
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:04,385
Both students are paying attention and processing

139
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:08,831
incoming information, but with regard to the wrong things.

140
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:12,754
Despite their attentiveness, for our purposes as teachers,

141
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:15,504
they are distracted and off task.

142
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:19,741
As a quick aside, we&#39;ll talk in week three about

143
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:23,069
self-regulated learning and discuss different forms

144
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,337
of student inattention and distraction

145
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:27,476
and how to minimize them.

146
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:29,943
We&#39;ll even make the case that mind-wandering

147
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:32,446
can sometimes be a good thing for the learners

148
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:34,548
in our classroom.

149
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:36,814
For now let&#39;s go back to our model student

150
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:39,088
paying attention to the teacher.

151
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:42,265
She is no doubt processing in short-term memory

152
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:46,008
what the teacher is conveying by taking notes.

153
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:50,559
But here&#39;s an important insight from a learning standpoint.

154
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:53,531
At the end of her time paying attention to her teacher

155
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:56,479
and taking notes, the student may have either

156
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,614
learned very little or possibly a lot.

157
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:02,814
It will mostly depend on how deeply she was able

158
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:06,255
to cognitively process what her teacher was presenting

159
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:07,088
and doing.

160
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:11,528
In other words, was the student able to meaningfully

161
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:15,353
link the new information with what she already knew?

162
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,408
Her prior knowledge.

163
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,568
This will be determined by how much she actively

164
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:22,486
and consciously reaches into her long-term memory

165
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:25,760
from her short-term memory to retrieve and think about

166
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,720
what she is seeing and hearing from the teacher.

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,363
This dialogue between short-term memory

168
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:35,972
and long-term memory is what will make and store

169
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:38,073
memories for this new learning.

170
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:42,045
This is the essence of active learning.

171
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:44,588
On the other hand, if a student mostly listens

172
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:47,104
and or watches in a learning environment

173
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:50,326
without being given the chance to actively process

174
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:52,955
new information, it likely won&#39;t stick

175
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,872
in the form of new and usable memories.

176
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:58,945
That&#39;s even if the students are rapt with attention

177
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:01,488
because most of their thinking and processing

178
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:05,226
will still be in short-term memory which soon decays

179
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:06,226
and is lost.

180
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:09,940
Unfortunately this happens too often in schools

181
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,385
when students aren&#39;t encouraged or required to actively

182
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:16,122
process what they are meant to be learning.

183
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,484
There are many ways to do this and we will

184
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:21,541
focus on this in later sessions.

185
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,337
Long-term memory is undoubtedly the most complex

186
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:27,550
component of our memory system,

187
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,487
so as educators, it is critically important

188
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,542
to understand the basics of how it works.

189
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:36,640
Something we&#39;ll do in the following sessions.

190
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,157
That&#39;s because enduring and useful memories

191
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:42,110
are what we hope results with regards to the essential

192
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,961
concepts and skills we teach all of our students.

193
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,355
We want them to be able to transfer

194
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,554
what they learn in our schools.

195
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:53,746
The most important learning, anyway, to situations

196
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:56,308
in their own personal lives and ultimately

197
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:59,729
to their work and civic lives in the future.

198
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,210
If they can&#39;t transfer beyond our classrooms

199
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,590
some important aspects of what we teach them,

200
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,519
does it matter then what we teach them?

201
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,109
Let&#39;s review some of the important ideas from this unit.

202
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,406
All of which we hope to deepen your understanding

203
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,854
in the coming weeks.

204
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:19,809
First, creating long-lasting memories is most successful

205
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:22,767
when new information is meaningfully linked

206
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:26,598
to already-existing knowledge in our memories.

207
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:31,022
Second, the more we process and think about something

208
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:34,842
new to the learned, the more enduring and retrievable

209
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,034
the memories become.

210
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:39,841
This most often involves a dialogue between

211
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:43,045
short-term memory, and long-term memory.

212
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:46,483
In other words, we have to think to learn.

213
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,695
By actively and consciously processing

214
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:51,269
new information and experiences.

215
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:53,986
Our later session about making enduring memories

216
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,851
will explain more in-depth.

217
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:59,621
Third, if the first two don&#39;t happen,

218
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:03,869
our students can be super attentive and work very hard,

219
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,927
but learn very little in terms of making

220
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:11,249
durable memories and learning that they can later use.

221
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:13,890
Finally, short-term memory is limited

222
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,333
in time and capacity and can be overloaded

223
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,771
in a way that limits learning.

224
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:24,223
We will address this and ways to avoid it in later sessions.

225
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:26,992
So that&#39;s a simple model of how memory works,

226
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:29,153
and we hope our subsequent sessions will deepen

227
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:31,725
your understanding of its major features,

228
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,674
always with this question in mind:

229
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:37,844
How can this developing understanding of how learning

230
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:42,011
happens be used to enhance my own teaching practice?
