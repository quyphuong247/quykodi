00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:29,130
Angela Duckworth là phó giáo sư

1
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,070
 ngành tâm lý học

2
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,760
tại trường đại học Pennsylvania và 2013

3
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,010
ông đã nhận được giải thưởng MacArthur Fellow Angeles cho nghiên cứu về

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,559
những năng lực không thuộc về chỉ số IQ bao gồm khả năng tự kiểm soát và 

5
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,980
và tính kiên trì bền bỉ một thuật ngữ mà bà đã đưa ra

6
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,680
được dự đoán là sẽ thành công trong cả

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,199
học vấn và chuyên môn. Những công trình nghiên cứ của bà rất nổi tiếng. 

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,629
Tôi rất thích các công trình nghiên cứu của bà 

9
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,780
bao gồm cả các học sinh của học viện West Point

10
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:59,309
lớp National Spelling Bee giáo viên mới vào nghề cuối cùng

11
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,590
người bán hàng và cả học sinh.

12
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,379
Duckworth nhận được bằng cử nhân ngành Sinh học thần kinh 

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,990
Đại học Harvard năm 1992 và bằng Thạc sỹ khoa học thần kinh năm 1996

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,350
của Đại học Oxford.

15
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,110
Bà hoàn thành bằng tiến sỹ ngành tâm lý 

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,539
tại Đại học Pennsylavania trước khi 

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,190
sự nghiệp nghiêm cứu của bà. Angela đã thành lập

18
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:19,979
một trường học hè phi lợi nhuận 

19
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,899
cho học sinh nghèo, 

20
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,880
một trong những giải thưởng của chính phủ cho bang Massachusetts

21
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,520
và được mô tả như trường hợp trường Harvard Kennedy

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,530
Angela cũng là 

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,540
một tư vấn quản lý của McKinsey 

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,490
  và làm giáo viên dạy toán trong 5 năm

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,250
tại trường công ở San Francisco, Philadelphia

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,610
và New York nên bà biết khá rõ về những gì mình làm.

27
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,159
David Yeager là một trợ lý giáo sư 

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,740
tại khoa tâm lý học phát triển 

29
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,450
tại Đại học Texas ở Austin 

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,850
và là hội viên của Qũy Carnegie 

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,189
 hoạt động vì sự tiến bộ của việc giảng dạy

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,719
Như tôi đã nói là một hội viên, tại casbah.

33
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,909
Năm nay ông đã giành được bằng cử nhân tại 

34
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,439
Đại học Notre Dame .

35
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,950
Đây là lần đầu tiên tôi có thể nói rằng 

36
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,829
một người học tại Notre Dame và một người không học tại Notre Dame

37
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,079
cùng giành được bằng Thạc sỹ ngành tâm lý học và 

38
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,360
bằng Tiến sỹ ngành khoa học phát triển tâm lý

39
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,579
 của Đại Học Standford. Công trình của ông

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,170
tập trung vào các học thuyết tâm lý học

41
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:15,390
và các can thiệp để làm tăng

42
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,090
động lực cho học sinh và các phương pháp luận khoa học xã hội

43
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,190
Ông nguyên là một giáo viên tại trường trung học

44
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,959
và ông có niềm đam mê 

45
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,840
trong việc sử dụng các nghiên cứu thử nghiệm 

46
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,670
để tạo ra sự bình đẳng trong giáo dục.

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,769
Và giờ hãy cùng tôi chào đón Angela và David 

48
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,349
Thật vinh hạnh. Tôi sẽ không lãng phí thời gian. 

49
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:33,240
Cám ơn bạn đã mời tôi.

50
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,580
Như tôi đã nói, 

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,430
tôi đến với ngành tâm lý này

52
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,630
 thông qua một lớp học

53
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,070
chúng ta đều trải qua các lớp học 

54
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,900
 nhưng với tôi, tôi trải qua lớp học đó 

55
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,420
với vai trò là một giáo viên đứng lớp. Tôi chỉ muốn nói rằng

56
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,040
những hiểu biết sâu sắc đã đưa tôi đến

57
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,640
với chương trình nghiên cứu này

58
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,530
vốn rất đơn giản. Những đứa trẻ thông minh,

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,750
chúng học hỏi rất nhanh

60
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,880
và ngay cả những học sinh không học tốt 

61
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,680
Tôi sẽ chỉ nói trong phạm vi

62
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,930
lớp học của mình, những em học sinh không

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,550
học tốt. Nếu bạn ngồi gần chúng và nói chuyện với chúng

64
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,190
về những việc mà chúng thực sự quan tâm 

65
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,320
như việc thông minh, đó chỉ là phần bên trong 

66
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,110
như kiểu không ngờ rằng bạn biết.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,790
rất nhiều những đứa trẻ tôi đã dạy

68
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,520
theo quan điểm của tôi thì, 

69
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,980
chúng rất sáng dạ.

70
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,600
Điều thứ hai đó là về toán học.

71
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,020
Bọn trẻ phải học môn toán, 

72
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,900
ngữ pháp, viết một đoạn văn thì khó,

73
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,930
thực sự khó, nhưng không hề 

74
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,810
nằm ngoài khả năng của chúng. Ken tôi chỉ

75
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,580
cảm thấy rằng phần lớn văn hóa 

76
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,320
và các thông điệp mà bọn trẻ đang mã hóa

77
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,030
giống như là, ai là người đủ thoongminh 

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,520
để học được điều đó. Thử nghĩ về điều đó, 

79
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,290
ai là người thông minh hơn để biết được cách tìm ra X 

80
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,050
bằng cách lấy chính nó ở vế trái của phép tính

81
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,540
Cả tôi và anh đều bắt đầu có suy nghĩ rằng

82
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:49,080
đó không phải là 

83
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,060
vấn đề về năng lực trí tuệ,

84
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,530
đó là sự lý giải ban đầu của người Mỹ.

85
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,670
 và việc điều trị 

86
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,380
cho những đứa trẻ

87
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,910
đang ngồi trước mặt tôi

88
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,040
Tôi muốn am hiểu được tâm lý

89
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,740
của sự nỗ lực và chính điều đó đã mang tôi đến với ngành tâm lý.

90
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,720
Không chỉ bởi tôi có thể trừng phạt bọn trẻ

91
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,850
hay chỉ tay hay là đổ lỗi, mà tôi còn

92
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,010
có thể thấu hiểu một cách thật sự lý do vì sao

93
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,870
mọi người vất vả làm việc, làm việc chăm chỉ để làm gì,

94
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,010
khi nào ta nên làm việc chăm chỉ và khi nào không.

95
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,650
Tôi sẽ nói cụ thể 

96
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,080
về một lĩnh vực của tâm lý,

97
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:23,040
 một lĩnh vực trong rất nhiều lĩnh vực 

98
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,900
mà tôi nghĩ chịu tác động do bởi 

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,670
khối lượng công việc mà bọn trẻ đang tiến hành

100
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,350
trong trường, hay với bất cứ những gì các em quan tâm

101
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,870
Tôi lấy nó từ trang web nhật báo New York Times 

102
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,470
nhưng bạn biết đấy, tôi chắc chắn rằng 

103
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,330
tôi có vận may, và tại sao nó

104
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,580
lại có trên trang web. Tôi nghĩ là bởi vì

105
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,400
có một thứ gì đó cộng hưởng với nó, 

106
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,639
có thể là về từ ngữ, nó tượng thanh như tiếng sào sạo

107
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,039
giống như có sạn vậy.

108
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,719
ý tôi muốn nói về lòng gan dạ

109
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:50,870
Tôi thực sự nghĩ rằng có một sự liên quan ở đây

110
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:53,300
khi tôi trò chuyện với các huấn luyện viên, mục sư, rabbis,

111
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,360
các giáo viên, phụ huynh, cô gì chú bác, 

112
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,180
phi hành gia và những người khác

113
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,539
những người thực sự có sự đồng thuận với vấn đề này

114
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,279
sự xây dựng này rất quan trọng

115
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:07,099
Tôi cho rằng bởi có sự nhận biết rằng

116
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:10,580
rất nhiều điều trong cuộc sống buộc bạn 

117
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:14,870
phải làm việc trong một khoảng thời gian đài

118
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:17,779
 với sự nhiệt huyết và nỗ lực. Mục tiêu thì có thể là 

119
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,330
bất cứ thứ gì bạn bạn quan tâm

120
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:23,300
nó có thể rất xa vời, có thể tốn của bạn 

121
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,879
 hàng tháng, hàng năm trời, và trong nhiều trường hợp

122
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,259
thời gian còn lâu hơn. Do vậy ý tưởng này chỉ là tạm thời

123
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,729
Tôi đã từng nghĩ nhiều thứ

124
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:32,659
 và tôi có một lòng thương cảm đặc biệt

125
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:34,069
cho bọn trẻ. Nhưng tôi cũng có suy nghĩ rằng

126
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:37,550
chúng trải qua những điều mà 

127
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:40,639
tất cả chúng ta ngồi đây đã từng trải qua.

128
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:44,300
đây là một biểu đồ đơn giản

129
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,580
đã lược bỏ hết những yếu tố nghèo đói chính trị xã hội

130
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,580
mà tôi cho rằng chúng có những ảnh hưởng 

131
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,909
đến việc học của trẻ và cố gắng của các em.

132
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,289
Tôi nghiên cứu những hạt sạn này vì tôi là một nhà tâm lý học

133
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:56,810
Trưa hôm nay tôi có ngồi thảo luận qua

134
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,879
 một vài vấn đề xã hội với những nhà xã hội học

135
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,649
và tôi nhận thấy rõ ràng rằng

136
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,180
đây là một bức tranh

137
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:04,310
không toàn vẹn về những gì đang diễn ra

138
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,649
nhưng đó chỉ là khởi đầu và tôi rất muốn

139
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,539
hiểu về tâm lý của trẻ em

140
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:10,639
Những học sinh giỏi hơn chăm chỉ hơn

141
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:13,819
có phải các em đang tích lũy nhiều hơn 

142
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,620
những khoảng thời gian quý giá vào các bài tập hơn là vào những thứ khác

143
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:18,500
và nếu như vậy, tại sao chúng lại làm như vậy

144
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,649
Quan điểm của tôi, những người can đảm làm hai điều

145
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,289
Chúng thể hiện như những gì

146
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:26,210
Woody Allen đã nói với chúng tôi trước đây, 

147
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:29,000
tám mươi phần trăm của sự thành công trong cuộc sống vẫn luôn tồn tại ở đó

148
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,649
đang được giữ ở đó và sau khi chúng chúng xuất hiện 

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,409
chúng làm những thứ được gọi là

150
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:35,270
tập quán hàng ngày. Bây giờ tôi thực sự 

151
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,770
rất hứng thú với công việc của mình và sẽ nói rất ít về chúng

152
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,330
nhưng bạn biết rằng 

153
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,919
David và tôi muốn kéo bạn vào

154
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,020
hội thoại, là phần cuối của 

155
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,899
thời gian cuộc thảo luận. Tôi nghĩ rằng 

156
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,969
children or grown-ups decide to you know

157
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:48,919
do things that are   hard over long

158
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:51,529
stretches of time they do things

159
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:54,139
essentially based on the expected costs

160
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:56,610
and benefits that's right I pretty much

161
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,500
think kids are rational agents

162
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,449
I know that's very unpopular to think of

163
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,669
people as rational these days but I

164
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,830
think at some level deeply people are

165
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,270
fairly sane including children including

166
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,819
children who are driving   crazy at the

167
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,069
moment but in their  head something must

168
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,199
be going on that makes their behavior

169
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,460
sensible to them and now of   course we

170
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,840
  have to understand what it is that's

171
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,270
going   on when it     doesn't make sense to

172
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,189
us now what I   mean     by deliberate

173
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,349
practice is nicely summarized by this

174
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,569
graph not from my own research but from

175
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:26,639
the work of andre's  erickson pretty much

176
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,490
  everyone in the room has read or heard

177
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,889
of outliers by   Malcolm Gladwell and I

178
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,659
will say that   the work on deliberate

179
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,389
practice thousands and thousands of

180
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:39,569
hours of this   special kind of practice

181
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:42,779
is not  Gladwell's own idea but in fact

182
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:45,659
shocker a scientist named Anders

183
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:48,840
Ericsson who studies experts and in his

184
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:50,759
study  of experts in as diverse fields as

185
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,520
you can think   of from sodoku to soccer

186
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,560
he finds that there's a skill curve so

187
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,389
skills on the vertical axis and what

188
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,849
he's got graphed here as years of

189
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,400
deliberate practice on  the      x-axis you

190
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:04,500
really  only have a chance at      world-class

191
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,870
levels of performance that's the dotted

192
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,060
horizontal line after you've accumulated

193
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,430
thousands and thousands   of hours over

194
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,379
years and years of this kind of practice

195
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,000
there's nothing magic about the number

196
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,839
ten thousand except for that it's round

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,699
and it was one average  in one study but

198
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,589
i think the generalized insight is  that

199
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,620
getting really good at anything  i mean

200
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:27,960
  anything being a chef or a mathematician

201
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,449
does you know take a tremendous  amount

202
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,310
of work  over time and in particular when

203
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,899
onder's studies experts he finds   that

204
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:36,208
they practice in a very particular way

205
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,699
which he dubs deliberate practice they

206
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:40,708
do   all fourth of these things at once

207
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:44,129
they're working   on something very

208
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:48,209
  self-conscious and specific that they

209
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:50,760
cannot yet do so they have set out to do

210
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:54,060
what they cannot do they concentrate

211
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,610
completely true full 100% concentration

212
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,490
they get immediate and informative

213
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:02,490
feedback so for   example Olympic downhill

214
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,709
skiers have themselves videotaped and as

215
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,270
soon as they can they   get their hands on

216
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:08,010
the videotape   and they watch it so they

217
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,000
can then learn on what to do a little

218
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,580
differently than

219
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,940
I'm and then finally  they practice to

220
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,010
fluency my husband's a former violist

221
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,780
like as in he played viola in college

222
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,520
and then he went   back to take vo lessons

223
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,220
and he came   home one day and he said you

224
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,080
know  feola teacher said      that he had to

225
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,440
play this single piece that he had  been

226
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,630
assigned right  ten times flawlessly

227
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,730
before he   would be given the next viola

228
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,950
piece and I thought   to     myself oh right

229
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,780
that's how   expert practice not to like

230
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,880
be plus not to kind of like yeah kind   of

231
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,220
get it but truly to complete fluency and

232
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,290
automaticity and what does it   feel like

233
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,480
to do deliberate practice I love this

234
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,980
essay that Martha Graham wrote towards

235
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,560
the end   of her career for National

236
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,260
Public Radio she says it takes about  10

237
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,360
years to   make a mature dancer right so

238
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,220
again nothing magic about 10 years or

239
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,470
10,000 hours but it does come  up again

240
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,510
and again it's true she says dancing

241
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,390
appears glamorous easy and delightful

242
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:06,240
but the path to the paradise of   G

243
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:09,540
achievement is not easier than any other

244
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,270
there   is fatigue so great that     the body

245
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,430
cries even in its sleep there are times

246
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,730
of complete frustration there are daily

247
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,110
small deaths this is what it feels like

248
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,440
to do  deliberate practice      at least

249
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,570
according to one very great artist it's

250
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,970
not always that bad but when we went to

251
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,070
the National Spelling Bee we wanted to

252
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,470
  know what kids were doing and how it

253
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,820
felt so we had them keep Diaries of the

254
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,650
kinds of things that they   did and they

255
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,250
listed all sorts of  things and they kept

256
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:40,560
track of not only how it felt in terms

257
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,850
of its effort and its enjoyment but also

258
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,000
how many hours   and minutes they were

259
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,089
  doing and here's our data so there's

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,580
three bars in each cluster the dark bars

261
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,140
are doing deliberate practice things

262
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,450
like writing the same word over and over

263
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,610
again singing lay down a page in  the

264
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,070
middle and the light bars is being

265
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:03,360
quizzed like your mom might say moose

266
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,040
bracha and you say you spra CH e Luce

267
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,930
bracha which was the winning word that

268
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,900
year and that which I just learned how

269
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,820
to spell by the way and   then what they

270
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,380
really want to   do all day     is what we

271
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,240
coded as leisure verbal activities

272
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,280
mostly reading right which kids actually

273
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,670
in the study rated as enjoyable as

274
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,259
eating ice cream so super enjoyable

275
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,139
things on in some case

276
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:27,389
is you know high effort things in it but

277
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,399
in the picture that we're painting here

278
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:32,309
is not that   unlike Martha Graham's

279
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,679
description of low enjoyment high effort

280
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,779
for deliberate practice but   when you

281
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:40,109
  throw everything into the same model and

282
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:43,350
you ask in  terms of time which kind of

283
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:45,660
practice uniquely predicts Spelling Bee

284
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,749
performance in the finals it's only

285
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,579
deliberate practice and a great was the

286
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:53,879
best psychological predictor of how much

287
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:56,160
time kids spent now some of  us may have

288
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,529
children in  the room or grandchildren or

289
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,479
you know nieces nephews I just want  to

290
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,339
point out one thing being quizzed is

291
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:04,979
actually a very  good thing for studying

292
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,779
in part because you can identify what

293
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,979
you don't know but then of  course you

294
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,749
have  to go      and practice it and that

295
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:12,869
might be why in this   model it falls out

296
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:14,999
as not being super predictive so do quiz

297
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:17,579
your children   grandchildren nieces

298
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:19,529
nephews but also recognize  that there's

299
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,910
a certain   amount of practice that they

300
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:23,279
have to do with full concentration

301
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,769
working on something they can't with

302
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,980
feedback repetitively in order for them

303
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:31,589
to improve now I want to transition to

304
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,389
  this expected value idea this idea that

305
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,709
kids are in a way little  economist

306
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:37,619
trying to figure out   how they should

307
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:40,589
optimize their benefits and minimize

308
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:43,079
their costs we created  an intervention

309
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,839
which simply taught kids what I just

310
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:48,569
explained   to you we told them Martha

311
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,999
Graham hates to practice says it kind of

312
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:54,480
feels like dying completely frustrated

313
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:56,519
sometimes totally confuse you know we we

314
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,160
spice it up you know with cartoons which

315
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,199
are more fun to look at the knee we also

316
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,329
tell them   that if you look at scientific

317
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:05,159
studies of kids and adults learning the

318
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:08,279
signature emotion of learning is not

319
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:11,339
flow it is not necessarily even

320
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,989
curiosity or happiness or pride the

321
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,359
signature emotion of learning seems to

322
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:18,239
be confusion it is confusion which you

323
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:21,629
have to   sustain in this concentrated way

324
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:23,639
that you don't  enjoy because confusion

325
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,859
is a negative emotion and that we should

326
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,299
maybe   in reinterpret the experience of

327
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:29,639
studying and homework as something   which

328
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,559
is normal and also potentially even a

329
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,860
good sign like I'm in my discomfort zone

330
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:37,980
kids at the end this   is very     Dueck Ian I

331
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,660
say has you know this exercise at  the

332
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,000
end where they write a letter to another

333
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,710
student where they simply summarize what

334
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,330
they've learned and actually tell a

335
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,340
story from their own life that brings it

336
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,350
to life so for   example on the far right

337
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,300
dear student deep practice helps me a

338
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,400
lot with soccer it makes me a better

339
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,740
player I used to   be the one that was

340
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,630
  behind on my team but now that I use D

341
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,420
practice I'm one of the top players it

342
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,310
makes me frustrated but I push through

343
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,060
it with hard work and that equals

344
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:08,070
success right so we created a task that

345
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,350
force kids to do deliberate practice we

346
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,510
took Khan Academy material but we

347
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,430
increased the algorithm so that kids

348
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,900
would   be constantly pushed into doing

349
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,120
problems that they   were actually getting

350
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,890
a certain percentage of   them wrong but

351
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,910
when we SAT them in the lab we said you

352
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,370
  know if you need to take a break

353
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,470
whenever you want   to you can go we have

354
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,240
 negotiated with your school to      take off

355
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,160
the firewall you can go to youtube go to

356
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,810
 Facebook you go to      Instagram we were

357
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,970
like   the most popular study that has

358
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,350
ever been run because kids never get to

359
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,610
do that   in their own computer labs and

360
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,770
this is a screenshot of one of our

361
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,150
studies and you can kind   of     see that

362
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,710
some   of the kids are on Instagram then

363
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,050
some of   the kids are actually on the

364
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:45,870
  task itself this deliberate practice

365
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,640
  test and what we found is that learning

366
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,890
about deliberate practice compared  to a

367
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,710
placebo control group actually can I

368
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,330
would say either you  could say the red

369
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,920
line increase the amount of deliberate

370
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,660
practice kids are willing to   do a

371
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,860
relative to   a control group or at least

372
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,750
mitigate against the decrease right that

373
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,860
the control group is like I really don't

374
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,360
want to do this and we're   sort of

375
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,760
buffering against that in the

376
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,440
intervention group we also change their

377
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,610
beliefs about practice once you go

378
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,290
through this intervention you say things

379
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,460
 like      you     know what when you're      doing

380
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,410
your homework and you're studying you

381
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,880
should focus on weaknesses and things

382
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,410
  that you don't know and stop repeating

383
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,840
all the things that   you do know which of

384
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,340
course feels better and also their

385
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,990
beliefs about frustration what is

386
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,530
frustration a sign that you should give

387
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,790
  up and you know like it's over or a sign

388
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,530
that you should actually persist because

389
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,870
this might be the real moment of

390
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,760
learning and   i will say finally that

391
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,770
we're excited that among the lower

392
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,620
achieving students which is a finding

393
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,690
 that      I think David and I and Carol and

394
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,760
many others of us who are all in the

395
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,170
kind of   Carol Dweck extended family you

396
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,430
know we often   find that there     is a kind

397
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,000
  of bringing up of the most vulnerable

398
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,440
suit

399
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,810
and these interventions and in this case

400
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,550
 we find that so      for example in the high

401
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,050
achieving kids there's no effect on

402
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,810
grades but in the low achieving kids

403
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,880
there is an increase in the intervention

404
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,980
group and finally I'll just say   for my

405
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,690
own self that I want   to give the credit

406
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,760
for   the intervention we're completely to

407
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:09,810
my graduate student Lauren and then  our

408
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,210
funders and also   David who among other

409
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,680
people to selflessly like tells me what

410
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,420
the heck I'm doing wrong when we call

411
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,890
him  and ask him to look at our

412
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:26,430
interventions so let me transition to

413
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:29,430
you David  and thinks I'm a developmental

414
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,740
psychologist but I I much my training is

415
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,080
in social psychology   and a hallmark in

416
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,630
social psychology is the idea that the

417
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,690
 situation the setting you're in provides

418
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,970
information   to you about the kind of

419
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:46,110
person you might be my beer might be

420
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:48,030
viewed as what's worth your effort what

421
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,590
is what is the meaning of your actions

422
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:53,250
in your behavior in this setting in the

423
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:56,880
 eyes of others and so where where where

424
00:16:53,250 --> 00:17:00,390
where we build on the story that Angela

425
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,220
developed is to try   to look at at an

426
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,740
even   earlier level in the diagram to say

427
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,410
what are the discernment that

428
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,660
individuals make as they  enter a setting

429
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,689
that this is a place where   I can trust

430
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,209
 that my effort will be valued and will

431
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:17,640
pay off in this setting is this a place

432
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:21,720
where I belong where people will respect

433
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,400
me where when I when I push myself to

434
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,680
the as Claude Steele says to the

435
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,390
frontiers of my ability and put myself

436
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,040
out there where I might look dumb I

437
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,800
might look like someone who lacks

438
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,160
ability that this is it's   it's a safe

439
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,740
place for  me to invest my efforts and so

440
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,390
where I love where this work comes

441
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,520
together is the   idea that there's a

442
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,670
particular   type of practice that

443
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,650
develops ability but  it takes trust that

444
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:50,040
that unpleasant feeling that frustration

445
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:53,370
the the judgment you make about about

446
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,440
that aversive emotion isn't worth it   to

447
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,790
me from my perspective given what I know

448
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,680
about the setting and we this is a long

449
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,750
tradition of research that builds

450
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Angela's co-author and some of this but

451
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,700
certainly  a lot of my collaborators

452
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,550
either at Stanford or from Stanford and

453
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,850
the work i'll present is really it grows

454
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:17,220
  out of a number of wonderful people     in

455
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,800
their work what's a good   setting to test

456
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,930
the psychology of effort specifically

457
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,150
your judgments of whether you can trust

458
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,650
  that this is a safe     place well      I'm a

459
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,620
former middle school English   teacher and

460
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,930
every I would assign writing assignments

461
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,730
and every Sunday   I would get or every

462
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,530
few Sundays I'd get i get   the drafts the

463
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,050
kids the essays  of the kids wrote and I

464
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:40,440
go   to this     coffeehouse shades of brown

465
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:43,230
and Tulsa Oklahoma and as before shades

466
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,950
of   gray so it was slightly it was less

467
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,750
weird at   the time and and I sit     there in

468
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,430
it anyway out great essays and I just

469
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,320
  have this stack and I just hated it

470
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,330
right it's  just so such an aversive

471
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,860
experience for me and I just  listen      to

472
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,000
the like the high schoolers chitchat

473
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,010
about the boring stuff that they're

474
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,140
doing   and whatever and I just you know

475
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,090
 just like drinking coffee and I'm the

476
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,610
only  thing that comforted me was these

477
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,410
kids are  so lucky because every comment

478
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,750
i put  on there sa they're going to get

479
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:13,290
so  much better at writing how fortunate

480
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,900
 that I went out of my way to tell      them

481
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,160
how they could improve I mean I'm   gonna

482
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,560
get something just going to get thank

483
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,290
  you note after thank you know when they

484
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,700
get essays back and they look like this

485
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,990
right and   that's kind of our theory of

486
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,060
like getting good teachers in the

487
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,650
classroom that really push kids you know

488
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,450
like the kids are going to love it but

489
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,940
  from the kids perspective like what are

490
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,450
  they saying right and they look a little

491
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,270
bit like this guy   you know they're

492
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,530
thinking this is a if you google first

493
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,690
batch of comments on   your dissertation

494
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,309
proposal this image comes up so the

495
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,019
question

496
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:49,970
that's  actually true uh from their

497
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,700
professions like this guy went out   of

498
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,100
his way on a Sunday just to crap on all

499
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,110
my work and like what a horrible person

500
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,970
right and so there's this

501
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,749
intersubjectivity problem right we're

502
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:05,240
like  that their effort from their

503
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:07,220
perspective is viewed as just this

504
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,789
complete lack of competence by an

505
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,820
authority figure and absent trust that

506
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:15,440
that if they try their hardest that

507
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,230
they're going   to meet a standard and be

508
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,539
treated   fairly why would it be rational

509
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,879
from their perspective to not play with

510
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:26,119
her friends at night but instead revised

511
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:28,100
an essay and so this   is work that grew

512
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,659
out of Jeff Cohen's dissertation and we

513
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,970
carried out a study also with Val pretty

514
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:33,830
vons where this  is a real essay from the

515
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,929
study where middle schoolers wrote

516
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,509
essays about their heroes this was

517
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:41,960
 designed to be a self relevant topic and

518
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:44,360
we instructed the teachers to do their

519
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,499
best on providing comments and you know

520
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,460
  I     was again I was an English teacher

521
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:51,799
you're told to do something to buffer

522
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,999
your critical feedback and now you can

523
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,950
ask yourself   well how do you give

524
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:56,330
critical feedback and I  talk      to a lot of

525
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,379
parents and   teachers and they say I'll

526
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,840
tell you how you   give a critical

527
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:00,950
feedback step  one give      someone a

528
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,509
compliment about something that's

529
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,279
  completely unrelated to the domain

530
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:07,399
you're about to talk about   like their

531
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,960
enthusiasm step to tell them that all

532
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:11,330
their work is bad and tell them all the

533
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,279
ways that it could  be revised step 3

534
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,720
remind them  of their competence      in some

535
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,509
completely unrelated domain like   their

536
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,190
taste in music or their shoes but   the

537
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,950
assumption   is that like self-esteem is a

538
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,330
cup   that you take a gulp and you know

539
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,679
you you fill it up a little   bit with a

540
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,879
compliment you   take a gulp with a

541
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,440
critical   feedback and then you have

542
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:30,019
don't forget to fill it back up again at

543
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,220
the end   but subjectively from the

544
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,230
perspective of the kid they may not   be

545
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,610
  wondering like you know do I have high

546
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,970
self-esteem but they may be wondering is

547
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:40,999
this person viewing me as an  idiot or as

548
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,759
someone who  has no confidence and if you

549
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:45,710
don't if you   don't create a trust that

550
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,049
this is a place where   your abilities and

551
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:51,710
perspectives are valued it can be

552
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:53,990
difficult   to make a judgment     of that

553
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,940
this is worth my effort so what teachers

554
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,580
did is they kind of intuitively knew to

555
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,710
use the

556
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,990
compliment sandwich approach and it's

557
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,370
like   this is really good good job and

558
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,950
then you know it's lots of substantive

559
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,090
feedback and  bye-bye      professional

560
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,029
development standards this is great

561
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,100
feedback on essays um but then what

562
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:13,740
happened is after the kids wrote the

563
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,720
first essay and then they and then the

564
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,029
teachers commented on it the researchers

565
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,130
intercepted the essays and we randomly

566
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:23,580
assigned post-it notes  on the essays

567
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:26,669
designed to assuage the concern   that

568
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,220
this teacher views you   only in light of

569
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:32,580
a   negative stereotype for instance or

570
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,409
enlighten who'd lacks ability and then

571
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,000
this   is     a technique developed by Claude

572
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:39,899
Steele and Jeff Cohen called wise

573
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,419
feedback and and what it does  is it has

574
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:45,240
two parts of   the message first an

575
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:47,460
invocation of high standards   in the     end

576
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,620
that I'm   giving you these comments

577
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,230
because I have high   standards and the

578
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,909
idea is   to     take off the table the

579
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,860
alternative attribution that you're

580
00:22:53,909 --> 00:23:00,059
being criticized because of bias or

581
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:02,549
dislike but just appealing to a high

582
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:04,440
standard doesn't assure a person that

583
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:07,169
they have the potential to meet it it's

584
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,299
like going to the two you know

585
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:11,639
astroworld that's in Houston six flags

586
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,080
and you see the you see   the thing you

587
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,820
have to be this big   to right that's the

588
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,679
standard but you're this tall and   you're

589
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,559
never going   to meet him and you wonder

590
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:21,450
well who developed that standard and so

591
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:24,149
the idea is to both appeal to the high

592
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,039
standard and then say I'm with you to

593
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:28,889
the bitter end until you reach that   high

594
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:30,210
standard and   so the note said I'm giving

595
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:31,559
you these comments because I have high

596
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:34,139
  standards and I know that you can meet

597
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:36,059
them it's a simple   sentence but it comes

598
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:38,250
directly   from observational work of the

599
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,870
world's   best teachers hi my Escalante

600
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,570
the   movie Stand and Deliver that's a

601
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,460
real story of   a real teacher and he said

602
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,019
  this is     the standard      free AP AP Calculus

603
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,000
and we're studying in my   living room

604
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:51,000
until midnight until everyone here and

605
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,190
  passes that we try to invoke that spirit

606
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,570
in the kids for kids in the control

607
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,159
condition they got a note that said I'm

608
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,019
giving you these comments so you have

609
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,130
feedback on your essay which conveys no

610
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:04,559
information however   some beautiful work

611
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,240
by Ellen Langer shows us that any

612
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,220
explanation for behavior that

613
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,230
grammatically sounds correct can have a

614
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,870
beneficial effect and so it's

615
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,880
truly titled a placebo and there's the

616
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,470
  footnote it's a beautiful set of studies

617
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,140
if you want to cut in line  at the copier

618
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:22,410
for instance it's you   know if you just

619
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,640
say I'd  like to make my copies or can I

620
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,750
cut in line people  like now it's

621
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,360
ridiculous you're a jerk and you're

622
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:29,100
selfish if you say can I cut in line and

623
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,780
you know I'm in a hurry i  need to      pick

624
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,580
up my   kids at soccer practice it's like

625
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,470
oh right   away     i would be a      jerk if i

626
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,540
stood in your way  but in the third

627
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:40,740
condition if you say can I cut in line

628
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:42,750
  I'd like to     make my copies faster then

629
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,429
you're just as likely to get compliance

630
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,700
and it took you a second to laugh

631
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:52,350
because grammatically it sounds like an

632
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:54,510
explanation and conveys it fulfills a

633
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,190
conversational norm and so here  too we

634
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,480
said  like just something that kids

635
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,280
wouldn't question in fact we knew

636
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,690
through  follow-ups follow-up surveys and

637
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,540
interviews that kids didn't question

638
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,490
  this okay so researchers intercept the

639
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,049
essays append the post-it notes randomly

640
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,910
signed at  the individual level in real

641
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:10,799
 7th grade classrooms at a racially

642
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,480
diverse middle school fifty percent   of

643
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,919
students of white fifty percent of

644
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,660
students were african-american but all

645
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,760
teachers were white so we're looking at

646
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,640
trust across the racial divide in  the

647
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,130
face of critical feedback essays had a

648
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,900
cover page put on them so teachers were

649
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,790
blinded to the treatment condition they

650
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,559
handed back the essays kids walk out the

651
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,480
door and then a week later they either

652
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,150
revise the essay or not and so what

653
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,650
happened on  the      y-axis here is the

654
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,960
percent   of kids who revise the essay in

655
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,630
the real middle school classroom and

656
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,160
what you  see is that      in the control

657
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,540
condition in  the placebo you see a

658
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,850
racial achievement gap that

659
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,250
unfortunately is reproduced in on a

660
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,919
number of metrics again and again in

661
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,840
many American classrooms and absent this

662
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,900
type of social psychological perspective

663
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,460
absent a perspective on the legitimate

664
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,410
concerns that students might have but

665
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,570
whether it's fair to trust in this

666
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:02,610
setting you might wonder are these kids

667
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,350
different are their traits that differ

668
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,169
is this the fixed state of affairs

669
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,549
however  for kids who received the high

670
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:10,679
 standards and assurance post-it note

671
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:13,020
white students showed a marginally

672
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,730
significant modest benefit of around

673
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,080
twenty five percentage points but for

674
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,150
 African American students there was a

675
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,980
 dramatic increase in the proportion who

676
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,049
revised their essays up to   seventy-two

677
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,179
  percent statistically this     eliminates

678
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:27,840
  the achievement gap on this metric

679
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:29,999
in this moment and what what's important

680
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,249
about this is that what can seem like a

681
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:34,350
  stable set of findings again and again

682
00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:35,970
can in fact be a legitimate discernment

683
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:39,179
  that an individual might have about

684
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,799
whether this place is is safe for me to

685
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:44,639
trust   that my effort will be valued and

686
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,259
respected by  the authorities we thought

687
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:48,570
this   is at the end of the 7th     grade year

688
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:51,029
at a time  when we knew trust was just

689
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,009
was declining just as in  angela's data

690
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:55,379
people wanted less deliberate practice

691
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:57,419
over time and   this data said we surveyed

692
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:59,100
kids twice a year on their trust their

693
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,019
their beliefs that teachers were fair in

694
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,999
the  control condition it looked      like

695
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,980
this every single measurement occasion

696
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:06,869
especially  African American students

697
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,240
showed lower trust in the treatment

698
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:11,100
condition there was still a decline but

699
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,480
that decline leveled off after the

700
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,470
post-it note throughout the eighth grade

701
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,669
year from official records at  the end      of

702
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,649
the school year in eighth grade we

703
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:22,559
looked at discipline incidents and the

704
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:24,480
reason  for this is this this this

705
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,190
finding   that grows in a part out     of some

706
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,129
theory that   Jennifer     eberhard who's here

707
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,679
has developed that individuals discern

708
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:33,360
whether institutions are fair is this a

709
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,190
place where the policies are applied

710
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,429
fairly to me and specifically to my

711
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,559
group and that that discernment once

712
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:42,990
developed can might apply across domains

713
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,580
of interaction so in this school we know

714
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,320
for instance that   African American

715
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,240
students   are aware that they're more

716
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,710
likely to for instance be stopped in the

717
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,779
hallway and ask for a  Hall Pass as

718
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,580
compared to white students that type of

719
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,690
discernment in turn predicts whether

720
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,419
they   revise the rest day in the

721
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:59,369
classroom  but it also predicts whether

722
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,779
they earn   discipline incidents in eighth

723
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:03,690
grade net of whether they were

724
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:06,509
disciplined themselves   previously and so

725
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:08,549
if Trust is this mediator if individuals

726
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:10,470
form a mental   model of trust based on

727
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:12,659
interpersonal treatment then that might

728
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,269
create the very reality that students

729
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:17,490
might have have perceived that as

730
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:18,869
students now distrusting may act out

731
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,450
against those very rules that  they see

732
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:25,950
is unfair  and unjust however if trust

733
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:28,019
could be restored in in fact the reality

734
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,610
is ambiguous if you could   lead students

735
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:31,980
to see this as  a place      where perhaps

736
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,899
  maybe sometimes I might be treated

737
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,580
  fairly then perhaps you could prevent

738
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:37,860
some  of that discipline and in fact

739
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,510
that's   what we find where

740
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,400
in the control condition you see a

741
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,620
dramatic racial disparity in discipline

742
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,470
just it consistent with what was

743
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,530
perceived by individuals however   for

744
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,030
kids who receive the post-it note there

745
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,400
was about a fifty percent reduction in

746
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,380
the discipline incidents note that this

747
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,690
  is different teachers a different school

748
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,570
different school year   and this is in

749
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,980
many cases outside  of the classroom so

750
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,770
there's   this dynamic interplay between

751
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,090
discernment of trust in the classroom

752
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,960
  and discernment of fairness of the

753
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,580
institution that you're a part   of now in

754
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,080
turn trust   in this in this study

755
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,750
predicted whether students made it to

756
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,190
college four years   later but what we

757
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,190
were interested in  is whether these

758
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,650
mental models of wariness about fairness

759
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,510
and belonging might might still be

760
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,190
malleable even later in development for

761
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,750
instance among individuals who are

762
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:30,059
transitioning from high school into

763
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,370
college so what'll end with is a study

764
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:35,520
we worked on Angela worked on or   closely

765
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,870
with   Greg Walton who's here we've

766
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,330
thought about this   idea where a

767
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:42,660
student's belief or a mindset that is

768
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,549
the product of experience might predict

769
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,140
their everyday behaviors whether they

770
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,030
feel it's safe to invest their effort or

771
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,250
not over time that might lead to

772
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,620
differences in learning achievement and

773
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,330
in turn reinforce a mindset that they

774
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,280
may have that is that perception becomes

775
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,799
a reality what Tim Wilson calls an

776
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,620
exacerbation cycle but you might  be      able

777
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,390
to   to cut that through psychological

778
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,910
intervention of the   type that were

779
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,110
developed   here at Stanford and so we did

780
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,640
some work in the transition  to college

781
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,490
which what I'll end with and

782
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,500
specifically we looked at graduates of

783
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,480
high-performing urban charter networks

784
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,010
these are students from communities

785
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,870
where the base rate of college

786
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:21,990
enrollment and subsequent graduation is

787
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:24,299
very low however these schools help

788
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,309
students develop skills academic skills

789
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,840
and gain admission to college in many

790
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:31,169
  cases at around one hundred percent

791
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,330
rates but   the college graduation rate

792
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:35,730
among those  students that      one hundred

793
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:37,980
 percent who made it to college is ranges

794
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:41,850
from   twenty to forty percent so there's

795
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:44,100
this   tragic loss of potential among

796
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,870
individuals coming out of in many   cases

797
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,669
 low-income      communities many cases

798
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:50,280
first-generation students many cases

799
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:51,630
students of color who head off to our

800
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,400
nation's colleges

801
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,540
but never earn degrees and leave with

802
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:00,720
with debt so we wondered  if helping

803
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:02,640
  students appraise early experiences of

804
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,760
difficulty that first critical feedback

805
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,140
on your freshman seminar  essay and then

806
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,270
probably everyone in this room remembers

807
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,030
your first freshman to like anyone

808
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:14,970
willing   to share those I'm not right

809
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:17,580
does that first calculus test you might

810
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,740
  have failed the first time in in that

811
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,540
that's academic what   about social the

812
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,280
the first time you have lunch with

813
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,420
someone   and then you know     that they go

814
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,610
  to a party the next day     and they don't

815
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,200
invite you those are   all experiences

816
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:30,660
where you might legitimately wonder is

817
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,180
this a normal part of   the transition to

818
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,310
college or is this do more   generally to

819
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,350
  something about my group that people

820
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,720
like me may not belong may not be valued

821
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,430
here and that   again that discernment

822
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,260
about belonging may in turn affect

823
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:45,060
whether you feel like it's a safe place

824
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,860
for   you to put yourself to the frontiers

825
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,050
of your abilities the frontiers of your

826
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,570
knowledge to be lost confused to

827
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:53,100
struggle to ask  questions in      front of

828
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,370
peers whether you worried they might

829
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:59,490
  think that you're done and so with Greg

830
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,900
  and Angela we had a design school day

831
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,700
here at the   Stanford design school we're

832
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,740
  trying to bring the fun of product

833
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,540
design methodology into the design of

834
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,100
psychological interventions that's

835
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,540
 andre's Erickson who came for that day

836
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,760
and there's   Angela so much from Angela

837
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,320
staff Chris  gabrielli Donald commence

838
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,640
one of our partners   from yes prep public

839
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,530
schools Chris Broughton  and what we did

840
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,630
 is we interviewed a ton of students

841
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:23,580
graduates of urban charters  for

842
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:25,530
transitioning to college and we tried to

843
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,120
craft a message that could just help

844
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:30,930
them have a little psychological space

845
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,120
before they face inevitable difficulties

846
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,770
we had students draw what we   called a

847
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,270
journey map this is a journey of their

848
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,030
transition from high school to college

849
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:41,430
you see stress stress stress when the

850
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,290
admissions process this   student went to

851
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:45,780
CSU East Bay and then dropped out after

852
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:48,810
one month for a financial   matter going

853
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,920
back   to college this     is a      woman young

854
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:54,000
woman that Claude Steele and I

855
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:57,900
interviewed and this told stories of

856
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,310
worries that that professors didn't care

857
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,810
nearly as much as her teachers in high

858
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,850
school and wondered   if it meant that

859
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:06,119
  they weren't valuing her respecting her

860
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,709
we building on this   kind of design

861
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,209
process we took a series of notes we

862
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:11,639
worked with  addie school for several

863
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:13,859
 months and rewrote materials that just

864
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:17,549
help students have a   little space to

865
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:19,409
potentially interpret early common

866
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:22,109
difficulties as things   that might be

867
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:24,089
 able      to     overcome as a place see college

868
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:25,559
as a place  where they might trust we

869
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:27,269
 develop      then distilled all these

870
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,429
insights into a very brief web-based

871
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:31,679
survey takes about 25 30 minutes to

872
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:33,209
complete and students go into their

873
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,919
school computer labs and they completed

874
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:37,469
it in may have senior year in high

875
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,609
school so it says you're finishing high

876
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:40,559
school you're going   to college you're

877
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:42,179
excited you probably still lots of

878
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,339
questions about  what to expect etc etc

879
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:46,619
and  then they read a series of quotes

880
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:48,449
that were taken from the real members of

881
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:50,519
 our focus groups and interviews talking

882
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:51,749
about how college is hard you're going

883
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,129
  to you're going to struggle in school

884
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:55,799
you're going   to struggle socially but

885
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:58,319
over time you get better these are kids

886
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,209
taking the   the survey they're randomly

887
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,069
assigned at the individual level from

888
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:04,379
their perspective all the materials look

889
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:06,029
very similar they read these quotes

890
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:08,279
again it   takes about 20 to 25 minutes

891
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:11,159
 from their perspective the study is over

892
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:12,179
at the end and then we track them

893
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,349
through the National Student

894
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,419
Clearinghouse which is a government

895
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:17,700
database that allows you to know whether

896
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:20,908
people are enrolled full-time in college

897
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:22,888
or not and so on the y-axis here is

898
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:24,539
 full-time enrollment rates this we did

899
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,299
this two years in a row   and replicated

900
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:30,419
in two different charter management

901
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:32,429
organizations one is in Philadelphia

902
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:35,608
almost exclusively  african-american

903
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:39,720
students   the other is in cities and

904
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:42,539
 Houston Texas almost exclusively Latino

905
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,518
students so what you see is that  in the

906
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,679
control tragically although one hundred

907
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:49,108
percent were admitted to   college only 61

908
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,879
percent show up in the fall so there's

909
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:55,200
what's called summer melt our treatment

910
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:57,239
doesn't stop summer melt really but   even

911
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,499
more tragically you see that even   among

912
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,549
the students   who made it to the first

913
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:02,519
semester  of college      you lose an

914
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:05,069
additional half by fall of junior  year

915
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:07,200
and   this is the most recent     data for the

916
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:09,480
treatment though you see a slowing of

917
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,700
that decline the the pipeline is   Leslie

918
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,170
key for   these students and it may not

919
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,670
look like much   but by spring of

920
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,309
sophomore year there's a 12 percentage

921
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,470
point increase in full-time enrollment

922
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:19,960
rates for students from this one time

923
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,410
message

924
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,330
with no  reinforcement we read in this

925
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:29,290
significant at every time point after

926
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:31,570
  the first     year in in cohort to what you

927
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,940
see is that again a hundred percent were

928
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:37,060
admitted   to college tragically only     51%

929
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,160
made it and then they lose about ten

930
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:43,750
 percent over the first year      and a half

931
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,339
of college but but by the by   the fall of

932
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,339
sophomore year there's a significant

933
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:50,589
treatment contrast and importantly  the

934
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:51,790
size of the effects may look modest but

935
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:54,400
  they're big from the perspective of

936
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:56,020
social science   so the flagship

937
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,730
intervention that paid students

938
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,890
 thirty-five hundred dollars per semester

939
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,810
for staying  full-time students had an

940
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,790
effect   of around two to two point four

941
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:06,400
percentage points and it faded out after

942
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,290
one year these these effects are much

943
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,500
larger and they can be  achieved at much

944
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:14,230
more modest cost so in   summary what I'd

945
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:17,410
like to suggest is that sometimes some

946
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,480
 of the withholding of effort that some

947
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:24,220
students especially across group lines

948
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,680
that we might see   may be due     to a

949
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,480
legitimate questioning of whether this

950
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,790
is a fair place where I could trust and

951
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,530
where I can succeed and then allowing

952
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,720
students to stay in the game just long

953
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,420
enough where they can have some success

954
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,130
where it can build on itself can have

955
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,130
surprising effects that can that can

956
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:45,280
last and  that can      reinforce themselves

957
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:47,410
over time and in what I and so in

958
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,030
conclusion I think you know what

959
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,190
Margaret is leaning here at the center

960
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:54,280
is really big integrated behavioral

961
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,589
science that that takes basic scientific

962
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,210
ideas and thinks of ways to   use them to

963
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:01,810
address important social problems and

964
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:04,270
all of the work I presented here  builds

965
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,310
on great work by cosmos fellows people

966
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,750
like Claude Steele and so I mean I'm

967
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,190
really excited to see the kinds of

968
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,960
effects that   we can have on important

969
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,490
social problems going forward from   the

970
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,070
kinds of work that   cosmos fellows this

971
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:17,070
year and next year   will be doing thank

972
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,130
you very much

973
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,130
you
