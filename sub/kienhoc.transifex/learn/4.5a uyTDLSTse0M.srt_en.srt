0
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:10,595
- Think of something you know really well,

1
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:12,621
something you have deep knowledge of

2
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:14,774
and are confident you could apply effectively

3
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:16,783
in different contexts.

4
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,540
How did that understanding develop for you?

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,042
Chances are in whatever way it happened

6
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:24,881
it probably took quite a bit of time.

7
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:27,578
That&#39;s how deep and enduring learning develops.

8
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:31,208
It&#39;s almost invariably distributed over long periods of time

9
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,260
with ample opportunities for feedback and reflection.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,843
This is called spaced practice.

11
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:46,205
A learning principle we&#39;re all familiar with,

12
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:49,173
both in our academic and daily lives,

13
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:51,708
yet in schools it&#39;s a learning principle

14
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,446
we frequently forget or ignore.

15
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:57,622
Too often our students, especially as they make their way

16
00:00:57,622 --> 00:00:59,302
through school from K to 12,

17
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:01,877
are taught in ways that run counter to what we know

18
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:05,674
to be best practice for creating long-term learning.

19
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,925
Surveys indicate that the most frequent way

20
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:09,268
for students to study,

21
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:11,276
especially in junior high and high school,

22
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:15,454
is called massed practice or more commonly cramming.

23
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:16,807
This usually involves students

24
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:19,809
intensively studying over a short period of time,

25
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:22,359
often the night before they have a test.

26
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,938
What happens next compounds the problem of cramming.

27
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:29,436
That&#39;s because many times the students end up doing okay

28
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:31,754
or even more than okay on the test.

29
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:34,793
It turns out that our human memory is pretty good

30
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,389
at retaining a surprising amount of information

31
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,907
for short periods of time.

32
00:01:39,907 --> 00:01:41,156
That&#39;s the problem.

33
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:44,883
The knowledge is retained for only short periods of time.

34
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,743
Give those students the same test

35
00:01:46,743 --> 00:01:50,426
three weeks later unannounced and see how they do.

36
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,845
My experience is that those same students

37
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:55,338
who achieved high scores retain little

38
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:58,061
of what they knew a few weeks earlier.

39
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:00,403
Even more interesting would be to have students

40
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:04,451
take their final exam from June the following September.

41
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:06,760
You could even limit the important skills and concepts

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,433
from the previous year.

43
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,494
How do you think they would do?

44
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:12,419
The problem of fragile knowledge,

45
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,387
as the physicist Richard Feynman called it years ago,

46
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:18,313
is a common one in our schools.

47
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:20,842
This is because for the most part

48
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:23,809
we don&#39;t seem to value learning that creates lasting

49
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:28,240
and transferable understanding beyond the immediate.

50
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,277
If so, we would place front and center

51
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,378
the principle of spaced practice

52
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:37,169
as we design curricula, instruction, and assessment.

53
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:40,178
Surprisingly, one of the oldest and most powerful

54
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:42,443
research basis in cognitive science

55
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:45,418
has to do with just this learning principle.

56
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:48,692
For over a century, numerous studies have demonstrated

57
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:50,559
that distributing learning over time

58
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:53,754
in relatively short intervals is a much better way

59
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:57,087
to develop enduring and usable memories.

60
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:02,802
This is in comparison to devoting the same amount

61
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:06,399
of learning time in less frequent and longer sessions

62
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:09,227
or even in single intensive sessions.

63
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:11,115
The principle of spaced practice

64
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:15,063
is one of the most important for long-term learning.

65
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:16,971
That&#39;s in addition to of course

66
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:21,102
the principle of active learning or thinking to learn

67
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:24,147
as we have described throughout this course.

68
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:26,705
Spaced practice applies to children and adults

69
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:29,484
of all ages for any subject

70
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:32,052
and it&#39;s useful for memorizing basic facts

71
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:34,611
in addition to learning complex skills

72
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:37,166
and high order thinking.

73
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,490
Lets now talk about how this principle

74
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,441
applies to designing curricula,

75
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:44,925
choosing teaching strategies and planning homework.

76
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,886
Recall, however, that our basic operating assumption

77
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:49,942
is that we want to create long-lasting

78
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:53,542
and transferable understanding for students.

79
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:57,047
The first move in applying the concept of spaced practice

80
00:03:57,047 --> 00:04:00,618
is to identify the most important concepts and skills

81
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:02,885
you want your students to walk out of your class,

82
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:05,445
department, or school knowing,

83
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:10,443
what&#39;s most worth learning for the future for every learner.

84
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:13,458
This will then provide a sense of priority and focus

85
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,684
for what is to be learned in a distributed way.

86
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:18,203
It&#39;s also the first step

87
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:21,870
in what Grant Wiggins calls backward design.

88
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,584
And it will prevent you from suffering

89
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:30,906
the futility of trying to teach everything of importance

90
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:32,441
as he puts it.

91
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,377
It will also prevent, hopefully,

92
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:36,694
the student corollary of the futility

93
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,936
of forgetting almost everything of importance.

94
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:42,298
Spaced practice has implications

95
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:43,844
for how you plan the sequencing

96
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:48,149
of priority concepts and skills in your course over time.

97
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:51,003
Instead of teaching a concept or skill intensively

98
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:53,206
over days or weeks as a unit,

99
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:55,401
better would be to plan spreading the learning

100
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:58,438
of the most important concepts over months,

101
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:02,722
returning to them periodically to build and reinforce.

102
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:05,377
This lends itself to a companion spacing principle

103
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:07,138
called interleaving.

104
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:08,608
We discussed this previously

105
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:12,252
in the student learning strategy section of this course.

106
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:13,812
Recall that interleaving involves

107
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,319
spending some time learning one thing,

108
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,545
then pausing to concentrate on learning a second thing,

109
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:21,633
then returning to the first thing

110
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:25,088
and possibly starting to learn a third thing,

111
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:28,076
all occur without fully learning to completion

112
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:30,418
any one of those subjects.

113
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:32,966
This sounds confusing, but it works,

114
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,007
especially if you&#39;re a good planner

115
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:37,585
who can keep track of lots of things.

116
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:40,004
As you can see from this English class example,

117
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:42,696
a teacher could block the four elements of their course

118
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:46,252
and teach each consecutively in a concentrated way.

119
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:49,617
Instead, this teacher has chosen to interleave the topics

120
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:52,386
in a way that makes sense for the material

121
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,053
and the students she&#39;s teaching.

122
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,040
She might even teach a given topic a few days in a row.

123
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,242
It all depends on the subjects at hand

124
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:07,540
and how they build on one another.

125
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,730
Also important of course is how well her students

126
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,076
are grasping the material.

127
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:15,535
The research is strong about how interleaving

128
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:19,347
enhances learning in a spaced practice way.

129
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:21,902
In the session on student learning strategies,

130
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:24,186
we talked about the benefits of interleaving,

131
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,414
but it&#39;s just as effective

132
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:28,961
as a tool for curriculum design and instruction.

133
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,904
With regard to teaching strategies,

134
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:33,210
intentionally and frequently having students

135
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,454
try to recall past learning is important,

136
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:38,225
especially for the skills and knowledge

137
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,510
you want to prioritize.

138
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,750
You can conduct mini reviews periodically in class,

139
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,690
asking students to harken back to important concepts

140
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,171
learned weeks before

141
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:52,598
or to practice important skills learned earlier.

142
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:56,248
This need only take five or so minutes of class time.

143
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,345
Combined with retrieval practice,

144
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:02,635
you have a very potent duo of in-class learning strategies.

145
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:05,059
It&#39;s hard to beat spaced retrieval practice

146
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,337
to increase student learning.

147
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:10,452
For homework, you can include questions or problems

148
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:14,032
that require students to reflect back on previous learning.

149
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,164
Again, the effect is amplified

150
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:18,923
when coupled with retrieval practice.

151
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:23,157
In testing, make your exams, when feasible, cumulative.

152
00:07:23,157 --> 00:07:25,378
You can tell students that any given test

153
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,506
might include not only current material,

154
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,407
but also past material.

155
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:32,711
It&#39;s important that students know in advance

156
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,645
the most important skills and concepts

157
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,441
that will be included from past tests.

158
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:40,004
This means they need to have a clear sense

159
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:43,520
of what the priority skills and knowledge include.

160
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,646
Also test the students unannounced on previous learning.

161
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:51,295
Occasionally regive parts of a test taken weeks before,

162
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,263
focusing on the important prior learnings.

163
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:55,949
Don&#39;t tell them ahead of time,

164
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:58,433
but alert students at the beginning of your course

165
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:02,671
that you will retest and explain the reason for retesting.

166
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:04,538
By doing this, you&#39;re signalling

167
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:06,433
that you value long-term learning

168
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:09,344
and you&#39;re also highlighting learning priorities

169
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:11,490
and at the same time devaluing the short-term

170
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,676
learning benefits of cramming.

171
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:17,001
In addition, it can provide useful information for you

172
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:21,079
about what your students are retaining in enduring ways.

173
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,122
Make sure you speak to your students

174
00:08:23,122 --> 00:08:25,643
about spaced practice and interleaving.

175
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:28,938
They can get frustrated doing it especially at first

176
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:32,085
because they feel like they&#39;re not mastering anything.

177
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:34,964
Also explain to them that concentrated focus

178
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:38,426
on a single topic can provide an illusion of mastery

179
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:41,701
in the short term, but not in a lasting way.

180
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,264
One final note.

181
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:45,415
Sometimes spaced practice is offered up

182
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:47,480
as a way to simply memorize things

183
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,842
in a knowledge on call way.

184
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:52,208
That may be true, but as we all know,

185
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,432
effective critical thinking, problem solving,

186
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:57,692
and decision making all require ready access

187
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:00,068
to critical information and knowledge.

188
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:02,580
In addition, as the work of Anders Ericsson

189
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,728
about how experts are made reveals,

190
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:07,177
one of the crucial factors in their development

191
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:11,580
is deliberate practice extended over long periods of time.

192
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,787
Both spaced practice and interleaving are integral

193
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,983
to becoming an expert in any field or endeavor.

194
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:22,487
As teachers, we may not be developing world class experts,

195
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:24,481
but we surely can model our practices

196
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,398
after their techniques.
