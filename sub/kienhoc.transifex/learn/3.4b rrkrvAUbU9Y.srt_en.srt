0
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:15,818
I need to make a confession at the outset here.

1
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:20,595
A little over 20 years ago, I did something that I regret,

2
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:24,342
something that I&#39;m not particularly proud of.

3
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:28,416
Something that, in many ways, I wish no one would ever know,

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,699
but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.

5
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:32,743
(Laughter)

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,024
In the late 1980s,

7
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:39,443
in a moment of youthful indiscretion,

8
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:40,968
I went to law school.

9
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:42,930
(Laughter)

10
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,103
In America, law is a professional degree:

11
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:50,832
after your university degree, you go on to law school.

12
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:52,296
When I got to law school,

13
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,430
I didn&#39;t do very well.

14
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:57,664
To put it mildly, I didn&#39;t do very well.

15
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:00,695
I, in fact, graduated in the part of my law school class

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,136
that made the top 90% possible.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,382
(Laughter)

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,208
Thank you.

19
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:14,540
I never practiced law a day in my life;

20
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:16,548
I pretty much wasn&#39;t allowed to.

21
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,169
(Laughter)

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,791
But today, against my better judgment,

23
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:25,136
against the advice of my own wife,

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,136
I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills --

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,519
what&#39;s left of those legal skills.

26
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:33,289
I don&#39;t want to tell you a story.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,524
I want to make a case.

28
00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:38,914
I want to make a hard-headed,

29
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:40,136
evidence-based,

30
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,334
dare I say lawyerly case,

31
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:46,107
for rethinking how we run our businesses.

32
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:49,938
So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

33
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:51,405
take a look at this.

34
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:53,736
This is called the candle problem.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,434
Some of you might know it.

36
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,136
It&#39;s created in 1945

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,136
by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,136
He created this experiment

39
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,291
that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science.

40
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:07,136
And here&#39;s how it works. Suppose I&#39;m the experimenter.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,780
I bring you into a room.

42
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:13,028
I give you a candle, some thumbtacks and some matches.

43
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:14,123
And I say to you,

44
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:17,136
&quot;Your job is to attach the candle to the wall

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,286
so the wax doesn&#39;t drip onto the table.&quot;

46
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,845
Now what would you do?

47
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:25,464
Many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall.

48
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:26,826
Doesn&#39;t work.

49
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,580
I saw somebody kind of make the motion over here --

50
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:34,708
some people have a great idea where they light the match,

51
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:37,661
melt the side of the candle, try to adhere it to the wall.

52
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:39,780
It&#39;s an awesome idea. Doesn&#39;t work.

53
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,136
And eventually, after five or ten minutes,

54
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,136
most people figure out the solution,

55
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,905
which you can see here.

56
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:50,719
The key is to overcome what&#39;s called functional fixedness.

57
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:54,707
You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks.

58
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:56,737
But it can also have this other function,

59
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,023
as a platform for the candle.

60
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,136
The candle problem.

61
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,131
I want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem,

62
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:06,614
done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,

63
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,759
who is now at Princeton University, US,

64
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:12,136
This shows the power of incentives.

65
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,136
He gathered his participants and said:

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,985
&quot;I&#39;m going to time you, how quickly you can solve this problem.&quot;

67
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,485
To one group he said,

68
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,136
&quot;I&#39;m going to time you to establish norms,

69
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,701
averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem.&quot;

70
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:29,136
To the second group he offered rewards.

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,883
He said, &quot;If you&#39;re in the top 25% of the fastest times,

72
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:34,915
you get five dollars.

73
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:39,627
If you&#39;re the fastest of everyone we&#39;re testing here today,

74
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,136
you get 20 dollars.&quot;

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,043
Now this is several years ago, adjusted for inflation,

76
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:46,612
it&#39;s a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work.

77
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:48,136
It&#39;s a nice motivator.

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,303
Question:

79
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:52,644
How much faster did this group solve the problem?

80
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:54,783
Answer:

81
00:03:54,807 --> 00:04:00,449
It took them, on average, three and a half minutes longer.

82
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,688
3.5 min longer.

83
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:03,534
This makes no sense, right?

84
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:06,661
I mean, I&#39;m an American. I believe in free markets.

85
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,136
That&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to work, right?

86
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,344
(Laughter)

87
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,283
If you want people to perform better, you reward them. Right?

88
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:17,136
Bonuses, commissions, their own reality show.

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,178
Incentivize them.

90
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:21,405
That&#39;s how business works.

91
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,442
But that&#39;s not happening here.

92
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,136
You&#39;ve got an incentive designed

93
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,956
to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity,

94
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,136
and it does just the opposite.

95
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,136
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.

96
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,091
What&#39;s interesting about this experiment

97
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:37,685
is that it&#39;s not an aberration.

98
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:40,794
This has been replicated over and over again

99
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:43,836
for nearly 40 years.

100
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,136
These contingent motivators --

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,534
if you do this, then you get that --

102
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:50,136
work in some circumstances.

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,972
But for a lot of tasks, they actually either don&#39;t work

104
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,892
or, often, they do harm.

105
00:04:56,848 --> 00:05:01,737
This is one of the most robust findings in social science,

106
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:05,294
and also one of the most ignored.

107
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:06,908
I spent the last couple of years

108
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,003
looking at the science of human motivation,

109
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:11,389
particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators

110
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:13,136
and intrinsic motivators.

111
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,572
And I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s not even close.

112
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:17,934
If you look at the science, there is a mismatch

113
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,811
between what science knows

114
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:21,246
and what business does.

115
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,516
What&#39;s alarming here is that our business operating system --

116
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,848
think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses,

117
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:31,581
how we motivate people, how we apply our human resources--

118
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,860
it&#39;s built entirely around these extrinsic motivators,

119
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:37,455
around carrots and sticks.

120
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,668
That&#39;s actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks.

121
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,803
But for 21st century tasks,

122
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:47,358
that mechanistic, reward-and-punishment approach

123
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:49,050
doesn&#39;t work,

124
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,556
often doesn&#39;t work,

125
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,751
and often does harm.

126
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:52,958
Let me show you.

127
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:56,059
Glucksberg did another similar experiment,

128
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,696
he presented the problem in a slightly different way,

129
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,740
like this up here.

130
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:03,939
Attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn&#39;t drip onto the table.

131
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,439
Same deal. You: we&#39;re timing for norms.

132
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:08,905
You: we&#39;re incentivizing.

133
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,380
What happened this time?

134
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,564
This time, the incentivized group kicked the other group&#39;s butt.

135
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:18,603
Why?

136
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:21,921
Because when the tacks are out of the box,

137
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:23,577
it&#39;s pretty easy isn&#39;t it?

138
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:27,871
(Laughter)

139
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:32,873
If-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks,

140
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:34,613
where there is a simple set of rules

141
00:06:34,637 --> 00:06:37,136
and a clear destination to go to.

142
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,136
Rewards, by their very nature,

143
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,136
narrow our focus, concentrate the mind;

144
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,495
that&#39;s why they work in so many cases.

145
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,598
So, for tasks like this,

146
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:48,975
a narrow focus, where you just see the goal right there,

147
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:50,379
zoom straight ahead to it,

148
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:52,032
they work really well.

149
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:54,776
But for the real candle problem,

150
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,792
you don&#39;t want to be looking like this.

151
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,946
The solution is on the periphery. You want to be looking around.

152
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,597
That reward actually narrows our focus

153
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,136
and restricts our possibility.

154
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,130
Let me tell you why this is so important.

155
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:10,439
In western Europe,

156
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,548
in many parts of Asia,

157
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:14,347
in North America, in Australia,

158
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:17,937
white-collar workers are doing less of this kind of work,

159
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:20,341
and more of this kind of work.

160
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,996
That routine, rule-based, left-brain work --

161
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,736
certain kinds of accounting, financial analysis,

162
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,455
computer programming --

163
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,674
has become fairly easy to outsource,

164
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,729
fairly easy to automate.

165
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,929
Software can do it faster.

166
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:38,278
Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.

167
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:41,270
So what really matters

168
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,922
are the more right-brained creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.

169
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:48,327
Think about your own work.

170
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:50,096
Think about your own work.

171
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,615
Are the problems that you face,

172
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,136
or even the problems we&#39;ve been talking about here,

173
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,048
do they have a clear set of rules,

174
00:07:58,072 --> 00:07:59,659
and a single solution?

175
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:02,136
No. The rules are mystifying.

176
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,406
The solution, if it exists at all,

177
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,136
is surprising and not obvious.

178
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,914
Everybody in this room

179
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:14,136
is dealing with their own version of the candle problem.

180
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,297
And for candle problems of any kind,

181
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,991
in any field,

182
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:22,008
those if-then rewards,

183
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:26,274
the things around which we&#39;ve built so many of our businesses,

184
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,131
don&#39;t work!

185
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:30,611
It makes me crazy.

186
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,571
And here&#39;s the thing.

187
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,651
This is not a feeling.

188
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:38,950
Okay? I&#39;m a lawyer; I don&#39;t believe in feelings.

189
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:42,617
This is not a philosophy.

190
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,903
I&#39;m an American; I don&#39;t believe in philosophy.

191
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:46,614
(Laughter)

192
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,493
This is a fact --

193
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,961
or, as we say in my hometown of Washington, D.C.,

194
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:54,575
a true fact.

195
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,043
(Laughter)

196
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:00,861
(Applause)

197
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:02,527
Let me give you an example.

198
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:04,136
Let me marshal the evidence here.

199
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,273
I&#39;m not telling a story, I&#39;m making a case.

200
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,568
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, some evidence:

201
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:11,967
Dan Ariely, one of the great economists of our time,

202
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:15,462
he and three colleagues did a study of some MIT students.

203
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:18,136
They gave these MIT students a bunch of games,

204
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,136
games that involved creativity,

205
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,438
and motor skills, and concentration.

206
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,543
And the offered them, for performance,

207
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,581
three levels of rewards:

208
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:30,851
small reward, medium reward, large reward.

209
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:35,012
If you do really well you get the large reward, on down.

210
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:36,370
What happened?

211
00:09:36,394 --> 00:09:39,136
As long as the task involved only mechanical skill

212
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,136
bonuses worked as they would be expected:

213
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,857
the higher the pay, the better the performance.

214
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:46,032
Okay?

215
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:51,136
But once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill,

216
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,232
a larger reward led to poorer performance.

217
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,406
Then they said,

218
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,565
&quot;Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s any cultural bias here.

219
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:02,542
Let&#39;s go to Madurai, India and test it.&quot;

220
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,136
Standard of living is lower.

221
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,637
In Madurai, a reward that is modest in North American standards,

222
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:09,002
is more meaningful there.

223
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,261
Same deal. A bunch of games, three levels of rewards.

224
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:14,374
What happens?

225
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:18,301
People offered the medium level of rewards

226
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:20,905
did no better than people offered the small rewards.

227
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:25,408
But this time, people offered the highest rewards,

228
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:26,928
they did the worst of all.

229
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:32,350
In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments,

230
00:10:32,374 --> 00:10:35,843
higher incentives led to worse performance.

231
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:43,610
Is this some kind of touchy-feely socialist conspiracy going on here?

232
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:46,410
No, these are economists from MIT,

233
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:49,136
from Carnegie Mellon, from the University of Chicago.

234
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,781
Do you know who sponsored this research?

235
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:55,925
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.

236
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,769
That&#39;s the American experience.

237
00:10:57,793 --> 00:11:00,568
Let&#39;s go across the pond to the London School of Economics,

238
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:03,136
LSE, London School of Economics,

239
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,604
alma mater of eleven Nobel Laureates in economics.

240
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:09,136
Training ground for great economic thinkers

241
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,136
like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,

242
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,447
and Mick Jagger.

243
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,770
(Laughter)

244
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:16,564
Last month,

245
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:18,087
just last month,

246
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,136
economists at LSE looked at 51 studies

247
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,136
of pay-for-performance plans, inside of companies.

248
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,611
Here&#39;s what they said:

249
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,431
&quot;We find that financial incentives

250
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:31,508
can result in a negative impact on overall performance.&quot;

251
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:36,635
There is a mismatch between what science knows

252
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,136
and what business does.

253
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,437
And what worries me, as we stand here in the rubble

254
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,136
of the economic collapse,

255
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,136
is that too many organizations are making their decisions,

256
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,532
their policies about talent and people,

257
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:53,683
based on assumptions that are outdated,

258
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:54,897
unexamined,

259
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:57,683
and rooted more in folklore than in science.

260
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:01,136
And if we really want to get out of this economic mess,

261
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,253
if we really want high performance

262
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,724
on those definitional tasks of the 21st century,

263
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:11,688
the solution is not to do more of the wrong things,

264
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:14,035
to entice people with a sweeter carrot,

265
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:16,458
or threaten them with a sharper stick.

266
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,136
We need a whole new approach.

267
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,136
The good news is that the scientists

268
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,348
who&#39;ve been studying motivation have given us this new approach.

269
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:26,467
It&#39;s built much more around intrinsic motivation.

270
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,946
Around the desire to do things because they matter,

271
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,533
because we like it, they&#39;re interesting, or part of something important.

272
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:36,136
And to my mind, that new operating system for our businesses

273
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,861
revolves around three elements:

274
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:41,136
autonomy, mastery and purpose.

275
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,136
Autonomy: the urge to direct our own lives.

276
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,405
Mastery: the desire to get better and better at something that matters.

277
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:51,136
Purpose: the yearning to do what we do

278
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,353
in the service of something larger than ourselves.

279
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:57,671
These are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system

280
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:59,136
for our businesses.

281
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,721
I want to talk today only about autonomy.

282
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,136
In the 20th century, we came up with this idea of management.

283
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,454
Management did not emanate from nature.

284
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:12,136
Management is not a tree, it&#39;s a television set.

285
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,384
Somebody invented it.

286
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:16,408
It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to work forever.

287
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:18,439
Management is great.

288
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,517
Traditional notions of management are great

289
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,136
if you want compliance.

290
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,343
But if you want engagement, self-direction works better.

291
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:29,407
Some examples of some kind of radical notions of self-direction.

292
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:32,367
You don&#39;t see a lot of it,

293
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:35,867
but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on,

294
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:39,534
what it means is paying people adequately and fairly, absolutely --

295
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:41,843
getting the issue of money off the table,

296
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:43,842
and then giving people lots of autonomy.

297
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,136
Some examples.

298
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,105
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian?

299
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,136
It looks like less than half.

300
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,565
(Laughter)

301
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:57,136
Atlassian is an Australian software company.

302
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,131
And they do something incredibly cool.

303
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:01,899
A few times a year they tell their engineers,

304
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:05,929
&quot;Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want,

305
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:08,063
as long as it&#39;s not part of your regular job.

306
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:09,477
Work on anything you want.&quot;

307
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:13,264
Engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code,

308
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:14,730
come up with an elegant hack.

309
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,720
Then they present all of the stuff that they&#39;ve developed

310
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:20,464
to their teammates, to the rest of the company,

311
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:24,440
in this wild and woolly all-hands meeting at the end of the day.

312
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,659
Being Australians, everybody has a beer.

313
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:28,703
They call them FedEx Days.

314
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:30,641
Why?

315
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:34,063
Because you have to deliver something overnight.

316
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:36,544
It&#39;s pretty; not bad.

317
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:39,236
It&#39;s a huge trademark violation, but it&#39;s pretty clever.

318
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,597
(Laughter)

319
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:42,299
That one day of intense autonomy

320
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:44,375
has produced a whole array of software fixes

321
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,136
that might never have existed.

322
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,228
It&#39;s worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level

323
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:50,310
with 20% time --

324
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,502
done, famously, at Google --

325
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:54,588
where engineers can spend 20% of their time

326
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:56,557
working on anything they want.

327
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,248
They have autonomy over their time,

328
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,485
their task, their team, their technique.

329
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:02,463
Radical amounts of autonomy.

330
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:06,413
And at Google, as many of you know,

331
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:08,770
about half of the new products in a typical year

332
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:11,270
are birthed during that 20% time:

333
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:14,136
things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.

334
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,080
Let me give you an even more radical example of it:

335
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:20,977
something called the Results Only Work Environment (the ROWE),

336
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:23,067
created by two American consultants,

337
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:25,770
in place at a dozen companies around North America.

338
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:28,399
In a ROWE people don&#39;t have schedules.

339
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,375
They show up when they want.

340
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,453
They don&#39;t have to be in the office at a certain time, or any time.

341
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,422
They just have to get their work done.

342
00:15:37,446 --> 00:15:41,605
How they do it, when they do it, where they do it, is totally up to them.

343
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:45,975
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional.

344
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,500
What happens?

345
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:50,235
Almost across the board,

346
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:53,469
productivity goes up, worker engagement goes up,

347
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:57,136
worker satisfaction goes up, turnover goes down.

348
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,136
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

349
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,772
the building blocks of a new way of doing things.

350
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:04,136
Some of you might look at this and say,

351
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,620
&quot;Hmm, that sounds nice, but it&#39;s Utopian.&quot;

352
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:08,998
And I say, &quot;Nope.

353
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,093
I have proof.&quot;

354
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,136
The mid-1990s, Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta.

355
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,477
They had deployed all the right incentives,

356
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:23,350
They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles.

357
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,963
Well-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing

358
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:28,245
to make sure it came in on budget and on time.

359
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,664
A few years later, another encyclopedia got started.

360
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:34,085
Different model, right?

361
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:37,166
Do it for fun.

362
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,757
No one gets paid a cent, or a euro or a yen.

363
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,180
Do it because you like to do it.

364
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:45,136
Just 10 years ago,

365
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,409
if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,

366
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:51,008
&quot;Hey, I&#39;ve got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia.

367
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:53,953
If they went head to head, who would win?&quot;

368
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:57,543
10 years ago you could not have found a single sober economist

369
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,787
anywhere on planet Earth

370
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,683
who would have predicted the Wikipedia model.

371
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:05,406
This is the titanic battle between these two approaches.

372
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,498
This is the Ali-Frazier of motivation, right?

373
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:10,361
This is the Thrilla in Manila.

374
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:13,554
Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators.

375
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,136
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

376
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,717
versus carrot and sticks, and who wins?

377
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:21,271
Intrinsic motivation, autonomy, mastery and purpose, in a knockout.

378
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:22,295
Let me wrap up.

379
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:27,986
There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.

380
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,597
Here is what science knows.

381
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:31,304
One: Those 20th century rewards,

382
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:34,308
those motivators we think are a natural part of business,

383
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:38,033
do work, but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances.

384
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,850
Two: Those if-then rewards often destroy creativity.

385
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:46,674
Three: The secret to high performance isn&#39;t rewards and punishments,

386
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,308
but that unseen intrinsic drive--

387
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:51,136
the drive to do things for their own sake.

388
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,136
The drive to do things cause they matter.

389
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,136
And here&#39;s the best part.

390
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,380
We already know this.

391
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:58,954
The science confirms what we know in our hearts.

392
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:03,808
So, if we repair this mismatch between science and business,

393
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,765
if we bring our motivation, notions of motivation

394
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,516
into the 21st century,

395
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,554
if we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology

396
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:14,610
of carrots and sticks,

397
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:17,363
we can strengthen our businesses,

398
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,969
we can solve a lot of those candle problems,

399
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:22,725
and maybe, maybe --

400
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,913
we can change the world.

401
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:27,242
I rest my case.

402
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:30,266
(Applause)
