0
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:10,316
- We discussed earlier the learning power

1
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:12,132
of a growth mindset.

2
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:14,758
It can help students push through challenges,

3
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:16,298
enhance their performance,

4
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:19,451
and close stubborn achievement gaps.

5
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:20,931
Why might the growth mindset have

6
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:23,390
such a large influence on us?

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,176
Earlier, we introduced a model,

8
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:27,580
illustrating how non-cognitive factors

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,950
interact and influence one another.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,256
That model suggests that mindsets affect

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,050
range of other factors, including social skills,

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,710
learning strategies, academic behaviors, and perseverance.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,172
And if students can improve in these interconnected areas,

14
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:47,381
they&#39;re highly likely to perform better.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,361
Over time then, we can help students

16
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:53,092
shift from a negative cycle to a more a virtuous one,

17
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:56,561
with each small positive change increasing momentum

18
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:58,741
for further positive ones.

19
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:00,947
So how can we do this?

20
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:03,059
What follows are five strategies

21
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,821
to encourage a growth mindset.

22
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:09,404
First, set high standards and expectations.

23
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:14,362
Students will tend to strive toward whatever bar we set.

24
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:18,053
If we keep it low, we&#39;re likely to suppress achievement.

25
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:21,349
If we set it too high, and don&#39;t provide proper support,

26
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,553
students will give up

27
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:25,641
and we&#39;ll just reinforce a fixed mindset.

28
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:28,036
Instead, set standards and expectations

29
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:30,871
that are ambitious but attainable.

30
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,519
This requires really knowing

31
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,348
your students and your material,

32
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:38,047
but once you&#39;re confident you&#39;ve set the right standards,

33
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:40,755
then you can ask a lot from them.

34
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:43,381
For instance, the growth mindset framing tool,

35
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:46,396
which can be found on the Mindset Works website,

36
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:49,751
provides guidance on how to communicate learning goals.

37
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,870
It suggests telling students,

38
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,214
this is going to be challenging

39
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:57,381
to learn but all of you can reach that goal, stretch for it.

40
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,311
One of the great gifts of teaching is

41
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:04,535
seeing students succeed when they didn&#39;t think they could.

42
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,413
Keep in mind, when you&#39;re truly challenging your students,

43
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:08,965
to let them know that struggle

44
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:11,688
is an integral part of the learning.

45
00:02:11,688 --> 00:02:14,016
We all struggle and can get confused

46
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:16,806
when we encounter new intellectual challenges.

47
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:20,795
It&#39;s normal so set high standards and expectations

48
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:24,002
but also provide ongoing support.

49
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:27,919
Second, establish short-term, achievable goals.

50
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:32,137
Students may give up in the face of high standards,

51
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:35,245
especially students who have a fixed mindset.

52
00:02:35,245 --> 00:02:37,593
To help them, offer practical strategies

53
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:41,775
that break down tasks into smaller steps they can reach.

54
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:45,983
Each small step they achieve leads to a small win.

55
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:48,591
Over time, those small wins reinforce their sense

56
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:53,289
of self-efficacy and confidence in moving forward.

57
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,956
Third, give meaningful feedback.

58
00:02:57,115 --> 00:03:00,304
Teachers who have mastered the pedagogy of growth mindset

59
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:04,004
provide ongoing, constructive feedback.

60
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:05,850
They&#39;re careful not to correct mistakes

61
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,151
that students can fix on their own but otherwise,

62
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:11,170
they&#39;re continuously helping students

63
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,551
to identify their own mistakes, explain them,

64
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:17,398
and articulate what can be learned.

65
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:18,975
The more we help students become

66
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:21,092
comfortable with honest mistakes,

67
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:24,963
and use them to respond differently the next time,

68
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:26,314
the more they&#39;ll come to believe

69
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:29,148
in the process of learning itself.

70
00:03:29,148 --> 00:03:32,054
Remember, not all feedback is constructive.

71
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:34,208
When I was a kid, I used to get essays back

72
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,634
with just a grade.

73
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,254
It was a form of feedback,

74
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:40,004
but it gave me no sense of how to get better.

75
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:42,876
What mattered, those teachers seemed to be telling me,

76
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:44,769
was just that single grade,

77
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:47,735
not producing better writing the next time.

78
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:51,556
Other times, teachers mark passages vague.

79
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:54,218
In junior high, when vague was written on my paper,

80
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:57,534
I had no idea what my teacher didn&#39;t understand

81
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:59,426
about what I had written.

82
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:02,672
I wish those teachers had offered comments instead.

83
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:05,069
For instance, this passage confuses me.

84
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:06,861
I think you&#39;re trying to say the following

85
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:09,379
but right now, I&#39;m not sure.

86
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,902
Then I would have understood what

87
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:13,044
I needed to explain differently.

88
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,503
It would have given me enough support

89
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:16,004
to know what I needed to do,

90
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:19,643
but left the actual work of doing it to me.

91
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:21,703
Now, be careful when giving feedback

92
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:24,804
about simply telling students to work harder.

93
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:26,053
If they don&#39;t know what to do because

94
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,942
they don&#39;t have the necessary knowledge

95
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:30,627
or skills or don&#39;t realize they do,

96
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:34,266
you can easily push them toward a more fixed mindset.

97
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:37,340
But if they&#39;re capable, asking them to work harder

98
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,313
can be a great thing, especially if you tell them

99
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,543
you&#39;re expecting a lot because you believe

100
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:45,099
they have the capacity to do well

101
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:48,465
and just observe to make sure they do.

102
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:51,479
Next, be sure that students are able to use

103
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,045
in meaningful ways the important feedback you give them.

104
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,570
As the educator Dylan Wiliam says,

105
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,596
&quot;the only thing that matters about feedback

106
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:03,754
&quot;is what students do with it.&quot;

107
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:06,430
Finally, we need to provide the time for students

108
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,644
to process the feedback we give them

109
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:12,193
and then directly apply it to revise their work.

110
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:14,339
Useful feedback improves performance

111
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:16,618
by developing more effective effort,

112
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:18,662
something that students can see in a way

113
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:21,593
that fuels the growth mindset.

114
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:23,432
Without the opportunity to improve

115
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:26,130
the quality of their effort, students are unlikely

116
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,412
to improve and this can cause them

117
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,083
to revert to a fixed mindset.

118
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,910
I&#39;m trying really hard, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work,

119
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,597
so maybe I&#39;m not so smart.

120
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:40,006
Meaningful feedback that students will use

121
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,506
breaks this cycle.

122
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,708
Fourth, praise carefully.

123
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:49,970
Praise is essential but we must give it carefully.

124
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,174
Let&#39;s start with three common forms of praise to avoid.

125
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:56,549
First, avoid praising students for

126
00:05:56,549 --> 00:06:00,031
working hard alone or for a long time.

127
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:02,635
What matters is effective effort,

128
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:06,685
not just trying an unworkable strategy over and over.

129
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:10,064
This means we need to help them discern productive effort

130
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:13,449
from effort that doesn&#39;t really lead to improvement.

131
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:14,710
A later session of this course

132
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,212
will describe how to help students

133
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:19,546
develop effective learning strategies.

134
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,563
Second, avoid praising students

135
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:24,121
for something that isn&#39;t worthy of praise

136
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:26,469
and definitely avoid meaningless jargon,

137
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,647
such as every mistake is a step forward.

138
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:33,367
Students can smell mindless praise from a mile away.

139
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,771
They tend not to hear what you&#39;ve said,

140
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,335
but rather, I don&#39;t know you,

141
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,001
or I don&#39;t actually believe you can do this.

142
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,440
Finally, avoid praising students for personal traits.

143
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,098
Calling a child gifted or saying you&#39;re so smart

144
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:51,440
can produce students who won&#39;t take risks

145
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,901
for fear of confirming that they&#39;re not gifted

146
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:57,360
or not smart if they don&#39;t succeed.

147
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,411
The best kind of praise then

148
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:03,021
focuses on the process of learning.

149
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,261
It acknowledges what students did right,

150
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,773
what effective steps they took,

151
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:10,525
and what adjustments they made.

152
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,464
Dweck suggests saying something like,

153
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:15,175
well done, you tried different strategies

154
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:16,676
and you figured it out

155
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:19,828
or, wow, you really practiced that the right way

156
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:22,420
and look at how much you&#39;ve improved.

157
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,539
Help students see how to try to hard and work effectively

158
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:30,040
and you&#39;ll put them on the right path to learning.

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,540
Fifth, embrace the word &quot;yet&quot;.

160
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:36,971
In a TED Talk, Carol Dweck notes,

161
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:41,138
just the words yet or not yet give kids greater confidence

162
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,995
because you convey your belief that they&#39;re capable

163
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:47,645
of mastering the skill with effort.

164
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:50,895
Not yet encourages greater persistence.

165
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:55,450
Students need to feel that you believe in their capacity

166
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,617
to do well through their own effective effort and hard work.

167
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:02,659
These five techniques we&#39;ve described

168
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,579
promote the growth mindset and bring a cascade

169
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:08,861
of other self-reinforcing benefits.

170
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:11,679
In subsequent sessions, we&#39;ll discuss ways to help students

171
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:16,339
translate a growth mindset into higher academic performance.

172
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:20,651
All this won&#39;t transform students overnight but over time,

173
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:24,818
these methods can bring real and powerful results.
