0
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,974
- Have you ever tried to complete a simple task

1
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:13,410
and given up after a short time because you just

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,244
couldn&#39;t get it done?

3
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:17,052
Maybe you were trying to read while you were

4
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:18,597
worried about something.

5
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:19,981
You got to the bottom of the page

6
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:22,967
and you realized you had no idea what you just read?

7
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:24,712
This happens to everyone.

8
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:27,944
Our ability to function effectively in a mental sense

9
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,185
can become temporarily overwhelmed

10
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:32,408
and we suffer the consequences.

11
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:34,734
We know this happens with our students too.

12
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,564
They are sometimes asked to undertake a set of tasks

13
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:40,937
that exceed their capacity to complete successfully.

14
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:43,226
Fortunately, in situations like this,

15
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:47,325
perceptive teachers usually pause, change things around

16
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:49,065
and then begin again.

17
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:52,393
This situation of over matching of our student&#39;s capacity

18
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:56,558
to effectively mentally process is important to understand.

19
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,173
Before we do that, let&#39;s review the memory model

20
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:02,107
we studied during the first week of this MOOC.

21
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:05,304
What can you recall about making, storing,

22
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:07,272
and retrieving memories?

23
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:09,525
What were the most important takeaway concepts

24
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:11,656
for you as a teacher?

25
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:14,431
We will briefly pause for you to recollect.

26
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:18,598
Perhaps drawing a flow chart or a picture might help.

27
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,568
Okay, here it is.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,706
An important feature of the model is that memories

29
00:01:31,706 --> 00:01:34,967
are formed through the dialog or active processing between

30
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:37,664
working memory and long term memory.

31
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,069
In other words, we have to think to learn

32
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:43,545
in order to encode and make durable memories.

33
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:45,596
The cognitive scientist Daniel Willingham

34
00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:47,696
captures this elegantly in the phrase,

35
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:51,339
&quot;Memory is the residue of thought.&quot;

36
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:54,246
What&#39;s leftover after thinking and reflecting

37
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,184
or creating interaction between working

38
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:59,308
and long-term memory is the stuff of learning.

39
00:01:59,308 --> 00:02:03,475
In other words, learning is changes in long term memory.

40
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,613
We started off this session by talking about

41
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:10,273
how our mental processing capacity can be overloaded

42
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:13,574
and we know this has a lot to do with working memory.

43
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:16,088
Recall that working memory has a limited capacity

44
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:17,501
and duration.

45
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:19,989
It can&#39;t hold a lot of information and it lasts

46
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:22,156
at most, 20 to 30 seconds.

47
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,213
This is important because it is the gateway

48
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:28,195
to long term memory and the nexus of most of our

49
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:30,086
thinking and reasoning.

50
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:32,713
One way to think about this is to learn about the concept

51
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:34,696
of Cognitive Load.

52
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,708
Cognitive Load is the total amount of mental capacity

53
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:41,458
imposed on working memory in any one instant.

54
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:48,449
Unfortunately, the capacity of our student&#39;s cognitive load

55
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:51,455
can frequently be exceeded or overloaded,

56
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:54,624
which significantly impairs their learning.

57
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:58,121
For example, consider a student studying in her room

58
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,715
doing history homework.

59
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:02,204
We hope that a maximal amount of her working memory

60
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:05,451
is being used to focus on reading and understanding

61
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,615
her history text.

62
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:09,205
However, if she is periodically attending to

63
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:12,497
text messages coming through on her cell phone

64
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:15,699
and she&#39;s also distracted by the sound of her little sister

65
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,353
practicing piano in the next room,

66
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:20,723
then her cognitive load is high.

67
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:24,104
There&#39;s a lot going on in her working memory.

68
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,782
In addition, if the history you&#39;re reading contains

69
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:30,765
many new vocabulary words and requires prior knowledge

70
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:34,538
she can&#39;t easily retrieve, what is already a high

71
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:37,936
cognitive load becomes even bigger.

72
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:40,994
She has to work harder to understand the reading

73
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:43,886
and she may even become stressed, which can begin

74
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:47,851
to occupy some of her precious working memory capacity.

75
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:52,170
The result, she becomes cognitively overloaded.

76
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,354
As a consequence, under these homework conditions,

77
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:57,961
not as much intended learning from the history reading

78
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,638
will happen.

79
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:03,962
The same thing can and does happen in classrooms.

80
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:06,221
Here&#39;s a way to think about this to help inform

81
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:07,621
your teaching.

82
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:10,946
We can sort cognitive load into three buckets.

83
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:13,718
The first is when working memory is able to focus

84
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:15,980
on the learning task at hand.

85
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,217
In our example, it was processing the history reading

86
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:21,623
to generate meaningful memories.

87
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:24,233
We call that Effective Load and it&#39;s something we want

88
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,233
to maximize.

89
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:29,338
We also wanna minimize how much of our working memory

90
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:31,440
is focused on distractions.

91
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,430
The lures of digital devices and the less than optimal

92
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,636
study environments make this a challenge

93
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:38,795
for many young learners.

94
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:41,293
That&#39;s the second cognitive load bucket.

95
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:43,526
We&#39;ll call this Ineffective Load

96
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:46,116
and we want that to be minimized.

97
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:48,825
Finally, the complexity of the learning task

98
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:51,229
will also consume some working memory.

99
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,701
The more difficult it is, the more working memory

100
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:57,128
will be required to simply make sense of the task,

101
00:04:57,128 --> 00:05:00,598
even before it is processed to encode memories.

102
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:04,466
We&#39;ll call this third bucket Task Difficulty Load.

103
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:07,506
As teachers, we have a lot of control over the degree

104
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:11,199
of task difficulty load or a student&#39;s experience.

105
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,598
This is reflected in the choice of activities we ask

106
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:14,777
them to do.

107
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:18,082
Both during class and for homework.

108
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:20,094
The teaching challenge is to match,

109
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:22,826
for as many of our students as possible,

110
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:25,585
the level of difficulty of a cognitive task

111
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:29,181
with the skills and prior knowledge of the students.

112
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:31,743
We will say more about this later.

113
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:34,492
You can see by this diagram that we want to minimize

114
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:38,511
ineffective load, manage task difficulty load,

115
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:41,298
and maximize effective load.

116
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:43,493
All of these are to one degree or another

117
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:48,357
under our influence as we work with and advise our students.

118
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:51,345
One teaching complication is that cognitive load can differ

119
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:54,570
from child to child in the same learning environment

120
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,162
and even for the same child from day to day.

121
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:01,795
Knowing how to diagnose and respond to learner diversity

122
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,945
is one key to effective teaching.

123
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:06,655
As teachers, there is much we can do

124
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:09,278
and even avoid to help students manage their

125
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:12,742
cognitive load so that learning is optimized.

126
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:15,853
For those interested in learning more about cognitive load

127
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,944
and it&#39;s instructional implications,

128
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,492
please see the Teaching Strategies

129
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:22,523
section of our MOOC.

130
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:25,954
There, you&#39;ll find a variety of suggestions and ideas

131
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:28,277
about how to translate the learning concepts

132
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:30,853
we&#39;ve discussed into teaching strategies

133
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:33,017
for your own practice.

134
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,410
The take home message for this session is that learners

135
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,408
can process only a limited amount of information at once.

136
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:42,356
So, we need to be mindful of our role in unintentionally

137
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:46,344
overloading student&#39;s finite working memory capacity.

138
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:49,213
We want their cognitive load to be maximally focused

139
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:52,183
on effective learning processes.

140
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:54,704
In addition, we need to encourage students to be

141
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:57,942
equally mindful of how, when, and where they choose

142
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:00,726
to study and learn, a topic for a later session

143
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:03,226
about self-regulated learning.
