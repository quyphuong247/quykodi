00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:10,261
- How do we help our students create memories

1
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,861
that last and can be retrieved when they need them?

2
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,347
Cognitive scientist Daniel Willingham

3
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:19,386
in his book Why Students Don&#39;t Like School

4
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,931
makes the simple but profound statement,

5
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:26,631
&quot;Memory is the residue of thought.&quot;

6
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:31,403
Let&#39;s explore the deeper meaning of what he is saying.

7
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:34,605
We&#39;ll begin by reviewing the elements of the simple

8
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:38,878
model of memory we described in earlier sessions.

9
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,893
Incoming information is perceived by our senses

10
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:46,929
and whittled down by our attentional filters.

11
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,988
As this information enters working memory, it can begin

12
00:00:50,988 --> 00:00:55,101
to be processed in interaction with long term memory.

13
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:59,109
If it&#39;s not, within a relatively short period of time,

14
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:01,890
it will be lost, since our working memory

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,835
lasts usually less than 30 seconds.

16
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:08,380
This is why students can be paying rapt attention

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,911
to what is going on around them in class,

18
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,706
like listening to their teacher present a lesson,

19
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:17,844
but at the end of 15 minutes, not remember much of anything.

20
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,723
How is this possible?

21
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:23,821
If students haven&#39;t engaged and processed in an active way

22
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,899
what they are hearing or seeing, it&#39;s simply lost

23
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:31,182
as it disappears from short term memory.

24
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:35,143
But what do we mean by process in an active way?

25
00:01:35,143 --> 00:01:39,310
Well, to learn something, that is, to make durable memories,

26
00:01:40,772 --> 00:01:43,283
we need to transfer information

27
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:46,572
from working memory into our long term memory.

28
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:50,549
In other words, to link the new to what is already existing

29
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,712
in our memories, as we discussed in the last session.

30
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:56,980
How do we do this?

31
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,281
Most often by consciously processing it.

32
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:03,705
This means to think about the new information

33
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:06,448
entering initially into our working memory

34
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:09,460
by reaching into long term memory to connect it

35
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,338
meaningfully with prior knowledge and memories.

36
00:02:13,338 --> 00:02:16,195
The more we do this thinking and processing

37
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:18,675
between working and long term memory,

38
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:21,264
the more likely it will stick.

39
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:24,130
Let me give you a simple example.

40
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,963
What comes to mind when I say the word friend?

41
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,332
Take some time to think.

42
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:37,453
My question initially caused you to think

43
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:40,378
about the meaning of the word, and then you began

44
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:44,117
to relate that meaning to other words and concepts.

45
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:46,849
What does it mean to be a friend?

46
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,649
Who are my friends and how do I know?

47
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:52,745
Who is my best friend, and so on?

48
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:55,703
That dynamic network of associations

49
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:59,967
and connections you conjured is a form of deep processing.

50
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:03,685
If I then asked you later, do you remember

51
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:07,876
the word I asked you to think about a few days ago?

52
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:11,030
You would probably have a good chance of remembering it

53
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,796
because of that act of processing.

54
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:16,485
On the other hand, you could process

55
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:19,115
the same word in a shallow way.

56
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,928
I could ask you to count how many letters

57
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:25,424
the word friend has, and how many vowels,

58
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:27,788
then have you spell it backwards

59
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:30,580
and arrange its letters in alphabetical order,

60
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,185
all aspects of the word that are largely

61
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:35,728
devoid of meaning and context.

62
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:39,091
You will probably be much less likely later

63
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:43,304
to remember that friend was the word I asked you about.

64
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:46,955
Another example of a form of deep processing

65
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:50,066
would be if I gave you a list of 10 words

66
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:53,899
and asked you to memorize them in two minutes.

67
00:03:56,498 --> 00:04:00,180
You could probably do it, but it would likely

68
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,319
be easier if you made a story out of them,

69
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,229
a not uncommon mnemonic strategy.

70
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:09,589
For example, you could imagine a car crashing

71
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:12,220
through a gigantic stretched out map

72
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,558
and on the other side is a toy top spinning

73
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:17,462
precariously on a cable floating in midair,

74
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:20,982
and underneath the top is a policeman standing on one hand

75
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:23,734
while looking at a pocket watch held up

76
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:26,805
in his other hand, and he then suddenly spits out

77
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:29,859
a blue blob that slowly floats away,

78
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:32,807
or something like that, you get the idea.

79
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:35,683
The process of thinking about how to connect

80
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:38,269
the new information, the list of words,

81
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:41,533
to information from your long term memory in some sort

82
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:45,712
of narrative is what will make the words more memorable.

83
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:49,879
This process is often called elaborative rehearsal.

84
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,000
By creating an active dialogue between working memory

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,676
and long term memory, by thinking to learn,

86
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:01,843
we extend, elaborate, connect, modify,

87
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:06,248
and/or consolidate new memories.

88
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:10,176
What&#39;s created and remains as a result of this thought

89
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,797
are memories, or residues in Willingham&#39;s terms,

90
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:17,191
linked to previously existing knowledge.

91
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,941
Memory is the residue of thought.

92
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:24,227
The more our students think about what they are learning

93
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:28,542
by asking themselves questions to link new knowledge to old

94
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:31,977
and working to put things into their own words,

95
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:35,633
the more enduring will be the memories they make.

96
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,835
Here&#39;s a corollary to this principle of learning,

97
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:41,800
one that may seem counter-intuitive.

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,893
Deep and enduring learning is almost always

99
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:47,433
effortful and difficult.

100
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:49,587
Making mistakes and errors,

101
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:53,163
even being confused can be good for learning,

102
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:56,598
that is, if in the process of correcting the mistakes,

103
00:05:56,598 --> 00:06:00,197
thinking about the errors, and resolving confusion,

104
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:04,511
active processing happens in just the way we have described.

105
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:08,598
These struggles can actually enhance learning.

106
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,395
The cognitive scientists Robert and Elizabeth Bjork

107
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:15,101
call this desirable difficulties,

108
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:17,929
intentionally created by teachers.

109
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:21,037
When learning is easy and not very effortful,

110
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:24,236
probably not much long-term learning is happening

111
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:26,850
because the new knowledge is not being as actively

112
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,925
processed and meaningfully linked

113
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:31,340
to prior knowledge in the learner&#39;s memory.

114
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,250
That said, it is important to note that not all forms

115
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,613
of confusion and struggle are always productive,

116
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:42,032
and not all difficulties are desirable.

117
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:45,337
Difficulties that engage deeper processing

118
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:48,325
within the learner&#39;s capacities are good.

119
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,982
Difficulties that simply cause learners

120
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:53,564
to wallow in frustration are not.

121
00:06:53,564 --> 00:06:56,218
You need to be the judge of when desirable

122
00:06:56,218 --> 00:07:00,154
difficulties turn into undesirable ones.

123
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:03,779
John Dewey in his book Democracy and Education

124
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:07,503
said over a century ago this about learning,

125
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:11,618
&quot;Give the pupils something to do, not something to learn,

126
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:15,306
&quot;and if the doing is of such a nature as to demand thinking,

127
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:17,723
&quot;learning naturally results.&quot;

128
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:24,713
We have to think to learn if we want our students

129
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:28,589
to learn in enduring and transferable ways.

130
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,420
As you can imagine, there are numerous instructional

131
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,086
strategies to help our students create long term memories.

132
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,903
Many you no doubt already use.

133
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:41,139
Please refer to the Teaching Strategies section

134
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,089
under Making Enduring Memories for more examples.

135
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,419
We&#39;ll also discuss different forms of deep processing

136
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,381
and thinking to learn in week four of our course.

137
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:55,026
In the next session we are going to learn

138
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:57,231
about how memories are retrieved

139
00:07:57,231 --> 00:08:01,148
and what this means for our teaching practices.
