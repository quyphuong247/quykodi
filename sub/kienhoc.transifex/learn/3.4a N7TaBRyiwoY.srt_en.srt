00:00:07,623 --> 00:00:09,952
- From the first day we begin teaching,

1
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:12,276
one of the most difficult and perplexing challenges

2
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:15,055
we face is how to motivate our students.

3
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:17,969
Or put a different way, what do we do to help our students

4
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,339
become self-motivated?

5
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,279
There&#39;s probably nothing I think about more as a teacher.

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,851
So how do we inspire, encourage, and even implore

7
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:29,005
our students to engage in what we hope

8
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,613
will be the accomplishments and joys

9
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,041
that the work of school has to offer?

10
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,054
How do we design experiences that invite them to explore

11
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:38,038
and create their own meaning of the things

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,001
we want them to learn?

13
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:43,525
We know academic success and achievement is rarely easy.

14
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:45,960
Deep and enduring learning is hard.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,398
It often involves struggles, mistakes, confusion,

16
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:52,328
and it requires persistent effort and engagement

17
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:54,537
on the part of our students.

18
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:56,795
What makes our students persevere in the presence

19
00:00:56,795 --> 00:01:00,195
of that discomfort to achieve learning?

20
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:02,630
Our challenges amplify because school isn&#39;t always

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,413
intrinsically interesting or of obvious relevance

22
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:07,154
to our students lives.

23
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:10,483
But their biggest challenge is that each learner is unique.

24
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:12,851
They come into our classrooms with an incredibly diverse

25
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:16,249
array of hopes, dreams, fears, capabilities,

26
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:19,655
experiences, problems, and ideas of themselves

27
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:24,126
as learners that make each their own motivational puzzle.

28
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,477
This helps explain the emotional roller coaster

29
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,731
that often characterizes teaching.

30
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:31,253
We revel in the exhilarating times when a child,

31
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:33,576
or an entire class, glows in the excitement

32
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:35,652
and discovery of learning.

33
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:38,145
And then there are the days when a lesson falls flat

34
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:40,764
or we head home pondering ways to reach a child

35
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:44,137
who&#39;s disengaged or frustrated.

36
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,518
In this session, we&#39;ll discuss some key findings

37
00:01:46,518 --> 00:01:48,430
emerging from the cognitive science research

38
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,432
about what motivates students to learn.

39
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:53,461
The literature is vast and complicated,

40
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,798
so we won&#39;t cover it in an comprehensive way,

41
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:58,320
but we do hope the insights we provide will be helpful

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,380
in informing your own teaching practice.

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,427
Distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic forms

44
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:07,391
of motivation is often problematic because they are

45
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,978
inextricably linked and the difference is not always

46
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:11,741
clear to the learner.

47
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:13,640
No doubt there are external factors

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,572
that motivate children in school.

49
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:17,502
Praise, grades, rewards,

50
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:20,522
and personal relationships among them.

51
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:23,311
In fact, the initial motivational hooks

52
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,468
or sparks for learning are frequently

53
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,935
provided by important people in students&#39; lives

54
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:30,708
and other supportive outside influences.

55
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,376
Likewise, praise and rewards can have their place

56
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:35,963
in motivating students in positive ways,

57
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,962
but we need to be careful about how they are deployed.

58
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:42,193
We&#39;ll say more about that near the end of this session.

59
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:44,557
That said, we do know that students tend to be

60
00:02:44,557 --> 00:02:46,982
more consistently and strongly motivated

61
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:49,547
when the desire to learn comes from within,

62
00:02:49,547 --> 00:02:52,195
rather than from mostly external sources.

63
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:54,110
What are some factors that help students become

64
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,110
more intrinsically motivated?

65
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,488
The motivational framework we&#39;ll discuss here

66
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:02,097
focuses on personal self-determination

67
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:05,959
and the need we all have to grow and be fulfilled.

68
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,173
At least four factors are involved.

69
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:12,090
Competence, autonomy, relatedness, and purpose.

70
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:18,118
Let&#39;s talk briefly about each one.

71
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:20,182
I love hearing in my classroom,

72
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:22,685
I&#39;m really getting better at solving equations,

73
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:25,984
or now I can have a real conversation in Spanish.

74
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:28,322
Our students need to believe that they are gaining

75
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:30,739
competency in doing their school work.

76
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,684
They should see improved performance and have a meaningful

77
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:37,309
sense that their efforts had a lot to do with their gains.

78
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,485
This involves not only helping kids develop

79
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,989
the growth mindset, as we discussed before,

80
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,396
but also getting feedback and instruction to be sure that

81
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:48,377
their hard work and effort is effective.

82
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:51,251
Research shows when students believe that their intellectual

83
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,441
abilities can be developed, they are more likely to

84
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:57,028
seek challenges, exert sustained effort,

85
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,335
and learn from setbacks.

86
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:01,550
In a later session we&#39;ll talk about ways to help our

87
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,446
students become self-regulated learners and be thinking

88
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:07,185
about ways to improve the quality of their efforts.

89
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:10,537
In other words, to do the stuff of learning.

90
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:13,232
Aligned with a developing sense of competency

91
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,878
is the opportunity for our students to act

92
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:18,208
in more independent ways.

93
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,858
This means their sense of control is more internal

94
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:23,912
and directed by them, rather than being too strongly

95
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:26,083
influenced by others.

96
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,062
In other words, their growth as learners is increasingly

97
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:32,214
under their control and these feelings of growing autonomy

98
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:36,511
will foster a sense of agency and self-efficacy.

99
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:40,469
Having our students think, I can do this by myself,

100
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,246
is hopefully the outcome of the class environment

101
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:45,820
we create that is feedback rich and fosters a sense

102
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,579
of risk taking and exploration.

103
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,073
In this sort of classroom, mistakes are embraced

104
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:53,844
as learning opportunities and a student&#39;s first move

105
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:58,430
after making a mistake is to ask, how can I learn from this?

106
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,685
It&#39;s therefore important that this happens in a network

107
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,413
of personal relationships that are

108
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:04,712
supportive and encouraging.

109
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:06,638
This means scaffolding challenges in ways

110
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:09,303
that students experience incremental success

111
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:12,278
in the context of a growth oriented community

112
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,861
where students and teachers work together

113
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,827
and learn from each other.

114
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,956
Challenge with assurance typifies

115
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:20,109
this sort of learning culture.

116
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:22,967
In this classroom, it would not be uncommon to hear,

117
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,970
this is going to be difficult, you will struggle,

118
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,750
but we know that you will figure out how to do it.

119
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,126
It goes almost without saying that students are motivated

120
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:34,176
to devote more time and energy to those activities

121
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,316
in which they expect to do well,

122
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:39,153
especially if their success is due to their own effective

123
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:42,179
effort that they are striving to improve.

124
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:44,856
We do want to acknowledge, however, that not all students

125
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:47,499
feel at home in school and feel they readily fit in

126
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:48,933
all the time.

127
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:51,434
We therefore don&#39;t want to discount or underestimate

128
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,547
the demotivating aspects of students feeling that they don&#39;t

129
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:58,295
belong are not understood by their teachers or are

130
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:01,917
considered different in their social and academic context.

131
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,318
Feelings of not belonging based on social interactions

132
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:07,510
and societal messages having to do with race,

133
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,242
socioeconomic class, gender, sexual orientation,

134
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:14,206
immigration status, and other similar aspects

135
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,709
of our identity can have an important defect

136
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,450
on student motivation and performance.

137
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,862
Working hard to create inclusive classrooms

138
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:23,708
and school environments will be essential

139
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:28,086
for all students to thrive and be motivated to succeed.

140
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:30,270
Finally, the last factor we&#39;ll discuss

141
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,136
that can influence motivation is a sense of purpose.

142
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:37,142
This can be a huge motivator for young learners.

143
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:39,584
Helping them see their relevance of what they are learning

144
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:41,937
and it&#39;s meaning in a larger personal context

145
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:44,194
can powerfully influence their willingness

146
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:46,033
to engage in academic tasks.

147
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:49,422
Again, research has demonstrated that something as simple

148
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:52,344
as pausing periodically to have students ponder

149
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:55,413
how what they are studying might have relevance

150
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:58,073
for their future lives can significantly influence

151
00:06:58,073 --> 00:07:00,340
their subsequent performance.

152
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,401
Now what about the role of rewards and praise

153
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,780
in motivating young learners?

154
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,095
This is not the time to review this extensive

155
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:10,110
and complicated research, but what we do need to include

156
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,881
are some observations as part of our discussion

157
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:14,778
about student motivation.

158
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:17,027
Let&#39;s start with rewards.

159
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:20,252
The first observation is that rewards can have both positive

160
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:24,163
and negative effects on student motivation and performance.

161
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:26,103
Rewards can definitely improve performance

162
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:30,250
in the short-term, but the problem comes when they go away.

163
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,221
Will a student being rewarded continue the desired behavior

164
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:35,769
once the reward is no longer given?

165
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,829
In other words, will the motivation for the desired behavior

166
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:40,440
become internalized?

167
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,655
If not, reversion to the prior

168
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:45,267
not so desired behavior may happen.

169
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:49,050
Worse, rewards can actually decrease motivation.

170
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,753
This is especially the case for tasks that learners

171
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:54,938
initially like and find intrinsically interesting

172
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,570
and the rewards are known ahead of time.

173
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,565
Feeling controlled, coerced, or manipulated

174
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,196
is part of the reason young learners find rewards

175
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:06,124
demotivating under these conditions.

176
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:10,273
However, this isn&#39;t necessarily the case for dull tasks.

177
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:12,758
A rule of thumb about rewards is not to use them

178
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,846
if you can find an alternative.

179
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:17,169
This means thinking of ways to motivate learners

180
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:20,062
more intrinsically as we previously discussed.

181
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:23,445
If you must use rewards, do so for a limited time

182
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:27,539
and for very specific reasons with the endgame in mind.

183
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,149
What&#39;s the plan when the rewards cease?

184
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,855
And now what about praise?

185
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:35,216
Praise is usually distinguished from rewards

186
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:37,481
because most rewards are known ahead of time

187
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:39,175
and therefore expected.

188
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,347
In addition, rewards usually don&#39;t impart

189
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:45,115
much information to the learner, but praise often does.

190
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:48,855
What are some tips about providing effective praise?

191
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:51,513
It needs to be sincere and earned.

192
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:54,439
Dishonest and unearned praise is immediately detected

193
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:57,017
by most young learners and can send a variety

194
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:59,486
of unfortunate messages.

195
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:02,233
By praising substandard or mediocre work

196
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:04,551
with all good intentions to boost the motivation

197
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:07,324
and confidence of a student, it can send just the opposite

198
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:10,379
message and backfire in terms of impact.

199
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,872
Insincere praise can be interpreted as

200
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:17,039
you tried hard and while it&#39;s not that good, for you it is.

201
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:20,460
Being honest in a way the student can respond to

202
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,168
productively is always better.

203
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:25,410
It just needs to be couched in a supportive way

204
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,455
so the student can hear it and respond

205
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,673
with opportunities to improve.

206
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:32,089
Brianna, your first paragraph would be even better

207
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,539
with a specific quote.

208
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:37,563
Praise that is intended or interpreted to be controlling

209
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,825
is always potentially problematic.

210
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:43,134
Saying something like, great job, Tina, you revised that

211
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:47,022
essay just like I wanted you to, is praise worthy

212
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:51,189
but sends an external locus of control message, do as I say.

213
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:54,096
It&#39;s better to provide informational praise

214
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:55,452
whenever possible.

215
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:58,138
Terrific work, Jamaal, your revision provided

216
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,592
much better supporting evidence.

217
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:05,068
Finally, praise should emphasize process and not ability.

218
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:08,320
Saying to a student, you&#39;re such a good science student

219
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,706
can boost confidence and be motivational in the short run,

220
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:14,848
but it can reinforce a fixed mindset in terms of ability

221
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,910
being the primary reason for high performance.

222
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,128
This may mean that when a student encounters

223
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:23,727
difficultly later, a fixed or ability focused mindset

224
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:26,451
can cause problems in terms of how they respond

225
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,506
as we discussed previously.

226
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:31,283
Instead, it&#39;s better to say something like,

227
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:33,625
you did such a good job on that science project,

228
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,908
you must&#39;ve worked hard at carefully collecting that data.

229
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:39,819
This emphasizes that it&#39;s the student effective effort

230
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,351
that has caused the good results.

231
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,059
Motivating the students in our classes

232
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,236
will always be a challenge.

233
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:49,232
It takes knowing students well and developing a relationship

234
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,191
with them that is supportive while encouraging them

235
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:55,581
to meet high standards and challenging themselves.

236
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:58,186
It also means that students need to meaningfully feel

237
00:10:58,186 --> 00:11:00,844
that we believe in them to succeed and keep growing

238
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:02,551
and getting better.

239
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,802
Experiences that help them feel more competent

240
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:07,462
and independent, as well as helping them see the purpose

241
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:11,139
and meaning of what we ask them to do, will go a long way

242
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:14,673
to develop in them an internally driven motivation.

243
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,862
In this way, our students will be on their way

244
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:19,356
to deeper engagement and fuller involvement

245
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:23,523
with directing their own learning in meaningful ways.
