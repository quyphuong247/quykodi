00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:11,033
- We want all of our students to be successful,

1
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:15,156
to thrive, to grow, and to feel challenged and supported

2
00:00:15,156 --> 00:00:17,302
as they learn in our schools.

3
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:19,089
That&#39;s not always easy.

4
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:22,614
Especially with the diversity of children we often teach.

5
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:25,350
In this session, we will introduce you to

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,263
the concept of cognitive load and why being mindful of it

7
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,117
as we design lessons for our students,

8
00:00:31,117 --> 00:00:34,066
can help enhance their learning in many ways,

9
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:35,582
while at the same time,

10
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:39,070
avoiding the frustration of overloading them.

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,914
Let&#39;s begin by reviewing what we learned

12
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:43,834
about how memories are made in our last session.

13
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:48,001
Our memory model illustration will help us visualize this.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,333
Recall that learning is mostly about

15
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,474
transferring information that enter short-term memory,

16
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:58,702
into long-term memory, where it is stored for later use.

17
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:01,756
It&#39;s the dialogue between these two

18
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:04,970
that causes memories to be formed.

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,826
We are only conscious of the information

20
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,375
currently being held in our short-term memory

21
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,140
and we are largely oblivious

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,998
to the enormous amounts of information

23
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:16,477
stored in long-term memory, that is,

24
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:20,617
until it is retrieved back into short-term memory for use

25
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:24,296
as we interact with it in the world around us.

26
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:27,966
Recall too, that we said short-term memory has

27
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:30,653
limited capacity and duration.

28
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:33,441
For example, try to remember this number

29
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,358
once it disappears from the screen.

30
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:42,124
What is it?

31
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:44,138
Pretty easy to remember, right?

32
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:46,828
But also notice that it has begun to fade

33
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:48,935
from your short-term memory already,

34
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:51,353
unless you&#39;ve rehearsed it in some way.

35
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:55,564
Information in short-term memory lasts only a few seconds,

36
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,314
usually less than 30.

37
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:01,799
Now, let&#39;s try to remember this number.

38
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:11,307
Any luck?

39
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:14,783
Probably impossible for most of you to remember that one.

40
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:16,207
Why?

41
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:19,667
Well, our short-term memory can hold only about seven,

42
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:22,238
plus or minus two bits of information.

43
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:25,539
Notice I&#39;m calling this short-term memory,

44
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:29,453
since it refers to single bits or chunks of information.

45
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:32,154
You can keep it in short-term memory

46
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:34,944
by rehearsing it periodically, using the little voice

47
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:37,529
in your head called phonological loop,

48
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:41,702
or by visualizing it, using the visual sketchpad.

49
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:44,777
What&#39;s working memory then?

50
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:48,138
Working memory is holding information in mind

51
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:51,228
and then manipulating it in some way.

52
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:54,228
For example, consider this number, a number

53
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:57,217
your short-term memory has little trouble remembering

54
00:02:57,217 --> 00:03:00,134
once it disappears from the screen.

55
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:07,810
Got it?

56
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,988
Now, let&#39;s do some work with that same number.

57
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:15,345
Remember, it&#39;s seven four eight three two.

58
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:18,928
Next, take each number in sequence, add one

59
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:23,941
and then say the resulting five digit number out loud.

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,820
What did you get?

61
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,320
Here&#39;s what you should have ended up with.

62
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:37,352
This is clearly harder.

63
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,805
Why?

64
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:42,165
You had to hold the numbers in your short-term memory

65
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,861
and manipulate or work them in some way.

66
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:47,969
Hence, we call this working memory.

67
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:50,316
Here&#39;s another example of working memory.

68
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:53,263
Multiply these two numbers in your head.

69
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:54,263
43 times 21.

70
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:05,178
Again, pretty hard to do

71
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,058
because you had manipulate or work

72
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:09,304
with what was in your short-term memory.

73
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:11,054
Multiplying 43 by 21.

74
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:16,469
Most people try this calculation in one or two ways.

75
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:20,846
Visually or phonologically in their head.

76
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:24,325
That is, you visualize the numbers in your working memory,

77
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:27,218
or a little voice in your head recited the numbers

78
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:29,821
as you tried to do the multiplication.

79
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:31,671
Some people use both pathways

80
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,940
when they are processing things in working memory.

81
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,573
Others of you might have used a strategy

82
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:39,821
retrieved from your long-term memory

83
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,505
by breaking the multiplication into parts.

84
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:44,338
43 times 20 equals 860

85
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,784
plus one times 43 equals 903.

86
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:54,772
We often augment our working memory

87
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:57,216
through using long-term memory.

88
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:59,368
This all means that working memory

89
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:02,878
is even more limited than short-term memory.

90
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:05,720
When processing or manipulating information

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,632
in working memory,

92
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:10,069
learners are able to manage fewer items of information,

93
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,018
depending on the type of cognitive processing required.

94
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:17,711
Sometimes, much less than the seven plus or minus two

95
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:20,932
chunks of information for the short-term memory.

96
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:24,105
Now why is all of this important for learning?

97
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:27,373
Well, it&#39;s in working memory where we do our thinking,

98
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:31,324
decision-making, problem-solving, reasoning,

99
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:34,728
and just plain making sense of the world around us,

100
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:37,832
both in terms of incoming sensory information

101
00:05:37,832 --> 00:05:41,392
and what we retrieve from long-term memory.

102
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:43,530
For example, think about trying to decide

103
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,198
what you want to order at a restaurant.

104
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:50,742
You will likely process a variety of factors as you decide,

105
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:54,042
both from your immediate environment, the menu,

106
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:56,388
what people at the table with you suggest,

107
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,960
what you see or smell in the restaurant,

108
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,426
what the waiter says, and also,

109
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:05,113
what you retrieve from your long-term memory.

110
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,813
What you ordered before at this place,

111
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:09,906
what a friend previously recommended,

112
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:14,744
your dietary restrictions, how hungry you are, and so on.

113
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:16,918
You might also be distracted by

114
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,586
the conversation going on at the table,

115
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:22,318
or your cell phone vibrating in your pocket.

116
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:25,630
All of those things will be held in working memory

117
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,684
at various times as you make a decision about what to eat.

118
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:33,197
That same thing happens when our students are learning

119
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:35,954
something new in school.

120
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:38,219
We take in relevant information

121
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,412
from our learning environment and at the same time,

122
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:45,296
usually retrieve information from our long-term memory

123
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:49,919
in order to make sense of what we are seeing or hearing.

124
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,712
But at the same time, we might be distracted

125
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,963
in various ways, which will take up

126
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:58,836
part of working memory in less-than-productive ways.

127
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,242
Since memories are formed

128
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:02,996
through that dialogue or active processing

129
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:05,804
between working memory and long-term memory,

130
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,207
as we discussed in the last session,

131
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:12,150
having working memory operating at its maximum capacity

132
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,829
is important for optimal learning.

133
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,494
So it is critical

134
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:18,740
that our students are able to process things

135
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,195
in working memory efficiently and flexibly

136
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:25,285
without overwhelming its capacity.

137
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:29,530
This is where the concept of cognitive load comes into play.

138
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,622
Cognitive load is formally defined as

139
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:35,112
the total amount of mental activity

140
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:38,789
imposed on working memory in any one instant.

141
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:42,153
Unfortunately and too often in learning situations,

142
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:44,843
students can be cognitively overloaded

143
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:48,375
which significantly impairs their learning.

144
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,425
For example, consider a student studying in her room,

145
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:54,463
doing history homework.

146
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:56,271
We hope that a maximal amount

147
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:58,359
of her working memory is being used

148
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,544
to focus on her reading her history text.

149
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:03,983
However, if she is partially attending to

150
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,127
any text messages coming through on her cell phone

151
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:09,103
and is also distracted a bit

152
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:12,177
by her little sister practicing piano in the next room,

153
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:14,301
then her working memory available

154
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:18,216
for paying attention to her history reading, is reduced.

155
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:20,860
In other words, her cognitive load is high

156
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,355
and her learning becomes less than optimal.

157
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:27,057
In addition, if the history reading contains

158
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:29,271
a lot of new vocabulary words,

159
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:33,493
and requires some prior knowledge she can&#39;t easily retrieve

160
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:38,006
or doesn&#39;t have, then what is already a high cognitive load

161
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:41,091
may actually become overloaded.

162
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:43,285
And as a consequence, not much learning

163
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:46,512
will probably happen during the study session.

164
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:50,716
The same thing can and does happen in classrooms.

165
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:52,725
The challenge for us all

166
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:56,201
is that the cognitive load in the same learning environment

167
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,586
can differ from child to child.

168
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,413
Knowing how to diagnose and respond to this

169
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:05,393
is one key to effective teaching,

170
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:08,700
since working memory is the gateway to long-term memory

171
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,463
and learning happens best

172
00:09:10,463 --> 00:09:12,644
when it is operating at full capacity

173
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:15,327
without being overloaded.

174
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:20,055
As teachers, there is much we can do and even should avoid,

175
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:23,352
to help our students manage their cognitive load.

176
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:26,702
For those interested in learning more about cognitive load

177
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,629
and its instructional implications,

178
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:32,502
please see the teaching strategies section of our MOOC,

179
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:34,607
under Cognitive Load,

180
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,919
for a variety of suggestions and ideas

181
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,398
about how to translate

182
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:40,047
the learning concepts in this session,

183
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,871
into teaching strategies for your classrooms.

184
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:46,888
We&#39;ll talk more about working memory and its critical role

185
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:49,118
in learning in future sessions,

186
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:52,519
especially when we discuss multi-tasking.

187
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,163
In summary, the take-home message for this session,

188
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:59,010
is that all learners can process

189
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,688
only a limited amount of information at a time

190
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:06,202
and it&#39;s the active dialogue between working memory

191
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:10,642
and long-term memory where durable memories are made.

192
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:12,933
So we need to be mindful of our role

193
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:16,427
in overloading our students&#39; finite working memory capacity

194
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:20,727
to process what we want them to, for effective learning.

195
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:23,881
In addition, we also need to encourage them

196
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:27,274
to be equally mindful of how and where

197
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:29,605
they choose to study and learn,

198
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:33,699
a topic for a future session about self-regulated learning.

199
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,234
The next session, we&#39;ll continue

200
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,749
our overview of memory and learning

201
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,836
and we&#39;ll be looking at how students&#39; prior knowledge

202
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:43,029
is a key consideration in designing

203
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:45,696
effective learning environments.
