00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:10,287
- Learning how to learn is one of the most important sets

1
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:12,199
of skills and understandings

2
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:16,411
that we can equip our students with no matter their age.

3
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:17,856
The ability and mindsets

4
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:21,034
to seek and successfully engage in new challenges,

5
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:23,025
to learn from mistakes and grow,

6
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:25,223
and to acquire new skills and knowledge

7
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:29,664
will all be crucial to their success in school and beyond.

8
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:31,337
One of the most important aspects

9
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:33,554
of being able to lead your own learning

10
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:36,917
is being aware of your thoughts and learning processes,

11
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:40,783
in other words, to actually think about your thinking.

12
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:44,950
In the world of education, we call this metacognition.

13
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,541
But it&#39;s an old idea that harkens back

14
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,645
to the ancient philosophers.

15
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:57,801
The word metacognition was coined only in the 1970s,

16
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:00,330
yet educators have been studying its learning import

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,793
for decades.

18
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:05,242
For example, educational philosopher John Dewey

19
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:07,142
said over a century ago,

20
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:09,667
&quot;We do not learn from experience.

21
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:13,145
&quot;We learn from reflecting on experience.&quot;

22
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:17,042
It&#39;s in the reflection, the interior dialogues we create,

23
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:21,001
where our most important learning often happens.

24
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,783
Children can be metacognitive at an early age,

25
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,851
but they must first develop a self-awareness

26
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:27,221
of their own thinking

27
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,916
and how it might differ from other people&#39;s.

28
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,315
In addition, effective metacognition

29
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:33,962
requires a knowledge base

30
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:37,276
that very young children often don&#39;t have.

31
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:40,776
This means metacognitive abilities develop over time,

32
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:43,122
and they can be significantly accelerated

33
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:45,749
with proper instruction and practice.

34
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:47,790
That&#39;s where teachers come into play.

35
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,111
Metacognition is often thought of as having two facets.

36
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,860
There&#39;s metacognitive knowledge, which is awareness

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,943
of one&#39;s own thinking and approaches to learning.

38
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:02,157
Then, there&#39;s an action component

39
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:04,489
that uses this metacognitive knowledge

40
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:07,041
to control and direct learning.

41
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,485
In this way, students self-regulate their learning,

42
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:13,818
hence the name metacognitive regulation.

43
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:18,726
This latter set of skills

44
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:21,126
involves planning, time management,

45
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:24,378
and monitoring and evaluating performance quality.

46
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:28,200
This all falls under the moniker of self-regulated learning,

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,576
an essential component of teaching students

48
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,909
about learning how to learn.

49
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:35,087
We&#39;re going to introduce you

50
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:37,479
to several aspects of metacognition

51
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:41,343
and developing a classroom culture that encourages it.

52
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:44,637
We&#39;ll then provide some useful metacognitive questions

53
00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:46,804
students can begin to ask.

54
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,133
Before we begin,

55
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,347
we&#39;d like you to recall the learning principles

56
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,903
we&#39;ve been studying throughout this course.

57
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:03,160
Please take a few minutes to do that.

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,282
We need to keep these principles in mind

59
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:07,337
as we think about teaching strategies

60
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:10,843
to help our students become metacognitive learners.

61
00:03:10,843 --> 00:03:12,997
Now, let&#39;s begin to examine some ways

62
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:14,874
to develop a classroom culture

63
00:03:14,874 --> 00:03:18,583
that supports thinking about thinking.

64
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,658
The most important and perhaps obvious practice

65
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:23,780
is to provide ample opportunities

66
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,588
for students to reflect,

67
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:27,743
both in and out of class.

68
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:30,054
It&#39;s a good idea to talk with them about

69
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:32,564
why you&#39;re having them reflect in various ways

70
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:36,399
and what you see the benefits to be for their learning.

71
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,137
This habit of reflection goes hand in hand

72
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:42,338
with formative feedback and closing the performance gap,

73
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:46,025
as well as with growth mindset and effective effort.

74
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,533
Recall from our previous sessions about feedback

75
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:51,509
that having students do something with their feedback

76
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:55,284
whenever possible is absolutely essential.

77
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:57,979
This expectation and practice of ongoing revision

78
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,482
after reflection goes a long way

79
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:04,596
in developing a metacognitive culture in your classroom.

80
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:07,894
A sense of purpose is a powerful motivator for learners,

81
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:09,972
and it helps them see why reflection

82
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:12,019
can help them achieve classroom goals,

83
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,598
especially if success criteria and standards

84
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:16,483
are visible to all.

85
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,650
They should know where their going as they learn

86
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,291
and why.

87
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,268
Consistently involving students with assessment practices

88
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:24,919
is important too.

89
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,265
Whenever possible,

90
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,828
having students self-assess is particularly effective

91
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,896
in encouraging metacognition

92
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,876
since it requires ongoing reflection to be successful.

93
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,398
This means students are asking question like,

94
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:39,864
&quot;What did I do well?

95
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:43,594
&quot;What do I need to work on?&quot; and &quot;What do I do next?&quot;

96
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:46,628
Finally, a classroom rich in collaboration,

97
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:49,623
with peer-assessment being an essential part of that,

98
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,381
will involve students in reflecting

99
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:53,364
on the thinking and work of others,

100
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:56,625
which invariably impacts their own thinking.

101
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,332
The more we infuse our classroom cultures

102
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,716
with opportunities for student reflection,

103
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:04,036
the more we cultivate this habit in our students.

104
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:05,609
We also signal to them

105
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:08,728
that it&#39;s an important disposition to value.

106
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:11,027
Next, I&#39;d like to discuss some questions

107
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:12,288
that students can ask

108
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:15,320
to help create a culture of metacognition.

109
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,503
At the end of the day,

110
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:19,563
metacognition is mostly about asking questions.

111
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:22,041
It&#39;s about creating an interior dialogue

112
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,482
or a dialogue with others

113
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:26,975
that makes students&#39; thinking and actions more visible.

114
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:31,124
This allows them to examine and critique their behaviors.

115
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:34,796
What follows are a few examples of metacognitive questions

116
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:37,064
that students can ask themselves.

117
00:05:37,064 --> 00:05:39,275
It&#39;s important that they practice these enough

118
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:42,064
to eventually have the most important ones internalized

119
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,948
to use without being prompted.

120
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:48,263
The basic intention of all the questions that follow

121
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:51,376
is that they encourage the learner to actively process

122
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,172
what they&#39;re seeing or hearing,

123
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:55,177
connecting the new information

124
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:58,240
to already existing prior knowledge.

125
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,715
Again, the learning principles we&#39;ve been studying

126
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:02,926
in this course about active learning,

127
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:06,068
the role of prior knowledge, and thinking to learn

128
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:07,785
will be important to keep in mind

129
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:10,463
as you have students practice.

130
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:12,098
Let&#39;s begin.

131
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:13,947
Here is some questions to ask

132
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:16,243
before engagement of a topic.

133
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,415
They&#39;ll help students determine purpose

134
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:21,687
and also activate prior knowledge.

135
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,770
Why are we studying this?

136
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:28,342
Why is this topic important?

137
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:34,008
What do I already know about this topic?

138
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:40,270
How does this topic relate to what we&#39;ve previously studied?

139
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:45,110
The next set of questions can be used during

140
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,929
the engagement of a topic.

141
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,735
These questions encourage students to actively process

142
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:51,163
what they&#39;re encountering,

143
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:53,846
linking it meaningfully to prior knowledge

144
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,562
and more fully elaborating its meaning

145
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:58,057
and the reasoning behind it.

146
00:06:58,057 --> 00:07:02,057
How can I connect this with what I already know?

147
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:05,947
What questions do I have?

148
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:10,029
What am I confused about?

149
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:13,696
How does this work?

150
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:19,286
What are the reasons or evidence being provided?

151
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:22,703
Who&#39;s point of view if being represented?

152
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:26,307
The following questions are meant to be asked

153
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:28,628
after a topic has been engaged.

154
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:31,543
They&#39;re also intended to have students actively process

155
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:33,001
what they&#39;ve just learned

156
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:34,966
and identify gaps in their learning.

157
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:39,678
What were the most important ideas or concepts?

158
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:42,919
What do I need to know more about?

159
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:45,889
How has this changed what I know?

160
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,972
How can I use this later?

161
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:53,040
Of course, we can hope to have our students learn

162
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,803
to ask all of these questions

163
00:07:54,803 --> 00:07:57,396
as a part of their metacognitive development.

164
00:07:57,396 --> 00:08:00,291
So the key question for us to ask is,

165
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,060
&quot;Which ones would be most useful for

166
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,824
&quot;our students in the context of

167
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:06,865
&quot;our learning goals and classroom environment?&quot;

168
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:09,873
Our overall aim in developing metacognitive knowledge

169
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:13,729
and self-regulation is for our students to become more aware

170
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,089
of their strengths and weaknesses.

171
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,178
In this way,

172
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:20,083
we hope to have a lasting impact on their futures

173
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,666
as growing and motivated lifelong learners.
