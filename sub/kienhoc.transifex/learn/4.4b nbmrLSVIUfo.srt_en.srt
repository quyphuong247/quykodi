0
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:08,989
- Okay, so

1
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:11,474
I kind of want us to try something a little bit different,

2
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:12,915
to, sort of, wrap this up.

3
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:15,022
I was thinking you guys seems like you&#39;re really comfortable

4
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:17,812
in terms of analyzing the text for bias

5
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:20,275
and then doing a little bit compare, contrast work.

6
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:21,814
I was thinking it could be sort of cool if you take

7
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,147
this to your groups

8
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:25,692
and then you, sort of, teach them what we tried.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,908
D&#39;you think you could do that?

10
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:29,764
So, what would you say if you were gonna teach someone

11
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,123
what we just did?

12
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:32,568
What would you, sort of, highlight for them?

13
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,693
- Look at the little print. - Look at,

14
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:36,807
maybe look at the fine print.

15
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:39,270
- Okay, and what did we do when we started?

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,751
- Pay attention to details.

17
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:41,584
- We paid attention to details.

18
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:42,812
We also checked out - We looked at the source.

19
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:44,332
- the source, right? - Yeah.

20
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:45,165
- So, - And kinda like,

21
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:46,290
find their purpose.

22
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,123
- Yeah, exactly.

23
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:48,032
We&#39;re thinking like, - What they wanna do.

24
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:50,370
- what do they want us to do as readers, right?

25
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,740
So, Noel and Ishan, can I have you share what we did

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,626
with Tigashi and Lichia?

27
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:57,079
And then Amalia and Charlie, do you feel like you can talk

28
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,541
to Charlie and Isabelle?

29
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,829
And just kinda keep it kinda quiet and whisper,

30
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,621
so that everyone else can keep working,

31
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,984
but take these with you, so you can try it all out.

32
00:01:03,984 --> 00:01:05,962
- [Woman] For the sample.

33
00:01:05,962 --> 00:01:10,079
- And now needing powder, at 60 calories, not 160

34
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,912
and 13 grams of sugar.

35
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:15,950
And so, if Roland has - Maybe that&#39;s because

36
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,980
- Fine.

37
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,245
- Saying this is how much that is.

38
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,188
- These two aren&#39;t leading,

39
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:20,866
maybe it&#39;s just their chocolate milk?

40
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,706
- I know, these two aren&#39;t leading.

41
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:25,137
- Right. - So, they&#39;re saying,

42
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:28,520
They&#39;re either picking the syrup, or they--

43
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,658
- They should really help-- - They&#39;re either

44
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:33,482
picking the syrup and the powder with the most sugar,

45
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:35,681
out of all them are better-- - Right, &#39;cause that&#39;s

46
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:36,514
what people would want. - And then

47
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:39,095
the fine print says, &quot;Leading syrup has 100 calories.&quot;

48
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:41,462
Which is less than their chocolate milk

49
00:01:41,462 --> 00:01:44,350
and they&#39;ll go to tiny print.

50
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,755
So, it&#39;s like - Stupid,

51
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:47,827
why would they do that?

52
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:49,494
- Because you can&#39;t usually,

53
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:51,335
do you ever read the fine print?

54
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:52,519
- Yeah, sometimes.

55
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,444
- [Girl With Glasses] And they would&#39;ve just lied

56
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:54,356
to the customer.

57
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:58,263
- Okay, I don&#39;t usually, unless it&#39;s like this,

58
00:01:58,263 --> 00:01:59,765
but, you know, there&#39;s a-- - Interesting.

59
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,182
- Didn&#39;t we also?
