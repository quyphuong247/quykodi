00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,537
- Whenever we join a new community,

1
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:13,360
it&#39;s only natural to worry about how we&#39;ll fit in

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,767
and whether we&#39;ll find success.

3
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,736
As students begin a new school year

4
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:19,865
or transition to a different school,

5
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:21,214
they&#39;re likely to wonder,

6
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:23,298
what will the other kids think of me?

7
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:25,102
What about the teachers?

8
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:26,989
Will I make friends?

9
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:30,017
Am I going to be able to do the work?

10
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:33,045
And if they hit bumps at the start which many do,

11
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:37,589
they might also ask, am I the only one struggling?

12
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,842
Psychologists call these kinds of feelings

13
00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:42,475
belonging uncertainty.

14
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,699
That sense of worry and doubt affects us all.

15
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,091
I&#39;ve known adults who graduated

16
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:49,918
from the most selective universities in the country

17
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:52,251
and years later, they confess feeling

18
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,791
that they&#39;ve been admitted by a mistake

19
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,007
and while this phenomenon can affect all of us

20
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,399
in one form or another,

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,200
it can prove especially acute

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,655
among historically marginalized groups

23
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:05,149
including black and Latino students,

24
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,460
women who enter quantitative fields.

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,244
As teachers, one of our primary goals

26
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:14,962
is to help all students feel welcomed and valued.

27
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:17,577
An important goal by itself.

28
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,340
But our feelings of belonging

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,630
as the model in session two suggests

30
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,713
can also directly influence academic performance.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,365
Here&#39;s the theory.

32
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:31,732
Belonging uncertainty can make normally minor events

33
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:34,929
such as being left out of a group or social activity,

34
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:39,077
being criticized or slighted seem large.

35
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:41,731
They feel like not just an isolated incident

36
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,655
but a larger pattern confirming that we don&#39;t belong.

37
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:48,600
Over time, this feeling can increase stress,

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,715
undermine student motivation and engagement

39
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:54,704
and as a result, lower achievement.

40
00:01:54,704 --> 00:01:56,327
How does it work?

41
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:58,435
Research suggests that some portion

42
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:01,468
of our cognitive resources is derailed

43
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:03,064
when we&#39;re worried about these things.

44
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:05,714
Not fitting in, being stigmatized

45
00:02:05,714 --> 00:02:08,660
or even just doing poorly academically.

46
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,080
Your own experiences may confirm this.

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,315
Mine certainly do.

48
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:14,190
On the other hand,

49
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,187
research shows that having a positive sense of belonging

50
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,937
improves academic performance.

51
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:22,434
You&#39;ve probably felt this too.

52
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,426
So how can we remedy these worries

53
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:29,520
and buttress belonging for our most vulnerable students

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,913
both throughout the year

55
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:33,219
and during those important transitions

56
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,451
when those feelings may be exacerbated?

57
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:39,283
Greg Walton and Geoffrey Cohen of Stanford University

58
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:41,329
along with some other researchers

59
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,659
have pioneered two types of interventions

60
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,153
to address just these concerns.

61
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,611
They&#39;re each aimed at sending key messages

62
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,822
to affected students.

63
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:54,873
The first message is you are not alone.

64
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,547
The truth is at some point,

65
00:02:56,547 --> 00:03:00,072
almost everyone thinks they&#39;re the only one struggling.

66
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:03,021
As teachers, we must help students understand

67
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:05,566
that struggling in a new environment

68
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:09,089
and worrying about fitting in are not unusual.

69
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,073
The best strategy is to discuss these issues candidly

70
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:13,748
and confidently.

71
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:16,903
We shouldn&#39;t minimize or push away those feelings

72
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:20,347
but rather acknowledge them as normal.

73
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,638
The second message researchers recommend

74
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:26,035
is to convey that feelings about belonging uncertainty

75
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:28,253
will fade over time.

76
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:31,898
Early distress is normal and it&#39;s temporary.

77
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:34,731
In other words, things get better.

78
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,547
One surprising finding is that interventions like these

79
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:40,881
don&#39;t require much time.

80
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:45,219
In several studies, just one 30 to 60 minute session

81
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:49,026
brought significant and long lasting impacts.

82
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:51,236
Many of the studies included older students

83
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:54,753
sharing their initial experiences with younger students.

84
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:57,332
So college seniors worked with freshman.

85
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:59,747
High school juniors with ninth graders.

86
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,716
Positive results came even with junior high students

87
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:05,228
helping elementary students

88
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:08,181
and multiple methods all worked.

89
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,982
Talking directly to students,

90
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:11,950
offering written testimonials,

91
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,893
creating videos.

92
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:16,040
In each case, the older students

93
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,901
shared their initial feelings of belonging uncertainty

94
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:22,223
and how they lessened with time.

95
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:24,717
And just this one simple intervention

96
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:27,782
helped the younger students allay their own concerns

97
00:04:27,782 --> 00:04:30,484
and gather strategies for adapting.

98
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:32,446
These messages were often reinforced

99
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:35,870
by saying is believing exercises.

100
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,244
In other words, following up later

101
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:42,336
with brief writing exercises or discussions.

102
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:43,890
After hearing from older peers,

103
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,121
the younger students then talked with each other

104
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:50,100
then they were actively engaged in the process

105
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,031
by writing an essay or letter about what they learned.

106
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:56,321
Students were also told their writing might be shared

107
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:57,698
with future students

108
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:02,038
thus reinforcing that what they were feeling was normal.

109
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:03,391
Another form of intervention

110
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:05,602
that counters belonging uncertainty

111
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:08,547
is called values affirmation.

112
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:11,042
In this practice, students are asked to reflect

113
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:14,354
on personal values that give them a sense of identity

114
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:16,152
and belonging.

115
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:18,531
Often, this reflection is done through structured

116
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:20,456
in class writing.

117
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:23,200
In one such study, seventh graders were asked

118
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,152
to write about what was most important to them.

119
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:28,280
For example, their personal interests,

120
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,390
their relationships with friends and family.

121
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,170
The exercise only lasted 30 minutes

122
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,255
but it boosted student achievement,

123
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,255
an affect that remained years later.

124
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:41,814
One explanation for the impact

125
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:43,910
of these self-affirmation exercises

126
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,742
is that they remind students about what they value

127
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:50,727
and their own good qualities.

128
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:53,506
This in turn shores up their sense of integrity

129
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:54,858
and self-worth

130
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:58,990
leading them to see negative events as less threatening.

131
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,157
These exercises work to reduce stress.

132
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:07,260
Such simple interventions all aimed at buttressing belonging

133
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,614
have yielded dramatic and long lasting results.

134
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:13,441
They&#39;ve improved academic performance in GPA,

135
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:16,585
bolstered health, increased homework completion,

136
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,835
even reduced dropout rates.

137
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,895
They&#39;ve also been shown to best help the students

138
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,448
who need it most,

139
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:27,270
those vulnerable to stereotypes in the USA

140
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,020
including minorities and women in math,

141
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,640
physics and engineering fields.

142
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,301
Some interventions have even narrowed the achievement gap

143
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:38,452
between black and white students.

144
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:39,452
Do I belong?

145
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,792
It&#39;s a question that many students wonder

146
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:45,985
and worry about through their time in school.

147
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:48,971
We know their sense of belonging in our classrooms

148
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:51,241
and schools or lack of it

149
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:55,963
can influence deeply their performance and well-being.

150
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:58,059
Some students will enter a classroom

151
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:00,351
more readily feeling they belong

152
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,945
but others won&#39;t

153
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:05,140
until we convince them that they&#39;re valued

154
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,966
and they belong as equals.

155
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:10,676
As teachers then our role is to help

156
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:14,509
all students feel accepted, supported and safe

157
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:18,737
so that they can succeed in school and in life

158
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:22,237
while they&#39;re our students and long after.
