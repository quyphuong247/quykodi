00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:11,294
- There&#39;s emerging consensus in educational research

1
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:13,097
that non-cognitive factors

2
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,966
can profoundly affect student learning.

3
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:18,745
We hope to demonstrate this to you in the coming sessions,

4
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:20,638
including ways that you can incorporate

5
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:23,396
what we cover into your teaching.

6
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:26,161
We&#39;ll do so through a model created in 2012

7
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,526
by a group of researchers and practitioners

8
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:30,912
affiliated with the University of Chicago,

9
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:33,269
led by Camille Farrington.

10
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:36,100
It&#39;s informed by a comprehensive literature review

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,195
on the role of non-cognitive factors

12
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:40,777
in shaping school performance.

13
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:43,034
The model conceptualizes the relationships

14
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:45,332
among each of those factors,

15
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:47,146
as well as their ultimate relationship

16
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,512
to academic performance.

17
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:51,337
So, let&#39;s take a look.

18
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:52,851
Near the bottom of the diagram

19
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:56,313
is an orange box labeled academic behaviors.

20
00:00:56,313 --> 00:00:58,011
This represents the student behaviors

21
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,116
we&#39;re used to observing

22
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:03,042
and hopefully eliciting in our classrooms.

23
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:05,794
Things like consistently attending class,

24
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:09,314
arriving prepared and on time, paying attention,

25
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:14,077
mindfully engaging class activities and doing homework.

26
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:16,280
In other words, this is the stuff of learning

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,304
and what it means to be a good student.

28
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:21,053
Academic behaviors are in turn

29
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:24,475
influenced by the other factors you see in this model.

30
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:27,973
Together they help determine students&#39; academic performance

31
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:30,597
and how well they do in school.

32
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:33,470
Next, the most broadly influential factor

33
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,893
in this model is academic mindsets.

34
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:38,576
As you&#39;ll recall from the last session,

35
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,898
mindsets encompass beliefs that students

36
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:42,870
bring to their learning.

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,039
Here again are some statements that capture them.

38
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,029
I belong in this academic community.

39
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:53,592
My ability and competence grow with my effective effort.

40
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:56,617
This work has value for me.

41
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,946
I can succeed at this.

42
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:01,236
Meaningful learning requires struggle,

43
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:04,270
confusion, and even mistakes.

44
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,256
Now, that last one wasn&#39;t in the original paper,

45
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:09,539
but we&#39;ve added it because it&#39;s so essential.

46
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:10,631
And we&#39;ll be discussing all five

47
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,300
of those statements in coming sessions.

48
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,724
Just below mindsets is academic perseverance,

49
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:20,304
which comprises a diverse but related set

50
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:22,604
of psychological concepts that recently

51
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:25,122
has received increased attention.

52
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:27,421
It represents the inclination for learners

53
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:31,631
to focus and persist for extended periods of time

54
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:35,108
in the face of distractions and temptations.

55
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:37,410
It&#39;s related to the overlapping concepts

56
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,533
of grit, tenacity, delayed gratification,

57
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:45,063
self-discipline and self-control.

58
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:46,532
Without these tendencies,

59
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:50,131
high achieving academic performance is difficult.

60
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:51,630
And so far there&#39;s not much evidence

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,176
they can easily be taught.

62
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:58,044
To the left of perseverance you&#39;ll see social skills.

63
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,885
While important, we won&#39;t focus too much on them,

64
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:04,340
but they include the interpersonal qualities of empathy,

65
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,923
cooperation, responsibility, and assertion.

66
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:11,585
They capture how students interact and collaborate

67
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:15,060
to learn more effectively from each other.

68
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,935
Finally, learning strategies encompasses

69
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:20,260
study skills and meta-cognitive strategies

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,359
aimed at helping our students lead

71
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,105
their own learning in a self-regulated way.

72
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,128
We&#39;ll give major focus to learning strategies

73
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,220
for at least two reasons.

74
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,547
First, there&#39;s now really good cognitive science research

75
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,458
that can be translated into useful teaching strategies

76
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,648
to help us improve our instruction.

77
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,152
Second, that same research can be applied

78
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:46,018
to help our students learn more effectively themselves.

79
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,632
We&#39;ll cover all of this in a later session.

80
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,942
Of course, these non-cognitive factors

81
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:54,663
don&#39;t operate in a vacuum.

82
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:56,987
The school and classroom context,

83
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,047
included near the top of this model,

84
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:00,473
can shape student achievement

85
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,973
in positive or insidious ways.

86
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:05,322
School and classroom environments

87
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:07,955
depend on the resources available,

88
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,751
policies about grading and tracking,

89
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,401
curriculum choices and instructional requirements,

90
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:18,105
safety, student norms and expectations,

91
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:21,693
faculty workload, and school leadership.

92
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,950
Equally crucial is the category at the very top,

93
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,858
students&#39; broader socio-cultural

94
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:29,638
environment outside of school.

95
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:32,606
To learn and flourish, all of us require

96
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,356
shelter, food, economic security,

97
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,865
safety, family stability, and health.

98
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:42,368
These factors can profoundly encourage

99
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:45,144
or constrain teacher effectiveness

100
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:48,459
and opportunities for students to learn.

101
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,915
Unfortunately, we can talk all we want

102
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,207
about the science of learning and its implications,

103
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:54,611
but if basic classroom

104
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,266
and school resource needs are not being met,

105
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:01,319
or important systemic obstacles are in place,

106
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,698
it becomes difficult to meaningfully use in classroom

107
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:07,473
the information we&#39;re conveying here.

108
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,277
We cannot underestimate or ignore

109
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:13,033
the very real factors creating stark inequalities

110
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:17,267
among our schools, in the lives of our students.

111
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,329
If they aren&#39;t addressed and remediated,

112
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:21,567
it will be very difficult for all of our students

113
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,875
to learn in optimal ways.

114
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,434
Almost no matter what we do within our schools,

115
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,948
regarding teaching and learning.

116
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:30,246
And this brings us to the last

117
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,542
and most important element of this model,

118
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,662
the students themselves, their backgrounds,

119
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:39,684
experiences, and characteristics.

120
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:42,156
No other factor shapes our effectiveness

121
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:44,650
as teachers more significantly.

122
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,694
And it&#39;s why we should all practice

123
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:51,010
what one educator called inside out teaching.

124
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,897
The principle is that effective teaching

125
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:56,189
always begins with the learner.

126
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,567
My first move as a teacher is to consider

127
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,206
foremost the students I&#39;m about to engage.

128
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,734
When they walk into my classroom,

129
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:07,791
what prior experiences, knowledge,

130
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,958
hopes, aspirations, fears,

131
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:16,113
wants and needs, skills, and questions

132
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:18,402
are they bringing with them?

133
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:22,720
How will those influence how and what I&#39;ll teach them?

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,390
As David Ausubel said in one of the first textbooks

135
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,838
published in 1968 about cognitive science,

136
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:32,761
&quot;The most important single factor influencing learning

137
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:35,201
&quot;is what the learner already knows.

138
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:38,451
&quot;Ascertain this and teach accordingly.&quot;
