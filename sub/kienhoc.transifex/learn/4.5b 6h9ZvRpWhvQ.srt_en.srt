00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,218
- Whenever I start a school year, I really try to have

1
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:13,163
a vision for where I want my kids to be

2
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:14,844
by the end of the year.

3
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:16,419
So this means I spend a lot of time

4
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:18,723
backwards planning and really thinking through

5
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:20,198
the particular learning objectives

6
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:23,432
that feel really non-negotiable to me.

7
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:26,125
Oftentimes, we have to cycle back to things

8
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,988
because, I know for me as a learner,

9
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,629
I never learn something the very first time I do it

10
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,648
and if it&#39;s really important, then we have to

11
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:35,993
spiral back to it so kids get repeated practice.

12
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:38,379
So, for instance, if we&#39;re talking about writing

13
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:40,933
and we want kids to improve something simple like

14
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,470
using paragraphs, I&#39;ll often do an intro sort of

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,500
demonstration and let them try it out

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,058
and then we&#39;ll come back to it in a more

17
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:50,315
higher level way where maybe they&#39;ll do some inquiry

18
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:53,437
and notice how paragraphing has improved

19
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:56,204
their comprehension or their understanding of a story.

20
00:00:56,204 --> 00:00:58,052
And that&#39;s something that can be really embedded

21
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:01,064
in any type of unit that we do across the year.

22
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:02,957
And so, to me, that&#39;s sort of like a high leverage

23
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:05,660
thing that I want kids to think about and to learn

24
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,006
and really, it&#39;s easy for me to measure their progress

25
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,973
from the beginning of the year to end of the year.

26
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:12,869
But if I want them to be successful, then I have to

27
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,387
give them multiple goes or multiple tries

28
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:19,636
so they can actually accomplish those learning objectives.

29
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:22,052
- I thought I was this great explainer of things,

30
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:23,707
as if that&#39;s what teaching was about,

31
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:26,707
rather than, now I believe, that the

32
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:29,182
experiences I give to them,

33
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:31,197
the ability for them to have conversations,

34
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:32,299
that&#39;s what makes a great teacher.

35
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,342
Not my ability to explain but my ability

36
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:38,031
to prompt them to explain their thinking to each other.

37
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,775
And I thought that if I was a great explainer,

38
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,341
I would explain something, I would show them how to do it,

39
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,959
and I would ask them to do it for homework

40
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,264
and then we would repeat that process every day,

41
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,600
and at the end of maybe two weeks,

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,007
we would test ourselves on what we learned,

43
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,797
and then we&#39;d do that again.

44
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:54,802
But I realized that kids got really good

45
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:57,412
at learning something for that two week time frame,

46
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:59,916
maybe even put it somewhere in their long-term memory,

47
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,412
but eight months down the line,

48
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,449
they never remembered that again.

49
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:05,118
And you hear teachers saying this all the time,

50
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:06,245
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s the end of summer break.

51
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,663
They don&#39;t remember anything.&quot;

52
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:08,975
Or, &quot;I can&#39;t test them on that,

53
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,868
we learned that before winter break.&quot;

54
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:11,889
And you just have to think,

55
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:13,774
&quot;Well, what was the point of teaching it to begin with

56
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:14,891
if they&#39;re not gonna remember it,

57
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,957
even three or four weeks later?&quot;

58
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:19,063
And so now, much more in homework

59
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:20,989
and even in activities in class,

60
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:24,352
I make sure that I&#39;m recalling previous ideas

61
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,518
and incorporating them into the homework

62
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:28,173
and into the lesson that we&#39;re doing.

63
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:30,389
And at first students get a little bit disoriented.

64
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:31,734
&quot;Why are we writing about this?

65
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,407
Why did you ask me about the vertex of a parabola?

66
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:36,027
We did functions last week,

67
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:39,126
why is that showing up in this unit, right now?&quot;

68
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,505
But their practice, in recalling that information

69
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:43,858
and using it again,

70
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:47,573
without any reminders about what that&#39;s about,

71
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,245
helps them in the future remember that

72
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:51,938
that&#39;s an important idea and helps them create

73
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,499
and strengthen those pathways

74
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:56,582
and helps them kind of navigate that forest in their mind

75
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:59,374
and say, &quot;These are the relationships that I see

76
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:03,291
between these ideas and I can use those again.&quot;
