00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,280
One of the

1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,560
principles of learning that I

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,720
practice is helping students become

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,720
regulated learners, who are directing

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,400
their own learning, who are thinking and

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,920
reflecting about what they&#39;re doing. So

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,480
they&#39;re not just completing tasks but

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,910
they&#39;re actually getting better as

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,960
learners when they&#39;re on their own in a

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,849
way from me

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,619
so one of the ways I&#39;ve done this is

11
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:33,550
through my conferences when I meet with

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,470
students

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,780
what I found was after many years of

14
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,400
doing this that they would come in we

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,070
would work on a problem together maybe a

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,380
student gotten stuck on an essay and

17
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,150
they would find a solution and then they

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,530
would leave in both of us would be happy

19
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,050
I&#39;d feel like I&#39;d helped and supported

20
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,210
them they figured out what they wanted

21
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,640
to figure out and so we both sort of had

22
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,070
a nice compromise there and what I

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,680
realized was that many times after these

24
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,050
great positive conferences students were

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,119
still making the same mistake or coming

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,500
back to me at a later time saying I got

27
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,680
stuck again I don&#39;t know how to do this

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,600
or worse just not bringing it up and

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,420
what I learned to do was to build in an

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,610
extra step to those conferences to sort

31
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,100
of force that process of reflection and

32
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:21,310
metacognition thinking about the

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,200
thinking they were doing so once we have

34
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,999
the conference in and work through some

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,909
of the issues and talked about them i

36
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:29,770
would then stop and say okay so what was

37
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,859
the problem that you originally came in

38
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,020
with why did you get stuck and what did

39
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,270
we just do in the last 20 or 30 minutes

40
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,409
or whatever time we had that helped you

41
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,810
get unstuck

42
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:42,939
how did you solve this problem and what

43
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,469
I found when I started doing this was

44
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,960
that frequently students couldn&#39;t tell

45
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:48,700
me and if I hadn&#39;t asked that question

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,590
if I hadn&#39;t asked them to stop and think

47
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,149
about it they likely would have run out

48
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,960
the door happy and I would have would

49
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:58,450
have been happy to so I this process of

50
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,369
pausing building into the time we have

51
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,770
for teaching and asking students to

52
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:05,079
think about what did you learn how did

53
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,869
you figure out and solve this problem

54
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,580
was became the essential part of the

55
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,740
conference it wasn&#39;t really the essay

56
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,240
that we ended up talking about it became

57
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,770
the process of learning

58
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,230
I also realized that I had to make

59
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,180
students write down what they had

60
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,330
learned this is a way that they could

61
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,220
keep a record of what they&#39;ve gotten

62
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,720
they could come back and review it and

63
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,710
crucially if they ran into that problem

64
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,570
again

65
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,260
they then had that resource to go back

66
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:34,450
and look and I this is a sort of

67
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,640
representative of my evolution as a

68
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,560
teacher&#39;s I continue to grow thinking

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,720
about not just solving the problem in

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,520
that specific assignment not just that

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,820
moment in time but helping students

72
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,470
become learners who understand and can

73
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,490
guide their own learning when they&#39;re

74
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,720
long gone

75
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:54,160
my classroom when I was a new teacher I

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,050
did most of the heavy lifting in my

77
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,480
classroom I spent most of the time

78
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,220
talking if I asked a question and nobody

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,930
knew it I would immediately supply the

80
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,000
answer if a kid raised their hand and

81
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,170
they were confused i would come over and

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,340
I would try to give them the answer

83
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,600
right away

84
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,640
this meant that they were never really

85
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,440
engaged in the struggle and instead they

86
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,940
knew that if they needed something I

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,070
would come and i would give it right to

88
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,200
them as I&#39;ve developed further in my

89
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,750
teaching practice I really tried to make

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,670
sure that i&#39;m more of a facilitator and

91
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,400
that the heavy cognitive lifting fall on

92
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,350
my students so they know that if they

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,640
have a question i might come over and

94
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,050
then we&#39;ll ask them to explain what

95
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,780
they&#39;re working on or what they&#39;re

96
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,430
trying and how it&#39;s going and as we have

97
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,920
that conversation we can figure out

98
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,570
where the misconception might be and

99
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,280
what they can do next

100
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,920
I think this kind of work really helps

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
kids identify where they feel stuck and

102
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,400
then figure out a way to move forward

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,400
and they know that I&#39;m there to help

104
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,870
them but they aren&#39;t so reliant on me

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,700
this is really important when I think

106
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,890
about them as future learners because i

107
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,720
won&#39;t always be there to help them and I

108
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,950
need them to have tools so that they can

109
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,730
solve their own problems more

110
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,920
independently so every week we take what

111
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,600
we call an understanding check a check

112
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,640
for understanding of what the kids can

113
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,650
and can&#39;t do based on all the material

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,290
from the previous months of the course

115
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,520
and i find that they can share a lot of

116
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,050
their knowledge and they practice that

117
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,880
recall of information while they take

118
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,070
the understanding check but the day

119
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,170
after they&#39;re presented with the

120
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,060
understanding check again and I circle

121
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,470
where they made a mistake I don&#39;t tell

122
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,960
them what they did wrong there&#39;s no

123
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,820
points associated with it minus 2 or

124
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,110
anything like that I just circle what

125
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,630
they&#39;ve done wrong and then they do

126
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,370
understanding check reflection where

127
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,200
they first need to explain in words what

128
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,930
they did wrong then they explained in

129
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,250
words with the the right solution is and

130
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,330
then they solve it correctly at the

131
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,340
bottom and as you

132
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,680
important for them to explain the one I

133
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,509
used to think and what I think now in

134
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,490
their own words maybe with the help of

135
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:50,289
appear maybe with the help of a teacher

136
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,719
maybe just by looking back at their

137
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:55,780
notes before they do the correct answer

138
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:57,729
to confront that that misconception that

139
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,590
they used to have and I think that

140
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:02,229
students learn more in that reflection

141
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,270
then they do in in the rest of the week

142
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,039
because they&#39;ve seen what they&#39;ve done

143
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,349
wrong and they made corrections to that

144
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,939
and they&#39;re highly motivated to do that

145
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,650
when they get that test back they look

146
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:13,030
for the green star because they know

147
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:18,180
that&#39;s the part that they get to make

148
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,180
right
