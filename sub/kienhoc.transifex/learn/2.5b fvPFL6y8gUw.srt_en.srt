00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:09,134
- In our classroom,

1
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,118
growth mindset really lays the foundation

2
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:13,252
for the work we do throughout the year.

3
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:15,089
At the beginning of the year, I spend a lot of time

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,251
really working with my class to build a working definition

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,494
on what growth mindset is, why it&#39;s important

6
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:23,058
and what it looks like.

7
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:24,930
So throughout our school day,

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,590
we spend time looking for examples

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,914
of moments when kids are using their growth mindset.

10
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:30,762
This might look like coming back together

11
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:32,635
at the end of a lesson and instead of

12
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:34,993
just going over the content, I&#39;ll ask kids,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,721
&quot;What was tricky about that?&quot;

14
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:37,835
&quot;What was hard?&quot;

15
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:39,004
&quot;What did you struggle with?&quot;

16
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,209
and I&#39;ll have them share out

17
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:42,299
some of their confusions and some of their struggles.

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:44,008
The thing we also make sure we do is

19
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:46,962
think about how we work through those struggles

20
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:48,921
and those challenges so kids kind of know

21
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,996
that it&#39;s important that they&#39;re putting in effort,

22
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:52,627
but it has to be effective.

23
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:54,515
What I think is really powerful about this,

24
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:56,634
is it helps kids think about

25
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:58,681
where they might have confusion

26
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,512
or they might have made a mistake

27
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:02,279
but then they also are really responsible

28
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,792
for correcting that mistake

29
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,751
or working through that confusion.

30
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:08,038
And if they approach something similar in the future,

31
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:09,859
which they most likely will,

32
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,672
they&#39;ve sort of developed a toolkit

33
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,376
where they have some strategies in place

34
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,991
that can help them really approach that challenge

35
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:18,943
more effectively the next time.

36
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:20,481
- So the first assignment I give to students

37
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,299
at the beginning of the year, is to write a mathography.

38
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,251
So it&#39;s a history of themselves as a math student

39
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,856
and they talk to me about how they feel as a math student,

40
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:30,034
some positive experiences and some negatives.

41
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:31,724
And there&#39;s always a few kids who say,

42
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,560
Miss, I&#39;m no good at math.

43
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,196
This is my worst subject, I&#39;m gonna be nice,

44
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,750
I&#39;m gonna be respectful, but I&#39;m no good at math.

45
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,767
And so, how do I change their minds

46
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,122
to make them think they can do math

47
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:45,605
because if they&#39;re not gonna think they can do it,

48
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,175
then they won&#39;t even try.

49
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,823
So I just had this conversation with Ashley the other day.

50
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:51,545
She had written in her mathography

51
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,080
that her seventh grade teacher told her not to pursue math,

52
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,957
that it wasn&#39;t worth her time

53
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:58,599
and yet, she&#39;s in my ninth grade math class.

54
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,863
So I can tell Ashley, you can do it,

55
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:04,717
I can tell Ashley, right on the top of your test I can,

56
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:05,816
and I can tell Ashley

57
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:07,385
that you&#39;re not allowed to say I can&#39;t.

58
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:09,784
But I also need to show her that her effort,

59
00:02:09,783 --> 00:02:12,952
that effective effort makes a difference in the future.

60
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:14,424
So Ashley was having trouble

61
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:15,940
knowing the difference between squaring

62
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,412
and square-rooting numbers

63
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:20,379
and I made sure to explain to her, what the difference was

64
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:22,428
and how to use it and how to recognize it

65
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:24,133
and give her those mental cues

66
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,093
so she knew when she saw that X-squared,

67
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:27,763
she knew exactly what that meant for her.

68
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:29,366
So she made up her own mnemonics

69
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,795
and did her own vocab, put poster on that.

70
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:33,287
Next time she took a test,

71
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,339
that was exactly the question on that test.

72
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:37,191
There was an X-squared and there was a square root of X.

73
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,774
Ashley nailed it and she came back so proud

74
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:42,014
with a proficient on that testing,

75
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:43,798
&quot;I actually can do it&quot;

76
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:46,321
And that, that can change her mind about who she is

77
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,683
as a math student and now, she might think,

78
00:02:48,683 --> 00:02:52,706
oh, if I put forth this effort, if I try this new strategy,

79
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,919
I&#39;m gonna be successful in the future

80
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,984
and that makes a big difference for her

81
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,984
in her future academics.

82
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:01,757
- Students enter my class

83
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:04,760
whether they are ninth graders entering high-school

84
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,386
or seniors about to leave high-school.

85
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:11,025
Basically, with a notion of who they are, as students.

86
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:14,504
Some of them, fortunately, have developed a growth mindset

87
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:17,254
around their learning in English, as readers and writers,

88
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:18,951
but others are very fixed in their notions

89
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:21,980
about what&#39;s possible for them as readers and writers.

90
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,793
And so what I do on day one,

91
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:26,105
before I instruct them in any sort of way,

92
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,578
is I ask them to draw a metaphor

93
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:31,350
that speaks to who they are as a reader

94
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,637
and who they are as a writer.

95
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:35,539
So most of them think of metaphor

96
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,676
as just a comparison that doesn&#39;t use like or as.

97
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,480
But instead I explain to them

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,237
that metaphors can frame and inform

99
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:45,474
how we move through the world

100
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:47,852
and what we think is possible for ourselves.

101
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,866
So students sit and they think about

102
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,850
the feelings that they experience

103
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,985
when they&#39;re asked to read, for homework at night,

104
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,876
they sit and they think about what it&#39;s like to write,

105
00:03:57,876 --> 00:04:01,681
and some of them draw pictures that are wonderful.

106
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:04,698
They express warm feelings about these activities.

107
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:06,400
They&#39;re on a beach, relaxing,

108
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,783
they are doing their favorite activity,

109
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:12,354
slushing down a hill, things that they really enjoy doing,

110
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:14,386
while others draw images of themselves

111
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:18,308
trying to climb Mount Everest, never getting to the top.

112
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:20,794
Reading and writing for them, is a struggle,

113
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,208
and they see themselves as always at that point

114
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:27,291
on the mountain, never never being able to reach the peak.

115
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,720
And so what I do is I talk to them about ways,

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,214
we basically do a gallery walk

117
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:34,165
so everyone shares their metaphors,

118
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:36,086
I put those metaphors on the walls

119
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:38,151
and they walk around and see how each other feels

120
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:41,706
about the activities they&#39;re about to do in the class.

121
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:44,412
And then over the course of the semester or the year,

122
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:47,259
what I do is we use those metaphors as touch points.

123
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,743
So every few weeks, I will say,

124
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:52,492
let&#39;s go back to that original metaphor

125
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,191
and see what you think about it at this point.

126
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,565
And they&#39;ll look at them and inevitably,

127
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,788
maybe not the first time they revisit the metaphor,

128
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:03,577
maybe not the second time, but eventually,

129
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:06,551
they revisit those metaphors and they begin to tweak them.

130
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,196
So you&#39;ll see edits on the visuals, right?

131
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:11,195
So maybe the figure on the mountain

132
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,267
makes it a little further up the mountain,

133
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:15,724
or maybe they get rid of that metaphor altogether

134
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:17,108
and they create another one

135
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,336
that suggests that their feeling

136
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:21,847
and their sense of capability around reading and writing

137
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:24,374
is just something that they embrace more,

138
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,408
that they feel more excited about.

139
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:28,355
And then we reflect together,

140
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:31,093
about what has made that change occur.

141
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:33,674
And what students come to understand is that

142
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:36,044
it&#39;s all about having a growth mindset

143
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,888
so that notion of you can change,

144
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:41,309
you&#39;re not always that person in the first metaphor,

145
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,750
but the other thing that it makes

146
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,619
very explicit for students,

147
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:48,604
is that with intentional effort,

148
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:52,162
you can shift your way of thinking about yourself

149
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:54,376
in a learning context

150
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:56,778
and you can shift what&#39;s possible for yourself

151
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:58,478
in that learning context.

152
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:00,712
So learning how to revise more effectively,

153
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:03,725
learning tools for reading each night,

154
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:08,044
coming to an appreciation about how a class can help you

155
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:10,697
work through misunderstanding,

156
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:13,407
are all strategies they come to see

157
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,970
are ways to help them grow

158
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,803
and shift their mindset around their learning.
