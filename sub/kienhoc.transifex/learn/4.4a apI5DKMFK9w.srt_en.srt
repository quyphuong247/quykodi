00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:09,653
- How does the science of learning

1
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:13,043
inform the day-to-day instructional choices of teachers

2
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:15,158
and how they might design learning experiences

3
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:16,741
for their students?

4
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:24,147
This is a question that until relatively recently

5
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:26,418
was not easy to answer.

6
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:28,321
The research about how children learn

7
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:32,186
was not readily accessible to the typical classroom teacher.

8
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:34,580
What was available didn&#39;t translate easily

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,166
into ready-to-use teaching strategies.

10
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,055
Fortunately, that&#39;s no longer the case.

11
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:43,588
Cognitive science research now provides a rich body of work

12
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:44,840
that can enhance immediately

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,465
the effectiveness of any teacher.

14
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:49,674
More and more of that research is being translated

15
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,747
into books and articles designed for classroom teachers.

16
00:00:53,747 --> 00:00:55,995
In this session and those that follow,

17
00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:57,993
we will show practical implications

18
00:00:57,993 --> 00:00:59,475
of the science of learning

19
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:02,284
as it relates to teaching strategies.

20
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:04,715
Before we begin, however, we want to acknowledge

21
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:06,804
that reflective teachers everywhere

22
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:08,704
may already understand many

23
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:11,203
if not all of the learning principles

24
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:14,167
these teaching strategies are based on.

25
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,310
Cognitive science research can affirm

26
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,092
and deepen that existing understanding

27
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:20,930
and in some cases provides us

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,574
with counterintuitive insights.

29
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:27,039
First, let&#39;s do a quick review of our model of memory

30
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,148
that you, by now, should be quite familiar with.

31
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:32,622
Incoming sensory information makes its way

32
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:34,131
through the attention bottleneck

33
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:36,895
and enters into our working memory.

34
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:39,788
It then either begins to be processed in some way

35
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:43,240
or is lost after a brief period of time.

36
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,549
Recall that the real learning action occurs

37
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:48,632
between working memory and long-term memory.

38
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:50,411
We encode memories through the dialogue

39
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,815
that happens between the two.

40
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:55,275
Learning is when information from working memory

41
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,417
is transferred to long-term memory

42
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,484
through what is usually called conscious processing.

43
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:03,482
We use the phrase, &quot;You have to think to learn,&quot;

44
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:06,566
with regard to memory formation.

45
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:09,201
That&#39;s what active learning is all about:

46
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:12,360
linking new knowledge to what&#39;s already in our memory,

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,643
what we call prior knowledge.

48
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:18,400
It&#39;s really that simple and profound.

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,502
If you&#39;d like a fuller explanation,

50
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:24,556
please refer to our earlier sessions on learning strategies.

51
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:25,661
Now we&#39;re going to look at

52
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:27,416
some different teaching strategies

53
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,069
that are based on learning principles

54
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,470
emerging from cognitive science.

55
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,102
You will be familiar with three of these strategies:

56
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:38,068
retrieval practice, spaced practice, and interleaving.

57
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:39,244
We discussed them earlier

58
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:42,120
when we talked about student learning strategies.

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,451
Two additional strategies

60
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,275
that are important for teachers to know

61
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:48,933
are elaboration and promoting metacognition.

62
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,517
Let&#39;s begin with retrieval practice.

63
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:54,325
Few cognitive strategies are as well-researched,

64
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:57,418
simple to understand, and easy to apply,

65
00:02:57,418 --> 00:03:00,347
yet its impact on learning is powerful.

66
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,460
It&#39;s basic premises are threefold.

67
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,105
First, the act of retrieving a memory

68
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:09,611
can modify, reorganize, and consolidate it better

69
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,770
in our long-term storage.

70
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,765
Second, recalling a memory often creates

71
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:17,299
secondary retrieval pathways to that memory

72
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,046
and makes it easier to retrieve later.

73
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,115
Third, by searching for a memory,

74
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:25,608
we frequently activate information connected to that memory

75
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:28,018
and link it in a more networked context

76
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:30,629
for easier future access.

77
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,159
It&#39;s as if our overall memory was a dark storage room

78
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,524
that we enter with a flashlight to look for things.

79
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:40,591
For example, in this analogy, let&#39;s say it&#39;s a picture

80
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:44,055
from an old box of photos we&#39;d like to find.

81
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:45,841
As we enter the dark storage room,

82
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,722
we scan with our flashlight and peer about.

83
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:50,793
We see some boxes off in a corner

84
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:52,973
that look as if they might contain the photos

85
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:55,294
and begin to rummage around.

86
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:58,477
In the process, we might organize the boxes a bit

87
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:01,410
as we examine them and poke around inside.

88
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,845
Finally, we find our box of photos,

89
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,052
retrieve the picture we&#39;re look for, and leave.

90
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:09,663
Chances are, the next time we go into the storage room,

91
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:13,050
we&#39;ll be much more likely to find the box of photos.

92
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,575
Likewise with retrieval practice.

93
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:17,738
All the cognitive processing it creates,

94
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,416
which can be a struggle, strengthens memories

95
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:24,003
and make them more likely to be retrieved in the future.

96
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:27,135
In basic ways, the act of retrieving a memory

97
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:29,397
is a learning event.

98
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:32,449
But there is an important caveat to consider.

99
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,312
It has to do with the retrieval cues

100
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:36,328
used to recall the memories.

101
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:40,019
It makes a difference where the retrieval cue comes from.

102
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,788
It could be an outside source like a question in a book

103
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:46,542
or on a study guide, or even a teacher&#39;s verbal question.

104
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,500
Those prompts or cues are what the learner then uses

105
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,404
to search their memory.

106
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:54,311
For example, a history student might study for a test

107
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,164
by rereading material they highlighted in their text

108
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,656
or looking over their notes

109
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:01,792
or even reading textbook passages.

110
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,255
These are three of the most common study strategies

111
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:05,983
used by students.

112
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:08,861
The recall cues used to retrieve the relevant information

113
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:12,776
in their memory comes from the text or the notes themselves.

114
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:16,168
We call this cued recall because the learner is being cued

115
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:19,155
or prompted by these outside sources.

116
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:20,317
On the other hand,

117
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:23,348
the learner can supply the retrieval cues.

118
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:25,991
In this case, the student first tries to recall

119
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,334
what they remember about the important material

120
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:31,842
in their text or notes without looking at them.

121
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:33,433
They would ask themselves,

122
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,917
&quot;What are the most important ideas

123
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,811
&quot;in my notes or what I highlighted

124
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:39,590
&quot;that I need to remember for tomorrow&#39;s test?&quot;

125
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,873
We call this free recall.

126
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:45,204
The cues are entirely coming from the learner.

127
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:48,130
If we hearken back to the dark storage room analogy,

128
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,531
during free recall,

129
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:51,812
the learner is the one holding the flashlight,

130
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:53,808
looking for the wanted item in the room

131
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:56,493
and also doing the work finding it.

132
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:59,899
In cued recall, someone else is holding the flashlight

133
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,936
and the learner is much less active.

134
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:05,717
Free recall is usually much harder for the learner

135
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:08,087
because they have to struggle to find the information

136
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:10,814
without the benefit of specific cues.

137
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:12,855
But it&#39;s precisely in that struggle

138
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:14,362
where the learning happens,

139
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:16,571
for all the reasons we&#39;ve described.

140
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:19,441
Unfortunately, cued recall often creates

141
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:22,109
the illusion of knowing in learners.

142
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:24,380
They look at their highlighted text or notes

143
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,019
and these cues help them go directly to those areas

144
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,516
in their long-term memory containing that information.

145
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,711
They find that information if it&#39;s there

146
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:35,636
and affirm its presence and then move on.

147
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:38,943
Little if any cognitive processing or struggle happens,

148
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:41,244
but this act of recognition does little

149
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:44,258
to strengthen and consolidate the memory.

150
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:45,223
It&#39;s not that cued recall

151
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:47,415
has no positive learning attributes.

152
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:49,123
It just doesn&#39;t have the significant

153
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:51,803
learning benefits of free recall.

154
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:54,463
So, how we do incorporate this understanding

155
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,353
of retrieval practice in our teaching?

156
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,536
It&#39;s actually fairly simple.

157
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:02,254
We encourage students to practice retrieval

158
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:06,225
whenever they can, both in and out of class.

159
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,141
Here are some examples.

160
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:10,049
The beginning of class is a good time

161
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:12,001
to do your retrieval practice.

162
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:14,766
If the students had a homework reading or problem set,

163
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:15,745
ask them to think about

164
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:18,897
the most important concept or skills they learned.

165
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,520
Be sure they know they can&#39;t look at

166
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,261
their notes or readings as they do this.

167
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:24,814
You could also ask them to recall

168
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:28,333
the most important ideas we talked about in class yesterday.

169
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,128
Be sure to have students think first on their own

170
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:33,817
and perhaps write down what they come up with.

171
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:36,041
Remember, you want them to struggle some,

172
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:40,423
and let them know that struggle is okay and even productive.

173
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:41,859
Once they&#39;ve thought for a bit,

174
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:42,777
they could share their thoughts

175
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:44,995
with a partner and compare notes.

176
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:47,999
This is another form of cognitive processing.

177
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,344
So far, we&#39;ve used no more

178
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,182
than four or five minutes of class time.

179
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,898
Next, you could talk as a whole class

180
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:57,924
or students could go back and review their notes or reading.

181
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,890
However you do it, you want them to be sure

182
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,695
to check on whether their retrieval

183
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:04,308
was both accurate and complete.

184
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:05,887
This is a key point.

185
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,172
Students must always have some way to verify

186
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:11,146
the quality of their retrieval practice.

187
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:13,424
We wanna be sure they confirm what they know

188
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:17,764
and identify what they may have forgotten or misconstrued.

189
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,793
You&#39;re probably thinking, &quot;This takes a lotta time.&quot;

190
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:23,273
Well, yes and no, depending on the nature

191
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:25,273
of the material we&#39;re dealing with.

192
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,934
It could take anywhere from five to 15 minutes,

193
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:30,142
but the long-term learning gains for the students

194
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,629
are well worth the investment of time.

195
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:33,792
And let me emphasize,

196
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,299
the gains are in long-term memory storage

197
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,651
and in the ability to flexibly retrieve

198
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,612
what&#39;s in our memory.

199
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:43,057
What we call forgetting is often an inability

200
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,464
to retrieve what&#39;s in memory

201
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:48,455
or was never consolidated in memory in a durable way.

202
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:50,169
Here&#39;s another example.

203
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:52,105
During a class discussion or lecture,

204
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:55,086
you could pause partway through and ask students

205
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:58,521
to think about their questions or the most important things

206
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,684
that have been said thus far.

207
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:03,955
Writing this down, drawing a diagram or concept map,

208
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:08,218
or talking with a neighbor will help solidify the learning.

209
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:09,831
Teachers need to encourage students

210
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:12,535
to use retrieval practice during homework,

211
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,790
pausing periodically to free recall

212
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,656
the most important ideas they&#39;ve been learning.

213
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:20,204
After doing a homework reading or problem set,

214
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:22,078
students can move on to other homework

215
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,862
but then circle back and try to recall

216
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:27,548
the most important ideas and concepts they studied before.

217
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:29,964
Expecting and teaching students to develop

218
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:31,944
these habits of studying should become

219
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:34,044
a part of your teaching repertoire,

220
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:35,725
even though you&#39;re not usually with your students

221
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,493
when they do their homework.

222
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,950
In other words, you take class time to help students

223
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,568
become more effective learners when they&#39;re away from you.

224
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:45,045
Recall that the growth mindset

225
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,815
is only useful in enhancing student learning

226
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:51,165
if the mindset is accompanied by effective effort.

227
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:53,101
The nice thing about retrieval practice

228
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:54,476
is that it&#39;s portable.

229
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:56,027
Students can do it anywhere:

230
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:58,403
sitting on the bus, standing in line,

231
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:02,144
taking a shower, even right before falling asleep.

232
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:05,257
A few caveats before we move on to spaced practice,

233
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:07,318
the next learning strategy.

234
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:08,898
First, as we&#39;ve said,

235
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:11,085
it&#39;s essential that students receive feedback

236
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:13,350
about the accuracy and completeness

237
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,726
of their retrieval practice.

238
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:19,996
Second, it&#39;s important that retrieval practice isn&#39;t graded.

239
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:23,241
We&#39;re not advocating simply doing a lot of quizzing.

240
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:25,602
Retrieval practice is a learning strategy,

241
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:27,574
not an assessment form.

242
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:30,732
We want students to use it whenever they can.

243
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:33,288
By grading retrieval practice, anxiety,

244
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:35,824
and other performance issues become attached

245
00:10:35,824 --> 00:10:37,571
to what should be a remarkably effective

246
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,400
and flexible formative tool for learning.

247
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,175
Finally, it&#39;s important that students have something

248
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,024
in memory to retrieve in the first place.

249
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,975
If they don&#39;t know how to strategically read, for example,

250
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:51,465
they may come into class with very little in memory

251
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,893
after reading a homework assignment.

252
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:55,815
That&#39;s why knowing how to actively learn

253
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:59,220
in the ways we&#39;ve discussed in this course is important.

254
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,549
Finally, done appropriately, retrieval practice

255
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:05,053
is difficult and it involves struggle.

256
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:08,933
Let students know that this struggle is good for learning.

257
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:11,914
Durable and long-lasting learning that can be retrieved

258
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:16,081
and used later when we need it doesn&#39;t happen easily.
