0
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,804
- We learn from feedback.

1
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:13,825
In fact, it&#39;s the primary way we learn.

2
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:16,174
Usually this comes from making mistakes and errors,

3
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:18,310
seeing how our efforts have fallen short,

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,191
or are misconstrued, then revising and trying again.

5
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:24,826
But learning from feedback is not always easy.

6
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:26,576
Especially in schools.

7
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:29,772
Students need to receive feedback first,

8
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:32,330
then interpret and reflect on what it means

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,278
and most importantly, figure out what to do with it.

10
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:39,871
This is complicated by the fact that every morning

11
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:42,396
we greet a wonderfully diverse array of learners

12
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:44,373
who often view the same feedback

13
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:46,490
in surprisingly different ways.

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,084
It&#39;s a given that our students don&#39;t learn

15
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,303
everything we teach them.

16
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:53,346
This is why feedback provided through assessments

17
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:55,630
is one of the most important elements

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,665
of effective teaching.

19
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:01,031
However, in the world of education, probably nothing

20
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:04,037
is more fraught with anxiety than assessment.

21
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:07,328
From the Common Core to the APs, we worry about how

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,067
high stakes testing affects our students.

23
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:13,045
Fortunately, this is not the sort of assessment

24
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:15,073
we&#39;ll be talking about here.

25
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:18,603
Instead, we will be talking about formative assessment

26
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:20,977
and what that means for student learning.

27
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:24,841
By formative assessment we mean gathering information

28
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,760
about student performance that we use

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,927
to move their learning forward and improve our teaching.

30
00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:38,053
The evidence supporting classroom formative assessment

31
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:41,256
as one of the most powerful enhancers of student learning

32
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:44,355
is some of the strongest in educational research.

33
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:47,075
It works and it&#39;s very powerful.

34
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,392
That said, it&#39;s not always easy to practice.

35
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:52,440
So let&#39;s go over the central principles

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,560
of effective formative assessment.

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,217
We can&#39;t do complete justice here to this complex

38
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,054
and challenging aspect of effective teaching.

39
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,723
For those interested in both the theory and practical

40
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,217
implications of formative assessment, we encourage

41
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:07,880
you to become familiar with the work of Dylan William

42
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,623
and Jan Chappuis and others.

43
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:12,725
Effective formative assessment revolves around

44
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,111
three basic questions.

45
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:17,060
What is it you want your students to learn?

46
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,643
Where are they now?

47
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:22,805
How do you move their learning forward?

48
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:31,059
In other words, how do we close the gap

49
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,814
between desired learning goals

50
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:35,361
and students&#39; current understanding?

51
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:39,039
In practice, it&#39;s much more complicated to answer

52
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,059
these questions for our students.

53
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:43,975
The first move is to be clear about what it is

54
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:46,283
we want students to know and be able to do

55
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:48,136
with what they know.

56
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:51,049
In addition, it&#39;s important to consider within our array

57
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,161
of intended learning goals, the following question.

58
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:57,825
What do we prioritize as the most important

59
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,762
learning outcomes we want our students

60
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,335
to possess enduringly?

61
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:04,808
In other words, what skills and knowledge do we want

62
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:07,353
to transfer beyond the short term?

63
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,301
What do we want our students to walk across

64
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:11,208
the stage possessing?

65
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,213
As we&#39;ve emphasized in this course, creating durable

66
00:03:14,213 --> 00:03:15,872
and lasting memories requires

67
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:18,614
special learning and teaching conditions.

68
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:21,206
It&#39;s important that as our priority learning goals

69
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:23,476
are determined, they&#39;re shared with students

70
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:25,657
along with the criteria for exemplary work

71
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:28,513
and how we will know when they&#39;ve been met.

72
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:30,934
We need to involve students in understanding

73
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,995
where we&#39;re heading in a learning way.

74
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,790
A clear destination with purpose can be

75
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,642
a compelling motivator.

76
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:40,372
Providing examples and models of weak and strong work

77
00:03:40,372 --> 00:03:42,320
can be helpful in conveying to students

78
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,144
clear and understandable learning goals.

79
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:48,151
This is important because students need to begin

80
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:50,650
to develop an understanding of what quality work

81
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,863
looks like so they can internalize standards for good work.

82
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:57,386
For teachers, being clear about priority learning outcomes

83
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:00,537
provides us with the evidence we need to collect

84
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:01,817
for our next step.

85
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,596
Where are my students now?

86
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:06,099
There are a myriad ways to figure out what students

87
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,113
currently know and can do.

88
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:09,811
That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy.

89
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:12,884
It would be nice if we could pry open our students&#39; heads

90
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:13,910
and look inside.

91
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,864
Since we can&#39;t do that, you&#39;ll need to figure out

92
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,697
in ways that make sense for your students

93
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:19,593
and school situation.

94
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,081
This will always be a challenge since truly figuring

95
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:25,149
out what our students know is a virtually impossible task.

96
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,566
That said, we&#39;ll offer a few suggestions.

97
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,167
First, provide descriptive feedback to students

98
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,475
that helps them answer questions like what are my strengths

99
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:40,818
and what am I doing well?

100
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:44,305
How does my work compare to our success criteria?

101
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:47,734
What am I doing not so well and why?

102
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:50,404
What are the most important things I need to work on?

103
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:54,745
Comments need to be clear, tangible, and user friendly

104
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,573
in terms of language that the students

105
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:58,643
can readily understand.

106
00:04:58,643 --> 00:05:00,628
Students need to clearly see the gap between where

107
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:02,858
they are and where they need to be.

108
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:05,852
Refer them to the criteria or verbix you have developed.

109
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,898
Best when done with them so that

110
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:10,698
your comments are goal referenced.

111
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:13,647
It&#39;s also important for them to be able to prioritize.

112
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,376
We often provide students with too much feedback

113
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:18,876
and they don&#39;t always know where to focus.

114
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,656
Second, as Dylan Williams suggests, the best way

115
00:05:27,656 --> 00:05:30,706
to figure out what students know is by talking to them

116
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,891
and engaging them in dialogue.

117
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:35,946
He and others provide a number of practical techniques

118
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:38,281
for collecting evidence about what your students

119
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,531
are able to do.

120
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:49,108
Third, teach students to self and peer-assess.

121
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:52,219
We want our students to eventually be weaned from us

122
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,013
in determining the quality of their work.

123
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:57,725
Over time, they should be able to ask and answer questions

124
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,117
like those posed earlier

125
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:00,837
about their strengths and weaknesses

126
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:02,752
as well as what to work on next.

127
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:05,896
A good way for them to learn how to do this

128
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,920
is to work with peers, providing each other feedback.

129
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,055
But be aware, kids need to be trained

130
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:12,972
on how to do this well.

131
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:21,726
Finally, and this is important, decouple grades

132
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:24,532
or evaluative feedback from your descriptive feedback.

133
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:27,301
Research shows, and your own teaching experience

134
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:29,924
probably affirms, that as soon as we put a grade

135
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,441
along with our comments, a large number of students

136
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,777
will ignore our feedback as they react

137
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,747
to the grade, good or bad.

138
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:38,538
This doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t provide feedback

139
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:41,737
that lets them know the quality of their work.

140
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,636
We can still convey that in our narrative comments

141
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,838
as we help them see their strengths and weaknesses

142
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,394
as it relates to our success criteria.

143
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,795
Nor does it mean they never get grades

144
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,889
as a part of their feedback.

145
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,263
This can be accomplished in a number of ways

146
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:56,364
in conjunction with them or not.

147
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:59,785
But our strong encouragement is to not provide feedback

148
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:01,934
in the form of descriptive comments and grades

149
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,952
at the same time.

150
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:06,203
Hopefully, when feedback is effective,

151
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:09,264
our students can see the gap between where we would

152
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:11,935
like them to be and where they currently are.

153
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:15,921
The next move is to help them close the performance gap

154
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,879
in a way that improves the quality of their work.

155
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,315
We don&#39;t have the time here to go through a thorough

156
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,530
discussion of all the ways to give students

157
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,697
effective feedback, but we&#39;ll say a few key things.

158
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,571
As we&#39;ve discussed elsewhere, developing in students

159
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:37,117
a growth mindset is important.

160
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:38,844
If they believe that their effective effort

161
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:40,889
will be the most important factor in their enhanced

162
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,545
achievement, then they&#39;ll be much more likely

163
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:46,015
to pay attention to our feedback.

164
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:48,165
It&#39;s crucial, therefore, that we help them become

165
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:51,915
more effective in their effort and hard work.

166
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,634
We mentioned earlier it&#39;s common to provide

167
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:00,270
too much feedback to our students,

168
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,498
which is a problem for two reasons.

169
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,669
First, it can be overwhelming,

170
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,651
especially for struggling students.

171
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:10,452
Second, voluminous comments can take a lot of teacher time,

172
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,215
which is unfortunate if the feedback ends up

173
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,070
not being very effective.

174
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,230
Instead, have students focus on their most important areas

175
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,585
in need of revision and improvement.

176
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:22,291
Both to hopefully give them a sense of accomplishment

177
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,519
but also to help them discern priorities.

178
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,372
In addition, over time, try and create a classroom culture

179
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:31,681
where peer and self-assessment become an integral part

180
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:34,764
of the way students receive feedback.

181
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,018
Our third suggestion is probably the most important one.

182
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:45,633
Unless students do something with the feedback they receive,

183
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,489
and actually act upon it in some way to improve

184
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:51,627
their learning, it is probably a waste of time.

185
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:54,740
Dylan William goes so far as to say the only thing

186
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,192
that matters about feedback is what

187
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:58,192
the students do with it.

188
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,090
This leads to our final point

189
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,203
which makes the last point possible.

190
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:09,426
We need to allocate class and homework time

191
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:12,821
for students to respond in some way to our feedback.

192
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:16,501
This means we need to make some hard choices

193
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:19,213
and carve out time for our students to meaningfully

194
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:21,473
apply the most important feedback they get

195
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,608
in order to improve their learning.

196
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,763
And we need to hold them accountable

197
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:27,997
for doing something with our feedback.

198
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:30,669
We can&#39;t just carve the time.

199
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:34,445
Research shows, and our own teaching practices affirm,

200
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:37,418
that the more our students receive ongoing feedback

201
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:38,782
to improve their learning,

202
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:41,252
the better their performance will be.

203
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:44,364
This will almost assuredly reinforce their growth mindset

204
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,288
and increase their sense of self-efficacy.

205
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:49,539
If we do this in a way that&#39;s transparent

206
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,707
and involves them in the self-assessment

207
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,272
and self-adjustment of their work,

208
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:55,808
their sense of competency and autonomy

209
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:58,851
will also increase and likely increase their motivation

210
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:01,082
for moving forward with their learning.

211
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:03,937
An added bonus is that formative assessment done well

212
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,393
also provides real time information

213
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:08,546
about the impact of our teaching.

214
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:10,563
It becomes a vital and informative link

215
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:12,881
between our teaching and our students&#39; learning.

216
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:15,907
If you asked me, something all teachers should become

217
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,720
really good at, I&#39;d probably say it would be

218
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,235
making the practice of formative assessment

219
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:23,984
an integral part of day to day classroom culture.

220
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:25,734
It&#39;s that important.
