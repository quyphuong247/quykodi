00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:11,285
- So at the start of the year,

1
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:13,339
Whether I&#39;m teaching a ninth grade class

2
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:15,209
of incoming high school students

3
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:16,628
or a senior class

4
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:18,861
about to apply to college,

5
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:22,098
what I do is I ask them to draw a metaphor

6
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:23,765
of themselves as a writer

7
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:26,453
and a metaphor of themselves as a reader.

8
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:29,713
So what that activity does right away is a few things.

9
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:32,853
One, it asks them to contend with this concept,

10
00:00:32,853 --> 00:00:35,486
called metaphor, and students,

11
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:38,515
particularly ninth grade students come in to my class

12
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:41,483
assuming that they know what metaphors are.

13
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:44,697
It&#39;s a comparison that does not like or as.

14
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:46,824
That&#39;s their working definition.

15
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:47,887
And what I say to them,

16
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:50,316
is while that is technically correct,

17
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,996
the way that I also want them to think about metaphor,

18
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:55,855
is that it impacts the way that we move through the world

19
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,393
and think about our possibility in it.

20
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,593
And they kind of look at me quizzically,

21
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,086
but then what we do is they spend some time

22
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:05,708
drawing a picture that represents for them

23
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,859
what it&#39;s like to be a writer,

24
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,191
and then they draw a picture that represents

25
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:12,365
what it is for them to be a reader.

26
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:13,574
And for some of them,

27
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,101
if reading and writing are difficult,

28
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:18,365
they draw themselves climbing these really steep mountains,

29
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,211
barely making it to the top,

30
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:23,070
or not even being able to see the top.

31
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,797
If it&#39;s something that they enjoy,

32
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:27,264
that they gravitate to intrinsically,

33
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:29,820
then what they do is they will draw themselves,

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,224
maybe on a hammock, or swimming at the beach,

35
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:35,656
something that speaks to their feeling

36
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:37,488
about what it is to do that activity,

37
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:39,810
and what they imagine is possible for them.

38
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,736
I actually had one student this year draw themselves

39
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,821
at the top of the triad for an Olympic event,

40
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:47,046
where they get their medals

41
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:48,672
and they were wearing a gold medal,

42
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,471
because that&#39;s how they feel when they read,

43
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:52,122
they feel like champions.

44
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:53,683
So collecting that information

45
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:55,480
and having the students from day one,

46
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,930
before I instruct them in anything at all,

47
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,399
lets me know what their prior knowledge

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,997
about themselves is as learners.

49
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,156
What are their preconceived notions

50
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:07,506
about what is possible for them.

51
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:09,824
And then what we do is we look at a few metaphors

52
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:13,578
that are sort of stock metaphors in our cultural context.

53
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:17,302
So one example might be the light bulb moment,

54
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:20,887
everyone is pretty much familiar with this idea that

55
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:24,908
thinking is often imagined as a light bulb coming on,

56
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,241
that great idea.

57
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:29,592
But then I talked through that idea with my students

58
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:30,990
and they come to understand

59
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,220
that if they think, if they go through the world,

60
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,843
if they go through school, imagining that

61
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:38,802
good thinkers have light bulb moments all the time,

62
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:40,990
as opposed to thinking that learning,

63
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,311
and having good ideas is actually an iterative process,

64
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:46,591
that it takes time, it takes effort,

65
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,746
it takes thoughtfulness and deliberate attention

66
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:50,196
to what you&#39;re doing,

67
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:52,578
then they&#39;re gonna think that those kids,

68
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:55,285
who seem to have quote en quote light bulb moments

69
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:58,062
all the time, can answer a question right away,

70
00:02:58,062 --> 00:02:59,235
are the smart ones,

71
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:01,552
and that they are ineffective learners.

72
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:03,492
And so we break down that metaphor,

73
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:06,183
and I show them that if we walk

74
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:08,201
through the world with one concept,

75
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,631
that it actually limits what&#39;s possible to us.

76
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,705
But if we open up our minds to other kinds of concepts,

77
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:17,497
other kinds of metaphors, like electrical circuits possibly,

78
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,155
traveling through each other,

79
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,385
in order to create that light bulb moment.

80
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:24,224
Then they have a better sense of possibility

81
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:25,903
for them in this class,

82
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:30,070
in ways that they don&#39;t come with in the beginning.
