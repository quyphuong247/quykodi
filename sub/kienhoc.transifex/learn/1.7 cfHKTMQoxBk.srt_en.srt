0
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,164
- In one form or another,

1
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:11,811
teachers are always asking the question,

2
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,609
what&#39;s worth learning, when they make choices

3
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,057
in designing learning experience for their students.

4
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:22,756
What are the most important concepts skills and attitudes

5
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:27,040
we want them to develop and use after their time with us?

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,913
That&#39;s why we work so hard to create

7
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:33,431
effective learning experiences that we hope will instill

8
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:38,185
long lasting memories of these essential understandings.

9
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:40,293
But getting those important learnings

10
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:43,951
into our student&#39;s heads is only half the battle.

11
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:46,441
They still need to be able to pull them out,

12
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:48,377
and apply them when needed,

13
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:50,519
be it in later academic settings,

14
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:53,186
or in their lives beyond school.

15
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:57,555
In fact, much of forgetting is simply not being able

16
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:00,811
to easily call up things we have in memory.

17
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,436
It&#39;s often in there,

18
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:05,348
but we just can&#39;t retrieve it when we need it.

19
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:07,316
And we&#39;ve all experienced many times

20
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:09,702
those failures to recall.

21
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:13,307
So if learning is to lasting and transferable,

22
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:16,302
meaning that we can apply it under the right conditions

23
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:20,534
after we have learned it, two things need to happen.

24
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:24,870
First, the new learning must be securely consolidated

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,935
and integrated into our long-term memory

26
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:30,425
through active learning experiences,

27
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:33,978
as we discussed in previous sessions of this course.

28
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:36,608
This requires that we think to learn

29
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:39,081
in order to make enduring memories

30
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:43,905
that are solidly linked to our prior knowledge and skills.

31
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:47,510
Second, the memories need to be readily accessible

32
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,010
through recall cues that are triggered by the circumstances

33
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,605
we want them to be used for.

34
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:57,401
In other words, how new learning will be used later,

35
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:00,466
that is under what real world conditions

36
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:03,148
will it have to be retrieved from memory,

37
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:06,161
is crucial to consider as we design ways

38
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,547
for new knowledge and skills to be made

39
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:11,159
into memories in the first place.

40
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,632
Cognitive scientists often say,

41
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,592
think of retrieval during encoding.

42
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:19,449
Unfortunately, this important aspect

43
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,009
of enduring and transferable learning

44
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,934
is often overlooked in learning designs.

45
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,432
So the rest of this session

46
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,460
will explore the teaching implications

47
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,142
of how we help our students recall the learning

48
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:34,797
we hope they commit to memory in our classes.

49
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:38,547
Let&#39;s start by my asking you a few questions.

50
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:43,108
How do you spell your last name?

51
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,625
Who is the current President of the United States?

52
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,412
How many sides to a triangle?

53
00:02:57,498 --> 00:03:00,915
How many planets are in our solar system?

54
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:06,908
What did you have to eat for breakfast today?

55
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,895
Who is your best friend?

56
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,806
What was your most embarrassing experience as a teenager?

57
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,989
How do you tie your shoes?

58
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:25,438
What was the plot of the last novel you read?

59
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:29,420
Each of these questions you no doubt answered

60
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,077
with varying degrees of quickness and certainty.

61
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:36,557
Some you were able to retrieve almost instantly,

62
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:39,590
but others took longer to find in your memory.

63
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,091
And still others you had to think about

64
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:44,225
once you retrieved the relevant memories.

65
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:48,318
Each one too, had a a different pathway to retrieval.

66
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,017
Some were probably direct and automatic,

67
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:54,433
while others because of when and how they were formed,

68
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:58,595
might have required more circuitous path to retrieval.

69
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:03,158
Questions of this sort can be thought of as retrieval cues.

70
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,042
A cue in the sense that we are talking about here,

71
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,967
is information from our surrounding environment

72
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:14,252
that causes us to begin the process of memory retrieval.

73
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:18,292
It could be sensory information, either in a focused way,

74
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,200
like specific smells or sounds,

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,750
like the smell of a gymnasium

76
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,104
reminding you of your sports career, or in combination,

77
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:30,012
the way a person walking and humming in front of you

78
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:32,781
reminds you of your grandmother.

79
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:35,533
The cues could also be the words in a book

80
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,904
or a question a teacher asks.

81
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,934
You could also provide the cue yourself,

82
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,755
as when you mentally ask a series of questions

83
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:48,109
trying to remember the plot of the last novel you read.

84
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:50,564
For our purposes in this course,

85
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:53,037
we&#39;re going to distinguish two forms of recall

86
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:55,772
as it relates to memory retrieval,

87
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:58,105
cued recall and free recall.

88
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:02,375
By cued recall, we will mean

89
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:06,720
any specific visual or verbal cue provided to students

90
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,768
intended to elicit a memory.

91
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,129
It could also be a teacher&#39;s question asked in class

92
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,828
or written questions on a study guide,

93
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:17,570
or the information in the student&#39;s notes

94
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,871
as he checks his memory to see if he&#39;s ready to take a test.

95
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:25,668
Free recall, on the other hand, is much less specific

96
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,496
in the form of the cue.

97
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:31,663
For example, a teacher for a reading quiz might ask,

98
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,532
what were the most important ideas

99
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,674
in the homework reading for today?

100
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:41,080
Or we just spent two weeks of class studying photosynthesis,

101
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,842
what were the key take away understandings?

102
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:49,457
See how nonspecific these free recall questions are?

103
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:51,799
It&#39;s important to know that free recall

104
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,802
is a lot harder to do.

105
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:56,765
It simply takes more work to search your memory,

106
00:05:56,765 --> 00:06:00,385
and to respond to those general sorts of cues.

107
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:03,785
Not only do you have to scan, sort, prioritize

108
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:07,088
and organize more, processing things in working memory

109
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,058
as you retrieve information,

110
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:12,267
but you also have to continually be thinking

111
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:15,196
of retrieval cues in your search.

112
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:18,782
In other words, once the general free recall prompt

113
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:21,290
or cue is asked, the learner must provide

114
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,152
the subsequent retrieval cues.

115
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:27,721
Now here&#39;s the really cool thing about free recall

116
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,509
as a way to retrieve memories,

117
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,169
it is very effective as a way to make memories

118
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,822
that last longer and are easier to retrieve.

119
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,708
The cognitive effort required

120
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,209
not only modifies in more specific and organized ways

121
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:43,566
prior memory being recalled,

122
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:47,152
but it also allows the learner to develop retrieval cues

123
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:51,293
for that memory rather than relying on some external cue

124
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:53,011
like a teacher&#39;s verbal question,

125
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,580
a written quiz, or a study guide question.

126
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,947
As long as there&#39;s something in memory to recall,

127
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:02,590
the desirable difficulty of free recall

128
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,024
can be a powerful learning tool.

129
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:09,896
It&#39;s important to note that after any free recall practice,

130
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,202
students need feedback of some sort

131
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:15,977
to about whether their recall was accurate and complete.

132
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,738
This is crucial, otherwise inaccurate

133
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,307
and/or incomplete memories might be the result,

134
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:25,825
exactly what we don&#39;t want to have happen.

135
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:27,930
We&#39;ll say a lot more about retrieval practice

136
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,078
in weeks three and four when we discuss study skills

137
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:34,024
and instructional strategies.

138
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:35,606
Here are a few more things

139
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,829
to keep in mind about retrieval

140
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:42,492
as we design learning experiences for our students.

141
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:46,785
First, match memory and coding with memory retrieval.

142
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:49,546
This goes back to the principle mentioned earlier,

143
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,463
think of retrieval during encoding.

144
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:56,818
As you design lessons for students to learn new things,

145
00:07:56,818 --> 00:08:00,152
think about under what circumstances they will be asked

146
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:02,635
to retrieve that information.

147
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:06,248
For example, if you want your students to write effectively,

148
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:08,605
what will be the eventual circumstances

149
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:11,198
they will need to write effectively?

150
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:12,831
Who will be the audience?

151
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:14,683
What will be the purpose?

152
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:17,881
If those questions and context are present,

153
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:21,909
at least in part at encoding, then when the student

154
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,137
encounters them elsewhere when needed, the more likely

155
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,807
they will be to retrieve the relevant memories.

156
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:32,787
Next, organization helps retrieval.

157
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:35,608
If a learner is given the opportunity

158
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:38,925
to take information already put in memory,

159
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,861
and reorganize it some way

160
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,891
by thinking about connections and relationships,

161
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,898
the more consolidated the memory subsequently becomes,

162
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:51,096
and the easier it will be to retrieve later.

163
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,538
Likewise, if the learner is made aware

164
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:57,174
of organizational relationships during memory formation,

165
00:08:57,174 --> 00:09:00,591
the easier it will likely be to retrieve the memories

166
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:03,537
with more than one retrieval cue.

167
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:07,780
Next, effective retrieval should take time.

168
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,339
Unless the knowledge to be retrieved

169
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,059
is of a rote learning sort or basic facts on call,

170
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,382
then encouraging students to work hard

171
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,436
at trying to recall things,

172
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:22,864
as well as giving them time to do so, is important.

173
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:26,046
This includes questions students are asked in class

174
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:28,642
by providing wait time for them to retrieve

175
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:32,480
and process their answer to an impromptu teaching query.

176
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,093
Finally, knowing purpose and meaning make retrieval easier.

177
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:40,493
When the learner understands the relevance and purpose

178
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:42,648
of what we are asking them to learn,

179
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,291
it will be better linked to their prior knowledge

180
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,625
during memory formation, and will be more likely
