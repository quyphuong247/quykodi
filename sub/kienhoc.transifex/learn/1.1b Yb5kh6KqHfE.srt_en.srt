The title of your book is &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow,&quot; and you talk about two systems,

1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,700
system one and two. Can you give us an example or tell us a bit about the characters in the book?

2
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:21,709
Well, the characters are indeed system one and system two. System one corresponds to

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,590
a distinction that everybody recognizes in their own thinking, that there are some thought

4
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,360
that just happen to you and there are some thought that you must generate. There is a

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,250
lot of mental life that is completely effortless, and then there is some of mental life that

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,250
feels like work. That distinction is obvious, and people recognize it.

7
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:51,449
When I say the word &quot;mother,&quot; you have images probably of your mother and you certainly

8
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,159
have an emotional reaction, and that&#39;s something that happens to you. When I say, &quot;Two plus

9
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,299
two,&quot; a number comes to your mind. You didn&#39;t bring it there. It just came. It happened

10
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:08,299
to you. There are many, you know—in fact, most of mental life is like that. The words

11
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:15,689
that I utter when I say this sentence, they just come to me. Sometimes I will stop and

12
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,829
choose which word—that&#39;s system two—but most of the time, when I speak the words just

13
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,969
come, so that&#39;s system one.

14
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:33,929
System two is—well, there are really two types of operations that system two performs,

15
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:40,929
and one is complex computations. That is where the pupil dilates and this is mental work.

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Mental work is involved in short-term memory tasks. If I ask you, &quot;What was your previous

17
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,319
telephone number,&quot; you&#39;ll work, and your pupil will expand by about 30 or 40 percent of its

18
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:06,319
area as you retrieve those. Then there is self-control, the inhibition of impulses.

19
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,360
When you are indeed choosing your words carefully because you don&#39;t want to offend, those are

20
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,830
situations in which system two is hard at work, and you feel it, so it corresponds...

21
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,720
System one and System two really correspond to experiences that are readily available

22
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,050
and that everybody recognizes. That distinction between something happening and something

23
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,330
that you do is, I think, pretty compelling to most people.

24
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,270
The dichotomy that you&#39;ve drawn between system one and two, how does that relate to the previous

25
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,820
work you&#39;ve done on heuristics and biases?

26
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:56,820
Well, it turns out we had—Amos Tversky and I, when we started our work, we had something

27
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,760
in mind that was fairly similar to that. We were interested in intuitive statistics, so

28
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,760
in estimates that come to people&#39;s mind about probabilities and so on. Now in many of these

29
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,910
cases—we were both teachers of statistics, so we were testing our own intuitions, but

30
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,870
we knew that we could compute. So in our very first paper, we distinguished intuition from

31
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,870
computation, and our point was that intuition is in some cases surprisingly error-prone

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,340
and that people should rely on computation.

33
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,440
That was the beginning, but we never studied what I now call system two. Then our work

34
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:59,270
became controversial, and people attacked it and criticized it. There was something

35
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,430
that essentially all the criticisms and all the experimental criticisms of our work had

36
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:12,430
in common, in that they created a situation in which people could figure out the answer

37
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,030
by working on it. That was really the background.

38
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,400
Amos Tversky and I in the very last paper that we wrote together, we answered one of

39
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,400
our very persistent and well-known critic, Gerd Gigerenzer. We pointed out that in his

40
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:43,509
experiments, typically people would see—well, how would I describe it? One of our best-known

41
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,479
examples in heuristics, and it&#39;s one of the best examples in the heuristics literature,

42
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,479
is the Linda example. Linda is that not-so-young woman. She&#39;s about 30 years old now, but I&#39;m

43
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:07,400
telling you that when she was a student she was an activist, the feminist, marched in

44
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,400
all the marches. I didn&#39;t say feminist, actually. Then we asked people how likely it is that

45
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,270
Linda now is a bank teller, or how likely it is that she is now a bank teller and is

46
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:30,270
active in the feminist movement. Now there&#39;s no question that when you ask different people

47
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,080
those two questions, they will invariably say that it&#39;s more likely that she&#39;s a feminist

48
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,210
bank teller rather than a bank teller.

49
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:49,210
When you ask them the two questions to compare the two options, you&#39;re allowing system two

50
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:56,229
to check logic. By priming logical reasoning and by creating some—you can sensitize people

51
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:03,069
so that they will detect that obviously she is more likely to be a bank teller than a

52
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:09,749
feminist bank teller, but that seems to be a different process. When people see only

53
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:16,749
one example, they evaluate the fit of that example. When you show them two things together,

54
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:21,199
they can also compare, them and you provide another cue.

55
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,199
That was really the background to the distinction between the two systems with the controversy

56
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,659
around our work. It was an attempt to resolve that controversy by pointing out if you do

57
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:38,969
it between subjects and if you do it the way the world is—so you make judgments intuitively

58
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:45,129
about things, that they happen—you get those effects, and you can make them disappear by

59
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:48,110
allowing logic to play.

60
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:55,110
I&#39;ve worked a lot with anchoring. That&#39;s a phenomenon. So somebody puts a number in your

61
00:06:55,409 --> 00:07:02,129
head, and it looks plausible after a while. I mean, in fact, this is the way our mind

62
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:06,699
works. We hear something strange, we try to make sense of it. Trying to make sense of

63
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:13,699
it makes us more prone to believe it, so anchoring is a suggestion. In fact that&#39;s very powerful.

64
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:20,099
You can recognize when you&#39;re being anchored. So if you are in a negotiation situation and

65
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:30,000
the other side has an outrageous number, you know there is—you could become anchored,

66
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,600
and that is worth resisting.
