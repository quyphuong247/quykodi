0
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:11,089
- Effective teachers start with the learner in mind.

1
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:13,738
Our first move in designing lessons

2
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:17,070
and choosing teaching strategies should be to consider

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,601
what&#39;s already inside the learner&#39;s head

4
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,865
as they walk into our classroom.

5
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,604
This is because cognitive scientists agree

6
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:27,049
that learning is connecting new knowledge

7
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:29,754
to previously existing knowledge.

8
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:34,567
In some ways, it&#39;s that simple and that complicated.

9
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,551
In the last session we talked about working memory

10
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:40,717
as the gateway to long-term memory.

11
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:44,419
What is attended to and processed in working memory

12
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,586
is essential for making permanent memories to use later.

13
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:54,016
For this session, we will talk about the importance

14
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,161
of what is already in our students memories,

15
00:00:57,161 --> 00:01:00,255
their prior knowledge, beliefs and skills,

16
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:03,784
and the ways they influence ongoing learning.

17
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:07,392
Lee Shulman and his book, The Wisdom of Practice,

18
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:10,532
speaks eloquently to inside out teaching

19
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:12,624
and connected learning.

20
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:16,236
He writes, to prompt learning, you&#39;ve got to begin

21
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:20,035
with the process of going from inside out.

22
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:23,319
The first influence on new learning is not what teachers

23
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,977
do pedagogically but the learning that&#39;s already inside

24
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:28,706
the learner.

25
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:32,483
Any new learning must, in some fashion, connect with

26
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:35,563
what learners already know.

27
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,553
Prior knowledge is one of the most influential factors

28
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:41,799
in student learning because new information is processed

29
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,576
through the lens of what they already know, believe,

30
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,270
and can do.

31
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,900
Our students are not blank slates as they walk

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,642
into our classrooms.

33
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:54,601
They come with their own concepts, ideas, beliefs,

34
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:57,915
values, theories, and attitudes gained through previous

35
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,198
schooling and daily life.

36
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:03,354
And this head full of previous learning profoundly

37
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:05,307
influences new learning.

38
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:09,250
That&#39;s why ascertaining, activating, and linking to our

39
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,917
students prior knowledge is so key to effective learning.

40
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:17,213
Please notice that we mentioned beliefs as part of what our

41
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:20,576
students come into our classrooms possessing.

42
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,862
Because what a student believes about themselves

43
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:25,882
as a learner and about learning itself

44
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:30,049
can greatly influence how effectively they learn or not.

45
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:34,308
This is an idea we&#39;ll delve into during week two

46
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:35,558
about mindsets.

47
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:39,410
Let&#39;s talk more now about prior knowledge

48
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,486
and how it can help or hinder learning.

49
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:46,653
If I say the word cardinal, what comes to mind for you?

50
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:52,249
Some of you probably thought of a bright red bird,

51
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:55,853
the state bird of Indiana, others a religious figure,

52
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,897
especially if you are catholic.

53
00:02:57,897 --> 00:03:01,005
If you&#39;re a sports minded person, you might have imagined

54
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:03,574
a baseball team from Saint Louis.

55
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:06,555
A few of you, mathematicians, most likely,

56
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:10,315
might have conjured the concept of cardinal numbers.

57
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,196
These same eight letters can mean such different things

58
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:17,773
to different people depending upon our prior knowledge

59
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:19,739
and experiences.

60
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,103
Our comprehension and sense making of the world around us

61
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:27,118
in basic ways is prior knowledge dependent.

62
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:30,706
Now consider this phrase, the notes were sour

63
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:32,623
because the seam split.

64
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,216
Does this sentence make sense to you?

65
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,458
Probably not.

66
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:45,662
What about now?

67
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,569
Again, for most of you the picture and word

68
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:55,428
caused the concept bagpipe to be retrieved from your memory.

69
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:58,836
This then helped you make sense of that sentence.

70
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:01,482
However, if you don&#39;t know what a bagpipe is

71
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:04,429
or what a sour note might be, the sentence

72
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:07,074
still may not make sense.

73
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:10,112
Now let&#39;s look at one more example of how having access

74
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,490
to relevant knowledge influences comprehension

75
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,433
and understanding as well as memory formation and recall.

76
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:20,242
It&#39;s from a classic study done by

77
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:22,742
Bransford and Johnson in 1972.

78
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:27,477
We&#39;re going to show on the screen a short paragraph.

79
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:30,644
Please spend a few moments reading it.

80
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:02,385
Does it make sense to you?

81
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,144
Probably not.

82
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:06,983
Most people find this passage unintelligible

83
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:09,492
or, at the least, confusing.

84
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:14,221
Now look at the sketch that next appears on the screen.

85
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:17,851
This sketch is of a man serenading his girlfriend

86
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,556
as she leans out of the window of her sixth floor apartment.

87
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:23,758
The man used balloons to float the speaker

88
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:28,074
for his microphone up to her so she could hear him sing.

89
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:30,907
Now please read the passage again.

90
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:04,712
Now does it make sense to you?

91
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:05,712
Probably so.

92
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:09,901
Bransford and Johnson found that without seeing the sketch,

93
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:13,398
people remembered very little about the story later.

94
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:15,771
Mainly because they couldn&#39;t comprehend it in a way

95
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,660
that linked to their prior knowledge.

96
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,549
For those people given the sketch ahead of time,

97
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:26,183
it was not only more comprehensible, but when tested later

98
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:29,683
they remembered much more about the story.

99
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:34,541
So what&#39;s the point of these examples?

100
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,575
If our students have appropriate, retrievable,

101
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:42,341
and accurate prior knowledge to link new knowledge to,

102
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:45,579
learning will happen more readily and will stick

103
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:46,996
in enduring ways.

104
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:50,696
This is why figuring out our students prior knowledge

105
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:53,527
is so important to effective teaching.

106
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:56,662
It&#39;s also why choosing readings and problems that can link

107
00:06:56,662 --> 00:07:00,185
in some fashion to our students prior knowledge and skills

108
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,935
is equally important.

109
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:06,394
If readings contain vocabulary or problems require

110
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:09,919
analytical skills not possessed by a learner,

111
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,921
then new learning will be very difficult to happen

112
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,568
for two reasons.

113
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,880
The first is that there will be nothing to link to

114
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,219
and the second is that cognitive load will likely increase

115
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,730
and learning then becomes even more compromised.

116
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,451
Sometimes too the prior knowledge of our students

117
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:30,264
can be misconceived.

118
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:33,312
They may have already existing inaccurate facts,

119
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:37,395
ideas, stereotypes, or faulty models and theories

120
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:39,797
about how the world works that they&#39;ve developed

121
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:42,061
from their own lived lives.

122
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,672
This means their learning and certain context

123
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,789
may be hindered or even prevented depending on

124
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:50,880
the nature of their misconceptions and how robust

125
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,662
those misconceptions are.

126
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:57,180
For examples of these misconceptions in different subjects

127
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,511
and to learn more about them, please see the teaching

128
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,834
strategies section of our MOOC under misconceptions

129
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:07,272
for a variety of suggestions and ideas about how to

130
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:10,173
translate the learning concepts in this section

131
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:13,476
into teaching strategies for your classrooms.

132
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:16,900
Meaningful learning is linking new information and knowledge

133
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,945
to already existing conceptual knowledge and skill

134
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:23,081
routines in our memory.

135
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:26,421
Without relevant and accurate prior knowledge and skills,

136
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:28,977
subsequent learning tends to be hindered

137
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:32,807
because learners might ignore, resist, discount,

138
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:35,619
or even not recognize important new information

139
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:39,648
and evidence that conflicts with existing knowledge.

140
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:42,242
And this can vary from learner to learner

141
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:44,217
in different contexts.

142
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:47,270
Our students often need help accessing their relevant

143
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,139
prior knowledge.

144
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:51,299
Teachers who are aware of their students

145
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,878
existing prior knowledge, whether accurate or not,

146
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:57,671
can design instruction to connect new information

147
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,879
more effectively with what they already know.

148
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,141
No surprise, our students learning environment

149
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:07,320
are accurately sensitive to the individual differences

150
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,006
among the learners in it, especially with regard

151
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:13,499
to their prior knowledge and skills.

152
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,953
Please see our teaching strategy section

153
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:19,305
under prior knowledge to learn about ways to translate

154
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:22,313
the concepts in this section into learning designs

155
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,594
for your classroom.

156
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:27,399
As David Ausubel wrote in one of the first textbooks

157
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,203
written about cognitive science in 1978,

158
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:35,751
the most important single factor influencing learning

159
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:38,835
is what the learner already knows.

160
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:41,788
Ascertain this and teach accordingly.

161
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:44,149
Our next session will focus on how we can help

162
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,900
our students make durable memories in ways they can use

163
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,650
and apply them when needed later.
