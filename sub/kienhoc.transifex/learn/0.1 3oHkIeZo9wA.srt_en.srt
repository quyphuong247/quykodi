00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,284
- Welcome to the Science of Learning,
https://youtu.be/3oHkIeZo9wA
1
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:12,674
what every teacher should know.

2
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:15,967
My name is Pearl Rock Kane and I&#39;m a professor

3
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:18,901
at Columbia University&#39;s Teachers College

4
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,948
where I also direct the Klingenstein Center.

5
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,414
- My name is Kevin Mattingly.

6
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:25,392
I&#39;m an adjunct professor at Teachers College

7
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,327
and a teacher at the Riverdale School in New York City.

8
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,713
- The course was inspired by a White House

9
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:33,949
ConnectEd initiative to provide high quality

10
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:36,362
professional development for teachers.

11
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:39,106
We are pleased to be invited to participate

12
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,292
because we want to share what we have learned

13
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,649
from cognitive science that can be applied directly

14
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:47,062
to improving classroom practice.

15
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:50,295
We want every teacher to know about this research

16
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:53,734
and the implications for improving student learning.

17
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,493
- I&#39;ve been a teacher for 35 years

18
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:56,896
and have taught science to high school

19
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:59,678
and middle school students in public and private schools.

20
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:02,335
I&#39;ve also had the good fortune for the past 12 years

21
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,560
to teach graduate courses in cognitive science

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,483
at Teachers College mainly with teachers as my students.

23
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:10,569
We&#39;re excited to be able to convey in this course

24
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,697
a portion of the cognitive science research

25
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,337
about how children learn

26
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:15,901
and what it means for our teaching

27
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:17,544
and the learning of our students.

28
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,130
- I have spent my career as a teacher.

29
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,856
I taught English and history to children and adolescents

30
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:26,522
in public and private schools.

31
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:28,398
As a professor at Teachers College,

32
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,668
I have taught courses on leadership

33
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:34,453
to almost four thousand educators from the United States

34
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:36,871
and countries throughout the world.

35
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,447
What we have learned from these educators

36
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:43,006
no matter what age their students or where they teach

37
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:45,701
is how deeply they care about their craft

38
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,214
and their students.

39
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:49,879
No matter how many years they have taught,

40
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,823
they continue to reflect on their practice

41
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:55,806
to stand back and analyze their teaching,

42
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:59,653
what went well and how they might improve.

43
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:03,293
They welcome the opportunity to learn and grow.

44
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:07,832
They aim for excellence and while they may be successful,

45
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:10,611
they are never completely satisfied.

46
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,943
It is that sense of striving

47
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:15,380
that contributes to ongoing learning

48
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,234
and that is what we aim to instill in our students.

49
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:23,100
If you would describe yourself as a striving teacher,

50
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,718
this course will be meaningful for you.

51
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:28,337
We certainly respect the expertise

52
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:30,920
and experience you bring to this course.

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,295
- Cognitive science or what we and others call

54
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:36,323
the science of learning is not a new field of study

55
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,202
yet it&#39;s only relatively recently

56
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:40,662
that the teaching applications of this research

57
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,791
have been made more broadly available.

58
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,208
That&#39;s where our course comes into play.

59
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,522
There are four sections to the course.

60
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:49,908
In the first section, you&#39;ll learn about memory,

61
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:53,137
how the brain makes, stores and retrieves memories.

62
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:55,143
Our focus will be on how we help our students

63
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,945
learn in ways that last

64
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:59,968
and can be used later in real world situations.

65
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,833
The second session focuses on mindsets,

66
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,085
how student beliefs about their intelligence

67
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,235
and sense of belonging

68
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:08,972
can powerfully influence their ability to learn

69
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:11,565
and how teachers can change students&#39; self-perceptions

70
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,985
along these lines in positive ways.

71
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,421
Section three is about helping students learn how to learn

72
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:19,754
and ways teachers can help students become leaders

73
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:21,312
of their own leading.

74
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:24,376
In the final section, we&#39;ll focus on teaching strategies.

75
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:27,444
We&#39;ll present simple ways to apply cognitive science

76
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:30,556
to increase learning for all our students.

77
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:34,069
We also selected key readings, research and resources

78
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:35,861
to supplement instruction.

79
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,119
During each section, you will be asked

80
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,218
to complete reflective assignments,

81
00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:43,080
assess your learning and provide feedback to others

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,725
taking this course.

83
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,486
- Each of our four sessions will be moderated by a teacher

84
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:51,640
who uses the cognitive strategies being taught

85
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,483
in their own classroom.

86
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,317
Interviews with these teachers

87
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:59,072
will provide personal anecdotes on what has worked for them

88
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,496
and what they have found challenging.

89
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:04,696
The intention is that you will complete this course

90
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:08,063
with practical ideas for your immediate application

91
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:10,474
to your work and life.

92
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:13,824
For us, this is a very exciting prospect

93
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:17,121
and it&#39;s a real privilege to be able to teach this course

94
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,121
to teachers from all over the world.
