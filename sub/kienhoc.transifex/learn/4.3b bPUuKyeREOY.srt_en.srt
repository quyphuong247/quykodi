00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,100
- One of the most important things for me

1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,446
is really helping my students to become more independent.

2
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,114
I spend a lot of time really teaching them

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,179
that they often can find the answers to their questions

4
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,629
and that they don&#39;t just have to refer back to me.

5
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,266
One thing I&#39;ve gotten in the habit of doing

6
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,656
is being really intentional about making my criteria

7
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:27,268
for success clear for them, so at the end of a lesson

8
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:29,393
or the end of a unit, they know that they&#39;re responsible

9
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:32,330
for having learned and having produced.

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,536
We also spend a lot of time together making tools

11
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,370
that they can use during their work time.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,251
So they have charts that they can refer to,

13
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,213
they have checklists that they can refer to.

14
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:42,129
Sometimes they draw pictures of different ways

15
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:44,369
they can improve their work and then they can refer back

16
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:46,703
to those tools when they&#39;re working independently

17
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:48,700
and it helps them see how the quality

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,534
of their work is progressing.

19
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:52,578
What I really like about this is it helps kids sort of

20
00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:56,177
internalize really strong, high quality work

21
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:58,986
and then also when they reread their work,

22
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:01,552
they become better at noting what they&#39;re doing well

23
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:03,642
and what they still need to do.

24
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:05,395
The great thing about a tool is it also teaches you

25
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:06,579
what you can do next.

26
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:08,658
It gives a lot of tips and it gives a lot of feedback

27
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:11,839
without me having to be the one really helping kids work.

28
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,045
And instead, they become more independent

29
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:16,541
and they take more ownership of their learning.

30
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,549
This also works really well in partnerships.

31
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,021
My students have partners for every subject that we do

32
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:24,633
and they feel a real responsibility

33
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:26,432
for helping their partner improve.

34
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:27,930
Which I think is really lovely.

35
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,008
They also love giving feedback and pretending

36
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:32,621
that they&#39;re the teacher and I think in a big way,

37
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:35,314
it helps them look at their own work more critically,

38
00:01:35,314 --> 00:01:37,148
which we talk about a lot in class.

39
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,576
You don&#39;t wanna look at your work and just say,

40
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,422
this looks good, this looks good, this looks good.

41
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:42,501
You want to really analyze it and make sure

42
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:45,194
that you&#39;re holding it to the highest standards.

43
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:46,994
And I think when you show kids that you have high

44
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:49,652
expectations for them and they can have those same high

45
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:52,799
expectations for themselves, it really motivates them

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,461
and leverages the quality of their work.

47
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,551
In my class, kids are used to getting a lot of feedback.

48
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,548
They get feedback from me when I confer with them,

49
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:02,231
they get feedback from their partners

50
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:03,532
when they look at each other&#39;s work.

51
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:06,225
They also spend time self-assessing and figuring out

52
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:09,499
what they&#39;re doing well and what they need to work on next.

53
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:11,450
The thing is, we also have to make sure that we&#39;re

54
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,992
holding ourselves accountable for taking our feedback

55
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:15,583
and then doing something with it.

56
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,615
So that&#39;s something that I try really hard to build

57
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:19,867
into my everyday classroom culture.

58
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,851
I often spend time checking kids work and they actually

59
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,625
have to show me where they improved their work in a certain

60
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,273
way or where they tried out a tip that I showed them.

61
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,910
They also do this with their partners.

62
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,407
Where they&#39;ll say, &quot;Okay, this is my plan,

63
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:33,207
&quot;This is what I&#39;m going to work on.&quot;

64
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:35,982
And then, at the end of a lesson, they&#39;ll have to go ahead

65
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:39,290
and show them where they did that and how it worked.

66
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,228
And then their partners can give them tips on how effective

67
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,840
it was or maybe what they need to do next.

68
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,965
We also spend a lot of time looking at our work

69
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:49,658
kind of before and after, side by side,

70
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:51,899
and noticing how it&#39;s improved.

71
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:55,208
And I think that helps kids really see the importance

72
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,065
and the effectiveness of taking feedback

73
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:01,988
and applying it to their work.

74
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:03,814
- So every week, we take what we call

75
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:05,359
an understanding check.

76
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,098
We check for understanding of what the kids can and can&#39;t do

77
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:10,804
based on all the material from the previous months

78
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:12,023
of the course.

79
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:14,635
And I find that they can share a lot of their knowledge

80
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:16,260
and they practice that recall of information

81
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,106
while they take the understanding check.

82
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:21,090
But the day after, they&#39;re presented with the understanding

83
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,434
check again and I circle where they made a mistake.

84
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:25,862
I don&#39;t tell them what they did wrong,

85
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:27,534
there&#39;s no points associated with it,

86
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:29,565
minus two or anything like that,

87
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,365
I just circle what they&#39;ve done wrong

88
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:34,058
and then they do a understanding check reflection.

89
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:36,009
Where they first need to explain in words

90
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,180
what they did wrong, then they explain in words

91
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,757
what the right solution is and then

92
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:42,719
they solve it correctly at the bottom.

93
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,344
And it&#39;s really important for them to explain the

94
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,956
what I used to think and what I think now

95
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:49,615
in their own words, maybe with the help of a peer,

96
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:52,587
maybe with the help of a teacher, maybe just by looking back

97
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:55,652
at their notes, before they do the correct answer,

98
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,692
to confront that misconception that they used to have.

99
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:02,467
And I think that students learn more in that reflection

100
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,998
than they do in the rest of the week

101
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:07,413
because they&#39;ve seen what they&#39;ve done wrong

102
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,922
and they&#39;ve made corrections to that.

103
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:11,047
And they&#39;re highly motivated to do that.

104
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:13,578
When they get that test back, they look for the green star

105
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:14,890
because they know that&#39;s the part

106
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,223
that they get to make right.
