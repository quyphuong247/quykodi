1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,179
We’ve been talking a lot about the science
of how things move -- you throw a ball in the air,

2
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:10,000
and there are ways to predict exactly how it will fall.

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:14,629
But there’s something we’ve been leaving
out: forces, and why they make things accelerate.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,560
And for that, we’re going to turn to a physicist
you’ve probably heard of: Isaac Newton.

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,859
With his three laws, published in 1687 in his book
Principia, Newton outlined his understanding of motion

6
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,019
-- and a lot of his ideas were
totally new.

7
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:33,189
Today, more than 300 years later, if you’re
trying to describe the effects of forces on

8
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:38,058
just about any everyday object -- a box on
the ground, a reindeer pulling a sleigh, or

9
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:42,158
an elevator taking you up to your apartment
-- then you’re going to want to use Newton’s Laws.

10
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,339
And yes. I’ll explain the reindeer thing
in a minute.

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:54,060
[Theme Music]

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,679
Newton’s first law is all about inertia,
which is basically an object’s tendency

13
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,199
to keep doing what it’s doing.

14
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:04,719
It’s often stated as: “An object in motion
will remain in motion, and an object at rest

15
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,548
will remain at rest, unless acted upon by
a force.”

16
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,799
Which is just another way of saying that,
to change the way something moves -- to give

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,860
it ACCELERATION -- you need a net force.

18
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,359
So, how do we measure inertia?

19
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,609
Well, the most important thing to know is
mass. Say you have two balls that are the

20
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:22,578
same size, but one is an inflatable beach
ball and the other is a bowling ball.

21
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:26,819
The bowling ball is going to be harder to
move, and harder to stop once it’s moving.

22
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,578
It has more inertia because it has more mass.

23
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,309
Makes sense, right? More mass means more STUFF,
with a tendency to keep doing what it was

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,118
doing before your force came along, and interrupted
it.

25
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,950
And this idea connects nicely to Newton’s
second law: net force is equal to mass x acceleration.

26
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,519
Or, as an equation, F(net) = ma.

27
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,578
It’s important to remember that we’re
talking about NET force here -- the amount

28
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:54,098
of force left over, once you’ve added together
all the forces that might cancel each other out.

29
00:01:54,099 --> 00:02:00,199
Let's say you have a hockey puck sitting on a perfectly
frictionless ice rink. And I know ice isn’t

30
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,358
perfectly frictionless but stick with it.
If you’re pushing the puck along with

31
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:08,318
a stick, that’s a force on it - that
isn’t being canceled out by anything else.

32
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,638
So the puck is experiencing acceleration.

33
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,539
But when the puck is just sitting still, or
even when it’s sliding across the ice after

34
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,180
you’ve pushed it, then all the forces are
balanced out.

35
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,930
That’s what’s known as equilibrium.

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,010
An object that’s in equilibrium can still be MOVING, like the sliding puck, but its VELOCITY won’t be changing.

37
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,120
It’s when the forces get UNbalanced, that
you start to see the exciting stuff happen.

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,080
And probably the most common case of a net
force making something move is the gravitational force.

39
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,908
Say you throw a 5 kg ball straight up in the
air -- and then, yknow, get out of the way,

40
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,400
because that could really hurt if it hits
you...

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,840
But the force of gravity is pulling down on the ball, which is accelerating downward at a rate of 9.81 m/s^2.

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,300
So the net force is equal to m a, but the
only force acting here is gravity.

43
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,439
This means that, if we could measure the acceleration of the ball, we’d be able to calculate the force of gravity.

44
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:01,280
And we CAN measure the acceleration -- it’s
9.81 m/s^2, the value we’ve been calling small g.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,419
So the force of gravity on the ball must be 5 kg,
which is the mass of the ball… times small g

46
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,099
which comes to 49.05 kilograms
times meters per second squared!

47
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,690
We use this equation for gravity so much
that it’s often just written as F(g) = mg.

48
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:20,169
That’s how you determine the force of
gravity, otherwise known as weight.

49
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:23,899
Now, those units can be a bit of a mouthful,
so we just call them Newtons.

50
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,939
That’s right! We measure weight in Newtons,
in honor of Sir Isaac, and NOT kilograms!

51
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,819
Kilograms are a measure of mass!

52
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,330
But gravity often isn’t the only force
acting on the object.

53
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,240
So when we’re trying to calculate a NET force, we usually have to take into account more than just gravity.

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,000
This is where we get into one of the forces that tends to show up a lot, which is explained by Newton’s third law.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,299
You probably know this law as “for every
action, there’s an equal but opposite reaction.”

56
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:55,659
Which just means that if you exert a force
on an object, it exerts an equal force back on you.

57
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,628
And that’s what we call the normal force.

58
00:03:57,628 --> 00:04:02,840
“Normal” in this instance means “perpendicular”,
and the normal force is always perpendicular

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,259
to whatever surface your object is resting
on.

60
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:09,340
At least, it is when you're pushing on something
big, and macroscopic, like a table.

61
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,920
If you put a book down on a table, the normal
force is pushing -- and therefore pointing -- up.

62
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,800
But if you put it on a ramp, then the normal
force is pointing perpendicular to the ramp.

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,939
Now, the normal force isn’t like most other forces.
It’s special, because it changes its magnitude.

64
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:29,319
Say you have a piece of aluminum foil stretched
tightly across the top of a bowl, and then

65
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:31,789
you put one lonely grape on top of it.

66
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,210
Because of gravity, that grape is exerting
a little bit of force on the foil, and the

67
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,029
normal force pushes right back, with the same
amount.

68
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:44,750
But then you add another grape, which doubles the force on the foil -- in that case, the normal force doubles too.

69
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,019
That’ll keep happening until eventually
you add enough grapes that they break through the foil.

70
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,269
That’s what happens when the normal force
can’t match the force pushing against it.

71
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:56,329
But, what does Newton’s famous third law
really mean, though?

72
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,649
When I push on this desk with my finger
right now, I’m applying a force to it.

73
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:06,000
And it’s applying an equal force right back on my finger
-- one that I can actually feel.

74
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,969
But if that’s true -- and it is -- then
why are we able to move things?

75
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,810
How can I pick up this mug?
Or how can a reindeer pull a sleigh?

76
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,079
Basically, things can move because there’s
more going on, than just the action and reaction forces.

77
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:23,719
For example, when a reindeer pulls on a sleigh,
Newton’s third law tells us that the sleigh

78
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,890
is pulling back on it with equal force.

79
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,069
But the reindeer can still move the sleigh
forward, because it’s standing on the ground.

80
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,480
When it takes a step, it’s pushing backward on the ground with its foot -- & the ground is pushing it forward.

81
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,520
Meanwhile, the reindeer is also pulling on
the sleigh, while the sleigh is pulling right back.

82
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,819
But the force from the GROUND PUSHING
the reindeer forward is STRONGER than the

83
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,139
force from the sleigh pulling it back. So
the animal accelerates forward, and so does the sleigh.

84
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,829
So, one takeaway here is that: there would
be no Christmas without physics!

85
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:57,879
But, now that we have an idea of some of the
forces we might encounter, let’s describe

86
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,129
what’s happening when a box is sitting on
the ground.

87
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:03,430
The first thing to do -- which is the first
thing you should ALWAYS do when you’re solving

88
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,889
a problem like this -- is draw what’s known
as a free body diagram.

89
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,909
Basically, you draw a rough outline of the
object, put a dot in the middle, and then

90
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,070
draw and label arrows, to represent all the
forces.

91
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,920
We also have to decide which direction is
positive -- in this case, we’ll choose up to be positive.

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,150
For our box, the free body diagram is pretty
simple. There’s an arrow pointing down,

93
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:28,159
representing the force of gravity, and an
arrow pointing up, representing the force

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,050
of the ground pushing back on the box.

95
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,449
Since the box is staying still, we know that
it’s not accelerating, which tells us that

96
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:37,759
those forces are equal, so the net force is
equal to 0.

97
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,670
But what if you attach a rope to the top of
the box, then connect it to the ceiling so

98
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,230
the box is suspended in the air?

99
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,569
Your net force is still 0, because there’s
no acceleration on the box. And gravity is

100
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:49,939
still pulling down in the same way it was
before.

101
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:55,899
But now, the counteracting upward force comes from the rope acting on the box, in what we call the tension force.

102
00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:01,339
To make our examples simpler, we almost always
assume that ropes have no mass and are completely

103
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:05,359
unbreakable -- no matter how much you pull
on them, they’ll pull right back.

104
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,189
Which means that the tension force isn’t
fixed. If the box weighs 5 Newtons, then the

105
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:15,250
tension in the rope is also 5 Newtons. But
if we add another 5 Newtons of weight, the

106
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,389
tension in the rope will become 10 Newtons.

107
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,800
Kind of like how the normal force changes,
with the grapes on the foil. But in this case,

108
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,670
it's in response to a pulling force instead
of a push.

109
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:29,000
The key is that no matter what, you can add
the forces together to give you a particular

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
net force -- even though that net force might
NOT always be 0. Like, in an elevator.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,449
So let’s say you’re in an elevator -- or
as I call them, a lift.

112
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,879
The total mass of the lift, including you,
is 1000 kg. And its movement is controlled

113
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,990
by a counterweight, attached to a pulley.

114
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:52,090
The plan is to set up a counterweight of 850kg,
and then let the lift go. Once you let go,

115
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,089
the lift is going to start accelerating downward
- because it’s HEAVIER than the counterweight.

116
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:59,779
And the hope is that the counterweight will
keep it from accelerating TOO much.

117
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:04,369
But how will we know if it’s safe? How quickly
is the lift going to accelerate downward?

118
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:10,240
To find out, first let’s draw a free body
diagram for the lift, making UP the positive direction.

119
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,180
The force of gravity on the lift is pulling it down, and it’s equal to the mass of the lift x small g --

120
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,000
9810 Newtons of force, in
the negative direction.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,180
And the force of tension is pulling the lift UP, in the positive direction.

122
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,639
Which means that for the lift, the net force is equal to the tension force, minus the mass of the lift x small g.

123
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,250
Now! Since Newton’s first law tells us that
F(net) = ma, we can set all of that to be

124
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,440
equal to the lift’s mass, times some downward
acceleration, -a. That’s what we’re trying to solve for.

125
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,720
So, let’s do the same thing for the counterweight.

126
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,840
Gravity is pulling it down with 8338.5 N
of force in the negative direction.

127
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,480
And again, the force of tension is pulling
it up, so that the net force is equal to the

128
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,620
tension force, minus the mass of the counterweight
times small g.

129
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,789
And again, because of Newton’s second law,
we know that all of that is equal to the mass

130
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:10,949
of the counterweight, times that same acceleration,
“a” -- which is positive this time since

131
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,860
the counterweight is moving upward.

132
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,820
So! Putting that all together, we end up with
two equations -- and two unknowns.

133
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,840
We don’t have a value for the tension force,
and we don’t have a value for acceleration.

134
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,180
But what we’re trying to solve for is the
acceleration. So we use algebra to do that.

135
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,699
When you have a system of equations like this,
you can add or subtract all the terms on each

136
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,759
side of the equals sign, to turn them into
one equation.

137
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:40,710
For example, if you know that 1 + 2 = 3 and
that 4 + 2 = 6, you can subtract the first

138
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,560
equation from the second to get 3 = 3.

139
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,079
And in our case, with the lift, subtracting
the first equation from the second gets rid

140
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,230
of the term that represents the tension force.

141
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:56,450
We now just have to solve for acceleration -- meaning, we need to rearrange the equation to set everything equal to “a.”

142
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,300
We end up with an equation that really just
says that “a” is equal to the difference

143
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:05,250
between the weights -- or the net force on
the system -- divided by the total mass.

144
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,190
Essentially, this is just a fancier version of F(net) = ma.

145
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,780
And we can solve that for “a”,
which turns out to be 0.795 m/s^2.

146
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,939
Which is not that much acceleration at all!

147
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,840
So, as long as you aren’t dropping too far
down, you should be fine.

148
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,500
Even if the landing is a little bumpy.

149
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,779
In this episode, you learned about Newton’s
three laws of motion: how inertia works, that

150
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:31,769
net force is equal to mass x acceleration,
how physicists define equilibrium, and all

151
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,069
about the “normal” force and the “tension”
force.

152
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,770
Crash Course Physics is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios. You can head over

153
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:45,159
to their channel to check out amazing shows like: BrainCraft, It’s OK To Be Smart, and PBS Idea Channel.

154
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,799
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

155
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,759
with the help of these amazing people and
our Graphics Team is Thought Cafe.
