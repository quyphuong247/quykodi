1
00:00:03,70 --> 00:00:06,90
Sunlight, moonlight, torchlight, and flashlight.

2
00:00:06,90 --> 00:00:10,140
They all come from different places, but they’re
the all very same thing: light!

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,600
It’s what makes it possible for us to see the world around us, so it’s worth a close, hard look.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,480
For instance, how does light travel?

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,40
When you flip that switch in the bathroom to brush your teeth, how does light move from the light bulb, to the mirror, and into your eyes?

6
00:00:22,40 --> 00:00:28,38
And if you’re one of many people who wear glasses, how do those lenses turn a blurry world into a high-definition experience?

7
00:00:28,39 --> 00:00:32,558
Whether it’s glasses, microscopes, or telescopes,
it’s all about bending light to our will.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,220
How do we go about this grand task of controlling
the very thing that helps us see?

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,780
Well, let’s take a look!

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:50,560
[Theme Music]

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,320
No matter where light comes from, we generally talk about it in the same way, and make the same assumptions about how it travels.

12
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,960
Say you’re lying on the beach, basking in
a ray of sunshine.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,680
One of the first assumptions we make is that the light is traveling from the sun to you, in a straight line.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,360
This way of thinking about light is called the ray model, and the core tenant of the model is that light travels in straight-line paths called rays.

15
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,580
But each individual ray is really just a graphical
representation of actual light.

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,780
A light source may be emitting an infinite number of rays, but we only draw a few to get the point across.

17
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,380
Now, let’s say we have a flashlight that’s
emitting rays of light.

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:31,520
If we point the flashlight at a reflective surface, like a calm pool of water, we can trace the rays as lines that leave the flashlight, reflect off the water and continue on as a straight line.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,60
Note that the rays on top of the flashlight
are now on the bottom, and vice versa.

20
00:01:35,60 --> 00:01:39,760
This makes sense, because if you’re viewing something in a reflection, you see its image reversed.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,880
Another important observation is that rays leave the reflected surface at the same angle at which they struck it.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,860
So if I point the flashlight at a 30 degree angle – an angle that we call the angle of incidence – it would leave at a 30 degree angle in the other direction.

23
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,880
So, we’d say that the angle of reflection
is equal to the angle of incidence.

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,259
And the fact that these two angles equal each
other is called the law of reflection.

25
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,100
Now, the way I described the light hitting the
pool of water was oversimplified, wasn’t it?

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,680
Because, in reality, some of the incident light will reflect off the water’s surface, while the rest of it will go into the water.

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,840
And, an interesting phenomenon happens when light rays change from one medium to another, such as going from air into water.

28
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,300
Have you ever looked at a straw sitting in a cup of water and noticed how the submerged part of the straw looks bent?

29
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,420
Of course the straw itself isn’t bent, but the light is,
when it passes between the water and the air.

30
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,359
This phenomenon, of light rays changing direction
at the interface between media, is called refraction.

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,180
When a ray moves from air into water, the ray’s angle after passing into the water will be less than the incident angle.

32
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,40
So, the straw looks bent because the rays coming from the straw into your eyes don't travel in a straight path.

33
00:02:42,40 --> 00:02:45,739
They become bent, so the bottom of the straw
appears to be in a place where it’s not.

34
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:53,420
The angle of a light ray after it passes from one medium to another is called the angle of refraction, and it’s related to the angle of incidence by Snell’s Law.

35
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,160
Snell’s Law says that angles of refraction are determined by the index of refraction for each medium and the angle of incidence.

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,859
The index of refraction for a certain medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum versus the speed in that medium.

37
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,740
And when a ray enters a medium with an increased
index of refraction, the angle of refraction decreases.

38
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,560
In other words, the higher the index of refraction,
the smaller the angle.

39
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,960
And refraction occurs when light leaves a
medium, too.

40
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,500
Say you have a flat piece of glass standing on end, and a light ray enters the glass at an incident angle of theta one.

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,480
The angle of refraction inside the glass would be less than theta one, since the index of refraction of glass is greater.

42
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,260
But once the ray reaches the interface between the glass and the air on the other side, it refracts again,

43
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,640
and now the angle of refraction is equal to
that first incident angle.

44
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,760
So, if you look from the right side of the glass, your eyes see an object that appears to be lower than it actually is.

45
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,260
Now, when you observe an object through refracted light like this, what you’re seeing is an image, a visually reproduced copy of an object.

46
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,000
And not all images are the same.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,900
An image is considered to be a real image if the rays from an object converge at some location, such as your eye or on some other surface, like film.

48
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,720
Real images can be projected onto screens, because the light rays from an object are actually traveling there.

49
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:12,400
But the alternative is a virtual image – an image where the light rays don’t actually converge, so your eyes construct an image as if the diverging rays originated from a single point.

50
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,420
When you look in the mirror, for example, it looks like you’re standing on the other side of the mirror.

51
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,380
But you aren’t.

52
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,520
You’re seeing a virtual image, because the light rays that make up your reflection aren’t actually converging to form an image of you.

53
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,200
Now, what if we take that plate of glass and
re-form both sides so they’re no longer flat?

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,80
How does that change the law of refraction?

55
00:04:30,80 --> 00:04:32,500
It doesn’t!
Refraction still occurs.

56
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,40
It’s just that the normal line, which is the imaginary line that the angles are relative to, changes.

57
00:04:37,40 --> 00:04:43,40
Warped pieces of material that form images of objects are lenses, and they’re the most critical tool in the field of optics.

58
00:04:43,40 --> 00:04:47,440
Say we have a lens that has a spherical face
on both sides, known as a convex lens.

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,580
As light rays enter the lens, they turn slightly towards the axis of the lens, the imaginary line that runs through its center, perpendicular to its face.

60
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:02,380
As they leave the lens and move back through the air, the rays are angled slightly more toward that central axis, due to the lens’s curvature.

61
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:10,920
The rays on the very top and bottom of the lens are bent at a larger angle towards the central axis than the rays near the center, which stay almost parallel.

62
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,340
And they all eventually converge at a single
point called the focal point.

63
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,20
Think of a magnifying glass.

64
00:05:16,20 --> 00:05:21,320
If you hold it just right in the sunlight, you can concentrate the sun’s rays into a single, very hot point.

65
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:28,60
That works because you’ve taken a bunch of incoming parallel rays, and placed your target of choice at the focal length of the magnifying glass.

66
00:05:28,70 --> 00:05:30,930
That’s the distance between the lens and
its focal point.

67
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,40
And one measure of a lens is its power, which is expressed simply as one over the focal length.

68
00:05:36,40 --> 00:05:40,620
But a lens that causes light rays to converge
in this way is known as a converging lens.

69
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,940
And when you look through a converging lens, you can see real images from objects that are beyond the focal point.

70
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,600
This is because light rays from those objects
actually converge after passing through the lens.

71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,80
And remember, when rays converge at a point,
that means a real image has been formed.

72
00:05:55,80 --> 00:06:00,560
Let’s show this using a ray diagram, which tells us about the position and size of images as seen through a lens.

73
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,940
Let’s take a candle that's some distance from
the lens, which we’ll call the object distance.

74
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,480
We will use the object distance and the focal
length of the lens to find the image distance,

75
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,190
the location where the image forms on the
other side of the lens.

76
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:21,90
Lenses have the same focal length on both sides, so we’ll label the focal point on the side opposite of the object as F and the point on the same side as the object as F prime.

77
00:06:21,90 --> 00:06:26,20
Now, we know that the ray traveling parallel to the axis will pass through the focal point on the other side,

78
00:06:26,20 --> 00:06:32,120
so let’s draw a ray from the top of the candle, refracting through the lens, and then passing straight through the focal point F.

79
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,380
Since the focal length is the same on both sides, we draw a second ray from the top of the candle, through the F prime focal point,

80
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,380
which then refracts through the lens and travels
parallel to the axis.

81
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,520
The third ray travels straight through the
center of the lens.

82
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:52,440
We draw this line because if we assume a thin lens, then we can draw a straight line through the center and disregard the slight offset that would occur due to refraction.

83
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,540
With these three rays in place, we see that they intersect at a single point, representing the top of the candle in the newly formed image.

84
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,880
You might notice that the image is upside down, which will always be the case for convex lenses.

85
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,20
And the image is formed by light rays that actually originated from the object, so a real image is formed.

86
00:07:09,20 --> 00:07:16,380
The distance between the image and the lens is the image distance and is related to the object distance and the focal length by a very important equation.

87
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,880
This is the thin lens equation, which is derived
from ray diagram geometry.

88
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,830
For a single converging lens, the focal length
and the object distance will always be positive.

89
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,810
The image distance will be positive if the image
is on the opposite side of the light source.

90
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,550
This equation holds true for converging lenses
as well as their opposite, diverging lenses.

91
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:40,660
Diverging lenses have a concave shape and do the opposite of a converging lens, causing rays of light to diverge away from the lens’s axis.

92
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:51,380
When we’re looking at an object through a diverging lens, our eyes imagine that the diverging rays originate from a location where the rays don’t actually begin, so the lens generates a virtual image.

93
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,540
And when we construct a ray diagram for a
diverging lens, there are a few key differences.

94
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,940
First of all, the focal point F is on the same side as the object and F prime is on the opposite side.

95
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:11,40
While a single ray of light still goes through the very center of the lens, the other two rays take slightly different paths, resulting in a virtual image forming on the same side as the object itself.

96
00:08:11,40 --> 00:08:16,420
For a diverging lens, the thin lens equation is still
true, but the focal length is now a negative value.

97
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,80
Another important equation that’s true for both converging and diverging lenses is the magnification equation.

98
00:08:22,80 --> 00:08:26,260
Magnification is the ratio of the image height
to the height of the actual object.

99
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,99
When the image is upside down, like in our converging lens, then the height is a negative value.

100
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,860
And the ratio of the image distance to the
object distance is also negative.

101
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:46,760
But all of these ideas, taken whole, give you a good understanding of optics – the fundamental rules that explain how we can observe particles too small to see with our eyes, as well as objects that are millions of light-years away.

102
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,319
Today we learned about the the ray model of
light and the laws of reflection and refraction.

103
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,760
We learned about how refraction works with
converging and diverging lenses.

104
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,500
Finally, we built ray diagrams to discover how objects are viewed through different kinds of lenses at different points.
