00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:07,400
Last time, we talked about how charged particles exert electrostatic forces on one another.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:15,640
We calculated these forces using the charge of each particle: which can be either positive or negative, and the distance between them, and we did it with the help of Coulomb's Law:

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,039
the equation that tells us the force generated by two charged particles on one another.

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,619
But what if we want to talk about more that two charges, or if we're dealing with charged objects of various shapes and sizes?

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,780
Coulomb's Law is great for finding the force between small objects, like particles but in physics, we deal with all sorts of shapes and sizes.

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:39,120
Electric forces are used to bring power to your home, charge your computer, and light up the screen that you're using to watch this video.

7
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,599
These everyday electric phenomena require physical components that manipulate charged particles in amazing ways.

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,460
We make electrical components that excite millions of electrons in each pixel on this screen.

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,340
But how to we design then to transmit just the right amount of electric force?

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:02,420
We've got some equations and concepts under our belt already, but we'll need a few more to understand how to control charged particles and expand the possibilities of electricity.

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:14,540
[Theme Music]

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,600
So we want to describe complex situations involving charged particles using more than just Coulomb's Law.

13
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,659
If we have an object with a knows amount of net charge, can we predict how other electric charges will react when they pass nearby?

14
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,379
Well, British scientist Michael Faraday came up with a way to do just that.

15
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:38,599
He hypothesized that every charged object generates an electric field that permeates space and exerts a force on all charged particles it encounters.

16
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,899
And he was right: an electric field is a measurable effect generated by any charged object.

17
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,560
A field carries energy and passes it on to other charged materials by exerting electric forces.

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,980
And we can get to know how electric fields work in a couple of different ways.

19
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,540
First there's good old math.

20
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,980
Let's consider a positive point charge which we'll call capital Q.

21
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:04,520
To study the effect that big Q has on other charges, we'll bring in a small positive test charge, small q, and measure the force that's acting on it.

22
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:14,419
Now, when we express it as an equation, the electric field created by a charged object is the electric force between the objects and the test charge divided by the magnitude of that test charge.

23
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,799
To find F, you just have to use Coulomb's Law.

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,240
And you only need to know the value for big Q, the point charge.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,700
In fact, you can plug the equation for Coulomb's Law into this equation, in place of capital F.

26
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:30,839
And if you do, you'll see that the magnitude of the test charge cancels out and we're left with an expression that relies solely on big Q.

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,960
Now we've got an equation to calculate the electric field generated by any point charge.

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,520
But let's make this field even easier to picture.

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,480
Another way of understanding what's going on between these charges is to diagram it with vectors using what we've learned about Coulomb's Law and force vectors.

30
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:51,619
Again, let's start with our positive point charge, capital Q located at Point A and our small positive test charge, small q.

31
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:58,759
While both big Q and small q generate electric fields, we're going to assume that big Q has a much larger magnitude than small q.

32
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:04,079
Now let's plot a series of vectors that result from placing small q at various points around big Q.

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,060
These vectors are called electric field lines and their purpose is to show the magnitude and direction of the force exerted on any nearby positive test charge.

34
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:19,099
The density of these field lines signifies the magnitude of the electric force on small q and the closer small q is to big Q, the greater the force.

35
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:24,819
And the same logic applies to how we represent negative charges although we do implement it in a slightly different way.

36
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:35,759
The electric field line diagram for a fixed Q that's negatively charged would look like that of a positive Q, but with arrows pointing inward to signify that positive test charges would be attracted to Q.

37
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,340
Now let's see what an electric field looks like for a more complicated situation.

38
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:47,200
Say we have one positively charged particle and one negatively charged particle that are some distance apart with an equal and opposite magnitude of charge.

39
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,379
This pair of particle is known as an electric dipole.

40
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:57,400
Since we have two particles that each generate their own electric field, we can add the fields together to create a total electric field.

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,640
This is the principle known as superposition.

42
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:07,139
Now let's examine the electric field created by this electric dipole because along the way, that's going to show us four important properties of electric field lines.

43
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,599
First: the field lines must be tangent to the direction of the field at any point.

44
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,199
This means if we place a positive test charge anywhere the field lines will point in the direction of the force exerted on a positive test charge.

45
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,259
This also means that a negative test charge would feel a force in the exact opposite direction.

46
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,079
Next: the greater the line density, the greater the magnitude of the field.

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,840
As a test charge moves closer to one of the fixed charges, the forces on it will be larger, thus the greater number of lines in that area.

48
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,899
All of this together means that the number of lines leaving a charged object is proportional to the magnitude of its charge.

49
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:46,039
If the magnitude of the positive charge in our electric dipole is doubled, then twice as many lines leave the positive point charge.

50
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,840
The third property of electric field lines is that the lines always start from positively charged objects and end on negatively charged objects.

51
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:57,560
And if there are no negatively charged objects around, then the lines just keep going on forever

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,660
into infinity, seeking out negatively charged objects wherever they can find them.

53
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,460
So in our electric dipole the lines start at the positively charged particle and move toward the negatively charged one.

54
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:12,620
And the same number of lines come out of each particle because the magnitude of their charges is equal and opposite.

55
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,060
Finally, the fourth property of electric field lines:
the lines must never cross.

56
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,780
Criss-crossing lines means the field acts in different directions for charges in the same location which is impossible.

57
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:27,159
Now that we know these properties, we can create field lines for any set of charged objects.

58
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,580
So lets look at a scenario with one negatively charged particle with charge -Q and a positively charges particle with charge +2Q.

59
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:43,639
If a positive test charge were placed directly between the particles the force exerted on it would be in the same direction that the electric field points toward the negative particle.

60
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,740
If we zoom out: looking at this pair of particles from far away, you can see that it looks like the field lines for a single positive point charge.

61
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,139
Keep in mind, groups of charged particles can look totally different when viewed from far away.

62
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:02,620
All right, you're probably wondering why we're still talking about particles when I spent all that time earlier talking about configurations of things that we see in real life.

63
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,939
Now that we know how to build electric field lines based on a set up of charged objects let's try to do the reverse and set up charged objects to achieve a certain purpose.

64
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:17,180
Let's say we want to create an electric field where all positive test charges move uniformly in a single direction.

65
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,540
We can model this as a field created by two infinitely large conductive plates one positive, and one negative.

66
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,879
All positive test charges between the plates would move from the positive plate to the negative plate.

67
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,740
So we construct the electric field as a series of lines moving from the positive plate to the negative one.

68
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:42,660
This pair of plates is known as a capactior and is an integral part of almost every electronic system partly because it can use its electronic field to store an electric charge.

69
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,380
But so far we've only talked about electrical fields between charged objects like particles and plates.

70
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:52,879
So can an electric field exist in a conductor, where electrons can move around freely in the material?

71
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,939
To figure this out, let's imagine we have a conductive sphere with a net negative charge meaning it has too many free electrons.

72
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,939
These extra free electrons want to move as far away from one another as possible.

73
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,379
This means they redistribute themselves on the surface of the sphere.

74
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:09,839
When they do, they've reached electrostatic equilibrium.

75
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,539
In this state, the excess charges have moved as far as possible to reduce their forces on one another.

76
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:21,200
Once these free charges are at equilibrium, their acceleration is zero, which means that there are no longer any net forces acting on them.

77
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,759
And since the electric field represents electric forces acting on nearby charges, when the net forces are zero, the electric field must also be zero.

78
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,539
So what do these observations tell us?

79
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:37,020
Well for one thing, it shows that the electric field inside conductors is always zero when the system is in electrostatic equilibrium.

80
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,079
And it also shows that the net charge is distributed on the surface.

81
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,879
These conditions hold true for all conducive materials.

82
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,560
While the electric field inside the material is zero,

83
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,480
an electric field exists outside the surface of the conductor.

84
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,819
Let's look again at the capacitor and see what I mean.

85
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,839
You can see that all excess charge is on the surface of the plates.

86
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,139
And while no electric field exists inside the plates themselves, a field is generated between the two.

87
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:05,060
Now, what if we take a neutral conductive sphere, hollow out the inside, and stick a positively charged particle in the center?

88
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:12,480
The positive charge inside the sphere attracts the negative charges inside the shell while it's pushing the positive charges to the surface of the sphere.

89
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,500
Once the system is at electrostatic equilibrium, the observations we made before still hold true.

90
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,019
The charges stop moving, so no electric field exists inside the shell.

91
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:29,120
Now the inside of the shell has a net negative charge due to the attraction of the central positive particle leaving the outer shell with a net positive charge.

92
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,399
So an electric field is generated from the outside of the shell, because of the net positive charge.

93
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:40,199
And while no field exists inside the shell, there is an electric field between that particle in the center and the inside surface.

94
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,700
Any positive test charges in the region would follow the field lines and be pushed toward the negative interior of the shell.

95
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:54,680
So we've managed to use our knowledge of electric charges and Coulomb's Law to figure out a way to describe the effect of any charged object on the entire universe surrounding it.

96
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:01,620
Later we'll learn about how electric forces and fields are just half of the story in our pursuit of understanding the larger concept of electromagnetism.

97
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,700
Today we learned how all objects with net charge generate electric fields that affect all other charged materials.

98
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:13,460
We learned how to construct electric field lines and how to calculate the magnitude and direction of the electric field for a charged particle.

99
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,639
Finally, we learned how electric fields interact in capacitors and conductors.
