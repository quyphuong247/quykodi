00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,259
This little toy is called a Drinking Bird.

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:09,339
You put a cup of water in front of it, and
its head dunks into the cup.

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:13,329
Eventually, the head bobs up again – but
then it goes right back into the water.

4
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:21,731
If you don’t know much about thermodynamics, the Drinking Bird might seem like it could go on forever, without an external source of energy powering it – a perpetual motion machine, in other words.

5
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:26,959
But the toy isn't a perpetual motion machine – because perpetual motion is impossible, according to the laws of physics.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,900
One of the reasons is the first law of thermodynamics.

7
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:42,399
[Theme Music]

8
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,000
One of the main goals of thermodynamics is
to describe the transfer of energy.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,219
We’ve already described two processes as a transfer of energy – work and heat – and they’re both connected to each other.

10
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,140
As a thermodynamic system does work, it loses
heat.

11
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,739
When work is done on a system, it gains heat.

12
00:00:56,738 --> 00:00:59,919
So heat is converted to work, and work is
converted to heat.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,379
Together, the work and heat transferred into or out of the system represent the change in its internal energy,

14
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,839
which – as you might recall – is the total kinetic and potential energy of all the molecules in the system.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,520
This idea – that the change in internal energy is equal to the change in work plus the change in heat – is so fundamental that it’s known as the first law of thermodynamics.

16
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,019
So we can have an equation to use for analyzing
problems, we write the first law like this:

17
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:28,439
The internal energy, U, of a closed system,
is equal to Q, the heat transfer to the system,

18
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,439
minus W, the work done on or by the system.

19
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,939
It’s important to remember that when we talk about changes in internal energy, if heat is transferred into the system, Q is positive,

20
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,060
and if heat is transferred out of the system,
Q is negative.

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,109
And, if work is done on the system, W is negative.

22
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:47,030
And if work is done by the system, W is positive.

23
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,879
Some textbooks will change those signs around, so it’s worth keeping track of what the positives and negatives mean.

24
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,579
Now, you’ll notice that the first law of
thermodynamics describes only those two factors

25
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,939
– work and heat – as affecting a change
in internal energy.

26
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,250
That’s because as long as the system is
closed – meaning, it’s isolated from the

27
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,530
rest of the universe – there just aren’t
any other factors involved.

28
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,240
The amount of heat lost by the system is exactly equal to the amount of work done by the system, and vice versa.

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,120
So, really, the first law of thermodynamics is just another way to describe the conservation of energy,

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,599
which keeps coming up in our lessons
because it’s such a key principle of physics.

31
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,299
There’s always some kind of heat loss, like
through friction.

32
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,840
Even that tiny amount means that the motion
can’t continue forever.

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,020
It will eventually run out of the energy it
needs to drive the work it’s doing.

34
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:35,960
That’s part of why the Drinking Bird isn’t a perpetual motion machine – it relies on the energy it gets from the cup of water to power its movement.

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:43,460
The bird is filled with a fluid that has a low boiling point, so it can easily change from a gas to a liquid and back, with just a slight change in temperature.

36
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:46,449
There's some liquid at the bottom, and some
vapor at the top.

37
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,280
When the bird’s head dips into the cup,
it gets wet.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:58,139
It keeps bobbing back and forth for a while, and as the water evaporates, it cools the vapor in the bird's head, which condenses into liquid, creating a partial vacuum in the head.

39
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,199
That makes liquid travel up the tube.

40
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,670
The head gets heavier and dips back into the
water.

41
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:12,149
But the tipping makes a bubble rise through the liquid into the bird's head, sending more liquid into the bottom, and setting the little bird swinging, and starting the cycle all over again.

42
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,390
But it still needs the water for it to do its thing: Once the water in the cup runs out, the bird stops moving.

43
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:21,779
Now, there are four basic types of processes
where the thermodynamic properties of a system

44
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,520
– generally an ideal gas in some kind of container –
can change according to the first law.

45
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,659
In each case, one property is held constant – volume, pressure, temperature, or heat – while the other properties change.

46
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:37,400
Variations on all these properties are used
in all kinds of machines, especially engines.

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:45,099
First there are iso-volumetric processes, where the volume is held constant – usually because the gas is in a rigid container – while heat is added or removed.

48
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,658
As you add heat, the pressure of the gas will
increase, and so will its temperature.

49
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:51,758
As you remove heat, the pressure and temperature
will decrease.

50
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,340
Isovolumetric processes are kind of boring,
as thermodynamic processes go.

51
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,479
The gas is stuck inside its container, and no matter how much heat you add, the gas doesn’t do any work.

52
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,659
You’re just increasing its internal energy.

53
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,340
But isobaric processes, where the pressure is held constant while heat is added or removed, are a little more interesting.

54
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,920
Here, the volume of the container is allowed to change, usually because the gas can move a piston.

55
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,519
As you add heat, the volume and temperature of the system increase, and as you remove heat, the volume and temperature decrease.

56
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,339
Which means that an isobaric process can do work.
Here’s why:

57
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:29,299
In earlier episodes, we’ve said that work is equal to force x distance – in this case, the distance the piston moves.

58
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,199
We’ve also said that pressure is equal to force/area, which means that force is equal to pressure x area.

59
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,259
Here, it’s the pressure of the gas x the
area of the piston.

60
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:43,060
So work is equal to the gas’s pressure x
the piston’s area x the distance it moves.

61
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,040
And one more step: the area of the piston x the distance it moves, will be equal to the change in the volume of the container.

62
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,900
So the work done during an isobaric process is equal to the pressure of the gas x the change in volume.

63
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:58,819
If heat is added, the volume goes up and the
piston moves outward, so the system does work.

64
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:03,599
If you push the piston inward, you’re doing
work on the system, so its volume – goes down.

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
The third type of thermodynamic processes
are isothermal.

66
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,400
That’s where temperature is held constant,

67
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,899
usually by connecting the system to a much bigger system whose temperature would take a lot of heat to change, known as a heat reservoir.

68
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:18,990
The heat or volume of the system is then changed
very slowly, so that the other properties

69
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,210
can adjust while the temperature essentially
stays constant.

70
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:29,099
An isothermal process is kind of like an isobaric process, in that if you add heat, the volume will expand, so the system will do work.

71
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,980
But for isothermal processes, you can’t use that simple W = P delta V equation, because the pressure does change.

72
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,720
Instead, you need to take the integral of the pressure with respect to volume.

73
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,880
This way, you’re still calculating work, but you’re taking the changes in pressure into account too.

74
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:53,000
Another difference between isobaric and isothermal processes is that, since temperature is held constant in isothermal processes, the internal energy of the ideal gas can’t change.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,360
And the first law of thermodynamics says that heat minus work is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system – in this case, zero.

76
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,540
So, the work done by the system will be equal to the amount of heat added, and vice versa.

77
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,879
Finally, there are adiabatic processes, where no heat is allowed to flow in or out of the system, but the gas can expand or be compressed.

78
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,420
Again, the equation for the first law of thermodynamics helps us out here.

79
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,360
Q is zero, because the heat of the system isn’t changing.

80
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,480
But the internal energy of the gas can change, so the system can do work, or have work done on it.

81
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,860
In fact, the change in the internal energy of the gas will be exactly equal to the negative of the work.

82
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,879
But this is all just the first law of thermodynamics.

83
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,600
There’s also the second law, which says that heat will spontaneously flow from something hotter to something colder,

84
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,439
but it won't flow from something colder to something hotter.

85
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,519
And that’s because of this thing called entropy.

86
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,579
Entropy is often described as the inherent disorder of a system – the more disordered the system, the higher its entropy.

87
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:54,639
So a gas, for example, with all its molecules randomly bouncing around, has a higher entropy than a solid, with its molecules neatly arranged.

88
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,000
And a more general way to state the second law of thermodynamics is that in real life, entropy can only increase, overall.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,079
That doesn’t mean entropy can never decrease in certain situations.

90
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,000
Like, gases do sometimes turn into liquids or solids, obviously.

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,420
You’ve seen water vapor condense and liquid water freeze.

92
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:21,680
But if the entropy in a system decreases, that means the entropy of the environment around the system must increase enough to compensate, and then some, so that there’s an overall increase in the entropy of the universe.

93
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,220
Say you put water in your freezer to make ice, for example.

94
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,800
The entropy of the water goes down as it freezes.

95
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,120
But meanwhile, your freezer is putting out heat as it works to keep itself cold inside.

96
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,819
And the heat from your freezer is increasing the entropy of your kitchen, more than the entropy of the ice is decreasing.

97
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,560
So overall, there's an increase in the entropy of the universe.

98
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,819
Remember that! Every time you're making ice, you’re increasing the disorder of the universe!

99
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:47,139
Now, entropy’s tendency to increase has to do with probability.

100
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,759
To see what I mean, picture a shattered ceramic mug.

101
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,500
There are molecules that make up that mug.

102
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,779
And there are lots and lots of ways that those molecules can be arranged in space, and all of them are equally likely.

103
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:03,339
But only in a few of those arrangements can the molecules make up a whole, solid, unshattered cup – the state where they have a lower entropy.

104
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:10,000
Still, there are lots of possible arrangements of those molecules where they could make up a shattered cup – a set of pieces, with a higher entropy.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,180
The cup can be shattered into pieces, 300 pieces, with the pieces far apart or very close together.

106
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,439
And every way the cup can shatter is another possible way for the molecules inside the pieces to be arranged.

107
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,680
But when there are so many ways for the cup to be broken, and so few ways for it to be whole,

108
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,879
it becomes very, very unlikely that the pieces will spontaneously put themselves back together if you drop them.

109
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,779
Basically, it’ll never happen.

110
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,919
On the other hand, it’s very likely that a cup that’s whole will break when you drop it.

111
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,599
So the process that leads to an increase in entropy has a much higher probability of happening.

112
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,899
And in thermodynamics, entropy is related to heat flow, because when heat flows between systems, their entropy increases.

113
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,559
Before, when their molecules were different temperatures, that was an orderly arrangement.

114
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,359
But when their temperatures become equal, that neat organization is gone, so the systems have a higher entropy.

115
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,419
So: heat spontaneously flows from warmer systems to cooler ones, because that leads to an increase in entropy.

116
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:05,279
Which is also why this little bird keeps bopping up and down!

117
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,919
When the heat flows out of it, the gas condenses and it dunks into the water.

118
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:15,059
The bird may not be a perpetual motion machine, but it's a great way to see the first and second laws of thermodynamics in action.

119
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:22,079
Today, you learned about the first law of thermodynamics, and how it applies to isovolumetric, isobaric, isothermal, and adiabatic processes.

120
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
We also talked about the second law of thermodynamics and entropy.
