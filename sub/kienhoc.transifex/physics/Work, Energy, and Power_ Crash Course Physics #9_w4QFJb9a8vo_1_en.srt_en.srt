1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,140
When I say “work,” what’s the first
thing that comes to mind?

2
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:10,748
Maybe a cubicle? Or a briefcase?
Or that history exam that’s coming up soon?

3
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:15,260
But if you’re a physicist, work has a very specific meaning -- one that has very little to do

4
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,550
with spreadsheets or the fall of the Roman
Empire.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,028
Today, we’re going to explore that definition
-- and how it connects to one of the most

6
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,570
important principles in physics: conservation
of energy.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,230
We’ll also learn what physicists mean when
they talk about another concept that comes

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,670
up a lot in daily life: power.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,490
So let’s get to…work.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:42,990
[Theme Music]

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,629
So far in this course, we’ve spent most of our time talking about forces, and the way they make things move.

12
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:50,628
And you need to understand forces before you
can understand work.

13
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:54,428
Because work is what happens when you apply
a force over a certain distance, to a system --

14
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:59,189
a system just being whatever section of the universe you h appen to be talking about at the time.

15
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,420
For example, if you’re using a rope to drag
a box across the floor, we might say that

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,859
the box is your system, and the force you’re
using to pull on it is an external force.

17
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,840
So, let’s say you’re pulling on this box-system by dragging it straight behind you, so the rope is parallel to the ground.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,320
If you use the rope to pull the box for one
meter, we’d say that you’re doing work on the box.

19
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:22,109
And the amount of work you’re doing is equal
to the force you’re using to pull the box,

20
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:23,790
times the distance you moved it.

21
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,540
For example, if you pulled the rope -- and
therefore the box -- with a force of 50 Newtons,

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,460
while you moved it 5 meters, then we’d say
that you did 250 Newton-meters of work on the box.

23
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,719
More commonly, however, work is expressed
in units known as Joules.

24
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,539
Now, sometimes, the force you apply to an
object won’t be in exactly the same direction

25
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,640
as the direction in which the object is moving.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,040
Like, if you tried to drag the box with your hand higher than the box, so that the rope was at an angle to the floor.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,000
In that case, the box would move parallel to the floor, but the force would be at an angle to it.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,359
And in such an instance, you’d have to use one the tricks we learned back when we first talked about vectors.

29
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,819
Specifically, you must separate the force you’re using on the rope into its component parts:

30
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,219
one that’s parallel to the floor,
and one that’s perpendicular to it.

31
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:11,280
To find the part of the force that’s parallel to the floor -- that is, the one that’s actually pulling the box forward --

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,140
you just have to multiply the magnitude of the force by the cosine of the rope’s angle to the ground.

33
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,669
You’ll remember that we typically designate
an angle in a system as theta.

34
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:23,839
So, to calculate the work you did on the box,
you just multiply the horizontal component

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,580
-- or F times the cosine of theta -- by the
distance you moved the box.

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,540
That’s one way physicists often write the
equation for work -- they’ll set it equal

37
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:34,429
to force, times distance, times the cosine
of theta.

38
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:40,040
And that equation will fit any scenario that involves a constant force being applied over a certain distance.

39
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,019
But what if the force isn’t constant?

40
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,380
What if, say, you started out pulling hard
on the box, but then you started to get tired,

41
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:51,229
so the amount of force you exerted on the
box got smaller and smaller the farther you dragged it.

42
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:55,369
To calculate the work you did in that case,
you’d have to count up the amount of force

43
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,219
you applied over each tiny little bit of distance.

44
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,180
And if you’ve watched our episodes on calculus,
then you know that there’s a faster way

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,140
to add together infinitely tiny increments:
integration.

46
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:10,339
So, to find the work done by a varying force,
you just have to integrate that force relative

47
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,500
to the distance the object moved. Which would
look like this.

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,919
But force-times-distance is only one of the
ways that physicists measure work.

49
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,979
Because, you know how we just said that Joules are
the units of work?

50
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,450
Well, Joules are often used as the units for
something else: energy.

51
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:27,949
And work uses the same units as energy,
because work is just a change in energy.

52
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:33,199
It's what happens when an external force is applied
to a system and changes the energy of that system.

53
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,819
In fact, that’s one of the ways to define
energy -- it’s the ability to do work.

54
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,199
There are all different kinds of energy, but in this episode, we’ll mainly be talking about two of them:

55
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,000
kinetic energy and potential energy.
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,969
When the box was resting on the ground, we’d
say that it had no kinetic energy.

57
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:54,020
But once you applied a force and it started
moving, it did have kinetic energy.

58
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,599
And the energy of the box changed, which means
that you did work on it.

59
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,060
More specifically, the kinetic energy of an object is equal to half of its mass, times its velocity squared.

60
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,459
If this looks familiar, that’s because it
comes from applying both Newton’s second

61
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,569
law and the kinematic equations to the idea
that work is equal to force times distance.

62
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:16,019
So, if the box had a mass of 20 kilograms,
and at some point while you were dragging

63
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,689
it, it reached a velocity of 4 meters per
second, we’d say that its kinetic energy

64
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:23,069
at that moment was 160 Joules.

65
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:27,430
Then there’s potential energy, which actually
isn’t what it sounds like.

66
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,209
Potential energy isn’t potentially energy
-- it’s potentially work.

67
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:36,180
In other words, potential energy is energy
that could be used to do work.

68
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,680
One common type of potential energy is gravitational
potential energy -

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,879
- basically, the potential energy that comes
from the fact that gravity exists.

70
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,300
If I hold this book a meter above the ground,
we’d say that it has gravitational potential energy.

71
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,699
Because if you let it go, then gravity is
going to do work on the book.

72
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,800
Gravity exerted a force that moves it to the ground.

73
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,180
Once the book hits the ground, though, we’d
say that its gravitational potential energy

74
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,139
is zero, because gravity can’t do work on
it anymore.

75
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,899
Calculating gravitational potential energy
is easy enough:

76
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:11,879
it’s just the force of gravity on the object
-- so, the object’s mass times small g --

77
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,600
multiplied by the object’s height.
Or mgh for short.

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,879
Which means that, just by knowing that this
book’s mass is about a kilogram, and that

79
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,550
it’s a meter above the ground, we can calculate
its potential energy: which is 9.8 Joules.

80
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,860
Another type of potential energy that shows
up a lot is spring potential energy.

81
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,259
Despite its name, this is not a seasonal thing --
and yes, I really made that joke.

82
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:37,000
Rather, it’s the type of potential energy that’s
specific to springs!

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,579
The force of a spring is equal to the distance
by which it’s either compressed or stretched,

84
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,418
times a constant that we write as k.

85
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,600
This equation is known as Hooke’s law, after British physicist Robert Hooke, who came up with it in 1660.

86
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,199
Now, the constant, k -- also called the spring
constant -- is different for each spring,

87
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,259
and it’s a measure of the spring’s stiffness.

88
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,759
And the equation makes total sense, if you
think about it:

89
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,560
The further you push on the spring, and the
stiffer it is, the harder it will resist.

90
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,439
You even can test this out for yourself by taking apart a clicky pen and playing with the spring inside.

91
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,360
By combining Hooke’s law, with the idea
that work equals force times distance,

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,540
we can find the potential energy from a spring:

93
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,720
it’s half times k times the distance squared.

94
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,900
For example: if you have a spring with a spring
constant of 200 Newtons per meter, and a block

95
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:26,359
is compressing it by half a meter, then the
potential energy of the block would be 25 Joules.

96
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,439
So, when something does work on a system,
its energy changes.

97
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,389
But how that energy changes depends on the
system.

98
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,750
Some systems can lose energy. These are known
as a non-conservative systems.

99
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,649
Now, that doesn’t mean that the energy that’s
lost is literally disappearing from the universe...

100
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,000
And it doesn’t have anything to do with
the system’s personal politics, either.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,779
It just relates to one of the most
fundamental principles of science:

102
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,478
that energy can neither be created or destroyed.

103
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,178
But systems can lose energy, like when friction
from the box dragging on the floor generates heat.

104
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,019
For non-conservative systems, you can still talk about their kinetic energy or potential energy at any given moment.

105
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,120
But conservative systems let you do much more
than that.

106
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,579
A conservative system is one that doesn’t
lose energy through work.

107
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:07,359
Say, a simple pendulum.

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,860
When the pendulum is at the top of its swing,
it stops moving for a brief moment as it changes direction --

109
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,699
meaning that its kinetic energy, at that point, is zero.

110
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,209
But it has lots of potential energy, because
the gravitational force can do work on the

111
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:23,948
pendulum, pulling it down until it reaches
the bottom of its swing.

112
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,528
At the bottom of the swing, that potential
energy becomes zero,

113
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:29,139
because gravity can’t pull the pendulum down anymore.

114
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:33,120
But now the pendulum has lots of kinetic energy,
because it’s moving through the swing.

115
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,459
And it turns out that, at any given point
in the pendulum’s motion, its kinetic energy

116
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:40,448
and its potential energy will add up to the
same number.

117
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:46,369
If its potential energy increases? Its kinetic energy will decrease by the exact same amount, and vice versa.

118
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,180
So, now that we know how to define work, we
can use that definition to help explain another

119
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,379
common term that physicists have a very specific meaning for: power.

120
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,759
Or, more specifically, average power.

121
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,420
Average power is defined as work over
time, and it’s measured in Watts,

122
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,080
which is just another way of saying Joules per second.

123
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,579
Basically, it’s used to measure how much energy is converted from one type to another over time.

124
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,399
So, remember that box you were pulling?

125
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,379
We figured out that you did 250 Joules of
work on the box when you moved it 5 meters.

126
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,288
If it took you 2 seconds to move the box,
then your average power output was 125 Watts.

127
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:21,899
You’re basically a lightbulb!

128
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:26,188
Now, we can also describe power in another
way, by putting two different facts together:

129
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,169
One, that work is equal to force times distance.

130
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:32,759
And two, that average velocity is equal to
distance over time

131
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,319
Knowing this, we can say that power is the net force applied to something with a particular average velocity.

132
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:43,859
If you moved the box 5 meters in 2 seconds,
then its average velocity was 2.5 meters per second.

133
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,139
And we already said that you were pulling
the box along with a force of 50 Newtons.

134
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,299
So, the force you were using to pull the box,
times the box’s average velocity, would

135
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:54,928
also give you an average power output of 125
Watts.

136
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:59,279
The two equations for average power are
really describing the same relationship;

137
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,339
they’re just using different qualities to do it.

138
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,440
We’re going to be talking about power a
lot when we discuss electricity in later episodes.

139
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,779
It’s the best way to calculate how
energy moves around in a circuit.

140
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:12,099
But that’s a story for another day. For
now, our work is done.

141
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,340
Today, you learned the two equations we can use to describe work, and that energy is the ability to do work.

142
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,110
We also talked about kinetic and potential
energy,

143
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,659
and how they play into non-conservative and
conservative systems.

144
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:26,409
Finally, we found two different equations
for power.
