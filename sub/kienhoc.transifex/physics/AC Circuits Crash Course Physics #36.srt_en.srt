1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:10,980
We couldn’t keep the lights on without alternating
currents.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:19,320
We’ve talked about how they change voltage, which helps transmit electricity over long distances, but there’s so much more to the physics of AC circuitry.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,420
For example, how are alternating currents affected
when you add resistors? Or capacitors? Or an inductor?

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,480
These three pieces of the electricity puzzle are used everywhere, and today we’re going to put them together.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:41,940
[Theme Music]

6
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,699
When you talk about direct current circuits, describing the voltage and current in a given situation is pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,200
Typically, the voltage source in a DC circuit is
unchanging, so the current will be constant, too.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,360
But in an AC circuit, both the voltage and the current are constantly changing directions, from positive to negative and back again.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,700
So how do you describe values when they’re
constantly changing?

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,399
Well, when a current alternates quickly, it’s changing back and forth between maximum and minimum values, known as peak current.

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,280
And “peak” here means either maximum or minimum, positive or negative, since the flow of current has the same magnitude.

12
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,980
Mathematically, a current is equal to the peak current times a sine function related to the system’s frequency, typically 60 Hertz.

13
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,920
And the same is true for the voltage in an
AC circuit.

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,920
It changes between a maximum and minimum peak voltage in order to generate the alternating current.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,680
Now, let’s say you’re calculating the
average power consumed by an AC circuit.

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,540
You can use the handy power expression for
DC circuits, which we’ve already derived,

17
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,860
in order to find the consumed energy over
time, in terms of current and resistance.

18
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,320
Then you can replace the current with our
new equation for alternating current.

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,820
Then, since you want to find the average power,
just take the average of the power expression.

20
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,679
The sine squared function always reduces to
one half when averaged.

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,480
This leaves you with an average power of peak current squared, times resistance, divided by two.

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,680
But you can only take this equation for DC circuits so far, before you have to start making some serious changes for it to help you figure out AC circuits.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,920
Why?
Because of I: the value for the current itself.

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,39
Think of driving a car in stop-and-go traffic.

25
00:02:09,39 --> 00:02:13,560
You speed up at times, you slow down at others,
but if you average it out over the whole trip,

26
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,849
you’ve got an “effective” speed somewhere
in the middle.

27
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,299
That’s what current is like in AC calculations.

28
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,840
So, in order to express current in this equation, we need a new variable that represents this effective value.

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,840
And that variable is the root-mean-squared,
or RMS value, of current.

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,420
It's really just the value you would get if you squared the current, took the average, and then square rooted it again.

31
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,160
Hence the name: root mean square.

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:42,359
Now, this same derivation works for alternating voltage, as well, with the RMS value of voltage being equal to the peak voltage divided by the square root of 2.

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:51,160
With these two RMS values at your disposal, you can then use them in place of current and voltage in DC equations, with power equaling the RMS current times RMS voltage.

34
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,439
So, now that we have RMS values to better
describe current and voltage in AC circuits,

35
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,379
let’s think about how we can use the unique
nature of AC circuits to our advantage.

36
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,519
For example, with coils of wire, we know that when the current is changing, a magnetic flux is induced in the coil.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,260
And that flux seeks to oppose the current with an electromotive force, or emf, in the opposite direction.

38
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,440
And this is the rule that we know as Lenz’s
Law.

39
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,940
And this relationship works the opposite way as well, with a changing magnetic flux inducing an emf that opposes the flux.

40
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:29,300
So in an AC circuit, what you end up with is a changing current that induces an opposing magnetic flux, which in turn induces an emf in the opposite direction of the current!

41
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,600
This induction of an emf that opposes the
main current is called self-inductance.

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,239
And to calculate an induced emf, you just take the change in current over time and multiply it by negative L.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:46,860
L is a constant, known as the inductance, signifying how well that specific coil induces an opposing current, depending on its shape and size.

44
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,200
And it’s negative, because the induced emf
is in the opposite direction of the main current.

45
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,940
Inductance, by the way, is expressed in units
called Henrys.

46
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,600
Induction of an electromagnetic force is so useful, that engineers make coils that are designed to maximize their self-inductance.

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,900
These coils that are designed for self-inductance
are called inductors.

48
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,40
In a circuit diagram, they look like small coils,
'cause that’s pretty much what they are!

49
00:04:08,40 --> 00:04:12,379
So to get a handle on how inductors work,
let’s first consider one in a DC circuit.

50
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,839
Let’s say this circuit has an inductor connected in series with a battery that has a constant voltage, V naught.

51
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:24,159
Since most inductors have a natural resistance, we’ll say that there’s also a small resistor in series with the inductor and battery.

52
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,791
And because we have an inductance L and a resistance R, we call this configuration an LR circuit.

53
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,680
If we set up this circuit and then insert the battery,
the voltage will immediately be V naught.

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,250
But the current won’t reach its maximum
value.

55
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,100
That’s because the inductor opposes the sudden change in current that was caused by the sudden voltage change.

56
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:48,980
So the current will increase gradually, until it eventually reaches maximum current, which is the battery’s voltage divided by the resistance.

57
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,960
The current in this case is kind of like a
car that’s accelerating from a dead stop.

58
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,169
Even if you stomp down on the gas pedal, you
won’t immediately start going at top speed.

59
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:59,258
You’re going to have to build up to it over
time.

60
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,539
So you have to consider time when you’re
dealing with inductors.

61
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,480
Mathematically, the current in a circuit with an inductor is expressed as the maximum current times one minus e to the negative t over tau.

62
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,350
The maximum current is the voltage divided
by the resistance, and tau is the time constant,

63
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,690
equal to the inductance divided by the resistance.

64
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,560
This time constant has all kinds of mathematical
meaning that we can’t get into right now.

65
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,740
But you can see that as time goes to infinity,
you get closer to the maximum current value.

66
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,420
Put in terms of our car analogy, the maximum current is like the fastest that your car will go.

67
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,500
And the time constant lets you know how long you need to press down on the accelerator to get there.

68
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,160
A small time constant means less time is needed to reach maximum speed, and also less time to slow down to a stop.

69
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,520
A large time constant means the opposite: that a lot of time is necessary to speed up and slow down.

70
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,240
Now, let’s say the circuit has reached steady-state,
with the current at that maximum value.

71
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,610
There’s no longer a changing current, so
the inductor acts just like a piece of wire.

72
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,270
But if the battery is suddenly removed, the
current won’t drop to 0 immediately.

73
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,820
Because, remember, the inductor opposes the change in current with its own changing magnetic flux.

74
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,300
So after the battery is removed, the inductor
generates its own current!

75
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,700
This is like driving a car and then taking
your foot off the accelerator.

76
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,139
You’ve stopped the car from going faster,
but you won’t stop immediately.

77
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,419
Instead, you’ll slow down over time, before
you stop entirely.

78
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,979
So you can write this as the decreasing version
of the earlier current equation,

79
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:22,159
with current equaling the maximum possible
current, times e to the negative t over tau.

80
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,680
I max is the same, and tau is the same, and once enough time has passed, then the current is equal to 0.

81
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,640
So, inductors oppose a change in current,
whether it’s an increase or a decrease.

82
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,919
When you switch a device on or off, and you notice a delay, that’s probably because an inductor is in the system.

83
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:44,100
By flipping the switch, you’ve either started or ended a voltage supply, but an inductor in the system delays the current from starting or stopping immediately.

84
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,990
OK so that’s inductors 101!

85
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,470
Now let’s go back to AC circuits, and combine an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor all in one circuit.

86
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,160
Each component will behave differently when
connected to the source of alternating voltage.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,620
So before we combine everything, let’s look at each component as if it alone were in series with the source.

88
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,100
Let’s start with a resistor.

89
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,780
When the voltage is at peak voltage, the current through the resistor will also be at peak current.

90
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,159
Since the voltage and current peaks occur at the
same time, the two are said to be in phase.

91
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,360
For inductors and capacitors, however, the
story’s a little different.

92
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:21,800
As the alternating voltage is applied across the inductor, the opposing emf that’s induced equals the amount of voltage that drops across the device.

93
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,520
The inductor has an insignificant amount of resistance, so when it’s the only device in the circuit, all the voltage must be opposed by the opposing emf.

94
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,400
In this equation, the voltage is at maximum when the current is changing the fastest, and the voltage is 0 when the current isn’t changing at all.

95
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,479
This means that, when the current is 0, there’s peak voltage, and when current is at its peak and unchanging, the voltage is 0.

96
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,20
When you express this graphically, it means that the current lags behind voltage by 90 degrees, or a quarter cycle.

97
00:07:48,20 --> 00:07:54,299
So in AC circuit inductors, we say that the current and voltage are out-of-phase, which means they don’t peak at the same time.

98
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,340
Capacitors in AC circuits are also out of
phase, but for a different reason.

99
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,419
Let’s look at a circuit with only an alternating
voltage source and a capacitor.

100
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,560
When the current flows in one direction, charge
momentarily builds up on one of the plates.

101
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,460
So when the voltage changes from positive to negative, the capacitor acts as a smaller voltage source that still pushes the current along.

102
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,280
In this case, current leads voltage by 90 degrees, changing the direction ahead of the voltage source.

103
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,760
So let’s sum up: Current in inductors lags
voltage.

104
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,139
Current in resistors is in phase with voltage.

105
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,650
And current in capacitors leads voltage.

106
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,440
Another thing that sets inductors and capacitors apart from resistors is that they don’t release a lot of heat.

107
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,760
The only part of an AC circuit that dissipates
power as thermal energy is the resistance.

108
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,519
Inductors and capacitors both have negligible
resistance, and they don’t dissipate heat,

109
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,49
but they do have voltage drops across each
component.

110
00:08:43,49 --> 00:08:49,149
So their voltage drops will still affect how much voltage the circuit can supply to other components that DO need to dissipate power.

111
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:55,829
So, when you have an AC circuit with a resistor, inductor, and capacitor in series, you can calculate the voltage supplied,

112
00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:00,888
versus the voltage applied across each component, by adding all of the component voltage drops together.

113
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:05,860
Every voltage drop peaks at a different time,
but the sum will always equal that of the source.

114
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,400
What goes in must go out!

115
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,480
This wraps up our last look at electricity!

116
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,000
But you can’t forget everything you’ve learned about electromagnetism yet, because it’s coming back in a shiny new form, known as light!

117
00:09:16,10 --> 00:09:18,760
Today, we learned about currents and voltages
in AC circuits.

118
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,20
We also learned about inductors and we combined
our knowledge of AC circuits with inductors,

119
00:09:23,20 --> 00:09:29,40
capacitors, and resistors in order to analyze how voltage and current interact with an alternating voltage source.
