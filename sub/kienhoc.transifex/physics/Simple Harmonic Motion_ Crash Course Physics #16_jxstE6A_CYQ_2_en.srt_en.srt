00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:09,259
In June 2001, officials in London unveiled a striking new feat of engineering: the Millennium Bridge

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,719
-- a pedestrian bridge spanning the
River Thames.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,800
It promised to be very useful, and it was
cool to look at, but it had to be close almost immediately.

4
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:21,479
Because when people used the bridge, it swayed back and forth dramatically, due to the force of their footsteps.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,019
Undeterred, people kept using the bridge, but as they walked they began leaning into the swaying to keep themselves from falling over.

6
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,719
And that only made things worse.

7
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:34,539
Eventually, the motion of the bridge became so severe, that the bridge took on the shape of a giant S.

8
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:36,199
Essentially, a horizontal wave.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,280
The bridge had to be closed and the engineers took nearly two years to fix it the problem.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,560
So, what was wrong with the Millennium Bridge?

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,580
And why didn’t the engineers foresee the
problem?

12
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,519
The answer lies in oscillations.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:59,420
[Theme Music]

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,500
The physics that caused the swaying of the Millennium Bridge has to do with oscillations, or back-and-forth motion.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,620
More specifically, it has to do with simple
harmonic motion:

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,820
where oscillations follow a particular, consistent pattern.

17
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,789
But before we had the Millennium Bridge as
a real-life example,

18
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:20,090
physicists often described simple harmonic motion in terms of a ball attached to a horizontal spring, lying on a table.

19
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,230
While it’s lying there, at rest, it’s
in equilibrium.

20
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,230
And when you move the ball so that it stretches
the spring, then let go,

21
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,430
the ball keeps moving back and forth forever...
in a frictionless world.

22
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,440
That back-and-forth motion caused by the force
of the spring, is simple harmonic motion.

23
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,540
Now, we want to know two things about this
oscillating ball:

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,400
What kinds of energy does it have?

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,330
And, what’s its maximum velocity?

26
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,519
To better understand what’s happening to
the ball, let’s start with its energy.

27
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,859
As the ball compresses and stretches the spring, both ‘kinetic energy’ and ‘potential energy’ come into play.

28
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,120
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and
as the ball moves, there are two points --

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,219
the turning points -- where it’s NOT moving:

30
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,739
One point is where the spring is compressed all the way, and the other is where it’s stretched all the way.

31
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:05,919
And the distance between either of these two points, and the equilibrium point, is called the ‘amplitude’.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,599
At those two turning points, the ball won’t
have any kinetic energy, since it isn't moving.

33
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,419
Instead, all of the ball’s energy will be
potential energy from the spring:

34
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:17,959
(half of the spring constant), times the (amplitude
squared).

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,540
Now, as the ball moves toward the middle,
its kinetic energy starts to increase,

36
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,639
because it’s moving faster and faster.

37
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,030
And at the same time, its potential energy
decreases, keeping its total energy the same.

38
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,520
And exactly in the middle of the ball’s motion -- at the equilibrium point -- its potential energy goes down to 0.

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,180
The ball is back where it started, so the spring isn’t pulling on it anymore.

40
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,079
Its kinetic energy, on the other hand, has
reached its maximum.

41
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,399
Which means that at that point, the total
energy of the ball will be equal to

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,539
(half of its mass), times its (maximum velocity
squared).

43
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:52,459
Now we have two equations for the total energy in this oscillating spring, which we can combine into one equation.

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,540
And if we use algebra to move around its variables, we can start to answer the second question we had about the ball.

45
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,218
We wanted to know the ball’s maximum velocity,
and this equation tells us, that it’s equal

46
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:06,628
to the (amplitude), times the (square root
of the spring constant) (divided by its mass).

47
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:09,568
So we’ve answered our two questions
about the ball on the spring!

48
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:12,899
We know about its energy, and we have an equation for its maximum velocity.

49
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:16,649
But there’s a lot more going on with this
ball than just its energy and velocity.

50
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:21,229
It also has properties like a period,
a frequency, and an angular velocity.

51
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:23,260
Plus, its position changes with time.

52
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:28,000
You might recognize those terms, because we’ve already talked about them in our episode on uniform circular motion.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,400
And that’s no coincidence!

54
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,919
Simple harmonic motion is actually a lot like uniform circular motion, mathematically speaking.

55
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,439
You can see this for yourself, if you compare the ball’s motion on the spring to an object in uniform circular motion --

56
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,759
say, a marble moving along a ring at a constant speed.

57
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,620
OK, I admit: It might seem like kind of a weird
comparison at first.

58
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,620
For one thing, the ball on the spring is
moving in one dimension,

59
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,740
while a marble moving along a circular path is in two dimensions.

60
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,860
But what if you take that ring, and look at
it from the side?

61
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,260
The marble keeps moving along its circular
path.

62
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:01,998
But to you, it looks like it’s just moving
back and forth along a straight line.

63
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:06,579
Not only that, but it looks like this marble
is stopping momentarily as it changes direction,

64
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,169
and moving faster as it gets closer to the
middle.

65
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,799
Which is exactly the same way the ball was
moving on the spring.

66
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,400
Now, let’s take this comparison a step further.

67
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,239
Let’s assume that the radius of the ring is the same as the amplitude of the ball’s motion on the spring.

68
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,460
And the marble’s constant speed along the ring is equal to the maximum speed of the ball on the spring.

69
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,219
In that case, if you did the math, you’d find that the equation for the marble’s velocity

70
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,800
-- when you look at it edge-on -- is exactly the same as the equation that described

71
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,459
the velocity of the ball on the spring.

72
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:38,000
So, let’s recall what we know about uniform circular motion, to see what it can tell us about simple harmonic motion.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,540
We know that the time it takes for the marble
to move around the ring once is called the period.

74
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,240
We also know that the period will be equal to the circumference of the ring, divided by the marble’s speed.

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,420
And! The radius of the circle is the same
as the ball’s amplitude on the spring.

76
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,540
So its circumference will be equal to two times pi times the amplitude.

77
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,520
This means that the period will be equal to
2 times pi times the amplitude,

78
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,939
divided by the marble’s speed -- which, again, is the same as the ball’s maximum speed as it moves on the spring.

79
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,309
And we can simplify that equation, since we
know that the maximum speed of the ball is

80
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:14,000
equal to the (amplitude) times (the square
root of the spring constant) divided by the (mass).

81
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:19,850
So: the period of the marble’s motion around
the ring is equal to (two pi) times (the root of m) over (k).

82
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,480
Now, we’ve also talked about the frequency
of uniform circular motion:

83
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:30,200
It’s the number of revolutions the marble makes around the ring every second, and it’s equal to 1, divided by the period.

84
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,839
In this case, the frequency will also be equal
to 1 over (2 pi) times (the square root of k) over (m).

85
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,879
And that’ll apply to the ball on the spring,
too.

86
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,300
Because the rules are the same!

87
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,759
Finally, there’s angular velocity to consider.

88
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:46,408
In uniform circular motion, we’ve described
it as the number of radians per second that

89
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:48,968
the marble covers as it moves around the ring.

90
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:52,528
And angular velocity is just equal to the
frequency times 2 pi.

91
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:57,079
Which means that in the case of the ball on the spring, it’s equal to the square root of k over m.

92
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,448
So now, with the help of our knowledge about
circular motion, we can understand the period,

93
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,771
frequency, and angular velocity of the ball’s simple harmonic motion as it oscillates on the spring.

94
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,339
But there’s one more question: How does
the ball’s position change over time?

95
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,599
To find out, we’ll have to analyze the
marble’s motion along the ring again.

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,060
And the answer will involve some trigonometry.

97
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,220
But it’s not particularly complicated trig so, it'll be fine.

98
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,120
At any given point along the marble’s path, it’ll be at a certain angle to the right-hand side of the ring.

99
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,959
And the cosine of that angle will be equal to its horizontal distance from the center of the ring, divided by the ring’s radius.

100
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,799
We already know that the radius of the ring is the same as the amplitude of the ball’s motion along the spring.

101
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,910
And if you turn the ring so that it looks
like a line again, you can see that the marble’s

102
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,659
horizontal distance from the center of the ring is the same as the ball’s distance from the equilibrium point.

103
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:48,990
So, the cosine of theta is equal to the (ball’s
position) divided by its (amplitude).

104
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,050
In other words, the ball’s position is equal
to (the amplitude), times (the cosine of the angle).

105
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,919
And we can simplify this equation, too.

106
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,800
In the same way that distance is equal to
velocity multiplied by time,

107
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,620
the angle is equal to the angular velocity multiplied by time.

108
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,978
So, we can write the equation for the position
of the ball as x = A cos w t.

109
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,499
And when you graph this equation, something interesting happens: It looks like a wave!

110
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,338
We’ll be talking a lot more about waves
in our next three episodes.

111
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,879
But for now, it’s helpful just to see the
connection here:

112
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,139
For an object in simple harmonic motion, the graph of its position versus time is a wave.

113
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,479
Which is why the swaying of the Millennium
Bridge looked like a wave.

114
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,300
Speaking of the bridge: now we can better
understand what happened to it.

115
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,740
The bridge’s shimmy was the result of oscillation, but it was made worse by another culprit: resonance.

116
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,980
Resonance can increase the amplitude of an oscillation by applying force at just the right frequency --

117
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,180
kind of like how you can get a kid to swing higher by pushing at just the right moment.

118
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,590
The engineers of the Millennium Bridge were
reminded of that, the hard way.

119
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:53,169
When pedestrians on the bridge started to
lean into its swaying, they created resonance.

120
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,910
They amplified the amplitude of the oscillation.

121
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,340
And the engineers of the bridge did account for oscillations caused by resonance when they designed it.

122
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:05,498
But they only considered vertical oscillations -- the kind that would have made the bridge bounce up and down.

123
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,180
They didn’t realize that they’d also have to factor in the horizontal swaying caused by people walking.

124
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,978
So, it was only a tiny bit of swaying at first, but it got a lot worse because people were leaning into their steps, causing resonance.

125
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,220
In the end, engineers had to apply a series of changes to the bridge that applied force to counteract its oscillations.

126
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,800
Because if there’s one thing you don’t
want your bridge to be doing, it’s The Wave.

127
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,160
Today, you learned about simple harmonic motion -- the energy of that motion, and how we can use math

128
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,580
of uniform circular motion to find the period, frequency, and angular velocity of a mass on a spring.

129
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,920
We also described how the position of an object in simple harmonic motion changes over time.
