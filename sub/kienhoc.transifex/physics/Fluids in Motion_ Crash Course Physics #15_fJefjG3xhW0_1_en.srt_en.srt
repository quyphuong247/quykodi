1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,120
You know what can be kind of peculiar and
surprising?

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,060
The fact that, whenever you want to shoot outside, everyone decides to mow their lawn.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,720
You know what else can be kind of peculiar
and surprising?

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,760
Water.

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,759
And in the right circumstances, I could even take water that’s flowing down and spurt it straight up.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,600
How?

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,280
All of these things are possible, thanks to
the study of the flow of fluids, known as Fluid Dynamics.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:41,100
[Theme Music]

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,100
By now, you’ve picked up on the fact that
-- even though we live in the physical universe

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,320
-- describing the rules of the universe sometimes requires us to pretend that certain things aren’t happening.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,659
Like the time we rolled a bunch of stuff down
a ramp, and pretended that there was no  kinetic friction.

12
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,679
The same is true when we talk about fluids.

13
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:02,979
Because, fluids in motion are dynamic and there are many, many things going on in and around them all at once.

14
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,859
So, in order to grasp the essentials of fluid
dynamics, let’s just do some pretending, shall we?

15
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,969
For one thing, we’re going to consider the
fluids in our examples to be incompressible,

16
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:14,200
meaning that their densities won’t change.

17
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:18,839
We’re also going to assume that fluids flow
perfectly smoothly, and have no viscosity.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,299
You’ve probably heard of viscosity before:

19
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,679
When a fluid flows easily, like water, we say that it has a low viscosity.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,760
Fluids that don’t flow as easily, like honey, have a higher viscosity.

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,460
And much like kinetic friction does in moving objects, viscosity tends to complicate things in moving fluids,

22
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,019
which is why we’re generally going to pretend that the fluids we’re studying don’t have any.

23
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,719
Now, say you have some water -- which exists
under all of these hypothetical conditions

24
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,250
-- in a pipe, moving along smoothly.

25
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,430
This pipe narrows about halfway through, so
that one end is narrower than the other.

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,230
This shape is going to affect some of the
properties of the water’s flow,

27
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,030
as it passes through the narrower side of the pipe compared to the wider side.

28
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,700
But one thing that won't change is the mass of water that’s moving through any given area in the pipe over time.

29
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,980
This is called the mass flow rate, and it’s
always going to be the same everywhere in the pipe.

30
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,729
That’s just because, as the water flows through the pipe, it pushes along the water in the rest of the pipe, too.

31
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:16,349
So if one part of the pipe has, say, a kilogram
of water moving through it every second,

32
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:20,710
the rest of the pipe ALSO has to have a kilogram
of water moving through it every second.

33
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:26,000
This fact, that the mass flow rate at one point in the pipe will be equal to the mass flow rate at any other point,

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,060
is called the equation of continuity.

35
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,680
And it can tell you a lot about the relationship between the velocity of a fluid

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,520
and the cross-sectional area of the pipe that it’s flowing through.

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,100
Let’s say you’re an engineer for the Water
Department of Hypothetical City,

38
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:44,120
and you need to understand the mass flow rate of hypothetical water that’s going through a certain point in your underground pipe system.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,240
But you don’t know the mass that’s going through that part of the pipe at any given moment.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,840
All you know are the water’s velocity and the area of the cross-section of that certain section of pipe.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,140
In order to describe the mass flow rate, you’ll
have to use what we know about density, area,

42
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,750
and velocity to work some algebra magic:

43
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,889
First, let’s have a look at a cross section
of that point of the pipe.

44
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:10,639
From our last lesson, you know that the mass of the fluid moving past this cross-sectional area, over time,

45
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,219
is equal to its density,
times its volume.

46
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:18,300
And, the volume of the fluid moving past this point is simply the area of the pipe at this cross section,

47
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,540
times the distance the fluid
moves.

48
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:25,199
And! From our episodes on the physics of motion,
you also know that the distance the fluid moves,

49
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,419
divided by the change in time, is equal
to the fluid’s velocity.

50
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:33,199
So, by putting all that together, you can
get a different version of the equation of continuity:

51
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,799
At any given point in the pipe, the density
of the fluid flowing through it,

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,680
times the area of the pipe, times the fluid’s velocity, will be the same as for any other point in the pipe.

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,319
And since you’re dealing with an incompressible fluid, the density is going to be the same for every point in the pipe anyway.

54
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,879
So really, you’ve just figured out that
at any point in the pipe, the area of the pipe

55
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,579
times the fluid’s velocity will be
the same as for any other point.

56
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,219
It’s the same thing we said before: The mass
flow rate is the same for every point in the pipe.

57
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:04,500
But instead of putting that relationship
in terms of mass and time,

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,340
you’re putting it in terms of area and velocity.

59
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:11,488
And, in your role as a water-department engineer,
this is important for you to know!

60
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,989
Because it means that, where the pipe is narrower,
the fluid will have to flow faster, in order to compensate.

61
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,358
But here’s a weird thing:

62
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,338
A fluid that’s flowing really fast actually has less pressure than when it’s flowing more slowly.

63
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:27,378
Sure, it might feel like it’s exerting more
force than when it flows through a wider opening.

64
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:31,229
But that’s not what physicists mean when
they talk about the pressure in a pipe.

65
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:34,338
They’re really talking about the pressure
on the walls of the pipe.

66
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:38,478
This means that, the slower the fluid flows,
the more pressure it puts on the pipe itself.

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
This is known as Bernoulli’s principle.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,080
It states that the higher a fluid’s velocity
is through a pipe,

69
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,339
the lower the pressure on the pipe’s walls,
and vice versa.

70
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:51,050
Bernoulli also came up with what we now know
as Bernoulli’s equation.

71
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,509
It might look kind of intimidating at first.

72
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:58,529
But when you break it down, it’s actually just a way of combining a bunch of things that you’ve already learned.

73
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:02,369
Bernoulli based his equation on the
concept of conservation of energy:

74
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,269
as a fluid flows through a pipe, it won’t gain or lose any energy.

75
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,990
This means that, no matter where
the fluid is in the pipe,

76
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,980
if you take all of the forms of energy that the fluid has at that point and add them up,

77
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,140
they’ll equal the same number
as any other point in the pipe.

78
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,618
To better understand this, have a look at how the three forms of energy in a fluid are represented in Bernoulli’s equation:

79
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,599
First, there’s pressure times volume.

80
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:28,259
In our episode on work and energy, we defined
energy as the ability to do work.

81
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:33,658
And when a fluid applies pressure and moves
the volume of fluid that’s downstream, it’s doing work.

82
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:36,079
So, pressure times volume must be a form of
energy.

83
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,359
The first term in Bernoulli’s equation takes
that energy, and divides it by volume.

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,900
Which just leaves pressure.

85
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,769
Next, a flowing fluid also has kinetic energy.

86
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:51,769
When we first talked about kinetic energy, we said that it’s equal to half of an object’s mass, times its velocity squared.

87
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:58,339
Again, Bernoulli divided this form of energy by volume, to get half the fluid’s density, times its velocity squared.

88
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,399
That’s called the kinetic energy density,
and it’s the second term of Bernoulli’s equation.

89
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,519
Finally, a flowing fluid also has the potential
energy that comes from gravity.

90
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,779
And we’ve said before that the potential
energy from gravity is equal to

91
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:13,979
an object’s mass, times small g, times its height.

92
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,939
When Bernoulli divided that by volume, he
got density times small g times height --

93
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:22,800
the potential energy density,
and the third term of his equation.

94
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,939
Why divide all these terms by volume?

95
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:30,879
Well, when it comes to fluids, it’s just easier to talk about things in terms of density than it is to talk about mass.

96
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,000
So when you look at his equation piece by
piece, you can see that Bernoulli was really

97
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:39,649
just putting conservation of energy into a
special form that would be useful for fluids.

98
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,749
Now, let’s look at a special case of Bernoulli’s
equation, known as Torricelli’s theorem.

99
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:49,540
Torricelli’s theorem uses conservation of energy to find the velocity of fluid flowing from a small spout in a container.

100
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,919
And it says that the velocity of the fluid
coming out of the spout is the same as the

101
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,278
velocity of a single droplet of fluid that
falls from the height of the surface of the fluid in the container.

102
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:01,139
In other words, the pressure that’s pushing
the fluid out of the spout

103
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,939
gives it the same velocity that it would get from the force of gravity.

104
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:09,360
To see this theorem in action, let’s say you’re not a water department engineer -- you’re just YOU,

105
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,879
and you’re watering your garden
with the water you’ve saved up in your rain barrel.

106
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,088
Your barrel doesn’t have a top, and you’re
watering your carrots and lettuce and stuff

107
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:18,079
from a hole -- or a spout -- in the side.

108
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,538
Now: You want to know: What’s the velocity
of the water coming out of the spout?

109
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,019
From Bernoulli’s equation, we know that
the sum of the pressure, kinetic energy density,

110
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:30,439
and the potential energy density of the water
at the TOP of the cooler, will equal the sum

111
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,149
of those three qualities of the water coming
out of the spout.

112
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:37,639
But we can simplify that relationship a bit,
to find the velocity of the fluid coming out.

113
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:39,908
First, the upper surface of
the water in the barrel,

114
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:43,579
and the water that’s coming out of the spout, are both exposed to the atmosphere.

115
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:47,558
So the pressure at those points will be the same -- it’s just the atmospheric pressure.

116
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,319
So we can cross off the pressure from each
side of the equation.

117
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,019
Now, there might be water coming out of the spout, but the top of the barrel has a much bigger area.

118
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:57,928
So the water at the top of the barrel isn’t
going to be moving very much.

119
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:01,328
In fact, we can say that its velocity is basically zero.

120
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:05,300
Which means that the kinetic energy density
for the water at the top of the barrel is zero.

121
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:09,679
Finally, we can cross out the density in each
term of the equation, since it’s not changing.

122
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,079
We’re left with a much simpler equation,
with only three terms --

123
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,300
an equation that should look VERY familiar, if you’ve watched our episodes on the physics of motion.

124
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,869
It’s a kinematic equation!

125
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:23,969
You already know the two main kinematic equations:
the definition of acceleration and the displacement curve.

126
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:27,658
And you can rearrange them to get another
equation that relates displacement, velocity,

127
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:30,209
and acceleration -- without considering time.

128
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,929
It’s exactly the same equation as the one
we just found by using Bernoulli’s equation

129
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,918
to describe the velocity of the water coming
out of the spout.

130
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,059
So, Torricelli’s theorem tells you that if a droplet of water fell from the same height as the top of the barrel,

131
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,359
when it reached the level of the spout, it’d have the same velocity as the water coming out of the spout.

132
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,279
Now you know how fast the water’s
coming out your rain barrel,

133
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,500
and how much water you’re putting in your garden over a certain amount of time.

134
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,240
But you want to try something fun?

135
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,680
Let’s turn the spout on your barrel so it’s pointing up instead of down.

136
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,979
If the water from this spout could shoot straight up,

137
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,779
the stream would get exactly as high as the water at the top of the barrel, before falling down to the ground.

138
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,699
Today, you learned about fluids in motion,
with a focus on the continuity equation,

139
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,280
Bernoulli’s equation, and Torricelli’s theorem.

140
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,860
You also learned that lawn mowers are loud.
