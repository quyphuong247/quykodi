00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,040
Hi, I’m Dr. Shini Somara and I hear you
want to learn physics.

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,788
I have to say: good choice.

3
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:13,259
Physics is the science of how the world -- really
the whole universe -- works.

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,698
And I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but
in the world I live in, things tend to move around a lot.

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,199
So that’s what we’re going to study first:
the science of motion.

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,730
And it turns out to be incredibly useful -- for
figuring out things like where you are, or

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,670
where you’ve been, or how you’re moving
through the world.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,960
Why is that worth knowing?

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,780
Well, for one thing: The police use physics
to decide how exactly how fast you’re moving

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,689
through the world, and if that motion happens
to break the law.

11
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:42,009
So if you’re gonna understand how and why
you got that ticket they gave you -- and maybe

12
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:46,070
even know enough to dispute it -- you have
to know the science of motion, too.

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,570
And in order to do that, you’ll need to
understand a few essential conditions that

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,789
describe your physical place in the universe.

15
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,640
Conditions like time, position, velocity,
and acceleration.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,679
So to talk about all of these things at the same time,

17
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:03,759
you’ll need a set of equations that links all of them together.

18
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,739
These are called the kinematic equations.

19
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:09,969
So, for the next few minutes, let’s talk
about how you can figure out your place in

20
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:14,489
the world -- literally -- which just might
help you beat that speeding ticket.

21
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:24,909
[Theme Music]

22
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:29,079
Let’s say you’re driving on a straight stretch
of highway. Say, someplace nice and flat,

23
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:34,359
on the wide open spaces of the Northern
Plains of the United States. Say…North Dakota.

24
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,890
You come across a red light, and even
though there are no cars in sight, you stop.

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,719
Because you’re a good driver who obeys traffic laws.

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,810
Then, the light turns green, so you hit the
gas. Annnnd exactly seven seconds later,

27
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,980
you hear the sirens and see the flashing lights
of a police car.

28
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:53,670
You’re promptly served with a ticket for
speeding in a 100 kilometer an hour zone.

29
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,590
But wait. Were you really going that fast?
Did you actually break the law?

30
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,579
You can’t really tell, because the
speedometer in your car is broken.

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,299
So you need to find another way to figure
out how fast you were going, and decide if

32
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,780
you want to take this up this issue with Johnny
Law in court.

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,520
That’s where physics comes in -- the physics
of moving in a straight line.

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,540
Let’s start by talking about how your car
was moving.

35
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,610
Driving along a straight highway is an example
of one-dimensional motion because the car

36
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,320
can only move back and forth along that line.

37
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,759
That’s different from something that’s
free to move in all three dimensions,

38
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,699
like a boomerang flying through the air.

39
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,579
And instead of describing that motion just
in terms of speed, or direction, like a police

40
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,349
officer or other non-physicist might do, we
physicists describe it with math.

41
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:39,109
Maths that measures the four main
conditions of the car’s movement --

42
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,670
its time, position, velocity, and acceleration.

43
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:48,780
Time simply tells you how long you were driving
for. Position is also important: It lets you

44
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,460
know where you are or where you were. It can
even be negative.

45
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,320
For one-dimensional motion, there are only
two directions you can move in --

46
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,639
in this case, forward or backward, east or west.

47
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,330
So, if the change in position -- known as
displacement -- is positive, you’ll know

48
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,280
you’ve moved in one of those directions.
If it’s negative, you’re traveling the other way.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,780
But which direction is positive, and which
is negative? That’s totally arbitrary.

50
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,800
You could decide that east should be positive
and west negative, or the other way around

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,300
-- but the answers you get will mean the same
thing.

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,200
You just have to make sure to keep track of
which direction is positive, and keep that

53
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,619
in mind when you’re talking about velocity
and acceleration, too.

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,400
Velocity is the way your position changes
over time, and it’s also a pretty big deal.

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,750
It’s kind of like speed, but just like with
displacement, it also tells you which direction

56
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,620
you’re moving in, based on whether it’s
positive or negative.

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,150
Now, what about when your velocity changes?

58
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,730
That’s the fourth quality of movement you’ll
want to pay attention to: acceleration.

59
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:50,489
If you’ve ever been in a car when someone
slammed on the gas, that feeling of being

60
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,980
pressed back against your seat is acceleration
-- your velocity’s changing.

61
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:59,919
So, how do we plot out all of these different
conditions that describe the movement of you

62
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,319
and your vehicle through the plains of North
Dakota?

63
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,669
A non-physicist might visualize this movement
on something like a map, but for us, graphs

64
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:11,259
are the most useful way to show how all this
change in position is happening.

65
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:15,769
Graphs are generally presented as position
versus time -- with position on the vertical

66
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,379
axis, and time on the horizontal axis.

67
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,399
We’ll label your position as x and time
as t.

68
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:27,359
Now, let’s imagine three different scenarios for how you drove through this small town, and graph each one.

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,860
First, let’s say that, after you went through
the red light, you just stayed in one spot

70
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,360
-- say, at 4 meters from the light -- for
three seconds.

71
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,918
From that moment, the graph of your position
would just be a flat line at x = 4 m, like this.

72
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,418
Now, what if you didn’t stop, but instead
were coasting at one meter per second?

73
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,120
Then the line would be diagonal, to show how
your position was changing -- like this.

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,439
And the third time, let’s say you were standing still at first at the 4 meter mark, but then you hit the gas,

75
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,939
and you moved in such a way that,
after 1 second, you went 1 meter in the positive

76
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:06,029
direction and after 2 seconds you went 4 meters
and after 3 seconds you’ve gone 9 meters.

77
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:09,569
In that case, you end up with a graph that’s
all curvy, like this.

78
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,529
But there’s more going on in these
scenarios than just your position and time.

79
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,399
You also have to be able to graph your
velocity and acceleration.

80
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,099
So, to graph your velocity, you’d put your velocity on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.

81
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,180
And you’ll note that, since velocity is
measured as the change in position over time,

82
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,280
it’s measured in meters per second.

83
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:35,919
The graph for acceleration is quite similar -- acceleration, a, goes on the vertical, and time goes on the horizontal.

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,759
And since acceleration is measured as the
change in meters per second, its units are

85
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,659
meters per second per second -- otherwise
known as meters per second, squared.

86
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,240
So: time, position, velocity, and
acceleration all relate to each other.

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,519
Velocity is the change in position over time, and acceleration is the change in velocity over time.

88
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,459
And often, your velocity will be different
from moment to moment -- like the third time

89
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,668
you drove down the highway, when you hit the
gas.

90
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:06,959
But let’s say you wanted to know your average velocity for a certain period -- say, for those first three seconds.

91
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,399
All you have to do is take the change in position
and divide it by the change in time.

92
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:17,399
Figuring out how much something is changing just means that you have to subtract its starting value from its final value.

93
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,180
And since, as physicists, we’ll end up doing
that a lot, we abbreviate that difference

94
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,970
using the lowercase Greek letter delta.

95
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:31,140
So we can use that to write the equation for average velocity: It’s just delta x over delta t.

96
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,139
The change in position over the change
in time.

97
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,240
Now what about the third scenario? When you
had your foot on the gas and kept accelerating?

98
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,210
You started out at the 4 meter mark, and ended
up at the 13 meter mark. So your change in

99
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:48,399
position, or delta-x, would be 13 minus 4,
or 9 meters.

100
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,299
And you started at 0 seconds and ended at
3 seconds, meaning that your delta-t was 3 seconds.

101
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,139
Over 3 seconds, you moved 9 meters. That’s
3 meters per second!

102
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:04,179
The equation we use to describe average acceleration
is a lot like the one for average velocity,

103
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,720
because it’s just the change in velocity
divided by the change in time.

104
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,500
So, in that case, your equation would be delta
v over delta t.

105
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,029
And! Here’s something that is incredibly
handy.

106
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:17,859
Since we’re talking about constant acceleration
— that is, acceleration that takes place

107
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:25,319
at a constant rate — we can rearrange this
equation to get v = v_0 + at.

108
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:32,199
That's average velocity equaling to velocity at time 0 plus the product of acceleration times time.

109
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,539
This, my fellow physicists, is an equation
we’ll be using a lot.

110
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,250
We call it the definition of acceleration
-- because that’s exactly what it is.

111
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,300
It’s saying that constant acceleration is equal to the change in velocity divided by the change in time --

112
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,139
we just used algebra to move the
variables around.

113
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,019
Now, it’s worth noting that there are lots
of different kinds of acceleration,

114
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,379
ones that don’t involve speeding tickets --
like when something is falling.

115
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:59,360
The force of gravity pulling it down is making
it accelerate at 9.81 meters per second squared,

116
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,569
which physicists often abbreviate as a lowercase
g.

117
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,259
So we’ll just call that constant small g
… there’s a capital G that’s going to come up later.

118
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,910
So, the definition of acceleration is the
first of the two main kinematic equations

119
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,340
that we’ll be using. But it only links velocity,
acceleration, and time. What about position?

120
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,409
There’s an equation for that too -- the
second kinematic equation, which we’ll call

121
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,949
the displacement curve, because it takes your
acceleration, your starting velocity, and

122
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,939
how long you were moving for, and uses that
information to figure out what your  displacement was.

123
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:33,539
And the displacement curve equation looks
like this.

124
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,109
It makes sense, if you think about it -- if
your acceleration is the change in your velocity,

125
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,219
and your velocity is the change in your position, then there should be some way to link all of them together.

126
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,559
Now, there are lots of other kinematic equations,
too, like these.

127
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:50,289
But, you only really need to know the first
two -- the definition of acceleration and

128
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:55,019
the displacement curve. The others are just
different ways of rearranging these main two.

129
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:00,298
And because these two equations have so many terms in common, you can use them together really easily.

130
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:04,799
For example, if you know your acceleration,
and your starting and final velocities,

131
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,339
you could use the definition of acceleration to
figure out how much time you were traveling for.

132
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,600
Then you could plug that value for time into the displacement curve equation and use it to find your displacement.

133
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,749
Now that we know what the kinematic equations
are, we can finally use the power of physics

134
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:21,778
to find out whether you were speeding when
the cops pulled you over.

135
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,980
As with most physics problems, the first thing
we need to do is write down everything we know.

136
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,639
In this case, we know your initial velocity,
v-nought, was 0, and your time, t, was 7 seconds.

137
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,139
The first thing we need to find is your acceleration,
which we can get using the displacement curve.

138
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:41,620
Plugging in everything we know, we find that
your acceleration, a, was 5 meters per second squared.

139
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:47,480
Then, we can plug all of that into the definition of
acceleration, to find your final velocity, like this:

140
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,759
We learn that you were going 35 meters per
second when the cops pulled you over.

141
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,639
That’s 126 kilometers an hour…
So you definitely deserve that ticket. Sorry.

142
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:03,220
But, in this very first episode of Crash Course Physics, you learned all about position, velocity, and acceleration.

143
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,639
We also talked about the two main
kinematic equations:

144
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,659
the definition of acceleration,
and the displacement curve.

145
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:14,879
