00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,080
When people say that Isaac Newton completely
transformed the field of physics, they really aren't kidding.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, we’ve already talked about his three laws
of motion, which we use to describe how things move.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,280
But another of Newton’s famous contributions
to physics was his understanding of gravity.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,859
When Newton was first starting out, scientists’
concept of gravity was pretty much nonexistent.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,550
I mean, they knew that when you dropped something, it fell to the ground, and from careful observation,

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,719
they knew that planets and moons orbited in
a particular way.

7
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,739
What they didn’t know was that those two
concepts were connected.

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,570
Of course, just like with motion, we now know
that there’s a lot more to gravity than

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,600
what Newton was able to observe.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,140
Even so, when it comes to describing the effects
of gravity on the scale of, say, our solar system,

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,289
Newton’s law of universal gravitation
is incredibly useful.

12
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,789
And it all started with an apple.

13
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,368
… Probably.

14
00:00:50,368 --> 00:01:01,379
[Theme Music]

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,760
Odds are, you’ve been told the story of
Newton’s apple at some point.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,710
The story goes that one day, he was sitting
under an apple tree in his mother’s garden,

17
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,379
when an apple fell out of the tree.

18
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,640
That’s when Newton had his grand realization:
Something was pulling that apple down to Earth.

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,150
And that led to another idea: What if the apple
was pulling on Earth, too, but you just

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,540
couldn’t tell, because the effect of the
apple’s force on Earth was less obvious?

21
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,100
A few years later, Newton was sitting in the same garden when he had another stroke of inspiration:

22
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:30,939
What if the same force that pulled the apple
to the ground could affect things much farther

23
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,500
from Earth’s surface -- like the Moon?

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,150
It was kind of counterintuitive, because the
Moon orbits Earth, instead of crashing straight

25
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,240
into the ground like an apple that falls off
a tree.

26
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,899
But Newton realized that the Moon was still
being pulled toward Earth -- it was just moving

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,859
sideways so quickly that it kept missing.
That’s what was keeping it in orbit.

28
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:52,060
If gravity was keeping the Moon in orbit, what if it affected the behavior of any two objects --

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,640
like a planet orbiting the
Sun?

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,530
That’s the official version of the story
-- the one Newton himself used to tell.

31
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,829
Most historians think he was embellishing at least
a little, but there probably is some truth to it.

32
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,390
Whether or not the thing with the apple actually
happened, Newton thought his idea seemed promising.

33
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,750
The idea that gravity might affect everything, including
the orbits of other planets and moons.

34
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,759
So he started looking for an equation that
would accurately describe the way the gravitational force made objects behave --

35
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,819
whether it was an apple falling on the ground, or the Moon orbiting Earth.

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,130
Newton knew that however this gravitational
force worked, it would probably behave like

37
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:28,289
any other net force on an object -- it would
be equal to that object’s mass, times its acceleration.

38
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:32,609
The mass part was easy enough -- it would
just be the mass of the apple or the Moon.

39
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,320
It was going to be a little harder to figure
out the factors that were affecting the acceleration part of the equation.

40
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,510
The first thing Newton realized he’d have
to take into account was distance.

41
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:44,840
When an object is close to the Earth’s surface,
like an apple in a tree, gravity makes it

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,219
accelerate at about 10 meters per second squared.

43
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,629
But the Moon has an acceleration that’s
only about a 3600th of that falling apple.

44
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:57,519
The Moon also happens to be about 60 times
as far from the center of Earth as that apple would be --

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,140
and 60 squared is 3600.

46
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,599
So Newton figured that the gravitational force
between two objects must get smaller the farther apart they are.

47
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,010
More specifically, it must depend on the distance
between the two objects squared.

48
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:10,259
Then there was mass.

49
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,250
Not the mass of the apple or the Moon -- the
mass of the other object involved in the

50
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,659
gravitational dance: in this case, Earth.

51
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,370
Newton realized that the greater the masses
of the two objects pulling on each other,

52
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,840
the stronger the gravitational force would
be between them.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,780
Once he’d taken into account the distance
between two objects, and their masses,

54
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,580
Newton had most of his equation for
the way gravity behaved:

55
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,400
The gravitational force was proportional to
the mass of the two objects multiplied together,

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
divided by the square of the distance between
them.

57
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,859
But it had to be a lot smaller, or else you’d see a force
pulling together most everyday objects.

58
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,240
Like, that Rubik’s cube is staying right where it is instead of being pulled towards me.

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,180
So the gravitational force between us
must be very small.

60
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:52,669
So Newton added a constant to his equation
-- a very small number that would make the

61
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:56,709
gravitational force just a tiny fraction of
what you’d calculate otherwise.

62
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,920
He called it G.

63
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:04,179
And he called this full equation, F = GMm/r^2,
the law of universal gravitation.

64
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,550
Newton had no idea what number big G would
be, though. He just knew it would be a tiny

65
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,770
number, and put the letter G into his equation
as a placeholder.

66
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,470
About a century later, Henry Cavendish, another
British scientist, made careful measurements

67
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,060
with some of the most sensitive instruments
of the time, and figured out that G was equal

68
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,759
to about 6.67 * 10^-11 N*m^2/kg^2.

69
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,500
So indeed, Newton was right about big G having
to be quite small.

70
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,689
But even though he didn’t know the exact
value of big G at the time,

71
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:36,850
Newton had enough to establish his law
of universal gravitation.

72
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:42,800
He described gravity as a force between any 2 objects, and published his equation for calculating that force.

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,759
Then Newton took things a step further -- well,
technically three steps further.

74
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,279
About 50 years earlier, an astronomer named
Johannes Kepler had come up with three laws

75
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,270
that described the way orbits worked.

76
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:58,399
And those predictions almost perfectly matched
the orbits that astronomers were seeing in the sky.

77
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,399
So, Newton knew that his law of universal
gravitation had to fit with Kepler’s laws,

78
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,049
or he’d have to find some way to explain
why Kepler was wrong.

79
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,270
Luckily for Newton, his law of gravitation
not only fit with Kepler’s laws,

80
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:16,789
he was able to use it, in combination with his
three laws of motion and calculus, to prove Kepler’s laws.

81
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,110
According to Kepler, the orbits of the planets
were ellipses -- as opposed to circles --

82
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,439
with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse -- one
of the two central points used to describe how the ellipse curves.

83
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,300
And that’s what’s known as Kepler’s first
law, and it actually applies to any elliptical

84
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,520
orbit -- not just those of the planets.

85
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,698
Our moon’s orbit around Earth is also an
ellipse, and Earth is at one focus of that ellipse.

86
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,080
Kepler’s second law was that if you draw
a line from a planet to the sun, it’ll always

87
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,668
sweep out the same-sized area within a given
amount of time.

88
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:49,680
When Earth is at its farthest point from the
Sun, for example, over the course of one day

89
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,319
we’ll have covered an area that looks like
a very long, very thin, kinda-lopsided pizza slice.

90
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:59,120
And when we’re at our closest point to the
Sun, one day’s worth of the orbit will sweep

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,009
out an area that’s more like a short, fat
pizza slice.

92
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,288
Kepler’s second law tells us that if we
measure them both, those two pizza slices

93
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:08,180
will have the exact same area.

94
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,540
His third law is a little more technical,
but it’s basically an observation about

95
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,259
what happens when you take the longest -- or
semimajor -- radius of a planet’s orbit

96
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,259
and cube it, then divide that by the period
of the planet’s orbit, squared.

97
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:23,519
According to Kepler, that ratio should be
the same for every single planet --

98
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,259
and now we know that it is, almost exactly.

99
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:32,448
For every single planet that orbits our Sun,
that ratio is either 3.34 or 3.35.

100
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:37,699
And! Newton was able to explain why the actual,
observed orbits in the night sky sometimes

101
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,778
deviated very slightly from Kepler’s predictions
-- for example, by having those slightly different ratios.

102
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,520
What Kepler didn’t know, and Newton figured
out, was that the planets and moons were all

103
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:51,680
pulling on each other, and sometimes, that
pull was strong enough to change their orbits just a little bit.

104
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,300
There’s one more thing we should point out
about Newton’s law of universal gravitation,

105
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,860
which is that it fits what we expect the equation
for a net force should look like, according to Newton.

106
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,360
From Newton’s second law of motion, we know
that a net force is equal to mass times acceleration.

107
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,259
What the law of universal gravitation is saying,
is that when the net force acting on an object

108
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:13,419
comes from gravity, the acceleration is equal
to the mass of the bigger object -- like Earth --

109
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,740
divided by the distance between the
two objects, times big G.

110
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,040
So, you know how we’ve been describing the gravitational acceleration at Earth’s surface as small g?

111
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,439
Well, small g is actually equal to big G,
times Earth’s mass, divided by Earth’s radius, squared.

112
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,779
...math!

113
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:32,859
And we can use this equation for gravitational
acceleration to help NASA out with a challenge

114
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,669
they’re grappling with right now.

115
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:38,339
We want to send humans to Mars. But we have
to make sure that their spacesuits will work

116
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:40,099
properly in Martian gravity.

117
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,040
One way that NASA tests spacesuits is by
flying astronauts on special planes --

118
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,879
sometimes called Vomit Comets.

119
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,430
They fly in arcs that let the spacesuit-testers
experience reduced weight -- or none at all

120
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,780
-- for short periods of time.

121
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,049
To simulate Martian gravity, the flight plan
will need to aim for the gravitational acceleration

122
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,710
you’d experience if you started hopping
around on the surface of Mars.

123
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,418
So, what would that acceleration be?

124
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,080
Well, from Newton’s law of universal gravitation,
we know that the acceleration of stuff at

125
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:12,239
Mars’s surface would be equal to big G,
times the mass of Mars, divided by Mars’s radius squared.

126
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,519
We also happen to know Mars’s mass and radius
already, which ... helps.

127
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,319
So, plugging in the numbers, we can calculate the gravitational acceleration at Mars’s surface:

128
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,459
it should be about 3.7 meters per
second squared.

129
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:29,879
That’s the acceleration you’d experience on Mars, and what the Vomit Comet pilots try to attain when they fly --

130
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,620
about 38% of the acceleration that you experience when you jump off the ground here on Earth.

131
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,060
So, hundreds of years after Newton’s day,
NASA is still using his math.

132
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,098
Yeah, I’d say he was a pretty big deal.

133
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,719
Today, you learned about how Newton
came up with his law of universal gravitation.

134
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,399
We also talked about Kepler’s three laws, and calculated the gravitational acceleration on the surface of Mars.
