1
00:00:03,70 --> 00:00:04,790
Imagine you’re floating down a river.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,430
Maybe the stream is calm and serene, flowing
without obstruction.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,700
Or perhaps it’s a rushing river, churning
and splashing over rocks!

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,20
Well, the way water moves in a river is a
lot like how electricity flows through a wire.

5
00:00:16,20 --> 00:00:20,600
But when we say that electricity is flowing,
we’re really talking about the flow of electrons.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,539
Electric current is the total amount of charge
passing through a wire over a period of time.

7
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,319
But how does current actually form?

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,580
What can it pass through?

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,650
And what determines how strong it is?

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,890
It’s time to sit back, relax, and go with
the flow.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:46,50
[Theme Music]

12
00:00:46,50 --> 00:00:49,680
Let’s talk about how we get charges to flow
from one place to another.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:58,580
Last time, we learned that when there’s a difference in electric potential between two points, the voltage gives charged particles, like electrons, the energy to move from one place to another.

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:04,700
Just like a river flows from high elevation to low elevation, electric charge flows from high voltage to low voltage.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,200
So, we need a way to generate a voltage that gets charge to flow continuously, creating an electric current.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,620
Before the 19th century, scientists had been able to generate static charge by rubbing different materials together.

17
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,300
But they couldn’t do much more than create
small sparks.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:24,600
They didn’t fully understand what they were doing, so they couldn’t figure out how to create a constant voltage to generate a steady flow of electricity.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,460
To solve this problem, Italian scientist Alessandro Volta invented the first voltaic cell,

20
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,80
which uses chemical reactions to create an electric potential difference between two pieces of different metals, known as electrodes.

21
00:01:36,80 --> 00:01:39,39
When the two electrodes are connected, current
begins to flow.

22
00:01:39,40 --> 00:01:45,840
We call these connection points terminals, and we can connect multiple voltaic cells together by placing wires between their opposite electrodes.

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,820
When one or more voltaic cells are combined, their voltages add up, and together they form a battery.

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,580
Today’s batteries operate under the same
principle as the very first voltaic cell.

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,39
Now that we have a source for our current, we’ll also need a ground that’s connected to the wire.

26
00:01:59,40 --> 00:02:05,560
This is just a common conductor that ensures the current always has a path to a large reservoir of charge -- usually the Earth itself.

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,500
Next, once we can generate an electric current, we’ll need a way to describe how strongly the charge flows.

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,200
If you picture the cross section of a wire, you can measure how much charge flows through that cross section over a period of time.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,380
The amount of charge moving past this point, divided by the time period, gives us a value in Coulombs per second, which we call by the special unit, amperes.

30
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,320
So one Coulomb of charge passing through that cross section of wire over one second is equal to one ampere of current.

31
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,450
OK but wait.

32
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,530
Did you notice that we’re talking about
positive charge flowing through a wire?

33
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,660
How can that be?

34
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,560
After all, the current is made up of negatively
charged electrons moving through the wire.

35
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,549
Well, when American polymath Benjamin Franklin
did experiments with electricity in the 1700s,

36
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:49,490
he established what he thought to be the direction in which electricity flows, and he named it the “positive” direction of current.

37
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,590
It’s a convention we still use today.

38
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:58,310
It wasn’t until much later that we learned the direction Franklin chose was actually the opposite of how electrons move in a wire.

39
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:07,40
But as far as electric current is concerned, the flow of negatively charged electrons in one direction is equivalent to the flow of positively charged particles in the opposite direction.

40
00:03:07,40 --> 00:03:14,579
While this can be confusing, remember that when we talk about the flow of current, the convention is to say the current is in the direction that positive charge flows.

41
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:21,780
Now, if you’ve ever installed a battery in…anything…you also know that one terminal of a battery is called positive and the other one is negative.

42
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,760
And conventionally speaking, current flows
from the positive to the negative terminal.

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,399
But this means that electrons must flow from
the negative terminal of the battery to the positive.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,220
Picture the positive terminal as the start of our river, up in the mountains, and the negative terminal as the end of the river, draining out into the ocean.

45
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,960
In a river, the strength of the water’s flow depends on how far the river drops from a high point to a low point.

46
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,280
And the same is true for electric current
and voltage.

47
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,709
A high voltage typically corresponds to a
high current in a circuit.

48
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,590
But voltage alone doesn’t determine how
much current flows.

49
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,821
Just like rocks and branches obstruct the passage of water, the materials used to conduct electricity have properties that impede the perfect flow of electrons.

50
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,781
This property is known as resistance.

51
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:07,680
And resistance is described in Ohms, where one Ohm of resistance would let one Volt of potential generate one Ampere of current.

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,680
When resistance is constant, voltage is directly
proportional to current.

53
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,60
And this relationship is known as Ohm’s
Law.

54
00:04:14,70 --> 00:04:17,40
This law assumes that the resistance of a
material is constant.

55
00:04:17,40 --> 00:04:20,320
So we can express voltage simply as current
times resistance.

56
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,440
There are substances in which the resistance is not constant, and it changes with current or voltage.

57
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,480
But for many materials -- known as ohmic materials
-- Ohm’s law works quite well.

58
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,680
Now, in ohmic materials, we can use our new expression of Ohm’s Law to predict and calculate the behavior of a circuit.

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,500
Let’s say we have a 9 Volt battery, and we want to know how much current it supplies to a light bulb when we complete the circuit.

60
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:51,400
If we know the system has a total resistance of 15 Ohms, we can divide the battery’s voltage by the resistance, to find that it has a current of 0.6 amperes, or 600 milliamperes.

61
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,539
And whether it’s a light bulb, a speaker system, or a supercomputer, most electrical devices and materials contain some level of resistance.

62
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:06,380
Even wires in a circuit have some resistance, but compared to the resistance of a connected device like a light bulb, it’s so minuscule that we typically neglect it.

63
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,940
But you want to know a neat trick?

64
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,680
Well it doesn't matter because I'm going to tell you, anyway.

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,980
If you can make certain conductive materials
extremely cold, you can bring their resistance to zero.

66
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:23,20
We call these materials superconductors, and trust me when I say that research into these materials is a very important -- and lucrative -- field of study.

67
00:05:23,20 --> 00:05:30,719
Because, if you can reduce the resistance of a material, by getting rid of that natural loss of energy, you can significantly increase the amount of electricity you transmit.

68
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,900
And in all aspects of engineering, efficiency
is key.

69
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,280
Now, in that spirit, I should probably point out here that the whole point of batteries isn’t to just push electrons around.

70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
We need to put those electrons to work.

71
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,500
For example, when we attach a battery to a light bulb, we take the potential energy in the battery and turn it into what we need, light.

72
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,980
As current flows through the light bulb, the small piece of filament provides resistance, which transfers electric energy into thermal energy and light.

73
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,560
And since we’re dealing with energy transformed over time, what we really want to know is how much power is used by the bulb.

74
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,300
Power is the amount of energy transformed
by a device over time.

75
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,440
And by “transformed,” I mean the energy is converted from electric energy into some other useful kind of energy, like heat or light.

76
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,920
We’ve already learned how to calculate how much energy is in a certain amount of charge that’s moving between a difference in potential -- that is, the voltage.

77
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:26,920
And since charge transferred over time is just current, it follows that the power used by the bulb is equal to the current in the circuit times the voltage across the system.

78
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:33,620
And just like in our other calculations of power, our resulting units are in Watts, named for Scottish inventor James Watt.

79
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,180
This equation holds true for the power used by any electronic device, or the power supplied by a battery.

80
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:48,360
Now, anything that consumes power -- from a light bulb to a refrigerator to an entire house -- can be modeled in our equations as a resistor, because they create resistance.

81
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:58,200
And if you want to find the power that’s consumed by a resistor, you can substitute Ohm’s law into the power equation to discover some helpful relationships that hold true for all ohmic materials.

82
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,99
Let’s start with the fact that power is a function of current through, and voltage across, a resistor.

83
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,260
And Ohm’s law is about relating voltage,
current, and resistance together.

84
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,759
So, you can either replace the current in the equation, and get a new power equation in terms of voltage and resistance

85
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,99
…or you can replace the voltage, and get an expression in terms of only current and resistance.

86
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,280
This is especially useful when you don’t
have all the possible information about the circuit.

87
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,559
So that’s your introduction to electric
currents!

88
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,320
They really are just like flowing rivers!

89
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,80
And, once you understand the elegant math
behind them, they’re almost as beautiful.

90
00:07:29,80 --> 00:07:34,300
Today we learned about what defines electric current and how we generate it using voltaic cells that make up batteries.

91
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,40
We also learned about Ohm’s Law and the
relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.

92
00:07:39,40 --> 00:07:44,220
Finally, we discussed what power is and how we measure the power produced and consumed in a circuit.
