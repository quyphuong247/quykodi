1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,220
Ever been on one of those twirly carnival
rides?

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:11,039
You know, the ones where you get into a giant cylinder and stand against the wall, and then they spin you around like a wet salad?

3
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:17,160
If you've had that uniquely nauseating experience, then you know that the simple act of spinning in a circle can be ... intense.

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,170
It also happens to be one of the most
misunderstood concepts in Newtonian physics.

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,320
It’s known as uniform circular motion, and it’s what occurs when anything moves along a circular path in a consistent way.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,960
Most of the confusion about this idea has to do with the fact that things accelerate inward as they move in a circle --

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,340
a kind of acceleration known as centripetal acceleration. But you'll often hear people talking about

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,310
centrifugal acceleration pushing things
outward as they move in a circle.

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,719
That's actually where centrifuges get their name!
And centrifugal acceleration isn't wrong, exactly.

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,740
It's just ... not real.
So, to explain how things really accelerate

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,280
when they move in circles, let's talk about
the physics of that ride as it spins you around

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,960
-- assuming you're willing to risk stepping
inside. I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:08,819
[Theme Music]

14
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,159
In 1960, NASA was getting ready
to send people to space.

15
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,379
They knew that a big part of space flight
would involve acceleration,

16
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,500
so they wanted to test how much acceleration people could handle before they'd black out.

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,718
Because that’s what happens when too much blood is forced away from your brain for too long.

18
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:28,538
So engineers tested potential astronauts by putting them in a human centrifuge --

19
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,219
Basically, a superpowered version
of those rides at the fair.

20
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:37,079
They found that most people could withstand an acceleration of around 98 meters per second squared for 10 minutes --

21
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,340
That's about ten times the acceleration caused by gravity that you'd feel just by jumping in the air.

22
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:45,539
With that in mind, let's say we've been asked to calculate the safety of one of those carnival rides --

23
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,359
which means we'll need to figure
out how much acceleration riders would experience.

24
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,959
There are equations we can use to do that,
because just like with all the other kinds

25
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:57,928
of motion we've talked about so far, uniform
circular motion has four main qualities --

26
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:02,049
position, velocity, acceleration, and time.
And they're all related to each other.

27
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,649
When it comes to uniform circular motion,
position is the most obvious quality:

28
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:09,840
There’s an object, and it’s on a circular path.
But velocity is a little less intuitive.

29
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,939
At any given moment, velocity tells you how fast the object’s going, and in what direction.

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,800
And that direction … is NOT along the path of the circle.

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,880
It’s actually perpendicular to the radius of the circle -- along what we call a tangent.

32
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,259
So if you draw an arrow representing the velocity on the circle, it’ll only touch the circle in one spot.

33
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:30,679
OK bear with me here, as this
might seem kinda strange, but it’s true!

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,620
One of the nice things about the physics
of motion is that often,

35
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,860
you can just try it out for yourself and see what happens.

36
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,580
So here’s a quick way to see tangential velocity in action:

37
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,380
All you need is some string,
a key -- or some other small object to tie

38
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,419
the string to -- and a wide open space so
nobody gets hurt , by a key flying around.

39
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:50,359
Move the string so the key starts twirling
around in counterclockwise circles, parallel

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,220
to the ground. Then, when the key is at the
point in the circle that’s farthest away

41
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,719
from you… let go of the string. The key
flies to the left!

42
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,240
Here’s why: In earlier episodes, we’ve
talked about inertia and the idea that if

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,280
an object is in motion, it’ll remain in
that motion unless it’s acted upon by a

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,390
net external force.
Which means that something moving in a straight

45
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,609
line is going to continue moving in a straight
line unless a force -- one that isn’t balanced

46
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,070
out by other forces -- turns it.
Whenever you see something turning?

47
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,359
There’s a net external force acting on it.
That’s why, at any given moment, the velocity

48
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,509
of an object moving in a circle will be tangent
to it. Without a force to turn it, it just

49
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:28,179
flies in whatever direction it was moving
last. Once you let go of the string, you got

50
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,760
rid of the force that was making the key turn
in circles.

51
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:36,149
So it kept moving with the same velocity that
it had at the exact moment you let go -- perpendicular

52
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,340
to the string connecting it to your hand,
which was the center of the key’s circular

53
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,289
path. And now, we can finally talk about the
mysterious force that was accelerating the

54
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:48,609
key -- changing the direction of its velocity
so that it moved in a circle.

55
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,450
That force is the same reason riders on the
human centrifuge spin in a circle -- in fact,

56
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:58,280
it’s the reason anything moves in a circle.
That force is known as the centripetal force,

57
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,360
and the acceleration it causes is called centripetal
acceleration.

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,510
And the important thing to remember about
centripetal acceleration is that it’s always

59
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:07,599
directed toward the center of the circular
path.

60
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,000
That makes a lot of sense, if you think about
it in terms of how the velocity’s changing.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,319
The key was only turning in circles because
your hand was pulling it toward the center

62
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,810
of a circular path.
But now think about what it’s like to be

63
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,560
on one of those centrifuge rides -- or, if
you’ve never subjected yourself to one,

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,329
what it’s like to be in a car that turns
sharply. The ride -- or the car -- is turning

65
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,859
in a circle, so there must be centripetal
acceleration pushing you toward the middle

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,370
of that circle.
Except, it feels like you’re being pushed

67
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,860
outward. People often attribute this sensation
to centrifugal force. But that’s not real.

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,658
The reason that people confuse the centripetal
force with what feels like a centrifugal

69
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:46,728
force comes down to a change in perspective
-- what physicists call a frame of reference.

70
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:51,228
From the frame of reference of someone standing
outside the human centrifuge, it’s easy

71
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:55,060
to see what’s actually happening: As the
cylinder turns, it forces the people inside

72
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,079
it to move in a circle. And the wall is pressing
on them to keep them turning -- it’s actually

73
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,008
pushing them toward the center of the circle!
But the person inside the cylinder just sees

74
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:07,180
everything moving around with them.
From their frame of reference, it feels like

75
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,939
they’re just being squashed against the
wall -- as though there’s a centrifugal

76
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,479
force acting on them.
But there’s nothing there to actually create

77
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,310
that force. Which is why physicists call it
a fictitious force -- it doesn’t really exist.

78
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,519
So! Now that we know how acceleration works

79
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,188
when you’re moving in a circle, we can finally
come up with some ways to connect position,

80
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,659
velocity, and acceleration -- and figure out
if that centrifuge ride is safe for people.

81
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:33,139
But first, we have to talk about time. When
something’s moving around a circle in a

82
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:37,788
consistent way -- in other words, its acceleration
is constant -- it’ll take a certain amount

83
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:41,978
of time to return to its starting conditions.
In this case, those starting conditions are

84
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:46,800
a particular point along the circular path.
We call that time the period of the motion,

85
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,538
and the variable we use to represent it is
a capital T.

86
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:53,168
Which isn’t too hard to remember, as long
as you keep in mind that the period is an

87
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:58,120
amount of time. From timing the centrifuge
ride in action, we know that it takes 2 seconds

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,879
to spin around once. So we’d say that the
period of its motion is 2 seconds.

89
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,778
But sometimes it’s easier to talk about
the same idea in another way -- how many revolutions

90
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:11,969
does the ride make in one second? That’s
what we’d call the frequency of the motion

91
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,969
-- which we write as an f in equations.
That’s simple enough to figure out: if it

92
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:20,990
takes the ride 2 seconds to make one revolution,
then it’s making one half of a revolution

93
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,650
per second.It’s also not too difficult to
relate period and frequency with an equation:

94
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:29,739
frequency is just 1, divided by the period.
Now that we’ve gotten time out of the way,

95
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,218
let’s talk about position. We generally
talk about distance in terms of the circumference

96
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:37,248
of the circle, because that tells us how many
times you’ve gone around the circle.

97
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:41,759
In other words, if a centrifuge rider covers
the same distance as one circumference, we

98
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,699
know they’ve made one revolution. And circumference
is just 2 times pi times the radius of the

99
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:53,399
circle. So if that human centrifuge has a
radius of 5 meters, riders would travel 31.4 meters every revolution.

100
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,319
Now: What about their speed? Well, in our

101
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:59,068
episodes on motion in a straight line, we
talked about how average velocity is generally

102
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,379
equal to the change in position over the change
in time -- -- which turns out to be a great

103
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,180
way to describe the speed of uniform circular
motion.

104
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,538
When the rider’s made one revolution around
the circle, they’ve covered a distance equal

105
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:15,399
to 2 times pi times r -- or, in this case,
31.4 meters. That’s how far they’ve traveled.

106
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,348
And the amount of time it took was equal to
the period of the ride’s motion. That’s

107
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:21,408
their change in time.
Divide the distance they’ve traveled by

108
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:25,348
their change in time, and you get the speed
equation for uniform circular motion. Using

109
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:29,808
that equation, we can calculate the speed
of a rider on the centrifuge -- it’s 15.7

110
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:33,059
meters per second.
Next, getting the equation for the magnitude

111
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:37,729
of centripetal acceleration -- how strong
it is, basically -- is a little less straightforward.

112
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:42,308
That magnitude will be equal to the change
in velocity over the change in time at any given

113
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:46,729
moment -- in other words, its derivative.
Actually calculating the derivative can

114
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:51,868
get complicated, but it turns out to be equal
to the speed, squared, divided by the radius

115
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:54,689
of the circle.
This equation makes a lot of sense for a few

116
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,789
reasons: First, take a look at the units.
Acceleration is measured in meters per second

117
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:02,959
squared, so we already know that whatever
the equation for centripetal acceleration

118
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,098
is, the units have to work out to meters per
second squared.

119
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:10,459
And they do: square the speed, and you end
up with units of meters squared per second

120
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:14,838
squared. Just divide those units by meters,
and you get meters per second squared. You

121
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:19,019
can also tell from this equation that if you
increase your speed along the circular path

122
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,338
or decrease the radius of that path, you should
end up with a higher acceleration.

123
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:27,019
And that relationship between acceleration,
speed, and radius checks out in real life, too:

124
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,649
Try spinning the key on a string faster,
or shortening the string but spinning it at

125
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:36,059
the same speed. You’ll feel the key pulling
harder on your fingers, because it’s experiencing

126
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,129
more acceleration.
And now that we have an equation for the acceleration

127
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:42,860
that riders would experience on the centrifuge,
we can finally figure out if that ride is

128
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,800
safe. We already know that their speed would
be 15.7 meters per second, and that the radius

129
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,569
of the ride is 5 meters.
So, according to the equation for acceleration,

130
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,360
their acceleration would be 49.3 meters per
second squared. That’s about half the acceleration

131
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,430
that NASA found would make people black out.
So the ride is probably safe, at least for

132
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:05,569
a couple of minutes. Whether that much acceleration
would be pleasant is a different story -- but

133
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,660
hey, we’re just here to make sure the ride
is safe. We’re not responsible for cleaning

134
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:11,838
up the vomit once it’s over.
Today, you learned that when an object is

135
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,029
in uniform circular motion, its velocity is
tangent to the circle and its acceleration

136
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:20,439
is pointing inward. We also talked about the
difference between centripetal and centrifugal

137
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,250
forces, and derived equations for period,
frequency, velocity, and acceleration.
