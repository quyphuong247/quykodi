00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,330
When you think about it, you probably receive
hundreds -- even thousands -- of cues about

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,030
what’s going on in your environment every
day, strictly from sound.

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:14,609
In addition to things like speech and music,
there are other bits of auditory information

4
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:19,410
that shape your day: an ambulance passing
by, a baby crying in the next room,

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,820
and of course [cell-phone style text ding goes off]
--

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,820
-- sorry.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,820
Just got a text.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,179
But there’s a lot that we can learn, not
just from what these cues MEAN, but from how

9
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,629
Sound itself works.

10
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,000
Studying sound waves has helped doctors learn
more about our ears, and has allowed engineers

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,170
to design things like microphones and speakers.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,230
Biologists have even used the science of sound
to figure out how animals like elephants can

13
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:41,849
communicate over long distances -- when we
can’t even hear them doing it.

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,588
It all comes down to the fact that SOUND is
a wave, which travels through a medium like

15
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,588
air or water.

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:50,289
And knowing that sound is a wave is important,
because it means that we can use the physics

17
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:53,029
of waves to describe the qualities of sound.

18
00:00:53,029 --> 00:01:05,579
[Intro Music Plays]

19
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:08,989
When you think of a wave, you probably think
of the kind you see at the ocean, or the ones

20
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:11,250
you made when you jumped on that trampoline
last time.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,950
Those waves produce ripples that run perpendicular
to the direction, that the wave is traveling in.

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,200
But sound is the other kind of wave: it’s
a longitudinal wave, meaning that the wave’s

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,890
back-and-forth motion happens in the same direction in which the wave travels.

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,019
Say you get a text message on your phone,
and it makes a nice, bright little ‘ding!’ sound.

25
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:30,640
What actually happened? Like, on a physical level?

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,510
Your phone’s speaker contains a diaphragm
-- a piece of stiff material, usually in the

27
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,510
shape of a cone.

28
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,140
When you got the message, the electronics
inside the speaker made the diaphragm move

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,959
back and forth, which vibrated the air around
your phone.

30
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,059
That made the atoms and molecules in the air
move back and forth.

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,019
Then, those moving particles vibrated the
air around them -- and as the process continued,

32
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:52,179
the sound wave spread outward.

33
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,580
[ding!]

34
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,170
Sorry! I’m just gonna turn this off now.

35
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,680
Anyway, physicists sometimes describe sound
waves in terms of the movement of these particles

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,700
in the air -- in what’s known as a displacement
wave.

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,510
But by moving particles in the air, sound
waves also do something else:

38
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,700
They cause the air to compress and expand
-- which is why sound waves are sometimes

39
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,098
described as ‘pressure waves’.

40
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:16,429
As the wave spreads through the air, the particles
end up bunching together in some places, and

41
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,930
‘spreading out’ in others.

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,968
Together, all that bunching and spreading-out
causes areas of high pressure and low pressure

43
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:23,748
to form and move through the air.

44
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:27,908
It’s useful to describe sound waves as pressure
waves, because we can build devices that detect

45
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:29,060
those changes in pressure.

46
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,930
That’s how some microphones work, for example:
They use a diaphragm stretched over a sealed

47
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,560
compartment, and as sound waves pass by, they
create areas of lower or higher pressure in

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
the compartment.

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,729
The differences in pressure cause the diaphragm
to move back and forth, which electronics

50
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,560
then translate into audio data

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,170
And your eardrums basically work the same
way!

52
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:51,619
As pressure waves pass through, they make
your eardrum vibrate.

53
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,509
Your brain then interprets those vibrations
as sound.

54
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,578
But not all sounds are the same.

55
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,769
Even before we knew much about physics, humans
were describing sound in terms of certain qualities:

56
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,908
mainly, by things like ‘loudness’
and ‘pitch’.

57
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:06,938
Our understanding of those qualities helped
shape the development of music -- which we’ll

58
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,009
talk more about next time.

59
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:11,259
But there’s also a more physics-y side to
those qualities of music.

60
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:14,729
Pitch can be high or low, and it corresponds
to the ‘frequency’ of the wave.

61
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:19,068
So, air that’s vibrating back and forth
more times per second will have a higher pitch,

62
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:22,748
and air that’s vibrating fewer times per
second will have a lower pitch.

63
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:26,579
Humans hear sounds best when the vibrations
are somewhere between 20 per second on the

64
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,010
low end and 20,000 per second on the high
end.

65
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:34,289
As we get older and lose more of the cells
that help us detect sound, we start to lose

66
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,739
the ability to hear higher-pitched sounds.

67
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,590
Some building security companies will take
advantage of this, using devices that emit

68
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,120
a high-pitched noise that most people over
the age of 25 can’t hear.

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,269
The idea is that since kids and teens can
hear it, and it’s super annoying to them,

70
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,000
they won’t hang out near the building.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,680
But some sounds are too high or low for any
humans to hear.

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,162
Sounds that are too high in pitch are called
ultrasonic, and sounds that are too low are

73
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:00,340
called infrasonic.

74
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,319
Dog whistles, for example, use an ultrasonic
pitch that’s too high for us, but is perfectly

75
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:06,318
audible to dogs.

76
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,018
Elephants, on the other hand, use INFRAsonic
sound to communicate with each other across

77
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,209
long distances.

78
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,120
They can hear these calls from several kilometers
away, but we can’t hear them at all.

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,069
Another aspect that shapes sound is its loudness
-- when you increase the intensity of a sound,

80
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:21,959
you increase its loudness, and vice versa.

81
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,418
We’ve talked about the intensity of a wave
before: it’s the wave’s power over its

82
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:28,490
area, measured in Watts per square meter.

83
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,069
We’ve also said that the intensity of a
wave is proportional to the wave’s amplitude, squared.

84
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,379
And the farther you are from the source of
a wave, the lower its intensity -- by the

85
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,039
square of the distance between you and the
source.

86
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,878
And just as there’s a range of pitches that
humans can hear, there’s also a range of

87
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,129
sound wave intensity that humans can comfortably
hear.

88
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:50,120
Generally, people can safely hear sounds from
about 1 picowatt per square meter,

89
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,899
up to 1 Watt per square meter -- which is about as loud as a rock concert, if you’re near the speakers.

90
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,029
The sound waves coming from a jet plane that’s
30 meters away, for example, probably has

91
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,448
an intensity of around 100 Watts per square
meter.

92
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:04,449
Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever been
that close to a roaring jet plane.

93
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:09,209
But there’s a reason people who work on
the tarmac at airports use those heavy-duty headphones.

94
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,839
Below 1 picowatt per square meter, sounds
are just too soft for us to detect them.

95
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:17,839
And although we will HEAR sounds above a Watt
per square meter, they tend to hurt our ears.

96
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,649
But here’s a weird thing about loudness
and intensity: it’s not a linear relationship.

97
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:27,459
Generally, a sound wave needs to have ten
times the intensity to sound twice as loud to us.

98
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,359
This relationship holds true as long as the
sound is toward the middle of the range of

99
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,860
frequencies we can hear.

100
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,160
So, instead of directly measuring the loudness
of sounds by their intensity, we use units

101
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,430
called ‘decibels’ -- which are based on
bels.

102
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,850
Bels convert a sound wave’s intensity to
a ‘logarithmic scale’, where every notch

103
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,660
on the scale is ten times higher than the
previous one.

104
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,909
The scale starts off with an intensity of
1 picowatt per square meter, corresponding

105
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:52,408
to 0 bels.

106
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:56,529
So a sound that’s 1 bel is ten times as
intense as a sound that’s 0 bels.

107
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:01,378
And a sound that’s 2 bels is 10 times as
intense as a sound that’s 1 bel --

108
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,360
-- but 100 times as intense as a sound that’s
0 bels.

109
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,310
Measuring everything in bels can be kind of
annoying, because sometimes you want to talk

110
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,899
about sounds that are, say, 3.4 bels without
having to deal with decimal points.

111
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,439
That’s why most of the time, you’ll hear
the loudness of a sound described using the

112
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,579
more familiar decibel unit -- a tenth of a
bel.

113
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:24,180
To find the loudness of a sound when you know
its intensity, you take the base-10 logarithm

114
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,860
of its intensity, over the reference intensity
of 1 picowatt per square meter.

115
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,470
Then, you multiply that number by 10 to get
the sound’s decibel level.

116
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,599
We can use this equation to convert the intensity
of that noisy rock concert -- which we said

117
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:38,810
was 1 Watt per square meter -- to decibels.

118
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,290
First, we take the base 10 log of 1 Watt per
square meter, over 1 picowatt per square meter.

119
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,900
Now, 1 divided by 1 x 10^-12 is just 1 x 10^12.

120
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:56,029
So what we really want to do is take the base
10 log of 1 x 10^12 -- or a trillion -- watts

121
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,029
per square meter.

122
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:01,168
What a logarithm asks you to do, is find the
power that you would need to raise the base

123
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:03,299
to in order to get the number in parentheses.

124
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,978
In other words, we’re looking for the exponent
of 10 that would equal 1 x 10^12.

125
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,258
Which is just 12.

126
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,220
To finish off the calculation of decibels
from intensity, we multiply that value -- 12

127
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,980
-- by 10 to get the decibel level of the rock
concert, where you were standing: 120 decibels.

128
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,620
Ouch.

129
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,889
You’ll notice that as the source of a sound
moves closer to you, it gets louder, and as

130
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,908
it moves away, it gets softer.

131
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:31,360
That makes sense, since the closer you are
to the source of a sound, the greater the

132
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,319
intensity of the wave that hits your ear.

133
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,490
But have you ever noticed that the pitch of
the sound changes, too?

134
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,418
It’s called the ‘Doppler effect’: As
a source of sound moves toward you, the pitch

135
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,688
of the sound you hear increases.

136
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:45,528
And as the source moves away, the pitch decreases.

137
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,280
To see why, imagine you’re standing on the
sidewalk, when suddenly you hear an ambulance

138
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,559
siren start up.

139
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,829
It’s coming from down the road, and it seems
to be moving toward you.

140
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:58,769
The ambulance is continuously emitting sound
waves at a certain frequency, in the form

141
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,769
of that siren.

142
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:04,990
But as the ambulance moves toward you, the
ambulance is also driving toward those sound waves.

143
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,480
So, the peaks that hit your eardrums are closer
together -- even though they’re moving at

144
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,819
the same speed -- and you get hit by them
more often.

145
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,790
Which means you hear a higher-pitched sound.

146
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,530
At the same time, it keeps emitting more sound,
which adds more peaks to those earlier sound

147
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:20,878
waves that are heading your way.

148
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,439
What you end up with, is a sound wave with
a higher frequency than before.

149
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,468
That’s what hits your eardrum, so you hear
a sound that’s higher in pitch than the

150
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:30,879
one you heard before the ambulance started
moving.

151
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,719
As the ambulance passes you and starts to
drive away down the road, the opposite happens.

152
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,960
The sound waves are still coming toward you,
but the ambulance is driving away from them.

153
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,649
So the peaks that hit your eardrum are farther
apart, and you hear a sound with a lower pitch.

154
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,700
The Doppler effect isn’t unique to sound
waves, though -- it happens with light, too.

155
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,780
Which means we can actually use it to measure
the distance of stars -- but more on that much later.

156
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:56,759
For now, you learned about sound waves, and
how they move particles back and forth to

157
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,250
create differences in pressure.

158
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,539
We also talked about pitch, and how the intensity
of a sound wave changes with amplitude and distance.

159
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:07,088
Finally, we covered decibels, as well as the
Doppler effect.

160
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,670
Crash Course Physics is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

161
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:16,000
You can head over to their channel to check
out amazing shows like Gross Science,

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,278
PBS Idea Channel, and It's Okay to be Smart.

163
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,620
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

164
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,740
with the help of these amazing people and
our equally amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
