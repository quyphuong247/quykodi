1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,259
Every discipline of science has its very own
special language --

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,160
the way it communicates the ideas that it investigates.

3
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:13,830
For example, biology finds order in the world,
by giving every living thing a name, in Latin.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,449
Chemistry has a system of prefixes, suffixes,
and numerals to tell you, in a word or two,

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,050
the exact composition of an atom, or a compound.

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,900
But physics has to communicate its ideas differently.

7
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:25,928
The language of physics, is mathematics.

8
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:29,518
Because, if you’re trying to describe how
the world works, you really have to know how

9
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,009
things relate to each other in a
mathematical way.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,308
For example, we've been talking a lot about position, velocity, and acceleration, and how they're all connected.

11
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:42,028
Velocity is a measure of your change in position, and acceleration is a measure of your  change in velocity.

12
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:46,100
They’re connected -- one quality will describe
how the other is changing.

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,300
And the way we describe change in mathematics
is through calculus.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,640
Calculus explains how and why things change,
using derivatives,

15
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,409
which help you determine how an equation
is changing, as well as with integrals,

16
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:00,409
which you can use to calculate the area
under a curve.

17
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,920
Derivatives and integrals themselves are closely
connected. But let's start with derivatives.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,680
You probably won't be able to go straight
from this lesson to your calculus final.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,800
But hopefully, in about 10 minutes, you WILL be
able to understand some of the maths that

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,269
scientists have been using to think about
physics, for the last 400 years or so.

21
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:21,670
And you'll ALSO have a NEW way to fight speeding
tickets. You know, just in case.

22
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:31,109
[Theme Music]

23
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:34,879
Last time, we talked about that unfortunate
incident where you got a speeding ticket.

24
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,560
Your speedometer was broken, but because we
knew your acceleration, we were able to calculate

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,879
how fast you were going when the cops pulled
you over.

26
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,899
So now, let's talk about what happens next.

27
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,629
Say the police drive off. You're ready to
get back on the road, so you hit the gas and

28
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,149
zoom forward, moving faster and faster.

29
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:53,308
But in this scenario, we don't know your acceleration;

30
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:56,528
we only know how much your position is
changing over time.

31
00:01:56,528 --> 00:02:00,078
In this instance, your position happens
to be equal to the amount of time you’ve

32
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,528
been driving, squared. So we’d write that
as the equation x = t^2.

33
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:10,508
20 seconds in, you pass a detector with a
sign that tells you your speed. You keep driving,

34
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:14,228
foot still on the gas, before you realize
what number you saw on the sign.

35
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:22,349
And…OH NO! You JUST got a speeding ticket in the last episode, for doing 126 kmh in a 100 kmh zone,

36
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:25,139
and now the sign says you’re going even
FASTER!

37
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,619
Now you want to know if the number on the
detector is accurate -- in other words, you want

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,580
to find your velocity, at the exact moment
you passed it.

39
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,320
That velocity is just a measure of your
change in position -- its derivative.

40
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,299
So, to find your velocity, we’ll need to
find the derivative of your position.

41
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,909
And in order to determine THAT, we first need
to talk about limits.

42
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,259
Not speed limits -- I mean the derivatives
kind. (pause) I’ll explain...

43
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,840
Limits are based on the idea that if you have
a an equation on a graph, you can often predict

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,060
what it's going to look like at one point, just by knowing what it looks like at the surrounding points.

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,599
For example: let’s say you have a graph
of x = t^2 -- from our speeding scenario above

46
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,239
And you want to find out how your position is changing at the exact moment that time is equal to zero.

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,420
That's what we'd call the limit as t approaches
zero.

48
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:14,219
So you take a look at what's happening AROUND
t = 0.

49
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,520
At t = 1, x is 1.

50
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,939
At t = 0.5, x is 0.25.

51
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:24,199
And at t = 0.1, x is 0.01.

52
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,570
You can probably tell that as we get closer
and closer to t = 0, your value of x is getting

53
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:33,109
closer to zero, too. That’s what mathematicians
mean when they talk about a limit.

54
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,580
Limits are useful because they can help predict
what happens as you make intervals smaller.

55
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,680
An interval is just a range on a graph, it's
the space between two points on the horizontal axis.

56
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:47,789
So the first thing we can try is calculating
your AVERAGE velocity over the interval from

57
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:51,179
15 to 20 seconds.
To do that, we use an equation that we talked

58
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,680
about last time --
your average velocity, which is equal to the

59
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,599
change in your position --
divided by the change in time.

60
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,189
That turns out to be 35 ms.

61
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,909
Problem is, it’s still just an average -- it’s
not EXACTLY how fast you were going after

62
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,299
20 seconds of acceleration, when you passed
the detector.

63
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,069
Because of limits, we know that you could
get a little closer to the right number by

64
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:14,659
calculating your average over smaller and
smaller intervals. Then you’d see that the

65
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:18,250
number seemed to be getting closer and closer
to 40 meters per second.

66
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,939
Which means that you’re going to need to
slow wayyyy down if you don’t want to get

67
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:23,079
your SECOND speeding ticket of the day.

68
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,399
But that's the idea of derivatives: you can
use infinitely tiny intervals to figure out

69
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,319
exactly how an equation is changing at any
moment.

70
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,969
You can even come up with an equation to describe
the change. That's exactly what velocity is

71
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,430
-- an equation that describes change in position.

72
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,800
And acceleration describes change in velocity.

73
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,629
So we'd call velocity the derivative of position,
and acceleration the derivative of velocity.

74
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:48,689
Now, when it comes to how you can express
a derivative in writing, mathematicians have

75
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,120
come up with shortcuts.

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,840
Like what's known as the Power Rule.

77
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,319
As the name suggests, it’s used for equations
with variables raised to powers, or exponents

78
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,839
-- as long as the exponent is a number.

79
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:04,519
For example, x = t^2 would work with the power
rule, because t is raised to the power of 2.

80
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,059
The power rule says that for these kinds of
equations, to calculate the derivative, all

81
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,030
you need is one weird trick.

82
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:15,209
Take the number of that exponent -- in this
case, two -- and stick it in front of the

83
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:18,259
variable. Then you subtract 1 from the exponent.

84
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,469
And that's your derivative!

85
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:25,180
So the derivative of x = t^2 is just 2t. Which
means that no matter how many seconds you’ve

86
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,329
had your foot on the gas, your velocity will
be 2t -- so, double the number of seconds.

87
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:36,550
After 5 seconds, you were going a modest 10
ms. But after 20 seconds, you were going a

88
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,740
full 40 ms. Which is not good. We'd write
that like this, where dxdt is just a way of

89
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,740
saying that we're taking the derivative of
the part of the equation that involves t.

90
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,860
Or, as a mathematician would put it, we're
taking the derivative of x with respect to t.

91
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,300
You'll also sometimes see this written in
a different way:

92
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,710
If F of T is equal to T squared, then F prime
of T is equal to two T.

93
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,879
Now let’s try to find a couple more derivatives
using the power rule.

94
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:08,879
x = 7t^6 is another power-style equation:
it has a variable, t, raised to a power, 6,

95
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,759
with a number in front of it: 7. The first
thing we do is take the exponent, and stick

96
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,089
it in front of the variable.

97
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:19,739
But there's already a number in front of t
... 7. So we end up multiplying them: 7 times

98
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,980
6 is 42. Then we subtract 1 from the power
that t is raised to. So we end up with 42t^5.

99
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,879
Same goes for equations where the exponents
are fractions or decimals. So the derivative

100
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,740
of t^½ is half t to the negative one half.

101
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,660
It works for negative exponents, too -- the
derivative of t^-2 is just negative 2 t to

102
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,620
the negative third.

103
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,319
Now, there are a few more equations whose
derivatives you should understand.

104
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,459
Trigonometry -- which we use to calculate
the angles and sides of triangles -- is going

105
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,339
to come up a lot in physics, because we'll
be using right angle triangles all the time.

106
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:58,948
So it's a good idea to know how to find the
derivatives of sin(x) and cos(x).

107
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:04,220
Sine tells you that if you have a right angle triangle,
and x is an angle in that triangle, then sin(x)

108
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,979
will be the (length of the side opposite,
that angle), divided by the (hypotenuse).

109
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:12,969
Cosine does the same thing, just with the
(side next to the angle) divided by the (hypotenuse).

110
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,419
So their graphs tell you what those ratios
will be, depending on the angle.

111
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:20,459
We can actually try to guess the derivative
of sin(x) just by looking at its graph.

112
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,209
You can see that the curve has turning points
every so often, at x = -90 degrees, x = 90

113
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:29,638
degrees, and so on -- repeating every 180
degrees.

114
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,000
Meaning, at those points, the equations aren't
changing at all -- so the derivative at these

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,410
turning points is also going to be exactly
zero.

116
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,930
Let's pull up another graph where we'll plot
the derivative, and put little dots where

117
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,329
we know it'll be zero.

118
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:49,300
Now, what's happening between those turning
points? Well, from -270 to -90 degrees, sin(x)

119
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,939
is decreasing.

120
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,449
In other words, its change -- and therefore
its derivative -- must be negative.

121
00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:01,391
Then, from -90 to 90 degrees, sin(x) is increasing
-- so it'll have a positive derivative. And so on...

122
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,349
There are actually a lot more clues in this
graph to help us find the derivative, but

123
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,680
we already know enough to make a decent guess.

124
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,660
If we smoothly connect the dots on the graph
of our derivative, keeping in mind where the

125
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,250
curve should be positive and where it should
be negative … hey, this derivative is looking

126
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,800
a whole lot like the graph of cos(x)!

127
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,978
That’s because it is. The derivative of
sine is just cosine, and that is going to

128
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:24,079
come up a LOT.

129
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,430
So will these, which you can work out on your
own by repeating what we just did with the

130
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,400
graphs of sin(x) and cos(x).

131
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,468
Another important derivative that comes up
a lot is a very special case, and that’s

132
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,640
e^x The derivative of e^x is
just…. e^x.

133
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,419
Yep, that’s it. No matter what.

134
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:45,079
In fact, that’s one way to define e, which
is kind of like pi in the sense that it’s

135
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,750
a simple letter representing a very specific,
irrational number -- about 2.718, but with

136
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,399
more digits after the decimal point that go
on forever.

137
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,350
It has all sorts of uses in calculus, but
it also shows up when you’re studying things

138
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,070
like finance and probability.

139
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,190
Armed with all these ways to find derivatives,
you could take pretty much any equation of

140
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,270
your position and calculate its derivative
-- and therefore your velocity.

141
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:12,100
In the same way, you could take the derivative
of your velocity and find your acceleration.

142
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,009
But there's still a whole other part of calculus
that we haven't talked about yet -- integrals

143
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:18,909
-- which will let you do this backwards.

144
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:23,419
With integrals, you can use your acceleration to find your velocity, and your velocity to find your position.

145
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:24,860
But we'll save that for next time.

146
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,279
Today, you learned about limits, and that derivatives use them to describe how an equation is changing.

147
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,980
We also talked about a few different kinds of derivatives: powers, constants, trigonometry, and e^x.
