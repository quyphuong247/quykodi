1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,179
Have you ever thought about why we wear clothes?

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,639
There are people who don't wear clothes,
of course.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,439
But most of us do, and it’s not just because of modesty, or a fear of getting arrested for indecent exposure.

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,379
You might be perfectly comfortable in just a T-shirt and shorts, but take them off, and eventually you’ll probably start to feel cold.

5
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:23,439
Walk around your house naked for a while -- in the interest of physics, you understand -- and you’ll see what I mean.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,500
That chill you’ll start to feel is all because
of the flow of heat.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:38,840
[Theme Music]

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,879
In thermodynamics, there are a few different
ways to describe the kinetic energy of a system.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,580
We’ve already talked about one of them:

10
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,339
temperature -- the measure of the average kinetic energy of each individual molecule in a substance.

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,980
Another measure of the kinetic energy of a
system is internal energy, also known as thermal energy, represented by the letter U.

12
00:00:55,988 --> 00:01:00,528
Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of all
the molecules in a system added together --

13
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:05,000
as opposed to temperature, which was a measure
of the average kinetic energy for each molecule.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,420
So to find the thermal energy in a system, you just multiply the average kinetic energy by the number of molecules.

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:17,560
And last time, we learned that the equation for the average kinetic energy of an ideal gas was equal to 3/2 x (k) x the temperature.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:25,460
So the thermal energy of an ideal gas is equal to the number of molecules in the system multiplied by 3/2 x k x the temperature.

17
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:30,699
Now, the amount of thermal energy that’s added to, or removed from, a system is what we call heat.

18
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,320
If I asked you describe heat to someone who’d
never heard of it before, you might have some trouble.

19
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,759
It’s hard to define what heat is, exactly,
just based on our own perceptions.

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,820
For a long time, scientists described heat as a kind of fluid, since it flows from one system to another.

21
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:47,000
But these days, we know that heat isn’t
actually a fluid.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,900
It’s the ‘energy’ that’s transferred between systems, when they’re at different temperatures.

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,980
In equations, we represent heat using the
capital letter Q.

24
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,179
And in our daily lives, we often measure heat
in units called calories.

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,440
The units you see on nutrition labels are
actually kilocalories, or a thousand calories.

26
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,519
But in the official International System of
Units, we use Joules.

27
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:12,659
One calorie is defined as the amount of energy it takes to increase the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius -- or one Kelvin.

28
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,979
One calorie is equal to 4.186 Joules.
Simple enough.

29
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,280
So, the flow of heat changes the temperature
of a system.

30
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:23,269
But exactly how much it changes the temperature
depends on two things:

31
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,469
The first is the system’s mass.

32
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:28,888
The more mass a system has, the more heat
it takes to change its temperature.

33
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:34,000
More massive systems have more matter, after all, so it takes more energy to change its average kinetic energy.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,580
But a temperature change also depends on something
called the specific heat.

35
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,960
Specific heat is a measure of how well a substance stores heat.

36
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:44,609
Every substance has its own specific heat,
and the higher it is, the more energy transfer

37
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,390
-- in the form of heat -- it takes to change
its temperature.

38
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:52,599
Water, for example, has a very high specific
heat compared to, say, aluminum.

39
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,440
That means it takes much more heat to change
the temperature of water compared to aluminum.

40
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,120
In general, the amount of heat transferred
to or from a substance is equal to the mass

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,069
x the specific heat (which we designate
with a small c) x the change in temperature.

42
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:10,728
And if Q -- which represents heat -- is positive,
that means heat is flowing into the system.

43
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:13,000
If Q is negative, the heat is flowing out.

44
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:16,469
But there’s another factor that affects
the way heat flow relates to temperature.

45
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,879
And that is phase changes.

46
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:23,309
Let’s say you have a kilogram of ice at
-10 degrees Celsius and standard atmospheric pressure.

47
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,939
Then you start adding heat to it.
What happens?

48
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:28,358
Well, we know that the ice’s temperature
will start to increase.

49
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:33,479
But at a certain point -- when the temperature
hits 0 Celsius -- it’ll stop increasing.

50
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,979
Because the ice is melting.

51
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:40,639
Then, instead of raising the ice’s temperature, the heat you add goes toward changing its phase from solid to liquid.

52
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:47,059
And later, once it’s all melted, the temperature of the water increases again as you add more heat, until it gets to 100 degrees.

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,438
And at that point, again -- the temperature
stops changing.

54
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,539
This time, because the water’s boiling.

55
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:57,359
When all the water has been converted to steam, adding more heat will make the temperature rise once more.

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,580
So we don’t use that earlier equation to
describe the heat transfer while a substance’s phase is changing.

57
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,719
Instead, the amount of heat that gets transferred during a phase change is equal to the mass times what’s known as the latent heat.

58
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:15,180
Latent heat is the heat required to change the phase of a substance, and like specific heat, its value depends on the substance.

59
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,620
The value also depends on the phase change.

60
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,459
For a change from solid to liquid,
for example, it’s known as the heat of fusion.

61
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,120
And for a change from liquid to gas it’s
called the heat of vaporization.

62
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,310
So that’s how heat affects phase changes.

63
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,280
But what about how heat spreads?

64
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,719
That’s the real key to figuring out why
wearing clothes is so great.

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,509
There are three main ways for heat to spread:
conduction, convection, and radiation.

66
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:43,629
They each occur depending on the circumstances, and heat can often spread in two, or even all three different ways at the same time.

67
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:50,120
In conduction, heat flow depends on physical contact between molecules, which transfer their kinetic energy among each other.

68
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,600
It’s like when the spoon you use to stir
your tea gets warm.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,530
Heat is conducted from your hot tea to your
metal spoon.

70
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,489
And what determines how much heat will be
conducted over time?

71
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,310
Well, the bigger the temperature difference
between molecules,

72
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,540
and the bigger the cross-sectional area that the heat’s flowing through, the faster the heat flow.

73
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,699
But the farther apart the molecules are, the
slower it’ll flow.

74
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:15,159
Conductivity also depends on the material -- metal, for example, conducts heat much faster than wood.

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,720
In equations, we represent this inherent conductivity,
known as thermal conductivity, using the letter k.

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,720
The higher the value for k is, the higher the thermal conductivity of the material, and the faster heat flows.

77
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,280
And there’s an equation for heat conduction over time that puts together all of these different factors:

78
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,918
It says that heat flow over time between two
points -- that’s Q over t -- is equal to

79
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,520
k x the cross-sectional area x the temperature
difference between the two points,

80
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,439
all divided by the distance between them.

81
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,060
Another way that heat can spread is through
convection, which is kind of like conduction,

82
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:48,250
in the sense that it still depends on contact
between molecules.

83
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:54,680
But in convection, the molecules aren’t just bumping into each other because they happen to be nearby -- instead, they travel much farther.

84
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,379
It’s kind of like the molecules are being
stirred.

85
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:04,420
In convection, warmer molecules generally move away from the heat source and are replaced by cooler molecules which are then heated up.

86
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:10,420
In a tea kettle, for example, the water is heated from the bottom, so the water at the bottom warms up first.

87
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:16,140
That warmer water expands and rises, and is replaced by cooler water, which then also heats up.

88
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:23,279
But convection only happens because the heat source is positioned in a way that makes the warmer water move away from it -- it’s at the bottom of the kettle.

89
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,699
If the heat source were at the top of the kettle, the water at the top of the kettle would warm up first,

90
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,199
and it would basically stay put, so the colder water wouldn’t be able to take its place.

91
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,060
As a result, the warm and cold water wouldn’t get mixed around, so it wouldn’t be heated by convection.

92
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,478
Finally, there’s radiation, which doesn't
depend on the movement of molecules.

93
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,918
Instead, heat is transferred by electromagnetic
waves.

94
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,360
We normally consider the infrared part of
the spectrum to be heat.

95
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,050
And we can describe the way heat radiates
from an object over time with an equation,

96
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,970
just like we do for conduction, but this one
works a little differently.

97
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,879
The bigger the object’s area, the faster
it will radiate heat.

98
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,680
And the same is true for temperature.

99
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,939
Specifically, the amount of heat that an object radiates over time is proportional to its temperature raised to the fourth power.

100
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:10,180
Meaning, if you double an object’s temperature,
you multiply the heat it radiates over time by sixteen.

101
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:12,680
So temperature’s a big deal when it comes
to radiation.

102
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:20,259
But radiation also depends on what’s known as the emissivity constant, which is based on a material’s inherent ability to radiate heat.

103
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,339
The higher the emissivity constant, the more
it radiates.

104
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,239
The equation that combines all these variables
together to describe how much heat an object

105
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,360
radiates over time is called the Stefan-Boltzmann
equation.

106
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,220
And it says that heat emitted over time is equal to the emissivity constant x a special number known as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant

107
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,000
x the object’s area x temperature
raised to the fourth power.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,839
Now that we’ve gone through all the different
ways that heat transfers, we can finally answer

109
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,299
Why do we wear clothes?

110
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,030
Well, it’s simple: Otherwise, we’d lose
a lot of heat.

111
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,459
Your body loses heat in all kinds of ways.

112
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:58,339
One of the main ones is convection -- if your skin is warmer than the surrounding air, then you’ll transfer heat to the air.

113
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:06,259
And air moves around a lot, so pretty soon, the warmer air gets swept away and replaced by cooler air, and you lose more heat from heating up that replacement air.

114
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,539
Clothes help by trapping air against your skin.

115
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Sure, you lose heat as you warm up that air, but then the warm air stays close to your body, so you don’t lose too much more.

116
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,879
You can also lose heat through radiation.

117
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:22,879
If the walls, floor, and ceiling of the room you’re in are colder than you, you’ll radiate more heat to them than they’ll radiate to you.

118
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:31,158
Clothes don’t stop you from radiating heat, but they can keep you warm enough for the heat that your body produces to keep up with the heat you’re losing through radiation.

119
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:34,279
Just another good reason to stay dressed,
whenever possible.

120
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,750
Today, you learned about thermal energy, as
well as heat, and how much of it you need

121
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,210
for both temperature changes and phase changes.

122
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,350
We also talked about heat flow through conduction,
convection, and radiation.
