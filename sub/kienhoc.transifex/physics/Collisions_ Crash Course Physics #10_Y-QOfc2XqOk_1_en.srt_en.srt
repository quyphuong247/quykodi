1
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:06,699
You and I have explored the rules that govern
lots of different moving objects so far.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,400
But physics isn’t just about dragging blocks
up inclines, or astronauts floating in Vomit Comets.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,470
There are also ... collisions!

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,769
And physics has a lot to say about collisions
-- whether it’s two billiard balls knocking

5
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,660
against each other, or what happens when you
fail at a Super Mario level for the 47th time

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,179
and throw your controller at the floor.

7
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,280
Stupid lava sticks!

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,738
To figure out what’s happening when objects
collide, we’ll have to take into account

9
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,539
two main qualities: momentum and impulse.

10
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,539
We’ll also discuss what physicists mean
when they talk about center of mass, and why that’s important.

11
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,560
And we’ll have our old friend Isaac Newton
to help us out along the way.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:52,140
[Theme Music]

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,960
Remember Newton’s second law?

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,299
That’s the one that says the net force on
an object is equal to its mass, times its acceleration.

15
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,068
Except, that’s not actually what Newton
said.

16
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:06,349
He really said that an object’s so-called “quantity of motion” was equal to its mass, times its velocity.

17
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:10,308
And the net force is equal to the change in
that mass-times-velocity over time.

18
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:14,590
In other words, it’s the derivative of mass-times-velocity
with respect to time.

19
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:20,199
And if you were to calculate that derivative, you’d find that the net force is just equal to mass times acceleration.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,978
But putting Newton’s second law in terms
of mass and velocity introduces an aspect

21
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:26,319
of motion that we haven’t talked about yet.

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,898
Newton didn’t really give this aspect a
name, but we will: it’s called momentum,

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,260
and it’s one of those things that’s easier
to see in real life than to describe.

24
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,280
Momentum is often described as an object’s
tendency to remain in motion, but technically,

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,549
it’s an object’s mass times its velocity.

26
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:47,009
So, a big bag full of leaves rolling down
a hill? It might be going fast, but it doesn’t

27
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,629
have much mass, so it doesn’t have a lot
of momentum, and it wouldn’t be too hard to stop.

28
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:56,699
But the boulder chasing Indiana Jones? That
had a lot of mass -- and therefore lots of momentum.

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,179
So it would have been much harder
to stop.

30
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:02,929
And momentum is one factor that affects collisions
between objects.

31
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:06,890
After all, if a huge boulder crashes into
another huge boulder, that’s going to be

32
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,990
a very different sort of crash than if a bag
of leaves crashes into a boulder.

33
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,900
But the other quality of a collision that
we often consider is known as impulse, which

34
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,760
-- at least in the context of physics -- doesn’t
actually have anything to do with willpower,

35
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,049
or why you throw your game controller when
you get stuck on a level.

36
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,380
Instead, impulse -- usually represented by
a J -- is the integral of the net force on

37
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:30,989
an object over time -- in other words, its
change in momentum.

38
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,689
Impulse turns out to be a particularly useful
way to describe a crash --

39
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:38,139
because generally, in collisions,
forces change very quickly.

40
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,969
So, if a ball smacks into a wall, and over
the course of half a second, its force on

41
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:49,270
the wall in Newtons is equal to the time, multiplied by 25, we’d say that its impulse was 3.1 Newton-seconds.

42
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,909
Now, let’s consider the different kinds
of collisions that we can study.

43
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:56,620
Generally, collisions can be described
as either elastic or inelastic.

44
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,159
And it’s going to be important to figure out which kind you’re dealing with, because the math works in very different ways.

45
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,150
If elastic collisions sound bouncy, that’s
because they are.

46
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,289
Like the conservative systems we talked about last time, in elastic collisions, kinetic energy is neither created nor destroyed.

47
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:15,229
For example: let’s say you knock a white
billiard ball into a second, red one that’s

48
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,530
sitting on the table, and they hit each other
in just the right way.

49
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,180
For this to be a true elastic collision, all
of the kinetic energy from the white ball

50
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,150
would be transferred to the red ball.

51
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,740
Meaning, after they hit each other, the white
ball would stay put, and the red one would

52
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,960
zoom away with all of the kinetic energy -- so, the same speed, basically -- that the white ball used to have.

53
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:36,500
But you won’t come across elastic collisions
in real life.

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,030
Because: There’s always going to be some
energy that’s lost somewhere in a collision,

55
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,550
generally as heat or sound.

56
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,510
And when kinetic energy isn’t conserved,
that’s an inelastic collision.

57
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:49,519
There’s one thing that’s going to be true about every collision, though, whether or not it’s elastic:

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,460
The momentum of the system
will always be conserved.

59
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,760
It might be transferred to another object --
it might even be transferred to more than one object --

60
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:59,399
but the momentum is always
going to go somewhere,

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,939
And we’ll be able to use math to figure out where it went.

62
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,500
And we can use what we know about impulse
-- and Newton’s third law -- to prove it.

63
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,780
The third law, of course, is the one that
says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

64
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,379
And that applies to collisions in the sense that,
if a ball hits a wall, it’ll exert a force

65
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,379
on the wall, and the wall will exert an equally
strong force on the ball.

66
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:22,540
We can describe each of these forces as impulses,
since we know that an impulse is just

67
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
a change in an object’s momentum.

68
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,280
So, the ball’s momentum will be decreasing
when it hits the wall. But because of Newton’s

69
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:32,318
third law, we know that the wall’s momentum
is going to increase by an equal amount.

70
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,030
The change in the wall’s momentum might
be impossible for us to see, because the wall

71
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:40,369
is connected to the ground, and Earth has
lots of mass. But it’s there.

72
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,209
And that fact -- that momentum is always conserved -- turns out to be super helpful for describing collisions using math.

73
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,038
Like in the case where you knocked the white
billiard ball into the red one.

74
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,000
Since momentum is conserved, and momentum
is mass times velocity, the white ball’s

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,439
mass-times-velocity before the collision has
to be equal to its mass-times-velocity, plus

76
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,019
the red ball’s mass-times-velocity, after
the collision.

77
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,818
Which is why -- assuming the balls have the
same mass -- if the white ball stops moving

78
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:09,439
after the collision, then the red ball must
move with the same velocity that the white ball had.

79
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,490
So, now we know about both elastic and inelastic
collisions.

80
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,079
But there’s also such a thing as a perfectly
inelastic collision, because... of course there is.

81
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,779
And it’s easier for me to tell you, first,
what it isn’t.

82
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:25,359
So, it is not a collision where the objects
lose all of their kinetic energy.

83
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,240
Instead, a perfectly inelastic collision is
what happens when objects stick together.

84
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,718
These collisions lose as much kinetic energy
as possible to other forms of energy, like

85
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:39,589
heat, sound, or even potential energy ... but
still, their momentum is conserved.

86
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,748
An example would be if you pushed one magnet
toward another -- at just the right angle

87
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:48,009
for them to stick together on contact -- and
then they both started sliding together at

88
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,038
half the speed of the magnet you pushed.

89
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:53,418
Before the collision, the momentum of one
magnet was zero, and the momentum of the one

90
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,839
you pushed was its mass times its velocity.

91
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,948
Once the magnets collide, the mass is doubled,
and the velocity is cut in half.

92
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,939
So the total momentum stays the same, but you lose some kinetic energy because there’s less speed involved.

93
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:10,500
So that’s the basics of how collisions work, and how they relate to the momentum of motion in a straight line.

94
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,959
But there’s one more detail we have to explore in order to really understand how objects move,

95
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,899
whether they’re going to collide or
not.

96
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,620
And that is: center of mass.

97
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,740
Until now, we’ve been talking about objects
as though they were little point-particles.

98
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,960
And that’s worked fine -- for the most part, the objects we’ve been talking about would act much like a small dot would.

99
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,438
But of course, not all objects work that way.

100
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:33,840
If you’ve ever tried to fling a hammer,
for example -- which I do not recommend doing!

101
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,038
-- it wouldn’t fly through the air the same way a softball would, because the hammer’s mass isn’t distributed evenly.

102
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,879
Likewise, a pendulum with a big ball on the end of a very light string -- called simple pendulum --

103
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:49,079
would behave very differently from a pendulum that uses a heavier stick -- what’s known as a physical pendulum.

104
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,370
In these situations, it’s more useful to
describe what the center of mass is doing.

105
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,848
When you throw the hammer, for example, it’ll
rotate around its center of mass.

106
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,709
So, what is the center of mass?

107
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,028
It’s basically the average position of all
the mass in the system.

108
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:08,478
Say you have a 3 meter long stick -- which we’ll pretend is massless -- with a 2-kilogram ball stuck on either end.

109
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,800
It’s easy to see where the center of mass
should be -- the mass is distributed symmetrically,

110
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,449
so its center is going to be right in the
middle of the stick.

111
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:19,759
Now, let’s say you have another 3 meter
stick, and on the left side there’s a 2

112
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,379
kilogram ball, but on the right side, there’s
a 4 kilogram ball.

113
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,028
This time, there’s twice the mass on the
right side of the stick.

114
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:29,180
So when you’re trying to calculate the average
position of all the mass attached to the stick,

115
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,408
you’re going to be counting the right-hand
side twice as much.

116
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:35,949
That means the center of mass will be two
thirds of the way along the stick,

117
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:37,720
closer to the 4 kilogram ball.

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,220
It’s like each piece of mass pulls on the
center of mass a little bit, so parts with

119
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,490
more mass end up pulling harder and moving
it closer.

120
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,629
But if you don’t want to calculate this
in your head -- and if there are like seven

121
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:52,999
different particles to deal with, you probably
won’t -- but there’s an equation for it!

122
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:56,059
First, pick a starting point to measure from,
where x = 0.

123
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,040
That can be the end of the stick,
the middle of the stick, whatever’s easiest.

124
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
As long as you’re consistent.

125
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,900
Then, the center of mass will be equal to
the sum of each individual mass, times its

126
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:09,050
distance from the starting point, all divided
by the total mass in the system.

127
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,300
Let’s try it for our stick with the differently-weighted
balls.

128
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,340
We’ll choose the left side of the stick,
where the 2 kilogram ball is, as our starting point.

129
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:18,699
The 2 kilogram ball’s mass times its
position is zero.

130
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,259
The 4 kilogram ball’s mass times its position
-- 3 meters -- is 12 kilogram-meters.

131
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,920
And the total mass of the system is 6 kilograms.

132
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,218
So, divide 12 kilogram-meters by 6 kilograms,
and you get 2 meters.

133
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,889
That’s the position of the center of mass,
which is two thirds of the way along the stick,

134
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:36,668
toward the 4 kilogram ball’s side.
Exactly what we figured out earlier.

135
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:40,840
I’m telling you all of this now, because
from here, we’re heading off in a totally new direction.

136
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,080
Literally!

137
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,980
But for now, you learned about collisions, and how momentum and impulse can be used to describe them.

138
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,899
We also talked about the differences
between elastic and inelastic collisions,

139
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,549
and how to calculate the center of mass of
a system.
