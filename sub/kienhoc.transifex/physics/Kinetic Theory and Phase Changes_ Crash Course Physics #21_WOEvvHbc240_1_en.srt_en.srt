1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:11,099
On November 14, 1971, NASA’s Mariner 9 probe, entered orbit around Mars, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet.

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,399
Its mission? Mainly, to take lots of pictures
and map out the Martian surface.

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,490
But mission engineers found themselves facing
a challenge that they’d never faced before on Earth.

4
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:22,750
On our planet, we talk about altitude in terms
of sea level.

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:29,420
The highest point on Earth, for example, is at the top of Mount Everest, which is 8,850 meters above sea level.

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,140
But Mars doesn’t have a sea.

7
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:34,119
So the mission team had to pick something
else to use as a reference point.

8
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:41,839
They chose the point where Mars’s atmospheric pressure was 6.105 millibars -- the minimum pressure that liquid water needs to exist.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
That’s right -- at very low pressures, liquid water just isn’t a thing, no matter the temperature.

10
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,359
Why not?

11
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:53,519
The answer lies in phase changes: what happens when molecules don’t quite live up to what we’d predict for an ideal gas.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:06,320
[Theme Music]

13
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,079
We’ve talked before about temperature,
and how it’s a measure of the kinetic energy
-- the energy of motion -- of a substance.

14
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:18,799
And we know that as temperature increases, so does kinetic energy, because of the kinetic theory of gases, which describes how ideal gas molecules behave.

15
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,700
As you might remember from our last episode, a gas is considered ideal, if it fits a few basic assumptions:

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,359
First, that the total volume of the gas molecules
is much less than the volume of the container they’re in.

17
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,859
Second, that these molecules only interact
with each other when they collide.

18
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,200
And last, that the collisions are perfectly
elastic, meaning that no energy is lost.

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,480
The kinetic theory of gases is based on the idea that if you have all these gas molecules bouncing around, you can calculate the average kinetic energy of each particle.

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,280
We’ve already talked about how, in general, the kinetic energy of an object is equal to half of its mass x its velocity squared.

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,420
And the average kinetic energy of the ideal gas molecules in a container, is equal to half of a molecule’s mass x the average squared velocity of the molecules.

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:08,240
And if you do the math, this average kinetic energy also turns out to be equal to 3/2 x a set constant k x the temperature.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:17,159
k is just equal to the constant R we talked about last time, divided by Avogadro’s number, 6.02 x 10^23, the number of molecules in a mole.

24
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:24,639
This equation might not look like much, but it’s important because it tells you exactly how kinetic energy and temperature are related in an ideal gas

25
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,879
As the kinetic energy of the gas increases,
temperature increases proportionally.

26
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,818
We already knew that - but now we’ve done what we often have to do in physics which is back up our assumptions using math.

27
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:39,199
Now, you may have noticed something a little unusual about the way we’ve been representing the velocity of these ideal gas molecules.

28
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,439
We’ve been talking about their velocities
in terms of averages, which makes sense,

29
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,900
since we’re trying to describe the overall behavior
of all the molecules, not individual ones.

30
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,829
To get the average kinetic energy, we didn’t
just take the average velocity and square it.

31
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,560
Instead, we squared all the individual velocities, then used the average of those squared values.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,400
This whole average-squared-velocity thing, helps our math work out, and it’s important to remember when you’re analyzing an ideal gas.

33
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:06,109
The square root of the average squared velocity
is what we call the root mean square speed.

34
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,550
We write it as v_RMS, and it’s a different
number from the average speed.

35
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,879
Say you know that a gas’s temperature is 300 Kelvin, and the mass of each molecule is 5.3 x 10^-26 kilograms.

36
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:18,938
And you want to find the speed of a typical
molecule.

37
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,719
Well, we have an equation for that!

38
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,830
Half the mass x the average squared velocity
is equal to 3/2 x k x the temperature.

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,410
So, to get the typical speed of a gas molecule,
you’re going to want to find

40
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:36,139
the square root of the average squared velocity, which
is equal to the square root of 3 x k x the temperature divided by the mass.

41
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:39,059
In this case, that works out to 484 m/s.

42
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,099
But 484 m/s isn’t the average speed -- it’s
the root mean square speed.

43
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,719
So, how does the root mean square speed compare
to the actual speeds of the molecules in the gas?

44
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:56,960
Well, back in 1859, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell used statistical analysis to figure out the distribution of speeds in an ideal gas.

45
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,360
And it looks like this.

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,100
The top of the curve shows the speed that’s
close to the speed of the greatest number of molecules.

47
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,120
And the root mean square speed is slightly
to the right of that.

48
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,969
So the molecules in an ideal gas can actually
have a whole range of different speeds.

49
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,960
But most of them are pretty close to
the root mean square speed,

50
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,580
so it’s a useful way to get a picture of
how fast a gas’s molecules are moving.

51
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,740
Now, we’ve seen the smooth, even way pressure
and volume change with temperature in an ideal gas.

52
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,639
But gases aren’t always ideal.

53
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,079
When the pressure gets too high, or the temperature
too low, they start to act very strange.

54
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:31,939
High pressure is a problem, because it forces molecules together to the point where they start to interact.

55
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,600
Low temperature is an issue for similar reasons.

56
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,509
The molecules have less kinetic energy -- they’re
moving around less energetically --

57
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,319
so their attraction to each other starts to have an effect.

58
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:47,180
And, remember, we said that one of our assumptions about ideal gases was that they don't have forces acting between molecules.

59
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,180
They just bounce off of each other like ping
pong balls.

60
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,840
So, at higher pressures and lower temperatures, real gases tend to have a bit less volume than ideal gases would.

61
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,479
And at really high pressures and really low
temperatures, gases just start acting weird.

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,460
And then eventually they aren’t even gases
anymore.

63
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,799
At a certain point, the attraction between the molecules takes over and stops them from bouncing around so much.

64
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,300
They become slightly more ordered, and take
the form that we call a liquid.

65
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:18,439
Like when water vapor from the air condenses on the outside of your nice cool glass of orange juice, kind of making it look like it’s sweating.

66
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,939
Increase the pressure or lower the temperature even more, and the attraction between the molecules has even more of an effect.

67
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,788
The liquid freezes into a solid.

68
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:33,228
In the same way, lowering a solid’s pressure or raising its temperature will eventually make it melt into a liquid and then boil into a gas.

69
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:34,449
Well … usually.

70
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:35,999
Take a look at this diagram.

71
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:39,430
It shows the different phases of water depending
on its pressure and temperature.

72
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,290
The vertical axis shows pressure, so the higher
up you go in the diagram, the more pressure there is.

73
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,140
The horizontal axis shows temperature, so the farther you are to the right, the higher the temperature.

74
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:55,399
Below the diagonal line (so, at low pressures
and high temperatures) water takes the form of
water vapor: a gas.

75
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:58,868
To the left of the line that’s nearly vertical,
water is ice: a solid.

76
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:03,369
And at the pressures and temperatures represented
by the triangle in the middle, water is a liquid.

77
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:07,529
But you’ll notice that there’s a point
toward the top right labeled the critical point.

78
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:13,570
On a phase diagram, the critical point represents the maximum temperature and pressure where the substance can be a liquid.

79
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:19,000
For a gas to become a liquid, it has to be below a certain temperature known as the critical temperature.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,740
For water, the critical temperature is about
647 Kelvin.

81
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,400
Above the critical temperature, you can increase the pressure as much as you want, but the gas will never condense into a liquid.

82
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:33,228
There’s a critical pressure, too, which
for water is about 22 megapascals.

83
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:38,800
If the pressure is above the critical pressure, you can raise the temperature as much as you want, but the liquid will never boil.

84
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,249
Then there’s the point toward the bottom
left, where the two lines intersect.

85
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:46,250
That’s the triple point.
And that's what Mariner 9 used to map out Mars!

86
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,879
A triple point is the temperature and pressure at which a substance coexists as a solid, a liquid, and a gas.

87
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,879
It’s also what we use to define the Kelvin
temperature scale.

88
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:00,968
The triple point of water is 6.105 millibars
and exactly 273.16 Kelvin.

89
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:08,689
That pressure and temperature is special, because at thermal equilibrium, water can exist in three phases at once -- ice, liquid, and vapor.

90
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:14,980
Now, you’ll notice on the diagram that at pressures and temperatures below the triple point, there’s only the gas phase and the solid phase.

91
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,199
That’s because below its triple point, a
substance can’t actually take a liquid form.

92
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,679
Instead, it’s either a gas or a solid -- and
it transitions directly from one to the other,

93
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,800
a process that’s known as sublimation if it goes from solid to gas, and as deposition if it goes from gas to solid.

94
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,999
That’s why dry ice, which is made of carbon
dioxide, vaporizes directly to gas.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,379
The triple point of carbon dioxide is about 5 times atmospheric pressure, so liquid carbon dioxide can’t naturally exist on Earth.

96
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:47,399
The triple point of water is used to define
the Kelvin temperature scale because it’s consistent:

97
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,060
You just find the temperature
where you get three phases of water at once

98
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,980
-- which scientists have set to be 273.16
Kelvin by definition.

99
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:02,520
It also made a lot of sense for the Mariner 9 mission to use the pressure of the triple point of water as the reference point for its Martian maps.

100
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,899
One of our main goals in exploring Mars has always been to search for evidence of life, either now or in the past.

101
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,899
And as far as we know, life needs liquid water.

102
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:15,500
Since the reference point for Martian altitudes
was the triple point of water, liquid water

103
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,860
couldn't exist at altitudes above the reference
point, where the pressure would be too low.

104
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:23,869
That made it easy to see on a map all the
places where liquid water could be --

105
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:27,660
or have been -- and where life could possibly survive,
or have survived.

106
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:32,168
Today, you learned about the kinetic theory
of gases, and how to calculate the root mean square speed.

107
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:37,471
We also talked about phase changes, including the critical point, the triple point, and how that all applies on Mars.
