00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,099
If you watched our episode on Newton’s laws
of motion,

3
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,490
then you’re practically an expert on FORCES,
and the way they make things accelerate.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,609
But there’s something we left out --
something important when you’re trying to

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:18,929
describe how things move in real life:
FRICTION.

6
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,609
It stops a baseball player sliding into home plate.

7
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,769
And it’s the reason I can pick up this cup without it slipping through my fingers.

8
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,600
Without friction, it would be tough to do
… almost anything.

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,399
But it also makes doing OTHER things…pretty
hard.

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,859
Anyone who has moved furniture knows that.

11
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:39,829
Luckily, friction is also a force, so, as
physicists, we know what to do with it.

12
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:48,729
[Theme Music]

13
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:55,009
You’re moving into a new house, and you ask a friend to come help out, which he does, because he’s just nice like that.

14
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:59,210
And you really do need his help, because you’ll
have to move giant bookcases and a desk,

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,070
and you can’t do all of that on your own.

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,799
And about halfway through the move-in, you’re rearranging the furniture in your new bedroom

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,640
when you run into a problem:

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,180
You’re pushing and pushing on your bookcase,
but it just not sliding across the floor.

19
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,000
So you call your friend over from the other room, and with both of you pushing, the bookcase finally starts to slide.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,719
But it was really hard to get it moving -- and
stay moving -- because there’s a force working

21
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,379
against you - stopping the bookcase from sliding:
friction.

22
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,500
And there are actually two kinds of friction.

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,939
First, there’s KINETIC friction -- that’s
the force that slows the bookcase down as it slides.

24
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:36,819
And there’s also STATIC friction — the force you had to overcome to get it moving in the first place.

25
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,789
So let’s talk about kinetic friction first.

26
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,210
It’s a resistive force, which just means
that no matter what, it’ll act to resist you.

27
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:47,530
In other words, if you push the bookcase so
it slides to the left, then the force of kinetic

28
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,299
friction is acting to the right.

29
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:53,299
But if you move the bookcase to the right,
then the friction will resist to the left.

30
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:57,659
Kinetic friction will also often generate
heat or sound or both.

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,979
So, what causes it?

32
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:03,548
The bookcase and the wood floor might LOOK
smooth, but if you looked at their surfaces

33
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,840
under a microscope, you’d see that they’re
covered in tiny bumps and grooves.

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,259
As the bookcase slides across the floor, the
surfaces catch on each other,

35
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:15,858
and might even start to form weak intermolecular
bonds. That pulls on the bookcase, slowing it down.

36
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:21,099
But as the bookcase continues to slide, it breaks those bonds and moves past whatever bumps it was stuck on.

37
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,739
The newly-freed molecules start to spring back,
and the movement produces heat and sound.

38
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,480
Then the cycle continues with
the next patch of floor.

39
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,158
You end up with a force that resists any kind
of sliding movement, and its strength depends

40
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:36,078
partly on what materials are sliding against
each other.

41
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:40,308
Rougher materials have more surfaces to catch
on each other, which is why the bookcase will

42
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:44,008
be easier to slide on the wood floor than
if you’d tried it on carpet.

43
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:48,839
And the way in which this roughness affects kinetic friction is called the coefficient of kinetic friction,

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,979
and it’s different for pretty much every
combination of materials.

45
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,329
But there’s another factor at work in friction:

46
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:59,280
How hard the materials are pressed together puts more of their surfaces in contact with each other.

47
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:02,179
And that’s where the normal force, or F_N,
comes in.

48
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,799
You might remember from our last episode,
that when a force pushes a bookcase against

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
the floor, the floor pushes right back.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,020
That’s Newton’s third law, and we call the force from the floor on the bookcase the NORMAL FORCE.

51
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,600
In this case, the force from the bookcase
on the floor is just its weight, mg.

52
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,680
So the normal force would be equal to mg,
but pointing up -- equal and opposite.

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,359
So - Now we know about the two main factors
that affect the strength of kinetic friction:

54
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:33,899
the coefficient of kinetic friction -- written
as mu_k -- and the normal force, F_N.

55
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,439
It shouldn’t be too surprising, then, that
the equation for kinetic friction is just…

56
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,519
the coefficient times the normal force.

57
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,739
But that’s only half the picture.
What about static friction?

58
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,800
When you weren’t able to move the bookcase
to begin with, that was because of the static

59
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:48,929
friction between the bookcase and the floor.

60
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,049
Like kinetic friction, it’s also a resistive force.

61
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,929
But not only can its direction change
-- its strength can, too.

62
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:59,439
Say you push on the bookcase lightly, with
just one hand, and it doesn’t move.

63
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,280
Since it doesn’t have any acceleration,
the bookcase must be in equilibrium --

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,500
meaning that the forces on it balance out.

65
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:10,289
So the force from static friction must be
exactly equal to the force from your hand,

66
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:13,400
but in the opposite direction -- because of
that equilibrium.

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,560
It’s not the same as the normal force, and
it has nothing to do with Newton’s third law.

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,259
But say you really put your back into it,
pushing as hard as you can.

69
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:28,159
The bookcase still doesn’t move, so static friction must still be pushing back with the same amount of force you are.

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,220
However, the static friction between two objects
can change:

71
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,990
Once your friend starts pushing too, the bookcase
starts to slide, because the force from your

72
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,030
teamwork is greater than the maximum amount
of static friction -- which we write like this.

73
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:46,279
And the relationship between the maximum static
friction and the normal force is similar to

74
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,069
the relationship between kinetic friction
and the normal force.

75
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:54,089
There’s even a coefficient of static friction,
which measures the roughness between any two

76
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:57,179
objects -- and we just write it as mu_s.

77
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,199
And the maximum force of static friction is just equal to the coefficient of static friction times the normal force.

78
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:07,049
So now we know the equations for both
kinds of friction and where they come from.

79
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,699
Which means we can use that information to figure
out how to solve problems involving friction.

80
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,420
Just like with the other force-related
problems, we start with a free body diagram.

81
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,020
That helps sort out what’s pushing where,
so we can get an overview of the situation.

82
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,389
Next, we decide on some axes: where are x
and y? And which way is positive?

83
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:29,819
That’ll be useful when ramps come up, because
if we want, we can just decide that x points

84
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,430
down the ramp and y points straight into it.

85
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,160
The next thing we’ll need to do is separate
vectors into components along our new x and y axis

86
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,939
because strange things happen to the normal force when you have something (like that bookcase) sitting on a ramp.

87
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,939
The normal force is pointing out of the ramp,
because it’s perpendicular to the surface,

88
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:51,680
but it’s NOT equal and opposite to the force
of gravity, because THAT'S pointing straight down.

89
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:55,550
Instead, we’ll have to use trigonometry
to separate the force of gravity into two

90
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,850
perpendicular components: one pointing down
along the ramp, and one pointing into it.

91
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,400
Then, the normal force will just be equal
and opposite to the part of the gravitational

92
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,169
force that’s pointing into the ramp.

93
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,240
So, here’s how to separate and diagram everything
that’s going on:

94
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,720
The angle between the force of gravity and the
component pointing into the ramp is called theta.

95
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,200
And it’s the same as the incline
of the ramp.

96
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,279
Those make two sides of a right triangle.
And since the component pointing into the

97
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,979
ramp is adjacent to the angle, we know that it’s equal to
(mg) x (the cosine of that angle)

98
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,490
-- and so is the normal force.

99
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,110
The other component, pointing ALONGSIDE the
ramp, is OPPOSITE the angle.

100
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,730
So, again using trigonometry, we know that
it’s equal to (mg) x (the sine of the angle).

101
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,360
So! You’ve drawn your free-body diagram,
you’ve decided on axes, and separated the

102
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,259
force of gravity into two useful components.

103
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,849
Now, we can finally set up our equations!
That’s where Newton’s second law --

104
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,210
F(net) = ma -- comes in handy.

105
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,750
There’ll actually be two of these -- one
for the x direction, down the ramp, and one

106
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,569
for the y direction, into the ramp.

107
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,740
So let’s say you’ve got the bookcase where
it needs to go, and now you’re ready to

108
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,579
get something else out of the moving van -- this time, a 40-kilogram box with a very fragile vase inside it.

109
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:09,889
It’s heavy, so let’s say you put it down
on the ramp leading from the back of the truck

110
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:15,788
to the ground -- which happens to be angled at 30 degrees -- and then walk away to get a drink of water.

111
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:21,819
You also happen to know that the coefficient of static friction between the box and the ramp is 0.50.

112
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,529
What is the box’s acceleration?

113
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:28,139
If it’s zero, it’ll stay put and your
vase should be okay when you walk away from it.

114
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,079
If not, that means the box will start sliding down the ramp, and you may have a problem.

115
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,839
The first thing we need to do is draw a free-body diagram of this box.

116
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,399
For our coordinate system, we’ll have x along the ramp, with the positive side at the bottom,

117
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,719
and y perpendicular to the surface of the ramp,
with the positive side also toward the bottom.

118
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,600
And we have a whole bunch of forces here:

119
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,590
The normal force is pointing out of the ramp.

120
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:54,709
There’s also the force of static friction,
which, right now is pointing up the ramp -

121
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:58,699
since it’s resisting the part of the
gravitational force pulling the box down.

122
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:01,899
Speaking of which: the force of gravity is
pointing straight down --

123
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:06,560
NOT along either of our axes, so we
separate it into components:

124
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,459
(mg)(cos)(theta) pointing into the ramp, and
(mg)(sin)(theta) pointing down along the ramp.

125
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,209
Now we set up our net force equations along
each axis:

126
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,789
The box isn’t going anywhere along the y
axis -- nothing’s going to make it start

127
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,810
rising above the surface of the ramp, right?

128
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,339
So we know that all the forces acting along the y axis should add up to zero, since they’re all balanced out.

129
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,189
But the forces along the x axis, along the
ramp, are a different story.

130
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:36,779
If the box has no acceleration (it’s standing still, or moving at a constant velocity) they’ll also add up to zero.

131
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,759
But if it DOES have acceleration along the ramp, then the forces will add up to its mass, times that acceleration.

132
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,039
So, to figure out if the box slides, all we need to do is find out if the part of the gravitational force

133
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,919
pushing it down the ramp, (mg)(sin)(theta),
is greater than the maximum static friction resisting it.

134
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:58,438
In other words: if down the ramp is the positive
direction, is the net force positive or zero?

135
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:03,578
The forces here are the gravitational force
pushing the box down the ramp, (mg)(sin)(theta),

136
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:08,620
and the maximum static friction. But we write
the maximum static friction as negative, because

137
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,389
it’s pointing in the negative direction
on our x-axis -- up the ramp.

138
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,688
So, adding them together, we get this equation.

139
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:18,288
Multiplying together the different values
that make up (mg)(sin)(theta),

140
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:22,179
we find that it’s equal to 196.20 Newtons.

141
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,659
And the maximum static friction is just equal
to the coefficient of (static friction) x

142
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:33,588
(the normal force) -- so, plugging in the
numbers, we find that it’s 169.91 Newtons.

143
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,100
Which means that the net force is 26.29 Newtons.

144
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,820
So, yes, there’s a net force pushing the
box down the ramp, and it’s going to slide.

145
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:44,488
Which means I have some bad news for you about
that vase...

146
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:46,920
But today, you learned about the two types
of friction:

147
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,378
kinetic friction and static friction,
and how they act to resist applied forces.

148
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:55,308
We also talked about how to use friction to
describe an object’s motion,

149
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:59,068
including how to calculate the normal force
when that object’s on a ramp.

150
