2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,868
I think fluids are fascinating and awesome.

3
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:12,798
Because they happen to be my area of expertise
as an engineer, in fluid dynamics.

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,169
But it’s not just me who’s intrigued by
how things flow.

5
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:20,489
Legend has it that a man once ran naked through
the streets because he was so excited about

6
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,620
discovering an important property of fluids.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,400
Now, I’ve never quite gone that 
far...

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,910
But still, an understanding of fluids is incredibly
useful.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,839
Because anything that flows -- liquid or gas
-- is a fluid.

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,399
So, water counts, but so does air, and so
does corn syrup.

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,539
Using their knowledge of fluids, physicists and engineers can design things like

12
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:41,000
pressure sensors, hydraulic pumps, and even airplanes.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,420
But first, let’s start with the basics:
the physics of fluids, at rest.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:57,880
[Theme Music]

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,920
Until now, we’ve often described the physics
of objects based on their mass.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,340
But when it comes to fluids, we mostly use
a different quality:

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,680
density, represented in equations
by the greek letter rho.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,420
You’re probably familiar with density:

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,180
it’s mass, divided by volume, and measured in kilograms per meters cubed.

20
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,379
If an object -- or a fluid -- is made of heavier
atoms or molecules, or those particles are

21
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,708
packed more closely together, then it’s
going to have a higher density.

22
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:27,859
And there’s another important quality of fluids, one that scuba divers and mountain climbers think about a lot: pressure.

23
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:31,799
In our last episode, we defined pressure as
applied force, divided by area.

24
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,479
It’s measured in units of Newtons per meters
squared, known as Pascals.

25
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:37,819
And fluids apply pressure in EVERY direction.

26
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:42,409
So, right now, there’s air putting pressure
on you -- and me -- from every side.

27
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:48,349
In fact, the average air pressure at sea level
is 101 THOUSAND 325 Pascals.

28
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:51,588
And if you jumped in a pool, the water would
also exert pressure on you.

29
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:55,659
But if you’ve ever tried diving to the bottom
of a pool, you'll know that there’s more pressure

30
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:59,388
at the bottom than at the surface -- which
is why, at the bottom, your ears hurt

31
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,608
and your head feels like it’s about to implode.

32
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:06,359
That’s because the deeper you go, the more fluid there is above you, with its weight pressing down.

33
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,539
There’s an easy way to calculate the
pressure of a fluid at a given depth:

34
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,919
it’s just (the fluid’s density); (times small g); (times the distance to the surface), represented by the letter h -- for height.

35
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,379
And the change in pressure based on depth
is equal to

36
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:22,699
(the fluid’s density), (times small g),
(times the change in distance to the surface).

37
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:25,799
So, let’s say you’re swimming in a pool
that’s three meters deep, and you want to

38
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,920
know how much more pressure you’ll experience
at the bottom of the pool, versus how deep

39
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,239
you are now, which is, let’s assume...a
quarter of a meter.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,980
The density of water is 1000 kilograms per meters cubed, and the change in distance to the surface is 2.75 meters.

41
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:46,719
Which means that the pressure at the bottom of the pool is 27,000 Pascals more than the pressure, a quarter of a meter down.

42
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,080
The water in the pool could be one example
of a confined fluid, because if you had a

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,980
piston the size of the pool’s surface and used it to push down on the water, the water would have nowhere to go.

44
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:04,280
And back in the mid-1600s, French physicist Blaise Pascal realized something about the way pressure worked in confined fluids:

45
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,759
If you apply pressure to a confined fluid, the pressure in every part of the fluid increases by that amount.

46
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,120
If you have water in a cup, and you use a piston to apply 10,000 Pascals of pressure to the surface of the water,

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,920
then the pressure everywhere in the water increases by 10,000 Pascals.

48
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,259
Today, that concept is known as Pascal’s
Principle, and it’s the reason hydraulics are so useful.

49
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:27,340
Say you have some water in a tube, with pistons
on either side.

50
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,819
Pascal’s principle tells you that if you use the piston on the left side to apply pressure to the water,

51
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,060
the water will exert the same pressure on the piston on the right side of the tube.

52
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,280
And pressure is equal to (force) divided by
(area).

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,800
So, say you have another tube that’s more
of a cone shape, with a piston on the left side

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,439
that has an area of one meter squared, and
one on the right that has an area of 2 meters squared

55
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,149
Again, you apply 10,000 Pascals of pressure
to the piston on the left side --

56
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,319
meaning, 10,000 Newtons of force.

57
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,900
But the piston on the right side has double
the area.

58
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:00,039
So, for the pressures to be equal, the water
has to apply double the force to the piston

59
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,759
as you applied to the water, and so you end up with 20,000 Newtons of force on the right-side piston.

60
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,239
This is a huge deal! You’re doubling the input force, but you didn’t have to put in any extra effort!

61
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,219
And the bigger the difference in area, the
more extra force you get!

62
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,420
To put it in math terms: the ratio of the
output force to the input force is equal to

63
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,449
the ratio of the output area to the input
area.

64
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:27,180
Systems like hydraulic lifts take advantage of this, by having big differences in area on either side of a fluid.

65
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,019
So if you want to apply a lot of force -- to lift something heavy, for example -- hydraulics are the way to go.

66
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:36,680
Now, if you’re going to be using pressure to do stuff, you’re probably going to want to be able to measure that pressure.

67
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:38,860
Which is where manometers and barometers come
in.

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,550
A manometer is just a U-shaped tube with a
fluid inside.

69
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,848
Say you wanted to use one to measure the pressure
of a bike tire.

70
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:48,379
You’d stick one side of the tube in the tire, and leaving the other side open to the atmosphere.

71
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,369
If there’s a difference in the pressure
on each side of the manometer,

72
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:55,200
whichever side has the higher pressure will push the fluid away from it --

73
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:58,540
creating a difference in the height of the fluid on either side of the U.

74
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,718
In this case, the inside of the bike tire
has a much higher pressure than the atmosphere,

75
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:07,300
so the level of the fluid on the side of the
U that’s closer to the tire will be lower.

76
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,600
If you measured the difference in fluid height directly, you’d get what’s known as gauge pressure --

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,020
the difference between atmospheric
pressure and the pressure inside the tire.

78
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:20,399
But the actual pressure of the tire -- the absolute pressure -- is the atmospheric pressure, plus the gauge pressure.

79
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,959
So, the pressure inside the tire will be equal
to (the atmospheric pressure),

80
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:29,778
plus (the density of the fluid inside the manometer) (times small g) (times the difference in the heights of the fluid).

81
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:33,778
Barometers, on the other hand, use a long,
vertical tube that’s closed on one end,

82
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,139
usually filled with mercury and then stuck
upside-down in a bowl that’s also full of mercury,

83
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,228
with the closed end of the tube at
the top.

84
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:43,449
The pressure of the atmosphere pushes down
on the mercury in the bowl,

85
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,199
which keeps a certain amount of mercury in the tube.

86
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,378
At standard atmospheric pressure, the mercury
in the tube will be exactly 76 centimeters high.

87
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,240
If the air pressure goes up, so does the level
of the mercury, and vice versa.

88
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,259
So we have one more property to talk
about when it comes to fluids at rest --

89
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,639
and it's the one that supposedly made that guy run naked through the streets, yelling “Eureka!”

90
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,719
That guy was Archimedes, and he lived in Greece
in the third century BCE.

91
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,820
Legend has it that he was asked to find a way to figure out if the king’s crown was pure gold.

92
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,329
And the best way to do that was to calculate
its density.

93
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:18,000
Archimedes could measure the crown’s mass easily enough, but he didn’t know how to find its density.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,660
He was taking a bath one day when he realized that the volume of the water displaced by an object

95
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,760
is equal to that object’s volume.

96
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,719
And since he already knew the crown’s mass,
that meant he’d be able to find its volume,

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,200
and therefore its density, just by putting
it in water.

98
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,800
That’s when he did the whole running-through-the-streets-naked thing.

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,139
So Archimedes discovered that when you
put something in a fluid,

100
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,579
the fluid’s volume increases by the amount of the object's volume.

101
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,598
This tells us a lot about what makes objects
float or sink.

102
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:49,038
For example, say you have a tub of water and
two balls of the same size, but of different densities.

103
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,300
Say, one is an American-style billiard ball,
and the other’s a racquetball.

104
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,240
We’re going to gently place the balls in the middle of the tub, let go, and explain what happens to them.

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,139
But first, let’s talk about the forces acting on the water that’s occupying the space where we’re going to put them.

106
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,519
Picture a sphere of water within the volume
of water that’s in the tub.

107
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,959
What are the forces acting on that watery sphere?

108
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,188
Well, the force of gravity is pulling it down.

109
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:14,889
And, since the sphere is in static equilibrium,
there must be some force pushing up on it,

110
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:16,800
counteracting the force of gravity.

111
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:20,770
We call that force the buoyant force, and
it comes from the fact that the water pressure

112
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:23,698
at the bottom of the sphere is greater than
the pressure at the top.

113
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,669
Now, let’s put the billiard ball where the
sphere of water used to be.

114
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:28,609
What are the forces acting on that?

115
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,729
The force from gravity that’s pulling down
on the billiard ball is stronger than the

116
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:33,959
force that was pulling down on the sphere
of water.

117
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,959
That’s because the billiard ball is denser
than water -- so even though the ball and

118
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,019
the sphere of water have the same size, the
ball is much heavier.

119
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:44,528
But the buoyant force on the billiard ball
is exactly the same as it was on the sphere

120
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:47,829
of water, since they’re the same shape and
size.

121
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:52,620
That’s Archimedes’ principle: there’s a buoyant force pushing upward on objects in water,

122
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,199
and it’s equal to the weight of
the water that the object displaced.

123
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,169
The billiard ball weighs more than the
sphere of water that it’s replacing,

124
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,960
so there’s a net downward force on the ball, and it sinks to the bottom of the tub.

125
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,899
But if you were to fill in that sphere of water with a racquetball, the opposite would happen.

126
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,859
In that case, the force from gravity pulling
it downward is weaker than the force pulling

127
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:15,159
down the sphere of water, but the buoyant
force pushing upward is still the same.

128
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:19,598
So there’s a net force upward on the racquetball,
which is why it floats to the top of the tub.

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,220
Some of the racquetball will pop out of the
water, but some of it will stay underwater

130
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,660
-- in fact, once it stops moving, the racquetball will displace a volume of water that weighs exactly as much as the ball.

131
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,580
Because at that point, the buoyant force pushing
the racquetball upward and the force of gravity

132
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,040
pulling the racquetball downward have the
same magnitude, so they cancel each other out!

133
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,009
Thanks to Archimedes, we know why objects
float and sink.

134
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:44,970
Today, you learned about the properties of
fluids at rest, including density, and pressure.

135
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,710
We also talked about Pascal’s Principle,
and how it’s used in hydraulics.

136
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,830
Then, we covered how manometers and
barometers measure pressure.

137
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,080
Finally, we explained Archimedes’ Principle and the buoyant force.
