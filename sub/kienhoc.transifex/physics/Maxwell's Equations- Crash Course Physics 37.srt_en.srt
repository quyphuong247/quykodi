00:00:03,70 --> 00:00:07,720
By the 19th century, we were pretty sure there was something was going on between electricity and magnetism.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:16,900
First, in the early 1800s, Michael Faraday showed us how a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force, or emf, resulting in an electric current.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,959
He also found that electric fields sometimes act like magnetic fields, and developed equations to calculate the forces exerted by both.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,200
In the mid-1800s, Scottish physicist James Maxwell thought something interesting was going on there, too.

5
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,290
So he decided to assemble a set of equations
that held true for all electromagnetic interactions.

6
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,160
And he did a great job of it, compiling a set of equations as critical to physics as Newton’s laws of motion.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,220
And while he was coming up with his all-encompassing equations, Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves.

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:53,120
And these are the waves that help you view the world around you, talk to friends a thousand miles away, and heat up that midnight breakfast burrito you’ve been craving.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,820
So Maxwell and his equations are, to put it
simply, enlightening.

10
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:09,320
[Theme Music]

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:18,39
When James Maxwell created his dream team of electromagnetic equations, he started with the ideas – and the mathematics – that other physicists had already established.

12
00:01:18,40 --> 00:01:22,820
But he put them together, to create a new,
complete understanding of electromagnetism.

13
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:31,699
Maxwell’s first equation is a form of Gauss’s Law, which states that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface.

14
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:39,680
A “closed surface” in this case is just the surface of any shape that completely encloses a charge, like a sphere or any other three dimensional shape.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,000
And electric flux is a measure of the electric
field that passes through a given area.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,180
Mathematically, this equation says that electric flux is the integral of the electric field over the area of the surface, which is equal to the enclosed charge, divided by the permittivity of free space.

17
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:03,340
I won’t blame you if you don’t remember, but the permittivity of free space is a constant of proportionally we’ve used before, that relates electric charge to the physical effect of electric fields.

18
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,399
If the electric field is constant over the surface, then the left side of the equation becomes E times A.

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,240
Maxwell’s second equation is also a form of Gauss’s Law, only with magnetic flux instead of electric flux.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,260
Magnetic sources are always dipoles, with a north and south pole, and magnetic field lines that leave from the north pole and return back to the south.

21
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:31,160
When you’re looking at how a magnetic field interacts with a surrounding surface, you see that the field lines that leave the surface out of the north pole must enter back through the surface to reach the south pole.

22
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,220
This results in the overall magnetic flux
being zero.

23
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:41,380
If you compare this with Maxwell’s first equation, you can tell that the format – with the integral of the magnetic field over the surface area – is the same.

24
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,370
But here, the integral will always equal zero
for a closed surface.

25
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,490
Now, Maxwell’s third equation doesn’t
have anything to do with Gauss’s Law.

26
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,930
Instead, it’s Faraday’s Law, but slightly
different than how we’ve seen it before.

27
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,500
This is how we've seen it before.

28
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:01,200
If you remember, Faraday’s Law of Induction says that a changing magnetic field will induce an electromotive force in a loop of wire.

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,880
Maxwell’s version is more general, simplifying Faraday’s Law to show the value of that induced emf.

30
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,579
It says that the emf is equal to the line integral of the electric field over a closed loop.

31
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,980
So with this equation, you can see the connection between a changing magnetic flux and an induced electric field.

32
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,859
The fourth and final equation is one that Maxwell made the most tweaks to, in order to make it applicable to all electromagnetic phenomena.

33
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:30,860
Maxwell’s first and second equations were so similar – one for electric fields and one for magnetic fields – that he knew there must be an equation that complemented Faraday’s Law as well.

34
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,760
After all, if a changing magnetic flux produces an electric field, why is there not a complementary law saying the reverse?

35
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,700
Why couldn’t a changing electric flux result
in an induced magnetic field?

36
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,260
Here, Maxwell started with Ampère’s Law, which states that a current through a wire induces a magnetic field around a path surrounding the wire.

37
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:56,700
In order to make this equation work for all possible electromagnetic scenarios, Maxwell needed to consider a situation where a magnetic field is induced, but not from the flow of current.

38
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,859
For example, picture a charged capacitor that’s
connected to wires on both sides.

39
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:08,80
As the capacitor discharges, current runs through both wires, generating a changing magnetic flux, just like Ampere’s Law says.

40
00:04:08,80 --> 00:04:13,460
But a changing magnetic flux is also induced between the two plates when there’s no wire connecting the plates.

41
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,440
However, there is a changing electric field,
and it acts like a wireless current.

42
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,339
In order to account for the magnetic flux
generated by this “wireless current,”

43
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,60
Maxwell added what’s known as the displacement current into Ampère’s Law, to complete the equation.

44
00:04:26,60 --> 00:04:29,460
Despite being called the displacement current,
it isn’t really an electric current.

45
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,719
It’s just called that because it fits into
the equation just like an actual current does.

46
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,160
Mathematically, the displacement current is equal to the change in the capacitor’s charge over time.

47
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,580
And that is equal to the change in electric flux over time, multiplied by the permittivity of free space constant.

48
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,960
With the addition he made to Ampère’s Law,
Maxwell’s equations were complete!

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,239
And using his laws today, we can see a pattern
in the production of electric and magnetic fields.

50
00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:00,300
If a changing electric field is generated, then a magnetic field is induced, which results in a changing magnetic field that induces an electric field, and the cycle continues.

51
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,840
These oscillations are electromagnetic waves, and they’re made up of changing electric and magnetic fields that travel through space.

52
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,429
Maxwell believed that we could reproduce electromagnetic waves in the laboratory, and he was right!

53
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,440
To prove it, let’s look at an object that can produce electromagnetic waves and transmit them through the air: an antenna!

54
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,620
This antenna is made up of two conductive rods,
each attached to opposite ends of an AC generator.

55
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,200
When the antenna is operating, the two rods switch between being positively charged and negatively charged, as the generator changes voltage.

56
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,680
And when one rod is positively charged, the
other is negatively charged, and vice versa.

57
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:43,000
When electric current travels up into the top of the rod, you can use the right hand rule, pointing your right thumb in the direction of the current, to see that how the magnetic field flows around the antenna.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,460
The electric fields generated by the antenna itself are easier to track, since they’ll just go from the positive rod to the negative rod.

59
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,979
But as the direction of current switches, the direction of both the electric and magnetic fields change.

60
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,420
And as the rods switch their charges, the waves generated by the initial charge distribution continue to propagate away from the antenna.

61
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:08,20
So, if you were standing away from the antenna, you would be able to measure an electric field and magnetic field that are both constantly changing.

62
00:06:08,20 --> 00:06:09,419
Now, what would that look like?

63
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:16,000
To grasp the effect of changing fields in motion, let’s model an electromagnetic wave as it travels through three-dimensional space.

64
00:06:16,10 --> 00:06:20,200
First, note the direction that the wave is
traveling, in the x-direction.

65
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,700
Now plot the electric field, oscillating back
and forth in the y-direction.

66
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,400
The electric and magnetic fields always act perpendicular to one another, so the magnetic field will oscillate in the z-direction.

67
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,479
Note that the electric and magnetic fields
both peak at the same time, so they’re in phase.

68
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:44,000
These electromagnetic waves are a type of transverse wave, which means both fields, electric and magnetic, act in directions that are perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is moving.

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,760
And how fast do these waves travel?

70
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,960
Maxwell calculated that the speed of each wave is equal to the electric field’s magnitude divided by the magnetic field’s magnitude.

71
00:06:51,960 --> 00:07:02,380
This equation simplifies down to an equation with two constants, the permittivity of free space for electric fields, epsilon naught, and the permittivity of free space for magnetic fields, mu naught.

72
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,180
And this speed works out to 3.00 times 10^8
meters per second.

73
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:13,100
We write it simply as small c, and it’s the speed of
every electromagnetic wave, ever, at least in a vacuum.

74
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,980
You may know it better as the speed of light.

75
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,640
After all, light is an electromagnetic wave!

76
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,979
Every electromagnetic wave carries energy through space, and can reflect off some material, while passing through others.

77
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,220
But visible light is just one small part of
what’s known as the electromagnetic spectrum.

78
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,740
Like waves in the ocean, electromagnetic waves
can vary in their wavelength, amplitude, and source.

79
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,560
The wavelength is the distance between the
peaks of a wave.

80
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,440
And the frequency is how many times a wave
peaks in a given second.

81
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,100
You might remember when we talked about traveling waves that a wave’s speed is equal to its frequency times its wavelength.

82
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,160
And since the speed of light is constant, you can easily find the frequency if you know the wavelength, and vice versa.

83
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:57,720
Now, in order to calculate the energy carried by any electromagnetic wave, you need to know the magnitude of the electric and magnetic fields that compose that wave.

84
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:05,500
Specifically, you use these magnitudes to calculate what’s known as the energy density of each field, which is the amount of energy stored in a field per unit volume.

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,240
Then, you can combine the energy density for both fields, solving for the total energy per unit volume within the wave overall.

86
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,360
But since you know that strengths of the electric
and magnetic fields are directly related,

87
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,000
you can substitute the electric field magnitude
for the magnetic field magnitude, and vice versa.

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,800
This lets you come up with the energy density terms that encapsulate the energy in both fields, with fewer variables.

89
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,60
So, here’s the calculation of the speed of light that Maxwell found, and the constants that it simplified down to.

90
00:08:31,60 --> 00:08:38,940
You can take our energy density equation and substitute the magnetic field magnitude, B, with the electric field, times the square root of the permittivity constants.

91
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:46,180
With this simplified energy density equation, you can then substitute the electric field magnitude for the speed of light and the magnetic field magnitude.

92
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,20
These equations give the energy density of
an EM wave at any point during its propagation.

93
00:08:51,20 --> 00:08:58,120
One last important measurement of delivering energy is intensity, which is the energy transported by a wave per unit time, per unit area.

94
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:06,640
Mathematically, the energy delivered is equal to the energy density times the volume of space in which the energy is transported over a period of time.

95
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,490
You can then replace energy density with one
of the simplified equations we used earlier,

96
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,10
so the volume of space encompassed by the wave is equal to the unit area times the distance traveled.

97
00:09:16,10 --> 00:09:19,840
And the distance traveled will be the speed
of light multiplied by the time period.

98
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:29,860
After cancelling out like terms, you’re left with an equation that tells you how much energy you have per unit area based on the strength of the electric field, which you can also replace with the magnetic field magnitude.

99
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,360
A lot of math, I know.

100
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:41,400
But the vast knowledge of electromagnetism that we have today, and the doors it has opened into the fields of relativity and quantum theory, are all based on the theories that Maxwell and his predecessors developed.

101
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:53,959
Albert Einstein praised Maxwell specifically for his contributions, but it was the combined effort of revolutionary minds like Maxwell, Faraday, and Gauss that we have to thank for our understanding of the interaction between electric and magnetic fields.

102
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,740
Today we learned about Maxwell’s equations
and their unifying power in the field of electromagnetism.

103
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,80
We discussed electromagnetic waves and how changing electric and magnetic fields propagate through space.

104
00:10:04,80 --> 00:10:10,300
We investigated the different types of waves on the electromagnetic spectrum as well as how to calculate the amount of energy they can carry.
