1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,580
So far, we've spent a lot of time predicting
movement: where things are, where they're

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,419
going, and how quickly they're gonna get there.

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:12,620
But there's something missing -- something
that has a lot to do with Harry Styles.

4
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,359
And today, we're gonna address that.

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,780
We've been talking about what happens when
you do things like throw balls up in the air

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,620
or drive a car down a straight road.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,500
That kind of motion is pretty simple, because
there's only one axis involved.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,769
The car's accelerating either forward or backward.
The ball's moving up or down. There's no messy

9
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:29,699
second dimension to contend with.

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,250
But this is physics. We may simplify calculations
a lot of the time, but we still want to describe

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,880
the real world as best we can.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,320
And in real life, when you need more than
ONE DIRECTION, you turn to vectors.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:50,280
[Theme Music]

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,359
Let's say we have a pitching machine, like
you'd use for baseball practice.

15
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,879
We're going to be using it a lot in this episode,
so we might as well get familiar with how it works.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,219
We can feed the machine a bunch of baseballs
and have it spit them out at any speed we want,

17
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,439
up to 50 m/s. The pitching height is adjustable,

18
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:10,379
and we can rotate it vertically, so the ball
can be launched at any angle.

19
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,879
It also has a random setting, where the machine picks the speed, height, or angle of the ball, all on its own.

20
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:19,719
Suddenly we have WAY more options than just
throwing a ball straight up in the air.

21
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,539
And now the ball can have both horizontal
AND vertical qualities. At the same time.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,180
Before - we were able to use the constant
acceleration equations to describe vertical

23
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,759
or horizontal motion -- but we never used
it for both at once.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,600
And, we're not going to do that today either.

25
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:38,798
Instead, we're going to split the ball's motion
into two parts -- we'll talk about what's

26
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,500
happening horizontally and vertically, but
completely separately.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,849
And we'll do that with the help of vectors.

28
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:49,219
Vectors are kind-of-like ordinary numbers
-- which are also known as scalars -- because

29
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,840
they have a magnitude, which tells you how
big they are.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,000
But they have another characteristic, too:
direction.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,959
Previously, we might have said that a ball’s
velocity was 5 meters per second, and -- assuming

32
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,450
we’d picked DOWNWARD to be the positive
direction -- we’d know that the ball was

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,950
falling down, since its VELOCITY was positive.

34
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,229
In other words, we were taking DIRECTION
into account, but we could only describe that

35
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,780
direction using a positive or a negative.
So we were limited to two directions along one axis.

36
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,439
But vectors change all that. Now - instead
of just two directions, we can talk about ANY direction.

37
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,139
It might help to think of a vector like an
arrow on a treasure map. You could draw an

38
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:29,000
arrow that represents 5 kilometers on the
map -- that length would be the vector’s MAGNITUDE.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,719
But you need to point it in a particular direction
to tell people where to find the treasure.

40
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,370
Which is actually pretty much, how physicists
GRAPH vectors. You take your two usual axes,

41
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,189
aim in the vector’s direction, and then
draw an arrow, as long as its magnitude.

42
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:46,740
Like, say your pitching machine launches a
ball at a 30 degree angle from the horizontal,

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,319
with a starting velocity of 5 meters per second.

44
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,359
We can just draw that as a vector with a magnitude
of 5 and a direction of 30 degrees.

45
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,770
And let’s say your catcher didn’t catch
the ball properly and dropped it.

46
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,620
Then just before it hits the ground, its velocity
might’ve had a magnitude of 3 m/s and a

47
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,140
direction of 270 degrees, which we can draw
like this.

48
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:09,859
That’s why vectors are so useful: You can
describe any direction you want.

49
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,220
But there’s a problem, one you might have
already noticed: You can’t just add or multiply

50
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:18,409
these vectors the same way you would ordinary
numbers, because they AREN'T ordinary numbers.

51
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:21,019
To do that, we have to describe vectors differently.

52
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,939
When you draw a vector, it’s a lot like
the HYPOTENUSE of a right angle triangle.

53
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:29,590
The vector’s magnitude tells you the length
of that hypotenuse, and you can use its ANGLE

54
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,069
to draw the rest of the triangle.

55
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:35,128
Right angle triangles are cool like that: you only
need to know a couple of things about one,

56
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:38,979
like the length of a side and the degrees
in an angle, to draw the rest of it.

57
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,239
It’s all just trigonometry, connecting sides
and angles through sines and cosines.

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,200
Which is why you can also describe a vector
just by writing the lengths of those two other sides.

59
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,079
In fact, those sides are so good at describing
a vector that physicists call them its components.

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,820
So let’s go back to our pitching machine
example for a minute. We said that the VECTOR

61
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:03,400
for the ball’s starting velocity had a magnitude
of 5 and a direction of 30 degrees above the horizontal.

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,080
We can draw that out like this.
That’s all we need to do the trig.

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,420
The length of that horizontal side, or component,
must be 5cos30, which is 4.33.

64
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,090
The same math works for the vertical side,
just with sine instead of cosine -- so we

65
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:23,269
know that the length of the vertical side
is just 5sin30, which works out to be 2.5.

66
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:28,719
So our vector has a horizontal component of
4.33 and a vertical component of 2.5.

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,960
In what’s known as unit vector notation,
we’d describe this vector as v = 4.33i + 2.5j.

68
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,930
The arrow on top of the v tells you it’s
a vector, and the little hats on top of the

69
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,319
i and j, tell you that they’re the UNIT
vectors, and they denote the DIRECTION for each vector.

70
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,999
i just means it’s the direction of what we’d
normally call the x axis, and j is the y axis.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
You’ll sometimes see another
one, k, which represents the z axis.

72
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:00,688
And if we wanted to add or subtract two vectors,
that’s easy enough -- we just separate them

73
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:05,109
each into their component parts and add or
subtract each component separately.

74
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:17,948
So 2i + 3j added to 5i + 6j would just be 7i + 9j.
And -2i + 3j added to 5i - 6j would be 3i -3j.

75
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:21,680
Multiplying by a scalar isn’t a big deal
either -- you just multiply the number by

76
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,278
each component, so 2i + 3j times 3 would be
6i + 9j.

77
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:31,939
The unit vector notation itself, actually
takes advantage of this kind of multiplication

78
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:37,659
i, j, and k are called unit vectors because
they’re vectors that are exactly one unit

79
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:41,248
long, each pointing in the direction of a
different axis.

80
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:46,769
So when you write 2i, for example, you’re just saying: take the unit vector i and make it twice as long.

81
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:52,430
But it’s NOT the same as multiplying a vector
by another vector -- that’s a topic for another episode.

82
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,088
So now we know that a vector has two parts:
a magnitude and a direction, and that it often

83
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:59,418
helps to describe it in terms of its components.

84
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:03,948
And when you separate a vector into its components,
they really are completely separate.

85
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:09,300
In other words, changing a horizontal vector
won’t affect its vertical component, and vice versa.

86
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,490
And we can test this idea pretty easily.

87
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,340
Let’s say you have two baseballs, and you let go
of them at the same time from the same height.

88
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:19,859
But you toss Ball A in such a way that it
ends up with some starting vertical velocity.

89
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,840
With Ball B, it's just dropped.

90
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,639
In this case, Ball A will hit the ground first
because you gave it a head start.

91
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:30,110
Now, what happens if you repeat the experiment,
but this time you give Ball A some HORIZONTAL

92
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,729
velocity and just drop Ball B straight down?
Which ball hits the ground first?

93
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,788
It’s kind of a trick question, because they
actually land at the same time.

94
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:43,278
It doesn’t matter how much starting horizontal velocity you give Ball A -- it doesn’t reach the

95
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:49,218
ground any more quickly, because its horizontal motion vector has nothing to do with its vertical motion.

96
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:52,449
With this in mind, let’s go back to our
pitching machine, which we’ll set up so

97
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,338
it’s pitching balls horizontally, exactly
a meter above the ground.

98
00:06:56,338 --> 00:07:01,238
Then, we get out of the way and launch a ball,
assuming that “up” and “right” each are positive.

99
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,000
How do we figure out how long it takes to hit the ground?

100
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:08,199
That’s easy enough -- we just completely
ignore the horizontal component and use the

101
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,879
kinetic equations the same way we’ve been
using them.

102
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,959
In this case, the one we want is what we’ve been calling the displacement curve equation -- it’s this one.

103
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,799
We just add y subscripts to velocity and acceleration,
since we’re specifically talking about those

104
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,860
qualities in the vertical direction.

105
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,879
Now we can start plugging in numbers.

106
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,620
The ball’s displacement, on the left side
of the equation, is just -1 meter.

107
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,740
There’s no starting vertical velocity, since
the machine is pointing sideways.

108
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,759
And the vertical acceleration is
just the force of gravity.

109
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,560
Now all we have to do is solve for time, t, and we learn that the ball took 0.452 seconds to hit the ground.

110
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,519
Its horizontal motion didn’t
affect its vertical motion in any way.

111
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:52,829
But sometimes things get a little more complicated
-- like, what about those pitches we were

112
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:58,400
launching with a starting velocity of 5 meters
per second, but at an angle of 30 degrees?

113
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,500
Well, we can still talk about the ball’s
vertical and horizontal motion separately.

114
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,959
We just have to separate that velocity vector
into its components.

115
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:12,359
Just like we did earlier, we can use trigonometry
to get a starting horizontal velocity of 4.33 m/s

116
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,199
and a starting vertical velocity of 2.5
m/s.

117
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,459
Now we’re equipped to answer all kinds of
questions about the ball’s horizontal or vertical motion.

118
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,959
Here’s one: how long did it take for the
ball to reach its highest point?

119
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,560
We already know something important
about this mysterious maximum:

120
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
At that final point, the ball’s vertical
velocity had to be zero.

121
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,060
That’s because of something we’ve talked
about before: when you reverse directions,

122
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,239
your velocity has to hit zero, at least for
that one moment, before you head back the other way.

123
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,078
So, in this case, we know that the ball’s
starting vertical velocity was 2.5 m/s.

124
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:50,798
And we know that its final vertical velocity,
at that high point, was 0 m/s.

125
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,899
Finally, we know that its vertical acceleration
came from the force of gravity --

126
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:00,240
so it was -9.81 m/s^2, since up is positive.

127
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,198
And we’re looking for time, t.

128
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:06,838
Fortunately, you know that there’s a kinematic
equation that fits this scenario perfectly

129
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,180
-- the definition of acceleration.

130
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:16,258
By plugging in these numbers, we find that it took the ball 0.255 seconds to hit that maximum height.

131
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:21,139
So, describing motion in more than one dimension
isn’t really all that different, or complicated.

132
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,960
You just have to use the power of triangles.

133
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,540
In this episode, you learned about vectors,
how to resolve them into components,

134
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:33,939
and how to add and subtract those components.
We also talked about how to use the kinematic

135
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,480
equations, to describe motion in each dimension
separately.
