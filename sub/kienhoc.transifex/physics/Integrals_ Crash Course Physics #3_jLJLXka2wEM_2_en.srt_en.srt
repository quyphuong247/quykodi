1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,379
If you watched our last episode --
and really, if you haven’t, you should.

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:11,000
...you now know all about derivatives, and how to use them, to describe the way an equation is changing.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,439
Which means that now we can talk about the
other main part of calculus -- basically,

4
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,609
the inverse of derivatives, called integrals.

5
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:21,310
Integrals are useful because they also tell
you a lot about an equation: if you plotted

6
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:26,169
an equation on a graph, the integral is equal
to the area between the curve and the horizontal axis.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,880
Finding an integral is a little less straightforward
than finding a derivative, but, as with derivatives,

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,929
there are shortcuts we can use to make things
a little easier.

9
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:37,619
We’ll even be able to use integrals to talk
about how things move -- specifically, the

10
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,519
equation we’ve been calling the displacement
curve, and why it looks the way it does.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,900
So let’s get started.

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:52,399
[Theme Music]

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,539
Say you want to know how high your bedroom
window is above the ground outside below.

14
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,719
But you don’t have anything to measure it with --

15
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,498
just a ball, the stopwatch app on your phone, and your impressive knowledge of physics.

16
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:05,159
The force of gravity is what makes the ball fall,

17
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,439
so you know that its acceleration is small g
9.81 ms^2, downward.

18
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,340
But you’re trying to find its change in
position -- how FAR it falls.

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,960
We’ve spent a lot of time talking about
the connection between the qualities of motion:

20
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,159
position, velocity, and acceleration.

21
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,939
But so far, we’ve been describing that connection in a particular direction: velocity is the derivative of position

22
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,700
-- that is, a measure of its change --
and acceleration is the derivative of velocity.

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,000
To figure out how far the ball falls, you
need to use the reverse of that connection.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,540
Expressed mathematically, that means that
velocity is the integral of acceleration,

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,530
and position is the integral of velocity.

26
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,140
In other words: if you draw these equation
on a graph, velocity is equal to the area

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,719
under the acceleration curve, and position
is equal to the area under the velocity curve.

28
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,000
Finding that area is the tricky part.

29
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,849
There are simple ways to find the area of
pretty much any shape, as long as that shape

30
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,199
is made of nothing but straight lines and
corners.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,240
And when you think about it, a curve is just
a set of infinitely tiny lines.

32
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,139
So the area under a curve can be divided into
a set of infinitely tiny rectangles.

33
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,539
Integrals tell you what happens when you divide
the area under a curve into those infinitely

34
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,799
tiny rectangles, take the area of each of
them, and add up those areas.

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
So, how do you find that integral?

36
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,170
Well, you start by using the fact that integrals
are basically the OPPOSITE of derivatives.

37
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:28,869
If you know that your velocity is equal to twice time, for example, then you know that’s the derivative of the position.

38
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:36,500
So, to find the equation for your position,
you just have to look for an equation whose DERIVATIVE is 2t … like x = t^2, for example.

39
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,479
It’s kind of a roundabout way of doing things, compared to the neat equation we were able to use to find derivatives.

40
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,659
But there is no tidy equation that we can
use to calculate any integral we want.

41
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:53,000
But! As with derivatives, there ARE shortcuts
for finding certain, useful ones.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,340
For instance, you can take the power rule
that we used for derivatives, and run it backward.

43
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,000
Basically: you add one to the exponent, then
divide the variable by that number.

44
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:05,530
So the integral of 2t -- which is written like this -- becomes t^2.

45
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,640
In the same way, the integral of 42t^5 is 7t^6.

46
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,199
You can take the trigonometric derivatives
that we talked about, and do those backward, too.

47
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:21,799
The integral of cos(x) is sin(x), and
so on. And the integral of e^x is just e^x.

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,460
But there’s one complication that we haven’t talked about yet -- maybe you’ve already spotted it: constants.

49
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:34,560
A constant is basically just a number. It can LITERALLY be a number -- like 2, or a half, or negative 4.

50
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,379
Or it can be a placeholder for a number, like the small g, we’ve been using to represent the acceleration caused
by gravity.

51
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:46,280
And constants pose a problem when it comes to integrals because: the derivative of a constant is just 0.

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,628
A derivative is a rate of change, after all,
so a constant, which by definition DOESN'T

53
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:53,609
change, will always have a derivative of zero.

54
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,400
Which means that lots of different equations - an infinite number, in fact - can all have the same derivative.

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,408
Like, the derivative of t^2 is 2t. But you
can add ANY number -- or a letter representing

56
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:10,709
a number -- to it, and the derivative will
STILL be 2t. So the derivative of t^2 + 1

57
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,340
is also 2t. And the same is true for t^2 - 7.

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,120
Which means: If you’re looking for the INTERGRAL
of an equation like x = 2t, you have INFINITE

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,259
CHOICES, all of which are equally correct.

60
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:28,099
t^2 would work, but so would t^2 + 1 … or
t^2 - 7 … or t^2 + 0.256.

61
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,200
In these cases, we might know what the SHAPE
of the integral should look like on a graph

62
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,879
-- like, whether it’s a straight line, or how it curves -- but we don’t know where to put it along the vertical axis.

63
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,339
So we need to know what the constant is, in
order to know where to start drawing its integral.

64
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,540
Whatever the constant is equal to, that’s
where the curve will intersect with the vertical axis.

65
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:53,819
So t^2 would intersect at 0, but t^2 - 7
would intersect at -7. You get the idea.

66
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:57,550
Mathematicians had to figure out how to get
around the problem of having infinite integrals

67
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,350
to choose from, so they came up with a way to represent ALL of them: just add a C at the end of the integral.

68
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,140
That C stands for all of the constants that
we know we COULD put there.

69
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,259
So if we say that the integral of 2t is t^2+ C,

70
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,879
then we’re including t^2 + 1 and t^2
- 7 and all those other infinite options --

71
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,199
every equation whose derivative is 2t.

72
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,539
But sometimes you don’t need the C at all,
because you CAN figure out where your integral

73
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,870
is supposed to be on the y axis. Like if you
have what’s known as the initial value.

74
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,180
In the case of a position graph, for instance,
the initial value would be where you started out,

75
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,319
so you’d know to draw the rest of
the graph’s shape from there.

76
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,659
If you started at the 2 meter mark, say, and
moved one meter every second, you’d put

77
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,700
the graph here. But if you started at the
4 meter mark, you’d shift it up a little.

78
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:48,199
Basically, it gives you the point where your integral intersects the vertical axis -- which is the value of C.

79
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,479
Let’s try it, and at the same time, we might
as well figure out the height of your bedroom window.

80
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,720
You’re standing in your room, holding a
tennis ball out the window with your arm resting on the sill.

81
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,740
Now you drop the ball and start your
stopwatch app at the same time.

82
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,379
Turns out that the ball takes 1.7
seconds to hit the ground.

83
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:09,860
Like we said earlier, we know the ball’s acceleration -- 9.81 ms^2 -- and we know the time involved.

84
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,560
Somehow, we have to get from
there to the equation for the ball’s position.

85
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,379
So, first, let’s find its velocity -- the
middle step -- by taking the integral of its acceleration.

86
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:21,100
Take a look at this graph of the ball’s
acceleration over time.

87
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,340
It’s just a flat line, which means that it should be pretty easy to find the area between it and the horizontal axis.

88
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,640
It’s a rectangle! And the area of a rectangle
is just its base times its height.

89
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,379
In this case, the base is t, the amount of
time the ball took to fall.

90
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:36,659
And the height is a, the acceleration.

91
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,400
So, the area between the acceleration graph and the horizontal axis is just (a) times (t).

92
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,939
And the integral is (a) times (t), plus that constant
we add -- C.

93
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,000
For now, we need the C, because we know the
general shape of the velocity graph:

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,720
It’s a diagonal line slanted in such a way that every second, it rises by an amount equal to the acceleration.

95
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,760
But still we don’t know where to PUT that
line on the vertical axis. Not yet, anyway.

96
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,060
Now, we could have figured out the integral
of acceleration just as easily by using the power rule:

97
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,100
The acceleration, a, is a constant, but we
could also say that it’s (a) x (t^0) --

98
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,960
because anything raised to the power 0 is just 1.

99
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,330
So, according to the power rule, the integral
of acceleration -- which is the velocity -- would

100
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:20,859
be equal to the acceleration, multiplied by
time, plus C.

101
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,680
That’s the same answer we got earlier!

102
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,800
Now, here’s where the initial value comes
in. The velocity graph tells you what the

103
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,430
velocity is for each moment in time. But we
had to add the C, because we didn’t know

104
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,790
where to place it on the vertical axis -- when
time equals zero.

105
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,500
So, the integral of the acceleration COULD
have just been (acceleration) x (time), or

106
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,240
(a)(t). But it could also have been (at) +
4. Or (at) - 6.

107
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,680
So we put a C in the integral instead, to
represent all those options.

108
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,980
But we can get rid of that C if we can figure
out the velocity, when time equals zero --

109
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,259
what we’ve been calling v(0).

110
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:58,480
And if we write our equation with that v(0)
in it, as a placeholder for the velocity when

111
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,189
time equals zero, we end up with the the full
equation for velocity.

112
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:06,550
That should look familiar, because it’s one of our kinematic equations -- the definition of acceleration!

113
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,590
Neat how everything works out like that.

114
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:12,579
This equation tells us that the final velocity
of our falling tennis ball, when it hit the

115
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,699
ground, was 16.7 ms downward.

116
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,420
But we aren’t done yet. We’re looking
to link acceleration and POSITION,

117
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,640
so we’ll need to go one step further
by integrating again.

118
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,379
There are a couple of different ways we could
do it, but let’s just use the power rule again.

119
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,430
The integral of (a * t) is (half)(a t)(squared),

120
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,180
and the integral of v_0 is just v_0 * t.

121
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,000
Put ‘em together, and you end up with this,
which is starting to look a whole lot like

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,200
ANOTHER kinematic equation -- the one we’ve
been calling the displacement curve.

123
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,740
Now, what about that C?

124
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,659
Well, just like before with the starting velocity,
the starting position will tell us where to

125
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,829
stick this equation on the vertical axis.
So we’ll just make C equal to the starting

126
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,280
position, which we’ll write as x_0.

127
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,860
And that’s our integral -- the displacement
curve equation.

128
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,399
Which means that now, we have everything we
need to figure out, how high your window is.

129
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,029
The starting velocity is zero, because you
just dropped the ball without throwing it.

130
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:08,370
The acceleration is 9.81 ms^2. And it took
1.7 seconds to land.

131
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,299
And now you know everything there is to know
about calculus. (long pause) No you don’t.

132
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,709
As you can probably imagine, we’ve barely
scratched the surface here -- there’s a

133
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,889
reason it normally takes two semesters of
university, just to cover the basics.

134
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:22,939
And, you know some people spend their
whole lives studying this stuff.

135
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,760
But we’ve at least established enough background,
that when those things do come up in this

136
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,620
course, we’ll be able to use what we’ve
covered here, to talk about them.

137
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,600
Today, you learned that integrals are the area between an equation on a graph and the horizontal axis.

138
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,360
You also learned a few shortcuts to help find them, and how to find C using an initial value.
