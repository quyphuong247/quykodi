1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,140
Think of all of the developments throughout history that led to the conveniences you enjoy today.

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,599
If I had to pick the biggest game-changer in human technology, it would probably be the steam engine.

3
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:16,919
During the industrial revolution, the steam
engine powered machines in farms and factories.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,580
And, although it may not seem so, those advances eventually led to the technologies that you’re using to watch me, right now.

5
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,019
So, the steam engine was a pretty big deal.

6
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:32,119
Developing a practical steam engine involved a lot of time and a lot smart people, and about a hundred years, and three main inventors.

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:39,259
And it took a solid understanding of thermodynamic processes – and heat engines – to make this world-changing technology, a reality.

8
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:51,159

9
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:57,398
Heat engines, like steam engines, turn thermal energy into mechanical work, and they do it in a repeating cycle.

10
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,859
The process starts at a high operating temperature, which we label as T_H, and ends up at a lower operating temperature, T_L.

11
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:07,359
In the process, the engine takes the input
heat that was used to raise the temperature,

12
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,439
known as Q_H, and turns some of it into work, while also releasing some heat – Q_L – as exhaust.

13
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,959
Then the engine’s temperature is raised once more, so it can start the cycle all over again.

14
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:25,639
OK, now think back to the first law of thermodynamics, which says that the change in the thermal energy of a system is equal to heat and work.

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,420
In the case of a heat engine, the change in thermal energy is zero, because it always returns to the temperature it started from.

16
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,160
So, the engine’s input heat must be equal
to the work it does, plus the heat it releases.

17
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,670
Now let’s see how this plays out in a steam
engine.

18
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,950
There are a few different types of steam engine, but we’ll focus on the basic reciprocating type.

19
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,219
As long as you have something to "heat" the steam, like coal or oil, the engine keeps working.

20
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,840
That’s the input heat.

21
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:52,369
The input heat is used to heat a volume of
water, which turns to steam.

22
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,040
Then, an intake valve opens, allowing the
steam into the engine.

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,960
The steam expands and moves a piston outward
– that’s the work done by the engine.

24
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,469
Then the intake valve closes, and an exhaust
valve opens.

25
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:07,870
The exhaust valve leads to a condenser, which
cools the steam back into water.

26
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:14,620
The lower temperature also lowers the pressure, creating a partial vacuum that makes the piston move back into its original position.

27
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,960
Then the water gets heated back into steam,
and the cycle starts over.

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,879
As the engine runs, the motion of the piston can be translated into all kinds of different movement,

29
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,280
which is how steam engines can do things like
move trains and boats, and run factory lines.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,739
But as the steam engine runs, it releases
exhaust heat.

31
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,900
The more exhaust heat it produces, the less efficient the engine is, and the more energy you have to put in for the same amount of work.

32
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:40,959
Obviously, it’s important for engines to
be as efficient as possible to save energy.

33
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,158
And to design an efficient engine, engineers
have to be able to calculate its efficiency.

34
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,099
Like we said earlier, an engine’s input heat is equal to the work it does, plus its exhaust heat.

35
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,099
And the more work – and therefore, the less exhaust heat – you get out of the input heat, the more efficient your engine is.

36
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,759
So, efficiency is equal to the work done by
an engine divided by its input heat.

37
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,630
We can also put this just in terms of input
heat and exhaust heat – pretty easily, actually.

38
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:06,810
We know that work is equal to input heat minus
exhaust heat.

39
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,340
So efficiency is equal to input heat minus
exhaust heat, divided by the input heat.

40
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:16,209
Or, simplifying those terms: efficiency is
equal to 1 - exhaust heat / input heat.

41
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,670
If your engine produced no exhaust heat at all?

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,530
We’d say that its efficiency was exactly 1.

43
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,129
It would be perfectly efficient.

44
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,620
But there’s no such thing as an engine that
produces no exhaust heat at all.

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,219
It wouldn’t work, because the temperature needs to be lowered and then raised again for the engine to keep going.

46
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,900
But we can imagine an ideal engine, where none of the exhaust energy is waste heat – where there’s no friction or anything like that.

47
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:46,159
An ideal engine would also be reversible – meaning, you could run it backward, putting in work to transfer heat from something with a lower temperature to something with a higher temperature.

48
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,740
This kind of hypothetical engine is called a Carnot engine, and we can use it to figure out the maximum possible efficiency of a real-life engine.

49
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,420
Last time, we talked about the four types
of basic thermodynamic processes.

50
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,859
The Carnot engine combines two of those types
into what’s known as the Carnot cycle.

51
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,680
But in the Carnot cycle, those processes don’t transfer heat between areas with different temperatures.

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:15,659
Because, if an engine involves heat transfer from an area with a higher temperature to an area with a lower temperature, then reversing the engine would involve transferring heat from lower to higher.

53
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,219
Which would violate the second law of thermodynamics!

54
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,620
So, in the Carnot cycle, heat won’t flow between areas of different temperatures at all.

55
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,699
Instead, the cycle goes through two adiabatic processes, where heat is held constant, and two isothermal processes, where heat is transferred.

56
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,860
But the temperature is held constant, so the heat never flows between areas of different temperatures.

57
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,960
Now, you might be wondering how heat gets transferred, if there’s no difference in temperature.

58
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,579
Well, remember how we described isothermal
processes last time:

59
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:47,759
In those cases, there are only very tiny differences in temperature, and they’re immediately eliminated.

60
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,420
So, practically speaking, there is no transfer
of heat between areas of different temperatures.

61
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,020
And this means, the process can still be reversed.

62
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:01,959
With all that in mind, here’s how a Carnot engine works – at least in theory, because again: Carnot engines are totally hypothetical.

63
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,759
The first process in the cycle is isothermal.

64
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,599
The temperature is constant, but heat is slowly
added.

65
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,379
That makes the gas’s volume expand and its
pressure decrease – path a-b on this diagram.

66
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,709
The second process is adiabatic.

67
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:20,419
The temperature drops while the heat stays constant, which also makes the volume expand and the pressure decrease.

68
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,300
That’s path b-c on the diagram.

69
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,879
The third process is the opposite of the first
one, and it’s also isothermal.

70
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:33,379
The gas is compressed while the temperature is held constant, so it releases heat and its pressure increases while its volume decreases.

71
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,680
That’s path c-d.

72
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,400
The last process is the opposite of the second: it’s adiabatic, so the gas is compressed but its heat doesn’t change.

73
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,159
That makes the gas’s volume decrease and
its pressure increase, like in path d-a.

74
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,480
Its temperature goes back up to the starting
point.

75
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,259
The Carnot engine is the ideal engine, because it produces the most possible work from a given temperature difference.

76
00:05:54,259 --> 00:06:00,839
And because a Carnot engine is as efficient as possible, the high and low temperatures are proportional to the input and exhaust heat.

77
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,289
Which is important, math-wise, because it
means that in the equation for efficiency,

78
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:10,719
you can replace Q_H and Q_L – the input and exhaust heat – with T_H and T_L – the higher and lower operating temperatures.

79
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,620
Which can help if you don’t know an engine’s input and exhaust heats, but you know its operating temperatures.

80
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,379
So! The ideal efficiency for an engine is equal
to: 1 - its low temperature / its high temperature.

81
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,879
The colder that lower operating temperature is, the more efficient the ideal version of the engine is.

82
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,199
So, say you need an engine to power a life-size
Mario Kart that you’re building for yourself.

83
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,620
You find an engine online, and you’re thinking about buying it, but first you want to know how efficient it is.

84
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,439
The manufacturer’s website says that for every second, the engine’s input heat is 10 kilojoules at 500 Kelvin.

85
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,478
Its exhaust heat is 2 kilojoules at 300 Kelvin.

86
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:51,900
The efficiency equation says that the engine’s efficiency is equal to: 1 - its exhaust heat / its input heat – in this case, 0.8.

87
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,199
That would be a very efficient engine, so
you should be a little suspicious.

88
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,860
I mean, is that kind of efficiency even possible?

89
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,370
You can find out, by checking the ideal efficiency
of the engine – the Carnot efficiency.

90
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:11,980
The ideal efficiency is equal to: 1 - its lower operating temperature / its higher operating temperature, which in this case is equal to 0.4.

91
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:19,020
It’s impossible for this engine to have an efficiency higher than 0.4, so the manufacturer’s website is...well, just lying.

92
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,539
So you probably shouldn’t buy anything from them anyway.

93
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:28,060
And, actually, you probably wouldn’t want an engine that was close to the efficiency of a Carnot engine, because Carnot engines are very slow.

94
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,658
During those isothermal processes, the temperature
has to be kept constant while heat is transferred

95
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:36,079
– which only works if the heat is transferred
super slowly.

96
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,079
So the engine has to be really slow.

97
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,300
If you had a Carnot engine in your car, for example, it would take you a whole day to get out of your driveway.

98
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,759
Real-life heat engines are useful, because they use the flow of heat from something warmer to something cooler to produce work.

99
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,860
But what if you want heat to flow from something
cooler to something warmer?

100
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,939
That’s what things like air conditioners and refrigerators do, and they were originally developed using the principles scientists had learned from creating steam engines.

101
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:06,300
These cooling machines are a lot like the opposite of heat engines, in the sense that they use work to make heat flow in the opposite direction that it would normally go.

102
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,040
The refrigerator, for example, passes a cool
liquid through the inside of the fridge.

103
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,060
The liquid absorbs heat – that’s Q_L – as
it evaporates.

104
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,519
Then, the fridge uses a motor to do work on the now-warmer fluid, which has turned into a gas.

105
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:24,620
It’s passed through coils on the outside of the refrigerator, where it releases the exhaust heat – Q_H – and cools to become a liquid again.

106
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,978
Then the cycle starts over.

107
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,020
For heat engines, efficiency is measured by the work produced for a given amount of input heat.

108
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:39,240
And there’s a similar concept for refrigerators: the coefficient of performance, or COP, which is equal to the amount of heat removed from the lower-temperature zone divided by work.

109
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,899
The more heat the fridge removes for a given amount of work, the higher the coefficient of performance.

110
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:49,699
Like we did with the efficiency equation, we can rewrite the COP equation just in terms of Q_L and Q_H.

111
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,660
The coefficient of performance is equal to
Q_L divided by Q_H minus Q_L.

112
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:04,299
To find the coefficient of performance for an ideal refrigerator, we do the same thing we did with the ideal Carnot engine: replace Q_L with T_L and Q_H with T_H.

113
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:13,479
So, for an ideal fridge, the coefficient of performance would be equal to: the lower operating temperature, divided by the higher operating temperature minus the lower operating temperature.

114
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,639
And of course, a real-life refrigerator can’t have a higher coefficient of performance than an ideal refrigerator.

115
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,939
Now, it may not be surprising that steam engines
and refrigerators are total opposites.

116
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:30,639
But! Fridges and freezers and air conditioning are all game-changing inventions that were only made possible by our knowledge of steam engines.

117
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,559
Today, you learned about how engines turn thermal energy into work and how to calculate their efficiency.

118
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,410
We also described the Carnot engine.

119
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,799
And finally, we talked about cooling machines,
like refrigerators.
