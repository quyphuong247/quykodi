00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,019
The physics we’re going to talk about today
has SAVED your life.

2
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:08,980
Whenever you step into a building, or walk
across a bridge --

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,980
THIS is the science that keeps the building STANDING, the bridge STABLE, and you ALIVE.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,230
It’s STATICS -- the study of how objects
behave, when they are NOT accelerating.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,980
Whether that means they’re standing completely still, or moving at a CONSTANT velocity.

6
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,519
Statics can tell you a lot about the way things
behave, when you’re trying to balance them,

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,879
or when they’re being COMPRESSED or STRETCHED.

8
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:32,460
So engineers use statics for things like...figuring
out where a building’s supports should go,

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,840
and how MANY of them there should be...Or
what type of bridge design would work BEST

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,160
to cross that river in town.

11
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,399
You can use it, too -- say...the next time
you climb a ladder.

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,679
If you do, you’ll find that, even though an object may not be moving, there are still, all kinds of things affecting it.

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,859
Like stress, and strain
and pressure.

14
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:50,839
So who knows? Today’s episode may someday,
save your life!

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:01:03,200
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,139
Objects that aren’t accelerating are said
to be in EQUILIBRIUM, a concept that we’ve touched on before.

17
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:12,238
It means that there can be forces ON an
object, but there can’t be NET forces on it.

18
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,739
Otherwise, that net force m, would make
the object accelerate.

19
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:20,618
Torque affects equilibrium too, since an object
in equilibrium, can’t have rotational acceleration, either.

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,260
So again, there can be torques on an object in equilibrium, but there can’t be NET torques on it.

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,340
In other words, the net torques must be equal to zero.

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,859
All of this means that for an object to be in equilibrium, all the forces AND torques on it have to balance out.

23
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:39,019
A classic example of forces and torques cancelling
each other out, is a ladder leaning against a wall.

24
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:42,638
The ladder isn’t accelerating -- or even
moving -- so it must be in equilibrium.

25
00:01:42,638 --> 00:01:46,098
But, how much force is there on the ladder,
from both the wall and the floor?

26
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,498
That's pretty easy to figure out!

27
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:51,068
Let’s say we know that the bottom of the
ladder is 3m from the wall, the top of the

28
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:57,539
ladder is 4m from the floor, the ladder itself
is 5m long, and it has a mass of 10kg.

29
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,079
The first thing we gotta do is draw a free-body
diagram.

30
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,879
First, the force of gravity, mg, is pulling
down, on the center of the ladder.

31
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:08,439
And the force from the wall has only one component
-- it’s pushing sideways on the ladder.

32
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,400
Meanwhile, the force from the floor has
two components:

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,099
one pushing UP on the ladder,
equal and opposite to the force of gravity

34
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,739
and one pushing on the ladder toward the wall, equal and opposite to the force FROM the wall.

35
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,860
Let’s talk about the force from the wall
first.

36
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,660
We don’t know how strong it is. But we can figure that out, by thinking about the torques acting on the ladder.

37
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:31,158
The ladder isn’t rotating, so any torques
on it have to add up to zero.

38
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,620
And we know from our previous lessons that torque is caused by a force applied at a distance from an axis.

39
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,219
So, if we choose the point where the ladder
touches the floor as our axis,

40
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,718
we can see that there are two forces
applying a torque to the ladder.

41
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:46,359
In this case, the ladder is leaning to the
RIGHT to meet the wall, so the force of gravity

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,989
is applying a clockwise torque.

43
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:51,090
And the force from the wall is applying a
counterclockwise torque.

44
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,579
And we know that both of those torques equal each other, because the net torque on the ladder is zero.

45
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:59,610
The torque from gravity is equal to the ladder’s
weight, times the perpendicular distance from

46
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,150
our axis to the center of the ladder -- and
that’s 147 Newton meters.

47
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,590
Meaning that the torque from the WALL is also
147 Newton meters, in the opposite direction.

48
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,979
Divide that by the vertical distance from where the ladder hits the wall to our axis of rotation,

49
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,639
and we get 36.8 Newtons: the
force from the wall on the ladder.

50
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,318
That’s half of the problem done!

51
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,908
But what about the force on the ladder from
the floor?

52
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:27,539
Like we said, there are two components of
the force from the floor: horizontal and vertical.

53
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:33,139
The horizontal component will be equal to
the force from the wall -- so, 36.8 Newtons.

54
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:37,298
And the vertical component will be equal to
the ladder’s weight -- so, 98 Newtons.

55
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,308
We’ve already talked about how to find the
total magnitude of a force from its components

56
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:45,788
-- you square the components, add the results,
then take the square root of that number.

57
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:49,739
Meaning that the total force from the floor
on the ladder is 105 Newtons.

58
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:56,149
So, once you know that an object’s in equilibrium,
you can use that fact to find the forces and torques acting on it.

59
00:03:56,149 --> 00:04:00,799
That’s important, because those forces can
affect the object’s shape -- and maybe even break it.

60
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,799
That’s why one of the main questions that
engineers consider is:

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,840
When I apply a force to this thing, what will
happen to it?

62
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,000
And generally, whatever happens will be one
of three main things:

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,400
First, you can apply just enough force that
the object will either stretch or compress,

64
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:19,920
but still spring back -- in that case, the
force is in a range known as the material’s elastic zone.

65
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,420
But if you apply a little too much force,
the object might become permanently deformed

66
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,610
-- meaning, the force has reached what’s
called the plastic zone.

67
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,060
And apply WAY too much force, and you’ll get to the breaking point -- otherwise known as fracture.

68
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,800
Ideally, engineers want to make sure that the objects they use to build things, like support beams,

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,100
stay within the range of Option
Number One: the elastic zone.

70
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,520
Often, they’ll also want to know how an object’s shape changes based on the amount of force that’s being applied to it.

71
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,539
And the amount that an object stretches or
compresses depends on a few different factors:

72
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,740
First, there’s the original length of the object. The longer it is, the more it will stretch or compress.

73
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,710
The strength of the applied force also matters.
More force means more stretching or compressing.

74
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:03,629
Then there’s the area of a cross-section
of this object.

75
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,279
Basically, the thicker it is, the less it will STRETCH or compress.

76
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,450
Finally, there’s the type of material itself.
Wood, steel, aluminum, granite --

77
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,139
they’re all going to have different amounts of elasticity.

78
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,959
That’s why engineers use something called Young’s modulus.

79
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,319
It’s a number, represented by a capital E,

80
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,959
that tells you how hard it is to stretch or compress a given material, based on that material’s stiffness.

81
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,859
The higher Young’s modulus is, for a certain
material, the less ELASTIC it is.

82
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,580
And all of these factors combine into one
equation.

83
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,810
It might look kind of messy, but this equation
is just saying that the change in length of

84
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,209
something that’s being stretched or compressed
depends on:

85
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:45,659
its original length, the force you apply,
its cross-sectional area, and Young’s modulus.

86
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,320
And we can use this equation to help define a couple of terms that engineers use a lot: stress and strain.

87
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,439
Now, these aren’t the same as the feelings you get the night before a huge exam.

88
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,250
Instead, stress is the force on an object,
divided by its cross-sectional area --

89
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,040
basically, that F over A term.

90
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,430
And strain is the object’s change in length,
divided by its original length.

91
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,990
This equation, and Young’s modulus, apply
for two types of stress:

92
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,350
‘tensile stress’, which stretches objects out,
and ‘compressive stress’, which compresses them.

93
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,180
But sometimes the forces you apply to objects
aren’t just compressing or stretching.

94
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,220
For example: you could also apply what’s
known as shear stress.

95
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,960
Maybe you’ve done this before:

96
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,039
Say there’s a really thick book laying on a table -- say, Game of Thrones or a big dictionary.

97
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,319
If you push the top of the book parallel to the table, the pages will all sort of slide over each other.

98
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,939
Where before you had a nice rectangular-looking
book, now you have more of a … parallelogram.

99
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,000
The sliding happens because you’re
applying a force to the top of the book,

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,060
while the table applies an equal and opposite force to the bottom.

101
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,449
That’s shear stress.

102
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,060
And the way an object deforms under shear
stress depends on the same kinds of factors

103
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:49,379
that are involved when you compress or stretch
something.

104
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:54,459
Like, if the original length were longer -- meaning you had a thicker, taller book: That would mean more sliding.

105
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,079
More force? More sliding.

106
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,680
More area perpendicular to the force -- in
other words, a book with bigger pages? Less sliding.

107
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,370
And then there’s the inherent slidy-ness
of the material, that the object is made of,

108
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,319
which we call the shear modulus.

109
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,540
Just like Young’s modulus, the shear
modulus is different for every material,

110
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,120
and is just a number, represented by a capital-G.

111
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:15,409
The higher its shear modulus, the less the
object will deform.

112
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,189
Put all those factors together, and you get
an equation that should look very familiar.

113
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,430
It’s just like the equation we had before,
for stretching and compressing.

114
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,449
The only differences are that the original
length, area, and change in length

115
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,639
represent different parts of the object,
and that we use a different modulus.

116
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,429
But we have one last type of shape-change
to consider: shrinking!

117
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,490
This is what happens if you apply a force to all the parts of an object at once -- say, by putting it in water.

118
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,199
The same factors affect the shape change here,
too.

119
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,639
The more volume the object originally had,
the more it’ll shrink --

120
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
In other words, the more its volume will change.

121
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,620
When we’re talking about something submerged in a fluid, we give a different name to the force divided by area.

122
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,259
And instead of stress,
we call it pressure.

123
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,120
And the more pressure you apply to an object,
the more it will shrink.

124
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,139
Finally, some materials are more resistant
to changes in volume --

125
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,899
and that stiffness is measured by the bulk modulus, represented by a capital-B.

126
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,260
Combined, these factors form an equation you
can use to predict how much an object will shrink.

127
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,980
So now you know the three main ways that forces
affect an object’s shape:

128
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,439
changing its length -- through tensile and
compressive stress,

129
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,060
deforming it through shear stress,
and changing its volume through pressure.

130
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,879
And hopefully, now you also have a better understanding of all the thought that goes into making sure buildings and bridges stay up.

131
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,540
Today, you learned that the net force and torque on an object in equilibrium, must equal zero,

132
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,620
and you saw how you can use that fact
to calculate individual forces and torques.

133
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:39,259
We also talked about the way objects deform under tensile, compressive, and shear stress, as well as pressure.
