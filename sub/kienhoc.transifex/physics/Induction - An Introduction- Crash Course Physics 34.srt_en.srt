2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,600
Physicists learned a lot about electricity
and magnetism in the 19th century.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,840
We’ve already talked about one of the biggest discoveries – that electric currents can create magnetic fields.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,100
And once scientists had figured that out,
they wondered if the opposite was also true.

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,730
Could magnetic fields create – or induce
– an electric current?

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,220
Many physicists designed experiments to detect electric currents induced by magnetic fields, but they kept coming up empty.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,420
That is, until two physicists, Joseph Henry and Michael Faraday, both on their own, figured out what was happening:

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,690
It turns out that magnetic fields do induce
electric currents.

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,230
But only under certain circumstances – when
the magnetic field is changing with time.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,50
And this discovery is what eventually led
to the invention of hard drives.

11
00:00:47,50 --> 00:00:59,769

12
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,940
When Faraday discovered that magnetic fields
induce electric currents, he got kind of lucky.

13
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:12,460
He set up a current flowing through a coil of wire so that it would generate a magnetic field, and then he watched to see if that magnetic field induced a current in a second coil of wire.

14
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,000
And it didn’t, which was probably pretty
disappointing at first.

15
00:01:16,10 --> 00:01:18,000
But then, Faraday noticed something weird:

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,520
When he turned the current on and off in the first coil, there was a brief spike of current in the second coil – but only while the current was changing from off to on and back again.

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,320
He realized that he’d been looking for the wrong thing: a constant magnetic field didn’t cause an electric current in a loop of wire.

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,600
Only a changing magnetic field did!

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,640
These days, we call this idea Faraday’s
Law of Induction:

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,300
It says that a changing magnetic field will
induce an emf in a loop of wire.

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,39
And emf, you’ll recall, stands for electromotive force, which is what causes electrons to move and form a current.

22
00:01:48,40 --> 00:01:54,000
So now Faraday knew that when a magnetic field changed over time, it induced an emf in a loop of wire.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,80
But a couple of other things induced emf, too, even if the strength of the magnetic field stayed the same.

24
00:01:59,80 --> 00:02:05,600
Changing the area of the loop of wire induced a current, too, and so did changing the angle between the loop and the magnetic field.

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,440
That’s because of a property that most directly induces emf – the property known as magnetic flux, represented by Φ_B.

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,740
Magnetic flux is essentially a measure of the magnetic field running through a loop of wire.

27
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,740
And when that field changes?
That’s what induces an emf.

28
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,939
And there are three factors that affect the magnetic field, and therefore the magnetic flux through the loop:

29
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,109
First, there’s the strength of the magnetic
field, which we label as B.

30
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:30,550
Next, there the area of the loop, A.

31
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,740
If the loop is bigger, there’ll be a larger magnetic field running through it, and vice versa.

32
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,840
And finally, there’s the angle, theta, between the magnetic field and a line perpendicular to the face of the loop.

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:50,660
Combining all these factors, we find that the magnetic flux is equal to the strength of the magnetic field times the area of the loop, times the cosine of the angle between the magnetic field and that perpendicular line.

34
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:58,20
And if the magnetic field and the loop are perpendicular, then the magnetic flux will just be equal to the strength of the magnetic field times the area of the loop.

35
00:02:58,20 --> 00:03:02,99
Magnetic flux is measured in units of Tm^2,
also known as webers.

36
00:03:02,99 --> 00:03:07,99
But when it comes to inducing emf, what really
matters is how the flux is changing over time.

37
00:03:07,99 --> 00:03:12,198
If the magnetic flux through a loop of wire
decreases over time, the emf increases accordingly.

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,359
And if the flux increases over time, the emf
decreases.

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,680
In maths terms, we’d say that the emf is equal to the negative of the change in flux, over the change in time.

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,20
This equation works well for the change in
flux through one loop of wire.

41
00:03:25,20 --> 00:03:33,880
But often, you’ll be inducing emf in a coil of wire – like what Faraday was doing in his experiment – so it helps to know how a change in the magnetic flux will induce emf in a coil.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:40,160
And the key here is that a change in the magnetic flux through a coil induces the same emf in each loop of the coil.

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:47,999
So if you want to know the total emf in the coil, you calculate the emf for one loop of wire, then multiply it by the number of loops in the coil, or N.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,920
Which means that the induced emf in a coil of wire is equal to the number of coils, times the change in magnetic flux over the change in time, all multiplied by a negative sign.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,679
So, having two loops in the coil would mean double the emf that would be induced in one loop, while 10 loops would mean 10 times the emf.

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:13,40
So! Faraday’s law of induction lets us calculate how much emf – and therefore, how much current – will be induced in a loop of wire by a change in magnetic flux.

47
00:04:13,49 --> 00:04:16,108
But in what direction will the induced current
flow?

48
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,729
To figure that out, we use a rule called Lenz’s
Law.

49
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,979
You know how currents generate magnetic fields?

50
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:27,900
Well, Lenz’s law says that the magnetic field generated by the induced current will be in the direction opposite the change magnetic flux.

51
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,440
So if you know the direction of the change in magnetic flux, you can figure out the direction of the magnetic field generated by the current.

52
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,840
And from there, you can use our old friend the right-hand rule to figure out the direction of the current.

53
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:47,299
To get a better feel for how to apply Lenz’s law, let’s look at two scenarios involving a bar magnet below a loop of wire, with the north pole of the magnet facing the loop.

54
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:54,000
In the first scenario, you move the north pole of the bar magnet closer to the loop, which increases the magnetic field flowing through the loop.

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,360
This therefore creates a change in magnetic
flux and induces a current in the loop.

56
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,440
And the current generates a magnetic field
that opposes this change in magnetic flux.

57
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,690
Now, the north pole of the magnet points in
the same direction as the magnetic field.

58
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:13,400
So by moving the magnet closer to the loop, you essentially made the magnetic field from the bar magnet point more strongly upward.

59
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,179
And according to Lenz's law, the magnetic field created by the induced current will oppose this – so it'll point downward.

60
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,900
In the second scenario, the north pole of
the magnet is again facing the wire.

61
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,568
But this time, you move the magnet away from
the loop.

62
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:32,800
In this case, you're basically making the magnetic field from the magnet point less strongly upward – and more strongly downward.

63
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,520
So the magnetic field created by the induced current will point upward to counteract this change.

64
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,799
And once you know the direction of the magnetic field generated by the induced current, you can figure out the direction of the current from there.

65
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
This is where the right-hand rule comes in.

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,320
Make a "stop" sign with your right hand, then point your thumb in the direction of the magnetic field being generated by the induced current.

67
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,440
The direction that your fingers are pointing?

68
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,80
That's the direction of the current.

69
00:05:57,80 --> 00:05:58,60
Let's try it:

70
00:05:58,60 --> 00:06:04,680
In our first scenario, where we moved the north pole of the magnet closer to the loop of wire, the generated magnetic field was pointing upward.

71
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,480
So the current will be moving clockwise along
the loop.

72
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,400
In the second scenario, where we moved the north pole of the magnet away from the loop, the generated magnetic field was pointing downward.

73
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:16,610
So the current will be moving counterclockwise
along the loop.

74
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,180
Now, another way to use magnetic flux to induce a current in a loop is by changing how much of the loop is within the magnetic field.

75
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,699
Say you have a horizontal magnetic field,
and a loop of wire.

76
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:35,159
You arrange the loop so it’s perpendicular to the magnetic field, then drag it out of the magnetic field, which decreases the amount of magnetic field within the loop.

77
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,429
The magnetic flux through the loop changes,
which induces an emf.

78
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:43,580
The strength of the emf is equal to negative of the change in the magnetic flux, over the change in time.

79
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:52,719
The flux, you’ll recall, is equal to the magnetic field times the area, times the cosine of the angle between the magnetic field and a line perpendicular to the loop.

80
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,920
Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the loop, the cosine of the angle is 1, so that term drops out of the equation.

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:05,800
Which means that in this case, the change in flux is equal to the magnetic field times the change in the area of the loop within the magnetic field.

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,360
And the area of the loop is equal to its length, which we’ll call L, times the width of the loop that’s in the magnetic field, which we’ll call x.

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,460
As you move the loop out of the magnetic field, the amount of its width within the field, x, changes.

84
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:26,380
So! The change in magnetic flux is equal to the strength of the magnetic field, times the length of the loop, times the change in its width within the magnetic field.

85
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,159
So the strength of the induced emf will be equal
to all of that, divided by the change in time.

86
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,680
Thankfully, there’s a way to simplify all
of this:

87
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,920
The change in x over the change in time should look familiar – it’s just equal to the velocity of the loop as you move it out of the magnetic field!

88
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:50,760
So when you move a loop of wire in or out of a magnetic field, the strength of the induced emf is equal to the strength of the magnetic field, times the length of the loop, times the velocity of the loop.

89
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,940
Using a magnetic field to induce a current is useful for all kinds of reasons – we’ll talk about some of the main ones next time.

90
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,180
It’s also how hard drives work – at least,
the ones that use a rotating disk.

91
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,120
Your computer stores information on your hard drive by magnetizing small sections of the disk.

92
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,600
To read that information, your computer rotates sections of the disk past the head, which is a small electromagnet that has a coil of wire.

93
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:21,200
The changing magnetic field induces a current in the coil in the head, and computers processes that signal as the zeroes and ones we use to store digital information!

94
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,260
Digital information like this episode of Crash
Course!

95
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,219
Today, you learned about magnetic flux, and how a change in magnetic flux can induce an emf in a loop or coil of wire.

96
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:37,480
We also talked about how to calculate that emf both when the magnetic field is changing and when the area of the loop in the magnetic field is changing.

97
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,799
Finally, we described how induction works
in hard drives.

100
