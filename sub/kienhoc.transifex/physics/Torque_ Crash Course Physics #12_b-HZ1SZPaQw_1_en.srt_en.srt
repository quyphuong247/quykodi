1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,379
You have a box. A ring. And a marble.

2
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:09,468
And they’re all at the top of a ramp. Because
you know how physics loves ramps.

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:14,838
Especially hypothetical ramps! So, let’s say this ramp would allow for static friction, but not kinetic friction.

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,530
Now, you let go of all of these objects at
the same time, so that the box starts sliding,

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,980
and the ring and marble start rolling, all
at once.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,240
So, which of them will hit the bottom first?

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,209
The answer might not be what you’d expect.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,130
I mean, we already know that when you drop
two objects from the same height -- in a vacuum

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,089
at least -- they’ll hit the ground at the same time. Even if you tried it with a feather and a bowling ball.

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,650
So you might think that all of the objects
would get to the bottom of the ramp at the same time.

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,119
But they won’t.

12
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,309
The reason has to do with how energy is distributed
in an object when it’s rolling.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:49,340
And in order to understand who wins the ramp-race, and why, we have to investigate some qualities of rotational motion:

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,240
Specifically, torque, and the moment of inertia.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:04,159
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,280
Have you ever tightened a bolt with a wrench?

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,180
Or pulled a door open?
Me too!

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,360
When we do those things, the wrench and the
door’s handle do their jobs using torque.

19
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,179
That is, they apply a force perpendicular to the axis of rotation, which makes the bolt turn and door swing open.

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,580
That’s what torque does -- it makes things
rotate faster or slower.

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,310
In other words, torque changes an object’s
angular velocity.

22
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,560
For the first few weeks of this course, we described net forces as changing an object’s linear velocity,

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,260
how fast it moves through
space, and in what direction.

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,480
Torque essentially does the same thing, but
for rotational motion.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,719
This means that a lot of the relationships and equations that apply to forces will apply to torque in a similar way.

26
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,739
But first, let’s talk about how to calculate torque, by analyzing what happens when you open a door.

27
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,879
The harder you pull on the handle, the more torque you’ll generate, and the more you’ll change the door’s angular velocity.

28
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,060
More net torque then, means the door
starts moving faster on its hinges.

29
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,900
So, the strength of the force that’s applied
is one factor that affects torque.

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,140
Another is the distance between the force
and the axis of rotation -- or the radius.

31
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,500
A larger radius means more torque.

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,299
You know this if you’ve ever tried opening a door with a handle that’s too close to the hinge.

33
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:10,788
I’m guessing you haven’t tried
that, though, because there’s a reason doorknobs

34
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:12,639
are generally placed far from the hinges.

35
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,579
A door with a handle close to the hinges would
be much harder to open, because you get less

36
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,590
torque for the same amount of force.

37
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,450
The last factor that affects torque is the
ANGLE BETWEEN the applied force and the radius.

38
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,889
If you tried to open the door by pulling the
handle, say, parallel to the door --

39
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:30,189
in the direction opposite from the hinges --
the door wouldn’t move.

40
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:33,849
Because the only part of the force that affects
the door’s rotation is the force that’s

41
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,379
Perpendicular to the radius.

42
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:40,348
To put this idea in mathematical terms, torque
-- represented by the Greek letter tau -- is

43
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:42,969
equal to the perpendicular force, times the
radius.

44
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:46,870
And, you know how we keep saying that for
translational motion, a net force on an object

45
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,310
is equal to its acceleration times its mass?

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,090
Well, something similar applies to rotational
motion, too:

47
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,140
The net torque on an object is equal to its angular acceleration, times what’s known as its moment of inertia.

48
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,878
Now, we’ve talked about inertia before,
at least as it relates to translational motion.

49
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:05,278
Basically, it’s an object’s tendency to
keep doing what it’s been doing.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,598
An object with lots of inertia is harder to speed up or slow down.

51
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:12,128
And in translational motion, the inertia of
an object depends on mass.

52
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:15,929
The MOMENT OF INERTIA works in a somewhat
similar way for rotational motion …

53
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,360
but the best way to define is mathematically.

54
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,239
Specifically, the moment of inertia is the
sum of all the individual points of mass in

55
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,939
an object, times the square of their distance
from the axis of rotation.

56
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,359
So, much in the same way that inertia relates
to an object’s mass in translational motion…

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,980
… the moment of inertia relates to mass,
too, but it depends on how that mass is distributed.

58
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,419
The farther away the mass is from the axis
of rotation, the higher the object’s moment of inertia.

59
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,090
It’s possible to derive the equation for
an object’s moment of inertia,

60
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,340
by integrating the square of the object’s radius over its mass.

61
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:48,359
But those integrals can get complicated.

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,500
So this is one of those rare cases where,
if you’re asked to solve problems using

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,280
moments of inertia and you don’t have access
to the equations, it’s probably worth memorizing them.

64
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:58,929
Now, there’s another thing that torques
and forces have in common,

65
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,090
and it’s going to be the key to figuring out which object wins the race down the ramp.

66
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,120
Namely: torques, like forces, have the ability
to do work.

67
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:10,268
As you might remember from our episode on
work and energy, the work done by a force

68
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,049
is just the integral of that force over a
certain distance.

69
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,709
In a similar way, the work done by a torque
is the integral of that torque over a certain angle.

70
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,918
Meaning: the more torque you apply while rotating
an object, the more work you do.

71
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,519
We also know that work changes the
energy of a system.

72
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,978
For example, it can change its kinetic energy, which is the energy of its motion.

73
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,740
In the case of objects that move without rotating, all of that kinetic energy goes into translational motion.

74
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,579
In this case, keep in mind that -- as we’ve
gone over before -- the kinetic energy of

75
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,139
translational motion is equal to half of the
object’s mass, times its velocity squared.

76
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,598
But when an object is ROTATING, some of its
kinetic energy is also taking the form of Rotational Motion.

77
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:51,918
And calculating the kinetic energy of rotational
motion is pretty easy.

78
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,720
Because, first, the moment of inertia affects rotational motion in the same way that mass affects translational motion.

79
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:03,158
And second, rotating objects have angular
velocity, just as translating objects have linear velocity.

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,720
So, the kinetic energy of an object’s rotational motion is just half of its moment of inertia, times its angular velocity squared.

81
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,400
OK, there’s just one final factor we have to consider, before we finally get back to the box, the marble, and the ring racing down the ramp:

82
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,259
And that factor is angular momentum.

83
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:22,598
We’ve talked about linear momentum -- and
how it’s equal to an object’s mass times its velocity.

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,040
Well, there’s also angular momentum, which is equal to an object’s moment of inertia times its angular velocity.

85
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,460
And, like linear momentum, angular momentum
is always conserved.

86
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:34,620
That’s another one of those super-fundamental principles of physics:

87
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,680
You can’t create or destroy angular momentum. It always has to go somewhere.

88
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,999
So, now, let’s get back to The Great Crash
Course Physics Ramp Race.

89
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:45,619
All three objects -- the box, the marble,
and the ring -- are covering the same distance.

90
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:48,649
And what we want to know is, how fast do they
cover that distance?

91
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:52,809
The answer has to do with what happens to
each object’s energy as it moves down the ramp.

92
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:57,800
When they’re at the top of the ramp, all the energy of each object takes the form of gravitational potential energy,

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,759
which is equal to the object’s mass, times small g, times the height of the ramp.

94
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,480
As they move down the ramp, all of that potential
energy gradually gets converted into kinetic energy.

95
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,720
In the case of the box, all of its potential energy will be converted to translational kinetic energy,

96
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,740
because that’s the only
kind of motion it has.

97
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,100
So the object that gets to the bottom of the ramp first is … the box!

98
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,780
Because, for both the marble and the ring, some of their potential energy gets converted into rotational kinetic energy.

99
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:26,938
And energy that goes into their rotation isn’t
being used to make them move faster down the ramp.

100
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,419
So really, anything that slides -- at least
on our hypothetical ramp with no kinetic friction

101
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:33,788
-- will reach the bottom before anything that
rolls.

102
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:37,568
And the masses of the objects don’t even
matter, because the energy of an object with

103
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,639
more or less mass will increase or decrease
accordingly.

104
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,809
So, the box wins.

105
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:42,729
But what’s the runner-up?

106
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:45,100
Does the ring reach the bottom next, or does
the marble?

107
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,100
That question is a little more complicated, but it turns out that the marble reaches the bottom before the ring,

108
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,560
because it has a lower
moment of inertia.

109
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,360
The marble is a solid sphere, so its mass
is distributed closer to its center.

110
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,169
But the ring’s mass is distributed in a,
well, ring -- so its mass is distributed far

111
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:03,908
from its center, giving it a higher moment
of inertia.

112
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:06,248
What does that mean for the marble’s speed
versus the ring’s?

113
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:11,059
Well, since the marble has a smaller moment
of inertia, its velocity can take up a larger

114
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:14,689
proportion of its kinetic energy -- which
means it moves faster down the ramp.

115
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:15,899
So, the final results of the race?

116
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,209
The box wins, the marble comes in second,
and the ring finishes last.

117
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:22,869
Today, you learned about torque, and how it
relates to an object’s angular acceleration

118
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:27,319
and its moment of inertia. We also talked
about how to calculate moments of inertia,

119
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,479
angular momentum, and the fact that torques
can do work. Finally, we figured out what

120
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:34,778
would happen if you let a box, marble, and
ring move down a ramp.
