[flute plays Crash Course theme]

2
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:11,419
That’s a familiar tune!

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:15,939
How do instruments, like this guitar, create
music?

4
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:19,259
We’ve talked about the science of sound,
and some of the properties of sound waves.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,720
But when we talk about sound waves in the context of music, there are all kinds of fascinating properties and weird rules to talk about.

6
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:29,099
I’m talking about the music that comes from
string, wind, and brass instruments.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,480
String instruments create sound when their
strings vibrate in the air.

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:38,219
And in order to understand how these instruments work, you have to realize that making music is not just an art.

9
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:40,369
It’s ALSO a science.

10
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:53,280
[Theme Music]

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,520
Sound, you’ll recall, is a wave: a ‘longitudinal’
wave.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,660
This means that the medium that the wave travels
through oscillates -- or moves back and forth

13
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,999
-- in the same direction that the wave is
moving.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,859
But string, wind, and brass instruments use
a special kind of wave — they’re ‘standing waves.'

15
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,579
A standing wave is a wave that looks like
it isn't moving.

16
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,140
Its ‘amplitude’ may change, but it isn't
traveling anywhere.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,460
Standing waves are the result of two other things waves do, both of which we’ve talked about before:
reflection and interference.

18
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,339
Reflection is what happens when a wave reaches the end of a path, and then moves back along the same path.

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,600
That’s what happens when you send a pulse down a rope -- it reaches the end, and then comes right back.

20
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,569
When we send a continuous wave down the rope,
that’s when interference comes into play.

21
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,839
The wave reaches the end of the rope and is
reflected, but there are more peaks on the way.

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,040
As the peaks pass each other, they interfere
with one another, changing their sizes.

23
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,300
Usually, you end up with crests and troughs
that are different sizes and various distances apart.

24
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,179
But at certain frequencies, the reflected waves interfere in such a way that you end up

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,360
with a wave that seems to stay perfectly
still, with only its amplitude changing.

26
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,060
That’s a standing wave, and it can happen
both in strings and in the air in pipes.

27
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,760
And that's what makes music: Standing waves with different frequencies correspond to different musical notes.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,039
Now, in order to understand how standing
waves operate, you should get to know their anatomy.

29
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,419
The points of a standing wave that don’t
oscillate are called nodes,

30
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:16,319
and the points at the maximum height of the peaks are antinodes.

31
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,709
And here’s something cool.

32
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:24,060
If you look at a string on a stringed instrument, you can actually see where the nodes and antinodes are.

33
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,060
The standing wave creates peaks along the string, and between those peaks, there are points that just stay still.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,840
So the peaks are the antinodes, and the points
that don’t oscillate are nodes.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,120
And if one or both of the string’s ends are fixed, then each fixed end is a node too, because it’s stuck in place.

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,240
Now, in a pipe, the standing waves are made
of air molecules moving back and forth.

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,820
But the areas where molecules oscillate the most

38
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:50,180
(including those near any open ends of the pipe) form the peaks, and therefore the antinodes.

39
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,780
And between those peaks, as well as at any closed ends of the pipe, are areas where molecules don’t move at all; those are the nodes.

40
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,009
Generally, musicians make their music using
the frequencies of these standing waves.

41
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,120
But the nature of these waves depends a lot
on what the ends of the string or pipe look like.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,840
Remember how a wave traveling down a rope gets reflected differently, depending on whether the end of the rope is fixed or loose?

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,128
A fixed end will invert the wave -- turning
crests into troughs, and vice versa --

44
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,912
while a loose end will just reflect it without inverting it.

45
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,479
The same thing holds true for air in a pipe: a closed end will invert the wave, while an open end won’t.

46
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,259
So the properties of a standing wave will
be a little different,

47
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:30,859
depending on whether it’s made with a string with two fixed ends, or a pipe with two ends open,

48
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,120
or a string or a pipe with one end fixed,
and the other open.

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,580
A string with two fixed ends -- like in a piano -- is probably the simplest way to understand standing waves.

50
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,400
Because, we know that no matter what, the wave made by a fixed string will have at least two nodes -- one at each end.

51
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,659
And in its most basic form, it would have
just one antinode, in the middle.

52
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,879
So the wave is basically a peak that moves
from being a crest to a trough and vice versa

53
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,060
like some kind of one-dimensional jump rope.

54
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,420
This most basic kind of standing wave is known
as the fundamental -- or the 1st harmonic.

55
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,819
It’s the simplest possible standing wave
you can have, with the fewest nodes and antinodes.

56
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,719
There are other, more complex standing waves
that you can have, too.

57
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,500
These are known as overtones.

58
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,860
Overtones build on the fundamental, incrementally:
each overtone adds a node and an antinode.

59
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,699
So each of these overtones is related to the fundamental wave -- and all of the overtones are related to each other.

60
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,159
Together, the fundamental wave and the overtones
make up what are known as harmonics.

61
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,960
The fundamental is the 1st harmonic, and the
overtones are higher-numbered harmonics.

62
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,239
With each node-and-antinode pair that’s
added to the standing wave,

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,379
the number of the harmonic goes up:
2nd harmonic, 3rd harmonic, and so on.

64
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,779
Now, physicists sometimes express harmonics
in terms of wavelength.

65
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:45,479
For example, for a string with two fixed ends, you’ll notice that the fundamental covers exactly half a wavelength.

66
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,660
A full wavelength of the wave would
span two peaks: a crest and a trough,

67
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,260
but the fundamental spans exactly one peak,
which is half the wavelength.

68
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:59,060
So, for the fundamental of a string with two fixed ends, the length of the string is equal to half a wavelength.

69
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,579
The second-simplest standing wave you can have on a string with two fixed ends has 3 nodes --

70
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,939
one at each end, and one in the middle
-- plus 2 antinodes in between the nodes.

71
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:11,660
It’s called the 2nd harmonic, and the string
holds exactly one wavelength.

72
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,600
You can probably guess what the 3rd harmonic
looks like: it has 4 nodes and 3 antinodes,

73
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,260
and the string holds 1.5 -- or, 3/2 -- wavelengths.

74
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:24,839
You may have started to notice a pattern:
For a standing wave on a given length of string,

75
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,439
the number of wavelengths that fit on the string is equal to the number of the harmonic, divided by 2.

76
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:35,319
So, now we have an equation that relates the wavelength of a standing wave to the number of the harmonic and the length of the string.

77
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,279
Once you get a handle on wavelength, you can figure out the aspect of the wave that musicians care about most -- the frequency.

78
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,899
We’ve already established that a wave’s wavelength, times its frequency, is equal to its velocity,

79
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:51,079
which will be the same for each harmonic, because a wave’s velocity only depends on the medium it’s traveling through.

80
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,199
So a standing wave’s frequency will be equal
to its velocity divided by its wavelength.

81
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,699
For the fundamental with two fixed ends, we already know that the wavelength is twice the string's length.

82
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,639
So the frequency of that fundamental standing
wave -- known as the fundamental frequency

83
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,000
-- is equal to the velocity, divided by
twice the length of the string.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We write it as f, with a subscript of 1.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,939
Now what about the frequency of the second harmonic -- the standing wave with 3 nodes and 2 antinodes?

86
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,240
It will be equal to the velocity, divided
by the length of the string.

87
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,300
Which is twice the fundamental frequency.

88
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,060
And the frequency of the third harmonic,
with its 4 nodes and 3 antinodes,

89
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,639
will be equal to three times
the fundamental frequency.

90
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,959
So, we’re starting to see another pattern here:

91
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:34,620
The frequency of a standing wave with two fixed ends will just be equal to the number of the harmonic, times the fundamental frequency.

92
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,180
In fact, that’s one way to define harmonics:

93
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,620
The number of a harmonic is equal to the number you multiply by the fundamental frequency, to get the harmonic’s frequency.

94
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,319
This math is what makes musical instruments
work.

95
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:51,060
When you press down a key on a piano, you make a hammer strike a string, creating standing waves in that string.

96
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,459
Every string in the piano is tuned so that
its fundamental frequency --

97
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:58,120
which depends on the string’s mass, length, and tension -- corresponds to a given note.

98
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,620
Middle C, for example, is 261.6 Hz.

99
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,000
Guitars are also tuned so that the fundamental frequencies of their strings, correspond to set notes.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,680
And when you press down on the strings
in certain places,

101
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,720
you change the length of the active part of string so that its fundamental frequency corresponds to a different note.

102
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,980
So, for a standing wave with two fixed ends,
we can relate wavelength, frequency, velocity,

103
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,860
the length of the string, and the number of
the harmonic.

104
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,139
And we can do the exact same thing for a standing wave with two loose ends -- in an open pipe, for example, like in a flute.

105
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,060
A standing wave in a pipe with two open ends is kind of the opposite, of the wave with two fixed ends:

106
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,379
Instead of having a node at each end, it has
an antinode at each end.

107
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:42,829
So the fundamental standing wave for a pipe
with two open ends will have two antinodes,

108
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,569
and one node in the middle of the wave.

109
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,149
Then, the 2nd harmonic will have three antinodes
and two nodes, and so on.

110
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:51,719
But each harmonic still covers the same number
of wavelengths.

111
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,930
Remember how the fundamental wave for a string
with two fixed ends covered half of a wavelength?

112
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,400
The fundamental wave for a pipe with two open
ends also covers half of a wavelength.

113
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,799
That half is just in a different section of
the wave.

114
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,280
And just like a string with two fixed ends, the second harmonic for a pipe with two open ends also covers a full wavelength.

115
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,899
It’s just that, in the case of the pipe, the wave starts and ends with a peak instead of a node.

116
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,500
So the equations for wavelength and frequency
for a standing wave with two open ends

117
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,620
will be the same as they were for a standing wave with two fixed ends.

118
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,120
So, we’ve covered guitars and pianos and flutes!

119
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,819
But a pipe with one closed end and one open
end works a little differently.

120
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,620
These kinds of pipes are used in instruments like pan flutes, where you blow across the top of a closed pipe to make music.

121
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,950
Here, standing waves need a separate set of
equations, for a couple of reasons:

122
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,290
First, the closed end of the pipe will be a node, because the air molecules aren’t oscillating there.

123
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,039
And the open end will be an antinode, because
that’s where there’s a peak in the oscillations.

124
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:48,589
Which means that the simplest wave you can make in this pipe will stretch from one node, to one peak.

125
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,350
But that’s only a span of a quarter of a
wavelength in the pipe.

126
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,310
Before, with both a string fixed at both ends, and an open pipe, the fundamental spanned half a wavelength.

127
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:01,369
The fact that a pan-flute pipe only covers
a quarter of a wavelength changes things.

128
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:07,060
Because, remember: the frequency of each harmonic is equal to the number of the harmonic, times the fundamental frequency.

129
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:10,939
But for a pipe that’s closed on one end,
you can’t double the fundamental frequency,

130
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,460
or quadruple it -- or multiply it by any even
number.

131
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,780
Because it would result in a wave that would
need a node on both ends, or a peak on both ends.

132
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:19,939
Which isn't possible.

133
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,300
So, a pipe that’s closed on one end can’t
have even-numbered harmonics.

134
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:28,000
All of this helps explain why musical instruments sound different, even when they’re playing the same note.

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,580
When you play a note, you’re creating the fundamental wave, plus some of the other harmonics -- the overtones.

136
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,340
And for each instrument, different harmonics will have different amplitudes -- and therefore sound louder.

137
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,580
But because of the physics of standing waves, instruments that have pipes with one closed end

138
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,100
won't create the even-numbered harmonics
at all.

139
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,940
That’s why a C on the flute sounds so different
from a C on, say, the bassoon!

140
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,060
Today, you learned about standing waves, and
how they’re made up of nodes and antinodes.

141
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,439
We discussed harmonics, and how to find the
frequency of a standing wave on a string with

142
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,500
two fixed ends, a pipe with two open ends,
and a pipe with one closed end.

143
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,539
Finally, we explained why a pipe with one
closed end can’t have even-numbered harmonics.
