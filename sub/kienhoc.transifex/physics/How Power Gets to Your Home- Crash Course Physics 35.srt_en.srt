00:00:03,60 --> 00:00:06,640
Wherever you are right now, there’s probably
an electrical outlet within easy reach.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,760
Whether you want to vacuum the living room or recharge your phone, all you have to do is plug into the wall, and bam – instant access to electricity.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,500
But have you ever wondered how all of that electrical power gets to your house, school, or office in the first place?

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,620
There are a lot of steps, but two of the most important ones involve electric generators and transformers.

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,260
And both of these devices work because of
a concept we introduced last time: induction.

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:42,80
[Theme Music]

7
00:00:42,80 --> 00:00:45,280
Electric generators are like the opposite
of electric motors.

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,20
Motors take electrical energy – so, the current running through a coil of wire – and convert it into mechanical energy as the motor turns.

9
00:00:52,20 --> 00:01:00,700
Generators, on the other hand, take mechanical energy – the rotation of a coil of wire – and use induction to convert it into electrical energy, in the form of a current running through a wire.

10
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:07,260
Generators use a wire wound around something called an armature – basically, a cylinder that rotates within a uniform magnetic field.

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,940
As the loop rotates, the changing magnetic
flux induces a current in the loops of the coil.

12
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,620
But the angle that the coil makes with respect to the magnetic field keeps changing, which causes the direction of the induced current to reverse itself at every half-turn.

13
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,149
So the magnetic field in the generator stays
constant.

14
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,540
But because the coil is rotating, the angle
between the coil and the magnetic field changes.

15
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,820
This means that the magnetic flux through the loops in the coil changes over time, which is what induces an emf.

16
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,339
And as we’ll soon see, the emf depends on the sine of the angle between the coil and the magnetic field.

17
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,820
So for half of the rotation, the sine of the angle is positive, and for the other half, the sine of the angle is negative.

18
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,380
When it’s positive, the current flows in
one direction.

19
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,600
When it’s negative, it flows in the other.

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,68
This means that the direction of the current
flips with every half-rotation.

21
00:01:51,69 --> 00:01:55,289
This produces a type of flow of electricity
known as alternating current, or AC.

22
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,909
Until now, we’ve mainly been talking about
DC, or direct current.

23
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:06,619
There are DC generators, which include special parts to make the current keep flowing in the same direction the whole time, instead of reversing itself as the coil turns.

24
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:09,799
But AC power is the kind that flows from the
outlets in your walls.

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,780
And in most places in the world, it reverses
itself either 50 or 60 times per second.

26
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,640
This is called the frequency of the current,
and you’ll normally see it written in hertz.

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,519
Now, we can calculate the strength of the emf in a generator using some of the principles we talked about last time.

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,780
We’ve already described what happens when you move a loop of wire in or out of a magnetic field:

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,820
The emf induced in the wire is equal to the strength of the magnetic field, times the length of the loop, times its perpendicular velocity.

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,19
In other words, it’s the velocity times the sine of the angle between the magnetic field and the loop.

31
00:02:39,20 --> 00:02:42,860
And the same idea applies to a coil of wire
rotating in a magnetic field, too.

32
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,720
We just have to replace some of the variables
with ones that apply to a rotating coil.

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,320
First, instead of the length of the loop,
we’ll use the area of one loop of the coil, A.

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,359
And instead of translational velocity, we’ll
use angular velocity, ω.

35
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,560
Next, the angle, theta, is just equal to the
angular velocity multiplied by time.

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,700
And finally, instead of finding the emf in just one loop of wire, we’re finding the emf in a whole coil of wire.

37
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,140
Which means that we need to multiply this
equation by N, the number of loops in the coil.

38
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,79
So, the emf induced in a coil rotating in a magnetic field is equal to the number of loops in the coil, times the strength of the magnetic field,

39
00:03:18,80 --> 00:03:24,820
times the area of a loop of the coil, times the angular velocity, times the sine of the angular velocity multiplied by time.

40
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,600
It’s a bit of a mouthful, but that’s because there are so many factors that affect the emf induced in the coil.

41
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:37,359
Basically, the equation is saying that you’ll have a greater induced current in the generator if there are more coils in the wire, or if there’s a stronger magnetic field,

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,860
or if each loop of the coil is bigger,
or if it rotates faster.

43
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,440
Now, it might seem kind of strange to have a generator produce a current that reverses itself dozens of times a second.

44
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,900
But actually, this is incredibly useful.

45
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:56,400
That’s because another important device that gets electricity from the power plant to your house is a transformer, which is made up of two coils of wire.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,860
And transformers only work with AC power.

47
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:06,760
They’re necessary because one of the problems with transmitting electricity over long distances is that, if the voltage is low, a lot of power gets wasted as heat.

48
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,220
We’re talking like 80% in some cases.

49
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,870
Which is a huge waste of energy!

50
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,480
When electricity is transmitted at higher voltages,
though, much less power gets wasted as heat.

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:23,480
That’s because, for the same power, a lower voltage translates to a higher current, and power loss increases proportionally to the square of the current.

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,780
In other words, if you double the voltage, you end up with only a quarter the power loss you had before.

53
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,380
And if you triple the voltage, you get a ninth
of the power loss.

54
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,659
So it’s worth transmitting electricity at
very high voltages.

55
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,370
But then you need a way to change the voltage
of the electricity running through the lines

56
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,830
– from its original voltage from the generator,
which could be around 12,000 volts;

57
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,840
then up to a very high voltage as it travels long
distances, which might be as high as 240,000 volts.

58
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,580
That’s definitely not safe to use in your
household appliances.

59
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,840
So once the electricity gets to where it needs
to go, you need to lower its voltage again.

60
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,859
In the US, the power coming out of your wall is
110 volts, and in most other places it’s 220 volts.

61
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:10,680
All those voltage changes are made using transformers, which take advantage of something called mutual inductance, where a change in the current in one coil leads to a change in emf in another, nearby coil.

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,660
And emf is the same thing as voltage.

63
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,640
This change happens because the changing current
in the first coil produces a changing magnetic field.

64
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,479
So the magnetic flux through the second coil
changes, which induces an emf.

65
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:29,140
And the emf induced in the second coil will be equal to the change in current in the first coil, divided by the change in time, and multiplied by a constant, M.

66
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,440
M depends on things like the size and shape of the coils, and how they’re positioned relative to each other.

67
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,580
This works in the opposite direction, too:

68
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,849
a change in current in the second coil will
induce a corresponding emf in the first coil.

69
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:46,640
In transformers, the power running through the first coil is AC, which means the current and the magnetic field it produces are constantly changing.

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,719
So an emf is induced in the second coil.

71
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,740
But if the second coil has more turns than the first,
it’ll have a higher voltage, and vice versa.

72
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,640
Here’s why:

73
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:03,39
Faraday’s law, which we talked about last time, says that the emf – or voltage – in each coil is equal to the number of loops in the coil, times the change in magnetic flux over time.

74
00:06:03,40 --> 00:06:10,80
We can write this out as an equation for each coil separately, using a subscript P for the primary coil and a subscript S for the secondary coil.

75
00:06:10,80 --> 00:06:14,260
Now, we want to know how the voltage in the secondary coil compares to the voltage of the primary one.

76
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,560
To find out, we divide the voltage in the secondary
coil by the voltage in the primary coil.

77
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,380
The change in magnetic flux over time cancels out,
which leaves us with a simple but useful equation:

78
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,979
The voltage in the secondary coil divided by the voltage in the primary coil is equal to the number of loops in the secondary coil divided by the number of loops in the primary coil.

79
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,20
So if the secondary coil has twice as many loops as the primary coil, it’ll have twice as much voltage.

80
00:06:36,20 --> 00:06:39,270
And if it has triple the loops, it’ll have
triple the voltage, and so on.

81
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:46,140
If the secondary coil has more loops than the primary coil, so that it increases the voltage, that’s called a step-up transformer.

82
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,599
And if it has fewer loops than the primary coil, so it decreases the voltage, that’s a step-down transformer.

83
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,470
As the electricity in power lines travels from the power plant to your house, it goes through lots of step-up and step-down transformers.

84
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,40
If you’ve ever seen a Tesla coil in action –
that’s just a fancy version of a step-up transformer.

85
00:07:03,40 --> 00:07:07,740
The secondary coil is designed so that it shoots out bursts of electricity that look like lightning bolts.

86
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,580
Mutual inductance is also used in lots of other things, too – like wireless chargers, for example.

87
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,20
Lots of cell phones have a wireless charging feature, where you just put the phone on top of a charging pad and it charges.

88
00:07:18,20 --> 00:07:19,320
No need to plug anything in.

89
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,580
It works because there’s a coil inside the charging
pad, and another one inside your phone.

90
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,979
The AC power running through the charging pad induces an emf in your phone’s coil, which can use the energy to charge its battery.

91
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:38,440
So the same technology that helps get electricity to the outlets in your wall can move power from one device to another – even if there are no physical connections between them.

92
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,629
Today, you learned about how electricity is
produced and transmitted.

93
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,700
We explained how electric generators work,
and derived the generator equation.

94
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,000
We also talked about transformers, and how
they use mutual inductance to change voltage.

95
00:07:50,9 --> 00:07:54,60
Finally, we described how mutual inductance
is used in wireless chargers.

96
