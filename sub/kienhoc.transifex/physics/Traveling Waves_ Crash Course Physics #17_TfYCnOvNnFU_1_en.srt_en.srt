1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Here we have an ordinary piece of rope.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,379
It’s not one of those magician’s ropes that can mysteriously put itself back together once it's been cut it in half.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,600
And it’s not particularly strong or durable.

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,359
But you might say that it does have special powers, because it’ll demonstrate for us the physics of traveling waves.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,059
Ropes and strings are really good for this kind of thing,

6
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:24,960
because when you move them back and forth the movement of your hand travels through the rope as a wave.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,080
By observing what happens to this rope when we try different things with it, we’ll be able to see how waves behave.

8
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:33,009
Including, how those waves sometimes disappear
completely.

9
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,309
How’s that for a magic trick?

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:47,630
[Theme Music]

11
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,820
This is a typical wave.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,659
And waves form whenever there’s a disturbance
of some kind.

13
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,679
Often, when something about the physical world changes, the information about that disturbance

14
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,740
gradually moves outward, away from the source, in every direction.

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,719
And as the information travels, it makes a
wave shape.

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,560
Think about all the disturbance you cause, for example, when you jump on a trampoline.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,960
When you hit the trampoline, the downward push that you create moves the material next to it down a little bit, too.

18
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,038
And the same goes for the material next to
that, and so on.

19
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:19,618
And while that information is traveling outward,
the spot where your feet first hit the trampoline

20
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:24,920
is already recovering, moving upward again, because of the tension force in the trampoline.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,250
And that moves the area next to it upward, too.

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,608
This up-and-down motion gradually ripples outward, covering more and more of the trampoline.

23
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,798
And the ripples take the shape of a wave.

24
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,219
Waves are made up of peaks, with crests -- the bumps on top -- and troughs -- the bumps on the bottom.

25
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:42,888
They have an amplitude, which is the distance from the peaks to the middle of the wave.

26
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:47,579
They also have a wavelength, which is the distance between crests -- a full cycle of the wave --

27
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,759
and a frequency, which is how many of those cycles pass through a given point every second.

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,980
Multiply the wavelength by the frequency,
and you get the wave’s speed -- how fast it's going.

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,160
And the wave’s speed only depends on the medium it’s traveling through.

30
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,119
That’s why the speed of sound -- which is
a wave -- doesn’t depend on the sound itself.

31
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,978
It doesn’t matter how loud or quiet it is.

32
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:10,778
It just depends on whether the sound is traveling through, say, air or water.

33
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,819
Now, there are four main kinds of waves, and we can use our rope to show the difference between some of them:

34
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,830
A pulse wave is what happens when you move the end of the rope back and forth just one time.

35
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,190
One lonely crest travels through the rope
-- that’s the pulse.

36
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:27,719
Then there’s a continuous wave, which is what happens when you keep moving the rope back and forth.

37
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,560
In that case, your hand is acting as an oscillator.

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,219
Anything that causes an oscillation or vibration can create a continuous wave.

39
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,960
Now, things that cause simple harmonic oscillation move in such a way that they create sinusoidal waves --

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,460
meaning that if you plotted the waves on a graph, they’d look a lot like the graph of sin(x).

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,420
But the waves we’ve mainly been talking
about so far are transverse waves --

42
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,219
ones in which the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction that the wave is traveling in.

43
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:59,159
When a wave travels along this rope, for example,the peaks are perpendicular to the rope’s length.

44
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,400
The same thing was mostly true for the waves that you made on the trampoline:

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,480
the waves were traveling along its surface horizontally, but the peaks were vertical.

46
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:12,959
But there are also longitudinal waves, where the oscillations happen in the same direction as the wave is moving.

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,980
In the case of a longitudinal wave, the back-and-forth motion is more of a compression-and-expansion.

48
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,479
These are the kinds of waves that you get
by compressing and stretching a spring --

49
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,489
and they’re also the kinds by which sound travels, which we’ll talk more about next time.

50
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,990
But all waves -- no matter what kind they
are -- have something in common:

51
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,450
They transport energy as they travel.

52
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,530
At a microscopic level, waves occur when the movement of one particle affects the particle next to it.

53
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,379
And to make that next particle start moving, there has to be an energy transfer.

54
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,819
But how can you tell how much energy a wave has?

55
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,479
Well, remember that an object in simple harmonic motion has a total energy of one-half,

56
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,119
times the spring constant, times the amplitude of the motion squared.

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,960
Which means for a wave caused by
simple harmonic motion,

58
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:59,340
every particle in the wave will also have that same total energy of (half k A squared).

59
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,960
All of this together tells us that a wave’s
energy is proportional to its amplitude, squared.

60
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:07,310
In other words, if you double the wave’s
amplitude, you get four times the energy.

61
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,890
Triple the amplitude, you get nine times the energy.

62
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:13,849
So why is the relationship between amplitude and energy transport so important?

63
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:17,649
Well, the intensity of a wave is related to
the energy it transports.

64
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:25,000
More specifically, its intensity is equal to its power, divided by the area it’s spread over and power is energy over time.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,110
So, changing the amplitude of a wave can change its energy -- and therefore its intensity

66
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,270
-- by the square of the change in amplitude.

67
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:35,149
And this relationship is extremely important for things like figuring out how much damage

68
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,479
can be caused by the shockwaves from an earthquake.

69
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,939
But waves also get weaker as they spread out, because they’re distributed over more area.

70
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,939
A spherical wave, for example -- one that
ripples outward in all directions --

71
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:50,779
will be spread over the surface area of a sphere that gets bigger and bigger, the farther the wave travels.

72
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,579
The surface area of a sphere is equal
to (4) times (pi) times (its radius squared).

73
00:04:54,579 --> 00:05:00,859
So, as a spherical wave moves farther from its source, its intensity will decrease by the square of the distance from it.

74
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,400
Two meters away from the source, and the intensity of the wave will be 4 times less than if you were 1 meter away.

75
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,750
Three meters away, and it’ll be 9 times
less.

76
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,879
That’s why being just a little bit farther away from the source of an earthquake can sometimes make a huge difference.

77
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,060
Now, let’s go back to the waves we were
making with the rope.

78
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,879
Suppose you attach one end of the rope to a ring that’s free to move up and down on a rod.

79
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,699
Then, with your hand, you send a pulse -- in the form of a crest, rippling along it.

80
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:28,409
When the pulse gets to the end of the rope, the rope slides along the rod.

81
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,920
But then, it slides back to where it was.

82
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,090
That motion -- the sliding back -- reflects
the wave back along the rope, again as a crest.

83
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:40,669
But something totally different happens, if you attach the end of the rope so it’s fixed, and can’t move.

84
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,449
Now, if you send a pulse along the rope, it
will still be reflected -- but this time, as a trough.

85
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,879
The wave was inverted.

86
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,180
That’s because, when the pulse reached the fixed end of the rope, it was trying to slide the end of the rope upward.

87
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,720
But it couldn’t, because the end of the
rope was fixed.

88
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,880
So, instead, the rope got yanked downward.

89
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,300
And the momentum from that downward movement carried the rope below the fixed end, inverting the wave.

90
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,660
Now sometimes, multiple waves can combine.

91
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:10,710
For example: Say you send two identical pulses -- both crests -- along a rope, one from each end.

92
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:16,959
When the two pulses overlap, they’ll combine to make one crest, with a higher amplitude than the original ones.

93
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,120
That’s called constructive interference
-- the waves build on each other.

94
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,230
Now, let’s say you do the same thing again.

95
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,890
This time, both waves have the same amplitude,
but one’s a crest and the other is a trough.

96
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,099
And when they overlap, the rope will be flat.

97
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,180
It looks like the waves just disappeared!

98
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,840
That’s called destructive interference,
when waves cancel each other out.

99
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,579
Constructive and destructive interference
happen with all kinds of waves --

100
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,418
pulse or continuous, transverse or longitudinal.

101
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:45,019
And sometimes, we can use the effects to our advantage.

102
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:49,759
Noise-canceling headphones, for example, work by analyzing the noise around you and generating

103
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:55,029
a sound wave that destructively interferes
with the sound waves from that noise, canceling it out.

104
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:59,448
There’s a lot more to talk about when it comes to the physics of sound, but we’ll save that for next time.

105
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:04,000
Today, you learned about traveling waves, and how their frequency, wavelength, and speed are all connected.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,829
We also talked about different types of waves,
including pulse, continuous, transverse, and

107
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,379
longitudinal waves, and how they all transport
energy.

108
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:14,379
Finally, we discussed reflection and interference.

109
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,909
