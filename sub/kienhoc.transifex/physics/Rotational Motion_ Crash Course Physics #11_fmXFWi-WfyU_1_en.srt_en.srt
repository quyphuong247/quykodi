1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,439
At this point, we’ve covered a lot of the
basics when it comes to how things move.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,589
But we’ve mostly been focusing on only one
type of motion: translational motion,

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:13,949
which is when something moves through space,
but doesn’t rotate.

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,500
But rotational motion is also a thing -- and
an important one.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,960
For example, the spin of a football -- both
the soccer and the non-soccer kind --

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,720
will affect the way it flies through the air.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,660
But the physics of rotational motion isn’t
all that different from the physics of translational motion.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,329
It still involves things like position, velocity,
and acceleration.

9
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,829
And many of the equations you use to describe
rotational motion will look really familiar to you.

10
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,439
But there are some important differences.

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,128
Like, instead of positions, there are angles.

12
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:42,248
And instead of points on a line, you follow
points along an arc.

13
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:47,588
And, there are times when rotational motion can explain things that sound impossible, but actually are true.

14
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:50,868
Like when a point on a spinning wheel,
is actually standing still.

15
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,619
So, the rules here are the same.

16
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:57,468
But rotational motion has what you might call
its own “circular logic.”

17
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:10,079
[Theme Music]

18
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,480
When it comes to translational motion, we tend to talk about position in terms of x and y.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,540
Where is this object, horizontally?
And where is it vertically?

20
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,729
Those axes make sense, because we’re usually
tracking the object’s motion along those directions.

21
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:26,019
But for rotational motion, we really want
to know the object’s angle -- what we call theta.

22
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,578
Say we have a big disk with a dot painted
on it.

23
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:33,900
If we call the top of the disk our starting point, then when the dot is at the top, its angle would be zero.

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,759
And when the dot is at the left, its angle
would be 180 degrees -- half of a full circle.

25
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,519
But! Even though we’ve been measuring angles
using degrees until now, there’s another

26
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,939
unit that physicists use a lot, and it’ll
be the main one we’ll use in this episode and the next.

27
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,299
That unit is called the radian, and its name
comes from the fact that it’s based on the radius of a circle.

28
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:55,520
If you think back to basic geometry, you’ll
recall that the circumference of a circle

29
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,468
is just 2, times pi, times the circle’s
radius, right?

30
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,699
Radians describe angles by essentially telling you how much of that circumference is covered by a given angle.

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,670
So, 360 degrees -- which is a full circle’s
worth of angles -- would be 2 pi radians.

32
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,689
180 degrees -- or half a circle’s worth
of angles -- would be pi radians.

33
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:18,419
And to convert any number of degrees to radians, you just multiply the degrees times pi and divide by 180.

34
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,439
So now we know how to describe the angle of
something that’s rotating.

35
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,759
But what about the velocity of its rotation?

36
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,479
Well, we’ve already learned that plain old translational, or linear, velocity is a measure of an object’s change in position.

37
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,379
And in the same way, rotational velocity is
a measure of an object’s change in angle.

38
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:37,699
This is known as its angular velocity, and
is represented by the lowercase Greek letter, Omega.

39
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,699
which I want to point out looks a bit like a W, but itsn't a W.

40
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,219
And, as you might have guessed by now, angular
velocity is the derivative -- or, the rate

41
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:48,449
of change -- of angular displacement with
respect to time.

42
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:52,109
But we can also describe an object’s rotation
in terms of its tangential velocity.

43
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,970
This is the same type of velocity we used
when we talked about the physics of uniform circular motion.

44
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,060
Remember? With the key spinning around on
a string?

45
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,719
And that vomit-causing carnival ride?

46
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,330
In those cases, we described how, when an
object moves along a circular path, its velocity

47
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,070
is perpendicular to the radius of the circle,
in the direction of the motion.

48
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,759
And, when you think about it, any rigid object
rotating around a fixed axis is basically

49
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,549
a set of points, all moving along circular
paths.

50
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,530
So, at any given moment, each of those points
will have a tangential velocity that depends

51
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,870
on the path it moves through -- specifically,
the radius of that path.

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,259
In fact, its tangential velocity will be equal
to its angular velocity, times the radius.

53
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,509
It’s easy to see why this makes sense, if
you picture the spokes of a rotating wheel.

54
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:36,370
All of the points along each spoke have to
have the same angular velocity, because they

55
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,689
all cover the same angular distance in the
same amount of time.

56
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:43,569
But to get from, say, the right-hand side
of the circle to the bottom, the points on

57
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:47,469
the outside of the wheel will pass through
a much bigger arc -- covering more space,

58
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,359
basically -- than the points on the inside.

59
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,210
So, the farther that a point on the spoke
is from the center of the wheel, the greater

60
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,340
its tangential velocity has to be.

61
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,750
Like circular motion, rotational motion can
also be periodic -- when the rotation repeats

62
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,439
after a set amount of time, which is represented by a  capital T, also called The Period.

63
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,319
And the equations that describe periodic motion
are pretty much the same as the ones we used

64
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,840
for a single point moving along a circular
path:

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,639
So the frequency, or number of rotations that
happen every second, is equal to one, divided by the period.

66
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,230
But frequency and angular velocity are really
just two different ways of describing the

67
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,090
same thing -- they just use different units.

68
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:27,439
Frequency is measured in rotations -- or revolutions
-- per second, and angular velocity is measured

69
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,730
in radians per second.

70
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,960
And one revolution is equal to the circumference
of the circle: 2 pi radians.

71
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,689
So, in order to convert from frequency to
angular velocity, all you need to do is multiply

72
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:37,889
the frequency by 2 pi.

73
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,449
Now, there’s a special case when it comes
to the velocity of rotating objects, and that’s

74
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,360
what’s known as rolling without slipping.

75
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,110
This kind of motion shows up in real life
all the time.

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,699
It’s what happens to your car’s tires
when you drive down the street, as long as

77
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,159
you aren’t skidding -- which, let’s hope
you aren’t.

78
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,260
And it’s what a train’s wheels do as they
move along the track.

79
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,719
But it turns out that the translational velocity
at the bottom of the wheel is /super weird/.

80
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,080
Mainly, because at any given moment, the point at the bottom of the wheel doesn’t have a translational velocity.

81
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,680
In other words, it doesn’t actually move.

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,290
To figure out why, let’s experiment with
a bicycle wheel.

83
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,819
If you roll the wheel along the floor for
one full rotation, that means that the entire

84
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,500
circumference of the wheel will touch the
floor, one point at a time.

85
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,139
And the center of the wheel will move forward
by a distance that’s equal to the circumference

86
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,120
of the wheel -- aka its radius, times 2 pi.

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,530
And the time it took to move that distance
was equal to the period of the motion.

88
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:30,459
So, the translational velocity of the center
was equal to the radius, times the angular velocity.

89
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:31,579
Now, what about the top of the wheel?

90
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:36,099
It has the same translational velocity as
the center of the wheel, plus the tangential

91
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,990
velocity that comes from the wheel’s rotation.
Because, at the top of the wheel, the tangential

92
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,860
velocity is pointing in the direction the
wheel is rolling in.

93
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,680
And in the same way, the bottom of the wheel
has the same translational velocity as the

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,139
center of the wheel, minus the tangential
velocity that comes from the wheel’s rotation.

95
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:56,240
Because at the bottom of the wheel, the tangential velocity is pointing opposite to the direction the wheel is rolling in.

96
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,480
Here’s the weird part:

97
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,720
We just saw that the translational velocity of the wheel is equal to the radius, times the angular velocity.

98
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,470
And we know that in general, the magnitude
of tangential velocity is also equal to

99
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,389
the radius, times the angular velocity.

100
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:13,960
So, the top of the wheel will be moving exactly twice as fast as the center of the wheel, relative to the ground.

101
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,659
Because, to get its total velocity, you add
the translational velocity to the tangential velocity.

102
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,230
But the bottom of the wheel won’t be moving
at all … because its total velocity is

103
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,879
its translational velocity minus the tangential,
since they’re moving in opposite directions.

104
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,668
As a result, the total velocity at the bottom
of the wheel is zero.

105
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:34,519
Even though the wheel is clearly moving relative
to the ground.

106
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,418
But if you look at the wheel’s motion at
any given instant, you’ll see that whatever

107
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:42,000
point is at the bottom of the wheel can’t
be moving relative to the ground.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,389
If it was moving relative to the ground
… that would be what we call slipping.

109
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,310
Like when a car is skidding on an icy ground:
The wheel isn’t turning, but the bottom

110
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,439
of the wheel is moving in relation to the
ground, because it’s sliding along on top of it.

111
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,860
But this wheel isn’t slipping -- its bottom has a total velocity of zero, because its velocities cancel out.

112
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,500
OK: I know I just blew your mind, so while
you put your head back together, I want to

113
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,569
talk about one more basic quality of rotational
motion: angular acceleration.

114
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,089
Based on what you already know about acceleration,
you can already guess that angular acceleration

115
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,019
is the derivative of angular velocity.

116
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,549
It’s represented by the lowercase Greek
letter alpha, and it describes how an object’s

117
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,879
angular velocity is changing over time.

118
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,810
And as an object rotates,  each point on it can actually accelerate in two different ways.

119
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,370
Radial acceleration is another term for what we’ve been calling centripetal acceleration up until now.

120
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,129
It’s the acceleration inward of any point
on our rotating object, and it’s equal to

121
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,889
the angular velocity, squared, times the radius.

122
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:41,790
But there’s also tangential acceleration,
which describes whether an individual point on a rotating object

123
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,939
is speeding up or slowing down.

124
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:48,279
So, like linear velocity, tangential acceleration
depends on the distance between the point

125
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,629
and the center of the object.

126
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,500
More specifically, it’s equal to the angular
acceleration, times the radius.

127
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,240
So you see, angular position, velocity, and
acceleration relate to each other in much

128
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,800
the same ways that linear position, velocity,
and acceleration do.

129
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,470
This allows us to talk about rotational motion
with terms and equations that are familiar

130
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,919
to us, once we’ve gotten the basics of translational
motion under our belts.

131
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,640
Next time, we’ll see how how the logic of rotational motion applies to another idea: momentum!

132
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,000
For now, you learned about the qualities of
rotational motion, including angular position,

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,129
angular velocity, periodic motion, and the
special case of rolling without slipping.

134
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:25,899
We also talked about angular acceleration,
as well as constant angular acceleration.
