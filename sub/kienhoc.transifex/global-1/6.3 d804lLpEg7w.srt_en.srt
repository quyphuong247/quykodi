00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490


1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,630
Are tax havens a new phenomenon?

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:10,570
The tax haven system has basically developed along with the third phase

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,240
of globalization, the global economic expansion that begins after the

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,710
Second World War.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,270
The growth of the offshore tax haven system was facilitated by the general

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,110
financial deregulation that occurred during the early 1970s.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:34,540
Since the '50s, '60s, '70s, you have had this flourishing, expanding system

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:42,280
of offshore tax havens, which we remember are not just small islands in

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,140
the middle of the ocean that are fringed by palm trees.

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,570
The term "offshore" does not refer to the geographical

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,460
location of the tax haven.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,140
It refers rather to what's called a secrecy jurisdiction.

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,610
In other words, this is a place, whether it's on an island or whether

14
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,510
it's in the middle of the city, where people are allowed to conduct

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,600
financial transactions essentially in secret, keep things off the books,

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,880
often be untraceable, and not be vulnerable to the collection of taxes.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,320
What does the expansion of the offshore tax system have to do with

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,290
global regulation?

19
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:30,200
One of the most important conclusions to be drawn from the operation of the

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,840
offshore tax haven system is that global regulation has

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,520
been essentially absent.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,500
The deregulatory trend that started during the 1970s and is still actually

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:54,410
very much in operation is an attitude toward the conduct of international

24
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,840
finance that, in effect, is laissez-faire.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,970
In other words, people are allowed to do what they do.

26
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,860
It is largely an unregulated environment.

27
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:14,740
It is an environment that needs global regulation but that does not currently

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,550
have anything like effective global regulation.

29
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:25,720
Now, one development we've seen during the year 2013 is that in several

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,390
countries, there was enough negative publicity about wealthy people and

31
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:39,020
corporations evading taxes by the use of offshore tax havens that there was

32
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:46,330
finally a critical mass of disapproval in the media that has actually

33
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:54,200
prompted initiatives in the direction of regulating tax havens in a way that

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,130
they never really have been regulated before.

35
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,680
How might these tax havens represent colonialism in disguise?

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,320
There are a number of offshore tax havens around the world that are

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,550
previous little territories of the British empire.

38
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:20,480
So what happened was that the British empire is eventually abolished in the

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,660
middle of the 20th century.

40
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:30,100
But little places like Jersey and the Channel Islands and certain small

41
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:37,750
places in the eastern Caribbean, the Cayman Islands, for example, that had

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,330
been parts of the British empire remained within the British

43
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,280
orbit, you might say.

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,170
And the city of London, which is to say the very powerful financial

45
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,920
district, the beating heart of finance in Britain maintained its connection

46
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,150
to these far-flung places.

47
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:09,400
And the city of London and the financial interests it represents

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,090
realized that these places would be ideal offshore tax havens and that

49
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:23,230
they could be retained, in effect, as outposts for the purpose of financial

50
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:30,480
manipulations, such as tax evasion, hiding, corporate ownership, shell

51
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:37,240
companies that are formed so that wealthy ownership cannot be traced

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,360
through a series of manufactured corporate identities.

53
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,480
One of the things you notice about these places is that, as in the Cayman

54
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,800
Islands, that there is a democracy deficit.

55
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:59,350
In other words, they are useful as outposts scattered around the world,

56
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,800
where one can make certain kinds of financial arrangements,

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
both legal and illegal.

58
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,770
These remain underdeveloped territories, they remain civically,

59
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:16,010
politically, legally underdeveloped places, because the point is not, as

60
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,280
in the case of the famous Cayman Islands, for example, south of

61
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,060
Florida, the point is not to develop these little bitty islands and

62
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,040
territories into viable communities.

63
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:37,490
The point is to use them as drop boxes for money and phony corporate

64
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,090
identities.

65
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,280
These are not wholesome, happy societies.

66
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,580
In the case of Jersey, what you have is a financial in-crowd that sticks

67
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,680
very closely together.

68
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,750
They're all in the financial game together.

69
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:05,760
And there's enormous peer pressure not to reveal the secrets, not to suddenly

70
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,620
develop a financial conscience that is not going to permit you to remain a

71
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,780
part of this very tightly controlled system.

72
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:23,580
And so what you have is a behind the scenes power being exercised by the

73
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:31,080
people back in Britain and Rather phony non-representative governments.

74
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,990
They may seem like representative governments, but these are going to be

75
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,170
politicians, who, for the most part, have been easily manipulable by the

76
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:46,320
big financial interests in London, who benefit from having these

77
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,180
tax havens out there.

78
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,380
How does tax avoidance promote social injustice?

79
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:59,620
When you remove very large amounts of money from, say, African societies

80
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,330
that need it for social development, the money's been moved out of there by

81
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,410
foreigners who are profiteering off a natural resource, say, or by the

82
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:17,730
so-called kleptocratic dictator who is nothing but a thief and who has been

83
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:24,490
able to stash billions in a place like Switzerland or other tax havens.

84
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:33,360
When you take that kind of money out of there, this is a recipe for

85
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,050
arrested social development.

86
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,080
The funding still isn't there.

87
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,970
So you have these obscene situations where you will have a very

88
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,930
super-wealthy, tiny political elite that has basically milked the oil

89
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:54,280
business or the mineral business dry on behalf of its own coterie and

90
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,590
stashed many billions overseas.

91
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:06,600
And next to them, formally under their care, a destitute population without

92
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,690
education, health care, short lifespans and the whole thing.

93
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:18,570
Now, there is another, more indirect way to, in effect, deny

94
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,645
funds to any society.

95
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:27,420
And that is not to pay what some would call your fair share of taxes.

96
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,670
If you have a corporation--

97
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,950
and there are enormous corporations that pay proportionately

98
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,970
very little in taxes.

99
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:43,860
When corporations avoid paying substantial amounts of taxes, they

100
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,090
are, in effect, shifting the burden of social development

101
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,340
onto ordinary taxpayers.

102
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,400
In other words, ordinary people with average incomes, even in the United

103
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,390
States, that are really quite modest are going to have to be taxed if

104
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,460
social development is going to occur, if there is going to be better health

105
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,150
care, if there is going to be better education, if there is going to be a

106
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,030
social safety net for 10s of millions of poor people, in the United States,

107
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,890
many of whom need food assistance, for example.

108
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:26,630
In other words, you can deny societies, whether they are developing

109
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,190
societies that are relatively poor or developed societies that are

110
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:39,630
relatively wealthy, you can deny a lot of funding for social development by

111
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:47,980
figuring out ways to avoid paying taxes, often with the collusion of the

112
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,280
government of the country to which the company formally belongs.

113
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,910
As one of these CEOs pointed out, for example, when he sat before a

114
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:04,720
congressional committee in 2013, if you don't like this arrangement, then

115
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,860
pass new laws.

116
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,810
And in a very real sense, he was right.

117
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,740
It is legitimate for a CEO to say if you don't like the way we have been

118
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,600
gaming the system, then change the law so that the big corporations to pay

119
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,990
more taxes to the US Treasury, thereby enabling the society to do more in

120
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,660
terms of developing various social institutions, aid to the poor, aid to

121
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,840
people who need food, et. cetera.

122
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,130
Where's the real difficulty in regulating tax havens in the United

123
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,240
States, like in Delaware?

124
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,100
Delaware is the home to almost a million corporations, no doubt post

125
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,730
boxes in certain buildings.

126
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:02,820
It's interesting that the campaign during the year 2013 against offshore

127
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,270
tax havens tend to be focused on places like Switzerland, which has

128
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:15,290
been manhandled by the United States Department of Justice, for example.

129
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:22,090
The Department of Justice has put huge pressure on the Swiss banks to reform

130
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,950
over the past several years.

131
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,580
And reform they have.

132
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,790
They have handed thousands of names to the Department of Justice of American

133
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,630
holders of Swiss bank accounts who are not paying their taxes.

134
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,670
So Switzerland has been a target.

135
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,500
And they have slowly been brought around to cooperate with the American

136
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,050
tax authorities, to a very considerable degree.

137
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:55,350
The Cayman Islands are a classic target of this sort of disapproval of

138
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,870
stashing money overseas.

139
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:03,190
Interestingly, Delaware is not.

140
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:10,430
And I think there is a certain amount of political favoritism playing out

141
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:20,230
here, because if it is wrong for the Cayman Islands off of Florida to be a

142
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,540
tax haven, then why is it that the state of Delaware should not be

143
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,240
subjected to the same kind of censure?

144
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,850
There's some selective indignation going on.

145
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,570
How does this topic of social justice relate to the other

146
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,380
topics in the course?

147
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:44,570
Social justice is related to several other topics in this course, take

148
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,410
labor, for example.

149
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:55,370
At any time you have a large group of workers who may be underpaid, they may

150
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:01,880
be doing dangerous work, they may very well be underpaid people doing

151
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,760
dangerous, risky work, then there is a social justice issue involved.

152
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,530


153
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:17,450
The state that administers legal justice that is going to be applied to

154
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:23,780
immigrant workers, there is, in fact, a globalization topic in the sense

155
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,810
that the movement of large numbers of workers across national boundaries is

156
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,130
a genuine globalization issue.

157
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:37,540
Unemployed Greek workers are a very good example to talk about here,

158
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,800
because Greek society, as of 2013, was falling apart in some

159
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,570
very serious ways.

160
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:52,100
This includes the labor market, so that you have especially significant

161
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,000
numbers of young Greeks who have simply given up on their prospects in

162
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,550
their own country, their own home, where their families are, where their

163
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:06,310
friends are, where they're speaking a small language that is not widely

164
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,800
spoken outside of this small country of 11 million people.

165
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:18,650
They and people from Africa, people from other parts of Southern Europe

166
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,590
are going to aspire to go to Northern Europe, where the

167
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,900
economies are healthier.

168
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,460
How are these people going to be treated?

169
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:33,700
What is their status as human beings who deserve certain kinds of social

170
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,510
justice, certain kinds of protections?

171
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:44,980
What are the responsibilities of the European Union with regard to many,

172
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:52,110
many potential immigrants who want to go north to survive, to find work in

173
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,130
the European Union?

174
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,880
But the European Union and many, many European countries individually have

175
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,680
had to figure out immigration policies.

176
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,340
These all sorts of social justice issues arise as you have these sorts

177
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,690
of the population movements, which are one aspect of globalization.

178
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,000
Thanks for talking to us about social justice, Dr. Hoberman.

179
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,250
Thank you.
