00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360


1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,450
On July 1, 2013, an Oslo newspaper reported that almost 9 out of 10

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,690
Norwegian cinema-goers had chosen to attend foreign rather than Norwegian

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,490
films over the previous six months.

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,180
There was a long way to go, the reporter commented, before the

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,460
government would succeed in its plan to get at least a quarter of

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,490
Norwegians to see their own films rather than foreign cultural products

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,780
such as Hollywood blockbusters.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,520
This report from a very small country raises some very large issues about

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,550
global popular culture.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,840
These concerns about where popular culture comes from and how it

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,570
circulates around the world have become urgent and controversial since

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,810
globalization began its ascent during the 1990s on its way to becoming one

13
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,710
of the most influential ideas on earth.

14
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,970
The most urgent and controversial aspect of popular culture in an age of

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,110
globalization is the power it is alleged to hold over

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,050
those who consume it.

17
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,470
The idea that popular culture can dominate large audiences and arrest

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,030
the cultural development of the people it holds in thrall was popularized in

19
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,740
the early 1950s by the American critic Dwight Macdonald.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,630
Mass culture, in his account, is manufactured wholesale for the market

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,710
and is an article for mass consumption like chewing gum.

22
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,490
It is, he says, an instrument of political domination.

23
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:44,200
It subordinates its audience to be imposed authority of its masters.

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,840
Macdonald's scathing critique of mass culture resembles the protests against

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,840
American cultural imperialism in that both critiques claim that the

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,460
audiences who are exposed to alien or debased forms of culture are rendered

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,530
passive and powerless to resist the force that now dominates them.

28
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,870
The upper classes, Macdonald says, use mass culture to dominate the masses

29
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,350
politically.

30
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,300
The critics of American cultural imperialism see the victims of an

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,430
invading popular culture as overwhelmed and unable to resist the

32
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,920
cultural products that have flooded into their lives and threatened to

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,060
displace the values and feelings they grew up with.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,380
Both mass culture and the reign of cultural imperialism produce what

35
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,130
Macdonald calls a homogenized culture, thereby threatening the existence of

36
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,950
distinctive national identities.

37
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,430
In other words, just as mass culture drives out high culture and its

38
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,100
improving influence on taste and character, foreign films supposedly

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,000
drive out domestic films that might have given citizens a more authentic

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,260
sense of themselves as members of a national community.

41
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,770


42
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,140
It was during the cultural and political upheaval of the 1960s that

43
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,400
popular culture became inextricably tied to questions about how power

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,050
works in the modern world.

45
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,100
If we think of popular culture as a potential vector of power and

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,780
influence, then it becomes useful to employ the concept of soft power as

47
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,550
opposed to the hard power that derives from military or economic strength.

48
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,650
The global consulting firm Ernst & Young defines soft power as the

49
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,720
ability to shape the preferences of others.

50
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,650
The ability of a nation to influence others tends to be associated with

51
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,450
intangible assets such as an attractive personality, culture,

52
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,460
political values and institutions, and policies that are seen as legitimate

53
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,330
or having moral authority.

54
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,190
They even publish a ranking of the world's top soft powers, as though

55
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,820
this thoroughly nebulous entity could somehow be quantified.

56
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,750
In any case, the United States heads the list, followed by France, Germany,

57
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,870
the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Japan, with China occupying eight

58
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,079
place, ahead of Russia, Brazil, and a few other countries.

59
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,550
The methodology for assigning countries to their appropriate

60
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,420
rankings is nowhere revealed.

61
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,210


62
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,230
This curious procedure does, however, provide us with an opportunity to note

63
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,170
that the formulating of rankings of this kind, including indices of

64
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,660
happiness and quality of life, are yet another symptom of globalization and

65
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,920
its obsession with measurement and competition.

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,620
This fixation on power and competition includes discovering new forms of

67
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,130
power that can be used to rank countries as they engage in various

68
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,240
kinds of global competition against each other.

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,720
In the context of this global competition for soft power, concerns

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,420
about the disproportionate and even global influence of the American film

71
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,810
industry are entirely understandable.

72
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,080
Exposure to too much foreign power of any kind of raises questions about

73
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,910
national vulnerability and even national identity.

74
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,430
If Norwegians, for example, are watching too much American television

75
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,150
and too many American films, if they are eating a lot of fast food that

76
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,770
comes from other cultures, if they are too well informed about the lives and

77
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,680
loves of various American celebrities, if they have embraced global internet

78
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,640
services like Facebook and Google, and if they are hearing and speaking

79
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,940
enough American English to provoke fears about the survival of their own

80
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,560
language, then it is not at all surprising that the inhabitants of

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,850
this small country may also be concerned about who they really are.

82
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,170
In these circumstances, it is understandable that a national

83
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:12,540
government might be concerned about whether its citizens are willing to

84
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,030
watch films produced by their own national film industry.

85
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,800


86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,410
The various forms of power the United States projects around the world mean

87
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,960
that the cultural predicament we have just described affects the lives of

88
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,430
enormous numbers of people in many societies around the world.

89
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,940
And in the current age of globalization, the popularity of

90
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,140
Hollywood films has become a familiar measuring stick for making judgments

91
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,170
about whether this form of American soft power has exceeded the limits of

92
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,090
what ought to be tolerated in a multicultural world.

93
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,640
In one of the early and best known books about globalization, Jihad vs

94
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,900
McWorld, published in 1995, the American political scientist Benjamin

95
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,700
Barber lamented that American films dominate the world market in a manner

96
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,260
that far outpaces its leadership in any other area.

97
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,660
And he adds, nowhere is American monoculture more evident or more

98
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,440
feared than in its movies and videos.

99
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,790
The idea that the world is experiencing not just Americanization

100
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,080
but American cultural imperialism is often heard.

101
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,630
Now let us take a look at the current balance of soft power between the

102
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,170
American film industry and those of the rest of the world.

103
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,175
The global market for all filmed entertainment will reach about $1.7

104
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:45,070
trillion by 2014.

105
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,170
It is worth noting that attendance at cinemas around the world accounts for

106
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,890
a very small fraction of a huge market that includes a video game market that

107
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,860
is more than twice the size of the cinema market.

108
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:07,310
The global box office for all films in 2012 was $34.7 billion dollars.

109
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,990
69% this revenue was generated outside of the United States and Canada, and

110
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,470
this number is slowly rising.

111
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:21,390
Hollywood's share came to 63% of the world total, and its share is slowly

112
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,090
going down.

113
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,300
While the number of Americans going to the cinema is stagnating, there is

114
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,070
explosive growth in markets such as Russia, China,

115
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,760
Brazil, and South Korea.

116
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,890
That is why, according to one Hollywood executive, the international

117
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,610
market outside the United States is becoming more important than the US

118
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,240
market for the most publicized American films.

119
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,670
Long before the cultural imperialism accusation became influential,

120
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,460
American leaders could see the exporting of American popular culture

121
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,080
as being in the national interest.

122
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,690
President Woodrow Wilson, for example, declared during the first World War

123
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,260
that "the film has come to rank as the very highest medium for the

124
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,820
dissemination of public intelligence.

125
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,270
And since it speaks a universal language, it lends itself importantly

126
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,910
to the presentation of America's plans and purposes." Wilson's conception of

127
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,470
film's international role was limited to its function as a loud speaker,

128
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,450
serving the interests of a powerful country.

129
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,870
Decades before the dissolution of the Western colonial empires, it did not

130
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,190
occur to Wilson that the rest of the world would eventually want to reply

131
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,110
to what American films were telling them.

132
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,360
Almost a century later, a State Department study found that popular

133
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,290
culture exports were actually harming the American image.

134
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,190
A 2007 Pew global attitudes survey came to the same conclusion.

135
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,820
It also found a sharp rise in the number of people outside the United

136
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,780
States who agreed that it's bad that American ideas and customs are

137
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,030
spreading here.

138
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,770


139
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,710
The idea that American entertainment or fast food companies impose a global

140
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,340
monoculture on the world is the core of the critique that is directed

141
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:21,460
against American cultural imperialism and its presumed effects on the 95% of

142
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,020
the world's population that lives outside the United States.

143
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,490
The current rise of the Chinese and other emerging economies makes this

144
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,260
historical moment particularly opportune for assessing the balance of

145
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,730
cultural power in the global film industry.

146
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,250
What is more, there are both quantitative and qualitative

147
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,330
dimensions this assessment must address.

148
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,720
The quantitative measures are revenues and the number of films produced by

149
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,800
the filmmaking countries.

150
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,880
While the revenue stream still favors Hollywood, the production numbers

151
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,760
favor Bollywood.

152
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,730
In 2012, India made 946 films, while the United States produced 611.

153
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,980
Bollywood took in a full 90% of the box office revenues in its own

154
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,840
national market, thereby putting to rest any fears one might have about

155
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,650
American cinematic imperialism establishing itself in

156
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,900
this part of the world.

157
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,180
