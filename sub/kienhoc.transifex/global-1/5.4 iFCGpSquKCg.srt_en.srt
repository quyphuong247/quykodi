1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,220
Section five is about the nation state in multinational corporations.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,850
Is a national champion a type or a special kind of multinational

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,000
corporation?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,380
Yeah, I would say a national champion is a special kind of multinational

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,320
corporation, in the sense that it receives special assistance from a

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,370
government.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:25,310
That assistance can be direct or indirect, it can be covert or overt.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:32,119
But the government makes a decision that special resources are going to be

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,800
invested in this particular corporation because it represents a

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,430
promising enterprise, and one that is going to be able to compete well in

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,850
the international market with other big multinationals.

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,840
What does your quote mean, national champions are the world's greatest

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,370
learning tool?

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,330
A national champion corporation is likely to be better developed,

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,820
wealthier, technologically more sophisticated than most other

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:10,830
corporations, so that if a national champion corporation forms some sort

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,580
of alliance, perhaps with a domestic or a foreign supplier which is not as

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,850
big, and not as technologically advanced, you can see the national

19
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:28,800
champion corporation as a reservoir of knowledge and expertise, research and

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,050
development.

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,200
How do you produce this particular airplane?

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,250
How do you produce this particular automobile or electronic product?

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:46,060
So in that sense, the national champion corporation is a fount of

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,680
knowledge from which other corporations can learn if the national

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,450
champion chooses to share that knowledge for its

26
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,640
own corporate purposes.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,170
How do companies become national champions?

28
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:06,240
A company becomes a national champion corporation by being selected by

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,530
powerful politicians in a government for special investment, special

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:18,590
development, so that it can produce products and services that are highly

31
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,460
competitive on the international market.

32
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,025
How do these politicians choose which companies they want to make into

33
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,360
national champions?

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,160
They or their advisors are going to make calculations about which company

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,380
has, for example, developed the most promising technology that has

36
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,450
possibilities in the international market.

37
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,250
Where is most of the research and development?

38
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,530
One aspect to this sort of state capitalism is that there are

39
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,070
non-professional criteria that can play a role in the selection of which

40
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,840
corporation, or corporations are picked to be national champions.

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,540
If, for example, there is a powerful politician with the ability to direct

42
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,690
government investment toward this company or that company, and that

43
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:27,040
politician has friends and or relatives who are in managerial posts

44
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,430
in this particular corporation, there's a pretty good chance that

45
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:39,820
favoritism is going to play a role in over-investing, in a sense, in this

46
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,450
particular corporation for reasons having to do with personal bias,

47
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,710
rather than professional assessment.

48
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,120
Why might state capitalism appeal to multinational corporations?

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,340
State capitalism can be very appealing to multinational corporations,

50
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:05,330
precisely because they can derive specific advantages from that special

51
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,970
relationship to the state.

52
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,200
Additional investment, the passage of laws that may favor their operations

53
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,709
as opposed to other domestic companies, or, even better, laws that

54
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,270
are going to make it easier for the favored national champion corporation

55
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:31,550
to do well domestically or internationally, because the legal

56
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,900
apparatus has been biased in such a way as to favor the operations of the

57
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,390
favored company.

58
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,550
Why do nations and corporations need each other to build a good society?

59
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,340
Governments and corporations, generally speaking,

60
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,460
have different functions.

61
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,750
A government is supposed to, in effect, coordinate the operations of

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,620
an entire society.

63
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,900
It is supposed to administer.

64
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,570
It is supposed to have a legislative branch that passes laws.

65
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,750
It is supposed to have a judicial apparatus that can adjudicate the

66
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,440
formulation and application of those laws.

67
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,345
It is supposed to provide citizenship.

68
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:18,190
It is supposed to provide passports.

69
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,780
It is supposed to provide police protection.

70
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,710
It is supposed to provide all sorts of regulations.

71
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:32,300
It's supposed to provide a standing army and a military apparatus.

72
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:40,070
Even a big corporation is not charged with those sorts of functions.

73
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,720
The role of the corporation is to produce products, to produce services,

74
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,390
to employ as many people as possible for the good of the economy.

75
00:05:53,390 --> 00:06:01,870
To produce exports that produce an inflow of resources into the economy

76
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,300
in which it is based, and of course, that gets complicated when you have

77
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:12,630
multinational corporations whose allegiances and operations can be

78
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,090
located in a variety of places.

79
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,850
One function of a multinational, from the government's point of view, is to

80
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,210
pay a substantial amount of taxes.

81
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,870
That, of course, in this day and age, is very problematic, because of the

82
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,630
complexity of tax law, the tricks, legal and illegal, that corporations

83
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:41,090
can use in order to avoid paying taxes to the quote unquote home government.

84
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:47,840
Multinational corporations are very good at using offshore tax havens as a

85
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,860
way to shelter income.

86
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,130
The governments have to find ways to convince the corporations, or force

87
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:02,230
the corporations to pay more taxes that can be used for social

88
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,100
development at home.

89
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,660
How does this section, Section Five, The Nation State, connect to the other

90
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,470
topics in this course?

91
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,290
The Nation State is related to virtually every other

92
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,210
topic in this course.

93
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,620
Let's take, for example, the global labor market.

94
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:26,100
One function of government is to regulate who is legally inside a

95
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,020
country, and who does not belong.

96
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:39,270
This will include, of course, workers, who are a labor resource, potentially,

97
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:46,530
or who may be resented as too much labor competition if they are allowed

98
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,530
inside the country.

99
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:55,000
So the regulation of the inflow and outflow of various work forces is a

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
responsibility of the nation state.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,330
Take the issue of transnational crime.

102
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:08,430
Every legitimate government has an interest in the combating and

103
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,320
reduction of transnational crime.

104
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:19,290
Interpol is an international police agency that helps to coordinate legal

105
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,670
efforts against criminals.

106
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,630
Can issue international warrants, for example.

107
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:32,010
And all nation states have an interest in this particular activity, because

108
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:38,500
every government has the responsibility to deal with legal

109
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,480
versus illegal activities.

110
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:49,700
It is certainly related to sports, Sport of Nationalism is a doctrine

111
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:57,660
that says that it is a responsibility of every modern society to produce

112
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,340
high performance athletes, because it is a prestigious thing to do.

113
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:10,500
Because it expresses the willpower of the nation, and I believe that the

114
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,860
virtually global phenomenon of Sport of Nationalism, countries taking

115
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,480
seriously the idea that they are responsible for producing elite

116
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,155
athletes, is nothing less than a global ideology.

117
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:25,970
It is compulsion.

118
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:32,780
And I think for many policy makers and politicians, there is some sort of

119
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,820
vague association between the production of elite athletes and the

120
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,640
national security.

121
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:44,760
The nation state is related to media, in the sense that many countries have

122
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,580
established national broadcasters, much in the same way that nation

123
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,770
states have established national airlines.

124
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:04,180
In a certain sense, you could say analogically that a national airline,

125
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:10,840
or a national broadcaster is a certain kind of national champion, which is

126
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:18,930
getting special government attention and investment, because the people who

127
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:24,880
run the country are, I think sincerely convinced that the country needs this

128
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,330
sort of representation along with national champion corporations that

129
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,720
can create wealth.

130
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,260
Thank you for talking to us about the nation state, Dr. Hoberman.

131
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,510
Thank you.

132
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,030
