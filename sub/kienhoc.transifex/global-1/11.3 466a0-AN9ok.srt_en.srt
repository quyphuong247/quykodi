1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,150
Section 11 is about small country self-assertion.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,140
Does a small country have an advantage over other small countries

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,910
if it is a tax haven?

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,900
Not necessarily.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,920
A small financial elite in that tax haven is going to be making money off

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,880
of the huge sums that are taken in for the purpose of tax evasion, concealing

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,030
the ownership of the money, concealing the owner of a corporation setting up

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,910
shell companies, that sort of thing.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,460
So it's really a very small number of people on that island, or in that

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:45,730
territory that are going to be making big money off of the huge deposits

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,560
that are there.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,970
I think there's a conspicuous disadvantage in that some of these

13
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,940
places are really quite non democratic, they're authoritarian,

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,210
there are tremendous pressures for conformity, because what you've got

15
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,560
going is an arrangement.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,250
It's a kind of a racket, a scam to one degree or another.

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,360
There's an in crowd that is benefiting from this arrangement, and that is

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,070
going to leave a lot of people who are butchers and bakers, and candlestick

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:25,930
makers who are not sharing in the proceeds.

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,290
Not like the top people are doing.

21
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,590
So that the quality of the civil society of a tax haven can suffer,

22
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,560
because it is a kind of a racket that is managed by relatively few people

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,020
who are not interested in democratic values or procedures.

24
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,520
Does specialization in a niche market make small countries vulnerable?

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,980
Potentially, yes.

26
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:59,140
If that market goes away and the small country is reliant on that particular

27
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,140
industry or product, then it is going to have to scramble to find a way to

28
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:12,000
replace the economic benefits that it has lost by specializing in a

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,510
particular niche market.

30
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:20,060
Now, no modern small country is just going to be in one market, but there's

31
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,420
going to be diversification.

32
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,990
In small countries that do very well, such as the Scandinavian countries,

33
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:35,350
you will find a variety of economic activities that are beneficial, so

34
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:42,920
that if one big drug company goes out of business in Denmark, for example,

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,970
there are going to be other enterprises that are there to provide

36
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,410
employment, and to pay taxes to the state.

37
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,580
Why might smaller countries have more realistic perspectives than larger

38
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,620
countries about what is happening in the world?

39
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,690
Interesting question.

40
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,500
There are at least a few economists who have thought about this, and the

41
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:14,890
conclusion that they have come to is that a developed, well run small

42
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:22,080
country is going to develop a kind of a sensing system about conditions in

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,540
the outside world, that there is a sense of vulnerability that motivates

44
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:35,490
them to pay more careful attention to the forces in the outside world than

45
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,920
is generally the case in larger societies that feel less vulnerable.

46
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,270
That have more political power, that have more economic power, that have

47
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,930
more military power.

48
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:54,440
So in this sense, the model is that is the mouse in the mouse cat

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,790
relationship that has got to be careful, in a way, that the larger cat

50
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:07,810
does not, because the cat is not vulnerable to the mouse, it's the

51
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,250
other way around.

52
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,770
So the theory is that some small societies are going to develop a kind

53
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:22,630
of a sensing system that is going to alert decision makers to changes in

54
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:28,160
conditions in the outside world to a greater degree than would be the case

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,660
in most larger countries, which feel less vulnerable.

56
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:38,330
And the result of that very careful attention that is being paid to

57
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,980
conditions outside the small country can pay off in terms of decision

58
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,620
making benefits about, well, we'd better get out of that market, it

59
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,700
would be a good idea to get into this one.

60
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,870
How is it possible that small, progressive, democratic states like

61
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,260
Norway and small, repressive, authoritarian regimes like Qatar are

62
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,520
both successful on the global stage?

63
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,790
Well, they are both very successful economically, and the answer in both

64
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,020
cases is oil.

65
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,800
That if a small place has lots and lots of a coveted natural resource, in

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,110
the case of Norway it's oil and gas, in the case of Qatar, it's oil, then

67
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:32,680
it will, unless this resource is really mismanaged, this is going to

68
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,620
give a huge economic advantage to a small country, or in the case of

69
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,620
Qatar, a city-state.

70
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,240
Both of these small societies are going to have relatively high per

71
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,580
capita incomes because there's lots of oil revenue, and a relatively small

72
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,470
number of people who are going to be claiming it in effect is as part of

73
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,230
the national wealth.

74
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,310
How do small countries combat the influx of the English language?

75
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:13,340
Small countries in Europe have created historically accommodated the power of

76
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:20,020
the English language in the wider world by accommodating to it.

77
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,730
You have to be in a variety of positions if you're in international

78
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,110
business, or academia, or something, you have to be multilingual.

79
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,060
So that small countries, probably to a greater degree than large countries

80
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,240
are literally forced to become multilingual.

81
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,830
And the second language is almost always, in this day and age, it's

82
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,750
going to be English.

83
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,910
There's another dimension to this, and that is to what extent is a small

84
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:57,150
society going to, not as in the first case, be using English as a resource

85
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,140
by which to build an economy, build careers, et cetera?

86
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,200
But to what extent is a small society going to feel that the sheer power of

87
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,730
the English language in a variety of media is going to constitute a threat

88
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,820
to their own culture, is going to constitute a threat

89
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,575
to their own language?

90
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:24,340
Now, there are countries that set up committees that try to prescribe

91
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,180
certain vocabulary to replace English words that are very common.

92
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:36,610
This is not terribly successful, but it can happen that in a small society,

93
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,310
there will be people wondering about whether that small language, which is

94
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,570
experiencing tremendous exposure to English, the entire population, for

95
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,900
the most part, is experiencing tremendous exposure to English may be

96
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,790
concerned about whether that small language is in decline, or whether in

97
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,610
the long term, it may even be headed for extinction.

98
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,940
How does this topic connect to the other sections in the course?

99
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,130
It connects to any number of other sections in the course.

100
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,360
For example, take sports.

101
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,640
Sport of nationalism is the idea that it is incumbent upon a nation state to

102
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,530
produce high performance athletes for purposes of morale building, for the

103
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,090
purpose of creating prestige for that country, for the purpose of

104
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:35,270
demonstrating national viability on a global stage.

105
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:42,980
It is quite possible that a sport of nationalism is more intense in certain

106
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,780
small countries because sports is a disproportionate opportunity for that

107
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,900
really small country to manifest itself on a global scale.

108
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,840
Norway has done very well this way, in a couple of ways.

109
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,990
The skiers they produce have won lots and lots of Olympic and other

110
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,040
international medals, and create a certain image for that country.

111
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,870
When the Norwegians put on the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympic games, that

112
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,030
was a big prestige boost for this very small country.

113
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:25,000
And the prime minister at the time exploited the success of this small

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,390
country's very successful winter Olympiad in all sorts of ways.

115
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,870
The small country theme is also related to the social justice theme in

116
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:41,460
that what about the authoritarian, small country or city-state that does

117
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:48,040
very well because it has economic resources, but which also suppress

118
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,320
civil rights, and perhaps abuses on a massive scale the foreign workers it

119
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,050
imports to do all sorts of manual and skilled labor?

120
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:05,200
The same sort of principle applies to the offshore tax havens.

121
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,610
Really small places that are being abused in a way that in effect

122
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,580
deprives entire populations, especially poor ones, of social

123
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,440
justice by removing a great deal of wealth offshore that ought to be on

124
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,960
shore promoting social development.

125
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,860
The theme of a global transportation system is relevant to certain small

126
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:38,650
countries in the sense that Norway and Denmark, for example, have produced

127
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:46,050
disproportionately large fleets of merchant ships, Denmark producing the

128
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,650
biggest container ships in the world.

129
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:54,790
Which is a wealth producer, because you're going to have a big

130
00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:00,440
corporation, in this case the Maersk Corporation, which is a tremendous

131
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:08,560
institution within the small country of Denmark, but projecting economic

132
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,400
power across the world in the form of merchant ships.

133
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,010
Thank you for talking to us about small country

134
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,430
self-assertion, Dr. Hoberman.

135
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,680
Thank you.

136
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,210
