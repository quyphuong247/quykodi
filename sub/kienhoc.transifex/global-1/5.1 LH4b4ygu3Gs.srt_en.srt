1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,530
The effects of the globalization process on the current status and

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,480
future prospects of the nation state is an essential topic for any course

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,290
on globalization.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,690
As Professor Mandred Steger has written, global markets frequently

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,560
undermine the capacity of governments to set independent national policy

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,140
objectives and impose their own domestic standards.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,280
Hence, we ought to acknowledge the decline of the nation state as a

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,290
sovereign entity.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,270
In his pioneering 1997 book on globalization, One

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,620
World, Ready or Not--

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,900
The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism, the American journalist William

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,980
Greider describes the various ways in which nation states have lost power to

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,950
the global markets for commodities and cultural products to multinational

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:56,560
corporations and to supranational organizations that offer benefits at

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,020
the cost of giving up a measure of national autonomy.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,880
Global markets challenge the nation state's economic viability by calling

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,470
into question the ability of its various corporate enterprises to

18
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,130
compete with foreign producers.

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,940
The global market can also fragment a national community by conferring

20
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,190
benefits on one group of citizens while inflicting economic or

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,770
environmental hardship on other citizens who are unable to put up

22
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,920
resistance to the forces of globalization.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,410


24
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,670
Greider points out that the obsession with nations and competition misses

25
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,060
the point of what is happening.

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,190
The global economy divides every society into new camps of conflicting

27
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,320
economic interest.

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,210
But what is the national interest when two factions within a country are

29
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,860
ultimately favored or ruined by global economic forces?

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,010
Global economic integration can also turn a national corporation into a

31
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,470
multinational corporation that regards itself as an independent entity that

32
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,670
owes no special loyalty or tax payments to the nation state in which

33
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,220
it originated.

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,640
The global labor market catalyzes large migrations of workers across

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,570
national borders, thereby changing the dynamics of domestic employment

36
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,230
markets and even threatening the integrity and continuity of national

37
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,320
identity in the eyes of many citizens.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,140
These agreed citizens may then support or actively participate in

39
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,510
anti-immigrant political activity, thereby roiling national politics in

40
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,300
at times unpredictable ways.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,060
Today, xenophobic political parties have established themselves in many

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,520
Western European countries.

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,300
And there are other threats to national autonomy.

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,490
Unrestricted movement of transnational investment capital can threaten

45
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:07,090
governments by destabilizing economic sectors that cannot survive sudden

46
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,650
withdrawals of capital by international investors who have no

47
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,310
stake in the well-being of national communities or their economies.

48
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,170
Wealthy hedge funds can take positions in foreign currency markets that have

49
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,350
the capacity to depress the value of national currencies.

50
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,980
The principles of global finance, as Greider points out, are transparent

51
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,660
and pure, maximizing the return on capital without regard to national

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,513
identity or political and social consequences.

53
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:42,670


54
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,460
One of the great dramas of the current globalization process has been the

55
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,170
contest for power between nation states and the great multinational

56
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,440
corporations that, along with the state capitalist enterprises of the

57
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,340
emerging world, dominate the global economy.

58
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,020
One aspect of this contest is the power of the state to collect taxes

59
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,870
from multinational corporations that have devised many clever and often

60
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,230
legal schemes that have allowed them to pay little or no tax on profits

61
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,180
they've made outside of their home countries.

62
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,240
Multinationals' use of offshore tax havens, often aided and abetted by the

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,220
very governments they deprive of tax revenue, is a longstanding abuse of

64
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,240
power that we will examine in another section of this course.

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,640
At this point, our task is to examine the relationship between American

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,940
multinationals and the American government.

67
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,800
Only weeks after the traumatic events of September 11, 2001, William Greider

68
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,350
asked some pointed questions about the relationship between American

69
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,220
multinationals and the nation state which had afforded them the

70
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,680
protections they need in order to operate.

71
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,780
"Where does loyalty reside," he asked, "for those American corporations that

72
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,680
have rebranded themselves as global firms?"

73
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,040
Greider provides some strikingly the denationalized statements from those

74
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,190
he calls the architects and cheerleaders of corporate

75
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,770
globalization.

76
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,370
"The nation state has been eclipsed," they explain, "and no longer has the

77
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,380
power to determine its own destiny.

78
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,430
The national interest," they assert, "now lies in making the world safe for

79
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,540
globalizing commerce and capital."

80
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,040
From this perspective, the executives of American multinationals have

81
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,250
sometimes asserted that their firms owe no special loyalty

82
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,030
to the United States.

83
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,570
"The United States does not have an automatic call on our resources," a

84
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,550
Colgate Palmolive executive once stated.

85
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,390
"There is no mindset that puts this country first."

86
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,320
The former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch, described GE as a

87
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,330
borderless company.

88
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,490
An American aerospace executive who supervised McDonnell Douglas's

89
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,490
production in China once stated, "We're in the business of making money

90
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,140
for our shareholders.

91
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,540
If we have to put jobs and technology in other countries, then we go ahead

92
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,160
and do it."

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,713
