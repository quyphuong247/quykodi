00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670


1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,500
The global regulation of tobacco products may be the most important

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,120
regulatory problem on Earth.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,740
The World Health Organization, or WHO, estimated in 1999 that half of the 1.1

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,380
billion smokers alive at that time would die prematurely from tobacco

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,140
related illness.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,340
In 2012, Professor Gregory Connolly, a researcher at the Harvard School of

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,320
Public Health, reported that tobacco had killed one hundred million people

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,970
during the 20th century, and that it could cost a billion

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,760
lives in the 21st century.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,920
The Australian lawyer Neil Francey proposed in 1999 that the production

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,150
and sale of tobacco products arguably constitutes a crime against humanity.

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,240
Since, in addition to acts of extermination, forced prostitution and

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,360
sterilization, crimes against humanity in the eyes of the International

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,030
Criminal Court include other inhumane acts of a similar character

15
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,700
intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,230
or physical health.

17
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,480
Even if the directors and executives of tobacco companies did not intend to

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,510
cause harm, he added, such conduct is comparable to manslaughter, where

19
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,380
death is an unintended consequence of a recklessly negligent act.

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,640
When in 2012 the High Court of Australia ruled six to one in favor of

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,540
requiring cigarette packaging to display public health warnings and

22
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,960
graphic pictures of smoking-related diseases, even the dissenting judge

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,910
called the manufacturers of tobacco products purveyors of lies and death.

24
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,940
Today, about five million people die each year due to

25
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,330
tobacco-related illness.

26
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,900
In short, there appear to be grounds for declaring tobacco a global menace

27
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,520
that should not be tolerated anywhere on Earth.

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,680
The official global consensus on the medical damage done by tobacco is

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,870
expressed in the World Health Organization Framework Convention on

30
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,600
Tobacco Control, which was adopted by the 56th World Health Assembly on May

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:27,130
21, 2003, and went into effect on February 27, 2005.

32
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,780
The Framework Convention was a response to what the WHO called the

33
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,440
globalization of the tobacco epidemic.

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,030
In fact, the WHO's explanation of the health threat posed by tobacco amounts

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,420
to a primer in the basic dynamics of economic globalization.

36
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,900
The spread of the tobacco epidemic is facilitated through a variety of

37
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,450
complex factors with cross-border effects, including trade

38
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,350
liberalization and direct foreign investment.

39
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,480
Other factors, such as global marketing, transnational tobacco

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,220
advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and the international

41
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,260
movement of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes, have also contributed to

42
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,190
the explosive increase in tobacco use.

43
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,640
In fact, it is economic globalization that accounts for the fact that the

44
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,470
tobacco multinationals continue to thrive, despite their role as the

45
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,380
greatest menace to human health on the face of the planet.

46
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,660
The story of how the global tobacco industry has prospered despite the

47
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,440
regulatory measures enforced by the WHO and by many countries is a lesson

48
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,380
in how political power is exercised in the age of market globalism.

49
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,500
Tobacco, according to two health experts, is at the center of the

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,110
contradictions inherent in the evolving process of globalization.

51
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,870
It is where the goals of a set of multinationals are clearly in conflict

52
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,710
with public health and welfare, and where globalization of values such as

53
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,020
accountability and corporate responsibility are

54
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,980
under severe pressure.

55
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,560
The trans-nationalization of marketing and promotion of harmful commodities

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,780
such as tobacco is one important component of globalized

57
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,200
public health threats.

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,390
In other words, there is a contradiction between the social

59
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,610
irresponsibility of profit-seeking corporations, and protecting hundreds

60
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,020
of millions of people around the world from the unnecessary suffering and

61
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,690
premature death that is inflicted primarily on the

62
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,080
inhabitants of poor countries.

63
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,650
A major tactic of the tobacco multinationals has been to challenge

64
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,700
the statutory authority of nation states to protect the health of their

65
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,670
own populations.

66
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,180
Industry strategists, the health experts report, are encouraging the

67
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,400
homogenization of the global tobacco industries and the creation of a new

68
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,520
global shared culture enshrined in the concept of a global smoker.

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,200
And from the perspective of the tobacco companies, they are the ones

70
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,860
who must defend the rights of these global smokers from the machinations

71
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,280
of the governments that are trying to save them from a lifetime of smoking

72
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,360
and its terrible costs.

73
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,440
Elsewhere in this course, we have examined struggles for power between

74
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,280
multinationals and nation states.

75
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,170
These contests have typically involved taxation, and the outsourcing of jobs

76
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,210
to cheaper labor markets overseas--

77
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,960
in short, the economic health of a society.

78
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,430
The uniquely perverse feature of the struggles between nations and tobacco

79
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,900
companies is that it is human beings, not local economies,

80
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,150
who are being ruined.

81
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,310


82
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,230
The tobacco industry's defense of the global smoker has taken the form of

83
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,230
lawsuits filed against countries that try to pass anti-smoking legislation.

84
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,640
In the case of the Australian Packaging Law of 2012, British

85
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,540
American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International, a veritable global

86
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,700
alliance for lung cancer, filed suit against the Australian government

87
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,940
claiming that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act amounted to an

88
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,560
acquisition of property.

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,180
According to one report, the various parties enlisted battalions of

90
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,360
lawyers, the proceedings received intense media attention, and the

91
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,800
public galleries were packed.

92
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,980
But even battalions of corporate lawyers could not prevent the

93
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,325
Australian government from legislating on behalf of public health.

94
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:53,300


95
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,800
The fact that this high court action was hailed by the WHO as a landmark

96
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,900
ruling well into the 21st century tells us something about the sheer

97
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,740
political power of the tobacco multinationals.

98
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,310
Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the WHO, declared that with

99
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,910
Australia's victory, public health enters a brave new

100
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,310
world of tobacco control.

101
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,180
Plain packaging is a highly effective way to counter industry's ruthless

102
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,060
marketing tactics.

103
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,000
The lawsuits filed by big tobacco, she said, look like the death throes of a

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,250
desperate industry.

105
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,790


106
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,740
Dr. Chan's optimism about the prospects for putting big tobacco out

107
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,510
of business was due to the fact that a nation state had won a clear-cut legal

108
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,450
victory over the tobacco multinationals and their army of

109
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,670
lawyers and lobbyists.

110
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,700
Nor was she alone in predicting a final victory over this scourge.

111
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,010
Around this time, the head of the Israel Council for the Prevention of

112
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,010
Smoking declared that the days of organized tobacco around

113
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,100
the world are numbered.

114
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,320
The government of New Zealand had announced in 2010 that all of the

115
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,740
country's public spaces would be smoke-free by the year 2025.

116
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,860
Finland has announced a similar goal for 2040.

117
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,370
An International Public Health Conference titled "The End Game for

118
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:26,390
Tobacco" is scheduled for New Delhi in September of 2013.

119
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,800
But a look at the conference program makes it clear that these public

120
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,820
health activists are planning, not for a victory any time soon, but rather

121
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,799
for the long haul.

122
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,090
Any prognosis regarding the future of tobacco consumption must take into

123
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,300
account the legal and political war the transnational tobacco companies

124
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,540
have been waging against countries that attempt to reduce tobacco use,

125
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,120
and against the World Health Organization itself.

126
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,740
This is a global campaign, directed at limits imposed on the advertising of

127
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,500
tobacco products, the size of health warnings on cigarette packages, the

128
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,690
placement of disturbing images of smoking-related disease effects on

129
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,870
packages, and higher cigarette taxes.

130
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,660
In 2010, for example, Philip Morris International sued the government of

131
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,780
Uruguay on the grounds that it was over-regulating tobacco.

132
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,300
The Philip Morris lawyers claim that Uruguay's placement of disturbing

133
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,610
pictograms and expanded health warnings on cigarette packages

134
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,140
violated a bilateral investment treaty.

135
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,870
The provisions of this treaty prohibit subjecting investments to unreasonable

136
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,960
requirements that are alleged by the company to play no verifiable role in

137
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,300
relation to the claimed public health goals.

138
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,600
In summary, the tobacco company was using investment law in an attempt to

139
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,580
show that a government's efforts to restrict tobacco use violated the

140
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,900
company's rights as an investor.

141
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,660
This strategy offered the additional advantage of focusing entirely on

142
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,660
treaty rights, while distracting attention away from the proven

143
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,150
relationship between tobacco and disease.

144
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,960
Philip Morris also sued Brazil, claiming that its proposed cigarette

145
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,980
packaging images of tobacco-related disease were inaccurate, and that the

146
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,760
display of such images would vilify tobacco companies.

147
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,940
They're using litigation to threaten low and middle income countries, the

148
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,380
head of WHO's Tobacco-Free Initiative commented.

149
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,470
Intimidation of governments by tobacco companies has also affected

150
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,520
policymakers in high income countries.

151
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,920
In the 1990s, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company cowed the Canadian

152
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,280
Parliament by threatening to bring a claim under the North American Free

153
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,240
Trade Agreements investment rules.

154
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,840
R.J. Reynolds defeated the proposed Canadian Plain Packaging measure by

155
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,380
invoking the prospect of Canada's having to pay hundreds of millions of

156
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,730
dollars in compensation to the company.

157
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,530
Shortly thereafter, in 1995, the Canadian Supreme Court put the final

158
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,350
nail in the coffin of Canada's Tobacco Products Control Act.

159
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,990
Two years later, however, the Canadian government, exercising what one

160
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,500
observer called political will, demonstrated its opposition to

161
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,675
corporate intimidation by enacting new tobacco control legislation.

162
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:44,050


163
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,840
The secret and underhanded political strategies of the tobacco

164
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,250
multinationals were revealed in detail in 2000 with the release of a World

165
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,070
Health Organization document titled "Tobacco Company Strategies to

166
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,665
Undermine Tobacco Control Activities." According to the director general of

167
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:09,140
the WHO, the tobacco companies had made efforts to prevent implementation

168
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,880
of public health policy and efforts to reduce funding of tobacco control

169
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,600
within UN organizations.

170
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,660
The industry's strategies included discrediting key individuals, lobbying

171
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,810
journalists.

172
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:28,040
Cultivating relationships with WHO staff, consultants and advisers,

173
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,570
placing industry consultants in positions at WHO, thereby compromising

174
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,710
the integrity of policy making at WHO.

175
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,630
Manipulating the scientific and public debate about the health effects of

176
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:47,910
tobacco, and secret monitoring of WHO meetings and conferences.

177
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,270
A principal strategy of the tobacco multinationals has been to persuade

178
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,480
developing countries that tobacco control is a first-world issue that

179
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,290
threatens their economic viability.

180
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,750
Giving up tobacco as a cash crop would, the companies warned, produce

181
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,850
economic destabilization in tobacco growing countries.

182
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,290
Tobacco control would cost more than the health damage done by the use of

183
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,760
tobacco, they said.

184
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,130
Developed countries that promoted tobacco control in developing

185
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,540
countries were, the company said, demonstrating their lack of concern

186
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,220
for the poor.

187
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,630
The sheer cynicism of this whispering campaign is evident in what the

188
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,640
tobacco companies did not tell their third-world partners.

189
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,260
Tobacco companies had been focusing their marketing efforts on developing

190
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,510
countries in Africa and Asia, precisely because successful

191
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,070
anti-tobacco measures in the first-world have greatly reduced the

192
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,445
number of smokers in developed societies.

193
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:54,130


194
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,610
The nature of the African predicament became clear in 2007 when the Nigerian

195
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,680
federal government filed a suit in the high court of Abuja against British

196
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,050
American Tobacco, Philip Morris International, and International

197
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,890
Tobacco Limited.

198
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,810
The Nigerian government sought $42.4 billion in damages on account of

199
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,010
alleged damage to Nigerians' health.

200
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,310
It was also attempting to restrict access to tobacco products in schools

201
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,920
and hospitals.

202
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,810
In the state of Lagos, the number of smokers was

203
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,050
increasing by 20% each year.

204
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:37,010
They are trying to get the younger generation addicted, a government

205
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,080
lawyer said.

206
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,080
It turned out, however, that the Nigerian government bore some of the

207
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,590
responsibility for its own tobacco epidemic.

208
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:52,080
It had offered concessions to attract the tobacco companies to Nigeria.

209
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,770
It was not enforcing two tobacco control laws that were already on the

210
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:02,230
books, and it was afraid that Nigerian lawsuits against the tobacco companies

211
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,580
might deter other multinationals from investing in Nigeria.

212
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,610
In a word, tobacco control in Nigeria was caught on the horns of a

213
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,310
globalization dilemma.

214
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,730
Opening an underdeveloped country to foreign investment did bring some

215
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,250
economic growth, and a great deal of disease at one and the same time.

216
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,730
