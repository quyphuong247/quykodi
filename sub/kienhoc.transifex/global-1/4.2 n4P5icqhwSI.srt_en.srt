00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170


1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,100
Do governments ever have the right to censor global media for what they

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,800
regard as defensive purposes?

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,170
What about the importance Chinese authorities ascribe to national

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,180
conditions and cultural traditions?

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,660
In fact, many governments, and often those that are to some degree

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,450
theocratic, do impose media censorship.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,300
Is it, then, improper to ask whether unlimited access to the internet is

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,160
unnecessary, or perhaps even undesirable?

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,330
It was, after all, the American, Thomas Friedman, not a Chinese

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,380
official, who pointed out years ago that the internet is, to some degree,

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,600
an open sewer.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,310
And it is this defensive strategy that many politicians invoke, on behalf of

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,640
their filtering of internet content, before it can reach populations it

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,380
might stimulate or change in ways that government officials regard as

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,980
politically undesirable.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,500
China has become the global leader in censoring the internet

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,410
within its own borders.

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,710
The Economist magazine reported in 2013 that the Chinese state has shown

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,880
great skill in bending the technology to its own purposes, enabling it to

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,770
exercise better control of its own society, and setting an example for

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,810
other repressive regimes.

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,800
There is an international market for these methods.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,020
Both China and Russia sell other countries technology for monitoring

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,270
and filtering the internet.

25
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,760


26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,930
The goal of this cyber censorship is the development

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,820
of a domestic internet--

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:46,010
a self-contained world that offers, for example, Chinese versions of many

29
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,310
of the online services and entertainments offered by major social

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,060
networking sites like Facebook.

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,310
This cyber world is effectively sealed off from the global internet, and can

32
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,640
be thought of as an authoritarian response to what the Chinese

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,150
government calls hostile foreign forces online.

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,400
What they call purifying the domestic internet space aims at maintaining

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,095
social stability while fending off political subversion from abroad.

36
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,110


37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,260
In a previous lecture, we heard about the early non-aligned movement of the

38
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,410
1960s and its demand that the Western media powers should no longer exercise

39
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,570
their effective monopoly over global mass media.

40
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,360
This political declaration endorsed the principle of national

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,790
self-determination that China represents today in

42
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,810
the age of the internet.

43
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,770
We listened earlier to the debate about internet access between

44
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,280
Secretary of State Clinton and Chinese authorities that accompanied the

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,550
Google China quarrel over internet censorship in 2010.

46
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,420
We heard the Secretary of State talk about threats to the free flow of

47
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,770
information.

48
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,400
We heard President Obama endorse unrestricted internet access.

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,220
We heard Sergey Brin, of Google, decry the forces of totalitarianism.

50
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,860
Where the United States stood on this matter was clear.

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,760
And the other Western democracies could be counted on to support the

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,840
American position on open access to the web.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,130
From a Western perspective, Chinese policy regarding the management of the

54
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,310
internet is, in a literal sense, totalitarian in its ambition to create

55
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,745
a hermetically sealed cybersphere that is immune from foreign influences.

56
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:43,760


57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,330
As we consider the competing arguments for and against open access to the

58
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,250
net, we should keep in mind that the Chinese government is by no means

59
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,000
alone in its insistence that every nation state has the right to shape

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,890
its relationship to the internet in conformity with its own standards.

61
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,810
At the World Conference on International Telecommunications, held

62
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,970
in Dubai in December of 2012, it became clear that the Chinese model is

63
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,110
widely admired by many authoritarian governments that want to custom craft

64
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:25,150
their own versions of restricted and monitored internets that meet their

65
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,250
political requirements.

66
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,980
Some of these countries buy their surveillance technology from China and

67
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,370
Russia, and claim their online practices do not differ in principle

68
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,050
from what Western governments do.

69
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,150
If the United States or France has the right to shut down what they regard as

70
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,640
objectionable websites, then every other country has the

71
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,340
same right to do so.

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,990


73
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,970
The non-democratic states, at the World Conference, defended state

74
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,610
control of electronic media.

75
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,520
A leaked document prepared by the delegations from Russia, the United

76
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,940
Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Sudan proclaimed the sovereign

77
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,950
right of each state to regulate its telecommunications and spelled out

78
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,750
this principle at greater length in the following paragraph.

79
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,040
Member states shall have the sovereign right to establish and implement

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,250
public policy, including international policy, on matters of internet

81
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,480
governance and to regulate the national internet segment.

82
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,260
Another paragraph in this document directly challenges American

83
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,000
supervision of the current system for managing the technical

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,500
function of the internet.

85
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,010
Member states, it says, shall have equal rights to manage the internet,

86
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,820
including in regard to the allotment, assignment, and reclamation of

87
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,320
internet numbering, naming, addressing, and

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,610
identification resources.

89
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,900
These procedures are managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned

90
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,290
Names and Numbers--

91
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,710
ICANN--

92
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,740
a private organization headquartered in California that was created in 1998

93
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:20,080
by the US government to supervise various tasks related to the technical

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,600
operation of the net.

95
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,795
ICANN still operates under contract to the US Department of Commerce.

96
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:29,790


97
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,860
In other words, for many years, the US government had exercised control over

98
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,300
the management of internet names and addresses.

99
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,290
The decision was then made to shift the management of the internet's

100
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,290
technical infrastructure from the government to a nongovernmental, but

101
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,970
still government affiliated, body that would also promote global

102
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,800
participation in this process.

103
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,320
While this transition appears to reflect the American preference for

104
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,190
the privatizing of some public functions, it is hard to overlook the

105
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,790
US government's continuing and unique involvement in the

106
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,990
management of the internet.

107
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,050
Whether one chooses to call this government role in the net management

108
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,350
or control, it is hardly surprising that many governments that do not

109
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,220
trust American policies or motives would object to the current

110
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,560
arrangement.

111
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,020
As one data expert wrote in 2005 in Foreign Affairs magazine, the

112
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,060
controversy over who controls the internet has simmered in insular

113
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,390
technology policy circles for years.

114
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,940
And more recently has crept into formal diplomatic talks.

115
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,370
Many governments feel that like the phone network, the internet should be

116
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,710
administered under a multilateral treaty.

117
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:57,230
ICANN, in their view, is an instrument of American hegemony over cyberspace.

118
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,120
Its private sector approach favors the United States, Washington retains

119
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,920
oversight authority, and ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee,

120
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,400
composed of delegates from other nations, has no real powers.

121
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,332
