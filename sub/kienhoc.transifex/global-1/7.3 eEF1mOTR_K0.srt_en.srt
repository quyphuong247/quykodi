00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,070


1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:07,130
On June 26, 2013, United Nation's highest court, the International Court

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,290
of Justice, heard the first arguments in a case relating to Japan's annual

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,530
whale hunt in the frigid waters of the southern ocean that surrounds

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,430
Antarctica.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,050
Australia argued that the Japanese whaling operation is an illegal

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,360
commercial activity that had been outlawed in 1986 by the international

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,150
whaling commission.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,550
Japan's counter argument was that the killing of whales is legal under

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,940
Article Eight of the 1946 International Convention for the

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,510
regulation of whaling, which allows whaling for purposes

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,920
of scientific research.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,280
The Japanese call the whale hunt research whaling, to which the

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,230
Australian representative to the court replied, "you don't kill 935 whales a

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,820
year to conduct scientific research."

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,590
In the court to observe the proceedings was a member of the Dutch

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,190
wing of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a vigilante anti whaling

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,470
group founded in 1977 by the controversial marine

18
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,040
activist Paul Watson.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,480
Watson justifies the ramming of Japanese whaling ships by his own

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,250
vessels by citing the United Nations World Charter for Nature, a resolution

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,740
passed by the General Assembly in 1982 which allows individuals to take

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:40,010
independent action to safeguard and conserve nature in areas beyond

23
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,260
national jurisdiction.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,870


25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:48,870
The history and politics of the Antarctic whaling dispute present us

26
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,720
with a particularly interesting case study in the complications of global

27
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,280
regulation.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,220
So let us introduced the major actors in this long running drama.

29
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,860
The international whaling commission, or IWC, was formed in 1946 in

30
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,919
accordance with the International Convention for the

31
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,090
Regulation of Whaling.

32
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,420
After decades of inaction, whale populations were drastically

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,860
declining, and the IWC adopted a moratorium on commercial whaling.

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,840
On its website, the IWC states in 1986, the commission introduced zero

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,130
catch limits for commercial whaling.

36
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,100
The Japanese whaling operation and the controversy that surrounds it are not

37
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,400
mentioned, despite the fact that the Japanese killed more than 1,000 whales

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,750
in 2005 in the course of doing what they call research.

39
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,480
Greenpeace is the world famous nonviolent environmentalist NGO whose

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,760
stated goal is to ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,810
its diversity.

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,640
Its primary concerns include overfishing and commercial whaling,

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,900
but it rejects the tactics of Paul Watson.

44
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,950
Greenpeace, according to a 2008 statement, will continue to act to

45
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:22,090
defend the whales, but will never attack or endanger the whalers.

46
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,980
Greenpeace takes partial credit for the 1982 moratorium on commercial

47
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,630
whaling that put an end to the whaling activities of the Soviet Union,

48
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,900
Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Spain, thereby saving thousands of whales

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,690
from harpooning and death.

50
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,660


51
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,800
The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, as noted earlier, is a radical

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,130
anti-whaling group founded and led by Paul Watson, who participated in

53
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,930
Greenpeace in its early days at the beginning of the 1970s.

54
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:03,130
Watson was voted out of Greenpeace in 1977, allegedly because the sheer

55
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,860
force of his personality and his proclivity for confrontation

56
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,490
conflicted with the Greenpeace ethos.

57
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,600
This brief account of the major actors involved in the global regulation of

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,640
whaling makes it clear that what we refer to as regulation can be carried

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,270
out with differing degrees of determination, or militancy, and that

60
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:32,120
regulators may differ in what we may call temperament.

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,790
The International Whaling Commission, like many other transnational

62
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,750
regulatory bodies, is an international organization whose 89 members are all

63
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,510
nation states, its transnational authority derives from the authority

64
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,490
conferred on it by nation states.

65
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,230
The 1982 United Nations Convention on the law of the sea operates on the

66
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,200
same principle, since it confers authority to take action in defense of

67
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,270
marine life only on sovereign states.

68
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,850
An important limitation of a state constituted international body or

69
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,760
treaty, or agreement, is precisely its lack of

70
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,220
independence from state interests.

71
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,190
For example, the United Nations Convention on the law of the sea is

72
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,590
supposed to be concerned with the current and disastrous decline of many

73
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,000
oceanic fish stocks.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,090
The code of conduct for responsible fisheries, adopted by the UN

75
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,660
affiliated Food and Agricultural Organization in 1995 is a voluntary,

76
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,180
and thus a non-binding agreement.

77
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,100
This code is a long and impressive document, but it has been ineffectual,

78
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,100
because its recommendations are no match for the politics of the global

79
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,980
fishing industry.

80
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,700
The owners and operators of national fishing fleets put pressure on

81
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,920
national politicians who refuse to make sacrifices on behalf of an

82
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,080
international strategy to preserve the ocean's edible fish.

83
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,850
Their priority is rather to keep those national fishing fleets in business,

84
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,220
no matter what the long term consequences may be for life on Earth.

85
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,190


86
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,450
Ineffective international regulation that is tacitly endorsed by

87
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,470
governments has opened the door to countless non-governmental

88
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:32,080
organizations, the NGOs, who think they can do better, and often do.

89
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,120
For example, it is the Sea Shepherds, not the IWC, that is saving whales in

90
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,880
the southern ocean, for it is the negligence, the failures, and the

91
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,710
crimes of national and international bodies that have created enormous

92
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,350
opportunities for NGOs.

93
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,180
And there's more to this story.

94
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,190
Since a moderate NGO like Greenpeace can be challenged by a radical NGO

95
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,180
like the Sea Shepherds, there are styles of global regulation that

96
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,930
correspond to a variety of temperaments and a variety of

97
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,800
regulatory ambitions that are rooted in ethical or spiritual values.

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,310
These differing levels of commitment can also correlate with different

99
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,610
vested interests.

100
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,500
International bureaucrats who fly first class to meetings and five star

101
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,660
hotels are not likely to be eager reformers.

102
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,010
Less privileged idealists will be less attached to the status quo, and will

103
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,200
be more willing to shake things up.

104
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,050
Think Greenpeace.

105
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,960
The radical idealist, like Paul Watson, or think Julian Assange, are

106
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,300
in a class by themselves.

107
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,780
These are driven, courageous, and deeply eccentric people whose goal is

108
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,350
not just to improve the world, but to transform the idea of global

109
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,060
regulation into a crusade that will reinvent a degenerate world that has

110
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,310
provoked their fury.

111
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,625
