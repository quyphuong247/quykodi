00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,892


1
00:00:00,892 --> 00:00:03,500
Section eight is about transnational crime.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,520
If crime increases as markets expand and globalization is promoted by

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,070
capitalism, will we see a significant increase in crime as world globalizes?

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,430
Yes.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,980
I think that the expansion of the global economy and the differentiation

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,330
of the global economy into increasing numbers of different kinds of

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,100
businesses and transactions is going to promote an increase in crime.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:37,090
The most dramatic example of the expansion of criminal activity within

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,960
the globalization project right now is cyber crime.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,750
All sorts of attacks from a variety of sources.

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,710
It can be from governments, it can be from hackers who are working with for

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,020
governments, it can be hackers who are pursuing various sorts of cyber crime

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:02,840
or cyberharassment for their own purposes, it can be people who are

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,710
trying to access all sorts of different kinds of information, either

15
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,190
for political or for commercial purposes.

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:18,360
This, I think, is the dramatically expanding criminal sphere within

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,310
globalization right now.

18
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,910
Does all the new internet technology come with this new kind of crime?

19
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:33,580
Revelations about the data spying and collection by the National Security

20
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,650
Agency of the United States has provoked a lot of commentary about the

21
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:46,860
price to be paid for tremendously convenient internet services.

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:55,160
And it is beginning to sink in that the price you pay, unless there is

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,150
profound reform of intelligence agencies--

24
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,520
not just in the United States, but in Europe and China and Russia and

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,180
elsewhere--

26
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,039
the bargain seems to be that in a world in which major intelligence

27
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:19,060
agencies are active and trying to keep track of the communications and

28
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:26,690
behaviors of large numbers of people, then the price you pay for having that

29
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,980
sort of access is, in effect, allowing a great deal of access to you.

30
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,030
Now, the presumption on the part of the intelligence agencies is that they

31
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,100
are targeting dangerous people.

32
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,700
The problem as we've recently learned is that enormous amounts of

33
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,310
information about enormous numbers of people are collected for the purpose,

34
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:58,930
allegedly, of finding a small number of bad actors who pose real dangers to

35
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,830
one or more societies.

36
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,290
What do you think the global reaction will be, or has been, to the

37
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,760
revelations that you were just talking about?

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:26,630
What one sees is a slow gradual set of proposed laws, investigations, that

39
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,790
there are a certain number of organizations, agencies, that are

40
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:40,510
pushing back to some extent against the idea that everybody has to be

41
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,700
electronically naked in order to protect the national security of this

42
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,590
country or that country.

43
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,700
So that, I think that what has been learned about the

44
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,020
extent of these various--

45
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,480
not just the NSA--

46
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,590
but maybe half a dozen major intelligence agencies, and the lengths

47
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,520
to which they will go to collect the lots of information

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,350
about lots of people.

49
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,460
I think it is reasonable to assume that there is going to be some

50
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,360
significant push back.

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
And that, at least in some countries, there is going to be legislation that

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,060
will attempt to rein in that sort of data collection to some extent.

53
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,160
And we should keep in mind that if there is one area of the world that

54
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:39,620
has demonstrated a special unusual interest in privacy in general, it has

55
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,160
been the European Union.

56
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,960
How do countries get away with just dumping waste on other countries, like

57
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,580
has happened to Somalia?

58
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,800
The reports regarding the dumping of all sorts of toxic wastes, both on

59
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:03,510
land in Somalia and along the Somali coast, involves, we are told, big

60
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:10,890
European corporations who send ships down there to dump even nuclear

61
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,560
radioactive materials, as well as other sorts of toxic substances on the

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
land and in the waters of this particular country.

63
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:29,770
It can be understood as a consequence of the enormous imbalance of power

64
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,440
between wealthy Europe--

65
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,500
with all sorts of resources, including access to cargo ships that can take

66
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,700
dangerous materials thousands of miles and dump them and then go home again--

67
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,270
and the world's most famous failed state.

68
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,930
A failed state is not in a position to defend itself.

69
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,820
In fact, the piracy operations directed against international

70
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,500
shipping by Somali pirates has been interpreted, perhaps reasonably to

71
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,720
some extent, as a response from a fraction of the Somali population who

72
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,940
said, you are basically destroying our marine environment, we can no longer

73
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,640
make a living by catching fish, we can no longer make a

74
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,400
living by catching shrimp.

75
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,270
And piracy is our response to the devastation of the coastline that you,

76
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:35,620
wealthy world with your merchant fleets, has inflicted upon us.

77
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:44,480
When Somali piracy was becoming a real hazard to international shipping, it

78
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,060
wasn't that long before something like a dozen countries put together a naval

79
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,630
flotilla for the purpose of protecting shipping.

80
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:01,400
Wouldn't it have been nice if Western governments, and other governments

81
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,020
with ships to protect in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia, had

82
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:18,100
detected and disapproved of this awful anti-environmental dumping operation

83
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,940
by European corporations, and said, the Somalis, the Somali environment

84
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,220
deserves protection from these sorts of crimes against the environment.

85
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,810
Well, that didn't happen.

86
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,590
It was only when the commercial shipping companies were being

87
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,880
victimized by Somali pirates that you had a concerted international effort

88
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,000
to do something about this particular hazard.

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,410
When these environmental crimes were being committed against the Somali

90
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,720
coast, as verified by any number of respected international organizations,

91
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,320
it appears that nobody lifted a finger.

92
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,500
If organ donors were paid, do you think that human organ trafficking

93
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,000
would decrease?

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:20,640
If there were a globally regulated commercial organ selling and purchase

95
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:29,040
system, I think that would put some sort of a dent in the illegal

96
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,510
trafficking of human organs.

97
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:39,650
Which is a huge problem, in the sense that it maims and kills many, many

98
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:45,570
people who are invariably poor, desperate, vulnerable.

99
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:52,420
I think it's reasonable to assume that a regulated commercial operation would

100
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,020
take some of the pressure off desperate patients who will do

101
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,910
anything, and pay anything, and look the other way as peasants from

102
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:11,210
Anatolia have their kidneys removed for the benefit of the wealthy and

103
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,810
desperate patient.

104
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,900
In this section, you say that the internet has become the nervous system

105
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,570
of globalization.

106
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,090
Can you further explain that?

107
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:31,140
Well, a nervous system is that network within a living organism that permits

108
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:38,510
it to coordinate its activities, to function in a very, very basic sense.

109
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:46,470
We organism we call globalization needs tremendous connectivity.

110
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:54,120
There has to be constant communication between many, many different points--

111
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,920
people, organizations, committees, et cetera--

112
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,770
so that the electronic network that permits the coordination of

113
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:13,910
humanitarian rescue mission, that permits the coordination of the export

114
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:20,080
of millions of containers from one port to another port.

115
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,960
There are a limitless number of operations that require communication

116
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,030
and coordination in a rather precise sense in order to keep the globe

117
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,710
going, in order to keep the global economy functioning, in order to

118
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,830
support the activities of countless organizations that have to be in touch

119
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,050
with each other.

120
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,960
So I think it is a fair analogy that the internet has become a kind of

121
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,180
global nervous system.

122
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,050
We can see how this topic connects to regulation with the Somali pirates and

123
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,510
with media with the internet.

124
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,440
But how does it connect to the other topics in this course?

125
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,030
There are many ways that one can connect the topic of transnational

126
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,100
crime to a variety of other topics in this course.

127
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,990
Even sports.

128
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:19,060
In recent years it has become clear that there are at least a couple of

129
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,900
threatening developments with regard to global sport.

130
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,580
One, of course, is performance enhancing drugs.

131
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,800
And according to the World Anti-Doping Agency, which is supposed to

132
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,670
coordinate anti-doping campaigns and operations around the world, that the

133
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,690
trafficking in performance enhancing drugs has been taken over by criminal

134
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,060
gangs, by what they call drug mafias.

135
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,580
So, in that sense, the sports world is vulnerable to

136
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,700
transnational organized crime.

137
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,880
Another way that the sports world is vulnerable to transnational organized

138
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:07,296
crime comes in the form of gambling and match-fixing where players on, let

139
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:09,740
us say, football teams--

140
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,140
or in other sports--

141
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:18,910
are paid either to influence the outcome of a game or a match, or to

142
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:25,670
affect the relatively minor statistics within a game or a match.

143
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,880
How many goals are scored, for example, as opposed to whether a team

144
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,100
wins or loses.

145
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,700
There is a great deal of this.

146
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,520
It is carried out through instant communications on the internet so that

147
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,840
you will have, for example, gambling bosses in Asia who will have paid

148
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,110
people in England to do certain things on the football pitch.

149
00:12:53,110 --> 00:13:02,520
And he is able to make bets with other people anywhere, given the range of

150
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,220
the internet.

151
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,680
He knows a few seconds before something is going to happen on the

152
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,190
pitch, let us say in Northern England, that it is going to happen.

153
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,260
And he will make a bet with someone.

154
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,400
You can bet on anything these days.

155
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,500
And the gambler can make instant profits having, literally, reached

156
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,730
around the world into the lives of players who have been paid off.

157
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,760
In terms of social justice, the offshore tax haven system is a way for

158
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,010
very powerful, very wealthy corporations and individuals to, in

159
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,890
effect, remove--

160
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,220
not billions--

161
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,310
but even trillions of dollars from societies that need that money to

162
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,580
promote social development.

163
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:57,850
But here is a social justice issue that, during the year 2013, has become

164
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:03,770
a hot topic in a number of countries where outrage against high officials,

165
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:11,570
for example, holding offshore accounts that had been undivulged previously,

166
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,160
became notorious figures.

167
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,270
And there is some mobilization now against the offshore tax haven system.

168
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,280
Thanks for talking to us about crime, Dr. Hoberman.

169
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,530
Thank you.

170
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,070
