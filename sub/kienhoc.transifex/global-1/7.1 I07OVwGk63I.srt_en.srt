1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,040
Global regulation is a difficult and often an impossible task.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,190
But global regulation is also a fascinating topic of virtually

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,320
unlimited scope, since all organized human activities can be regulated in

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,160
one way or another.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,045
All three of the basic concepts of this course imply regulation.

6
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:27,060
Man-made systems can be regulated, connectivity can be regulated, and

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,650
competition can be regulated.

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,780
One might even say that the globalization process itself consists

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,660
of a very large number of interlocking and regulated systems that include

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,170
global transportation systems, immigration systems, communication

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,600
systems, market systems, atmospheric monitoring systems, surveillance

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,820
systems, and many, many more.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,400


14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,310
Regulation is a process that occurs over stages that include agenda

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:05,540
setting, negotiation, implementation, monitoring, and enforcement.

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,870
Some regulation makes it from agenda setting to monitoring but does not

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,420
progressed further to the stage of enforcement.

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,570
Global regulation offers many examples of only partial regulation, because

19
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,670
the sheer scale on which any kind of global regulatory regime is

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,460
implemented makes it difficult or impossible to get large numbers of

21
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:34,300
people around the world to adhere to a specific set of norms.

22
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,950
Global regulatory initiatives can originate with international

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,750
organizations such as the United Nations, the World Health

24
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,590
Organization, the International Whaling Commission, or the World

25
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,620
Anti-Doping Agency.

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,890
Specialized agencies of the United Nations having regulatory

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,370
responsibilities include the International Maritime Organization,

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,940
the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Food and

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,580
Agricultural Organization, the International Labor Organization, the

30
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,990
International Telecommunications Union, and the Universal Postal Union.

31
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,330
This course briefly addresses the regulatory functions of several of

32
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,580
these UN agencies.

33
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,780


34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,120
Global regulation can also be undertaken or supported by various

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,540
Nongovernmental Organizations, or NGOs, such as Greenpeace, Amnesty

36
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,670
International, Human Rights Watch, or Transparency International.

37
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,850
NGOs may form as a response to what their members regard as regulatory

38
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,420
failures on the part of nation states or international organizations.

39
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,010
Oppositional relationships between states and NGOs may result from the

40
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,160
activism of the latter directed at the alleged inaction of the former.

41
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,810
Greenpeace, for example, has staged many dramatic public events to draw

42
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,490
attention to states' regulatory failures to protect the natural

43
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,990
environment.

44
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,560
An extreme oppositional relationship between a government and NGOs resulted

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,980
in the passage in 2012 of a Russian law that forced foreign-funded NGOs to

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,930
register as foreign agents.

47
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,600
By watching out for vote rigging at the polls, some of these NGOs were

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,850
regulating the integrity of Russian elections on behalf of a global

49
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,620
standard of electoral integrity.

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,530
Nation states too can declare an interest in the enforcement of an

51
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,650
international rule or standard and pursue this interest at an

52
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,960
international forum, such as a court of law.

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,000
It is important to keep in mind that regulatory ambitions are often

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,950
associated with value systems, ethical judgments, and

55
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,420
standards of decent conduct.

56
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,300
International organizations such as the United Nations were created to

57
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,600
represent ideal norms of this kind.

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,960
The idea or ideal of global governance that aims to realize these norms is

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,002
one aspect of that global imaginary that expresses, as Professor Manfred

60
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:17,519
Stager has said, "people's s growing consciousness of belonging to a global

61
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,240
community." " It is fair to say that the official representatives of this

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,080
global community are expected to aspire to humane values, such as

63
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,750
compassion for others and a sense of justice.

64
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,360
It is assumed that a global regulatory regime derives from a values system

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,940
the international community can respect.

66
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,220
It is tempting to make a distinction between practical and idealistic

67
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,320
international organizations and their respective regulatory roles.

68
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,660
A practical regulatory function might be assumed to be the administration of

69
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,170
a global technology-based system, such as shipping or aviation or

70
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,530
telecommunications.

71
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,000
An idealistic regulator would presumably be concerned about human

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,820
rights or human health.

73
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,970
Elsewhere in this course, however, we have seen the distinguishing between

74
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,500
practical and ideal roles and their regulatory duties is somewhat

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,640
artificial.

76
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,080
Practical regulatory regimes, such as the International Maritime

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,980
Organization or the International Telecommunications Union, have their

78
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,540
own ethical responsibilities toward vulnerable or

79
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,020
neglected groups of people.

80
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,030


81
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,610
Global governance and its regulatory systems are ideal constructs as much

82
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,820
as they are practical arrangements, because there is no ultimate source of

83
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,930
authority to mandate and formulate regulatory codes.

84
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,710
The Vatican, which is the oldest international organization in the

85
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,640
world, claims to possess both an authoritative mandate and a regulatory

86
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,630
code of conduct for human beings.

87
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,450
Other global organizations, lacking this degree of doctrinal

88
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,350
self-confidence, are often looking for guidance.

89
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,150
"At the international level," Professor Matilda Dahl, has observed,

90
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,480
"there is no single regulator.

91
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,510
But even so, states continue to follow rules made up by various others.

92
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,860
These are often different types of international organizations.

93
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,560
One might even claim," she says, "that states are following scripts," written

94
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,340
by global bodies that seem to possess the authority to regulate the affairs

95
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,590
of nations.

96
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,170


97
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,130
Up to this point, we have looked at global regulation as a necessary idea

98
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,510
that possesses neither an infallible unitary doctrine nor an absolute

99
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,790
mandate to impose itself on international disputes.

100
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,290
This means that how global regulation actually works depends on many

101
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,590
factors, some of which will be absolutely unique to

102
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,810
a particular scenario.

103
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,320
The rest of the lectures in this section present three regulatory

104
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,330
scenarios that illustrate both the basic aspects of global regulation and

105
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,010
the unpredictable complexities of the conflicts between contending forces

106
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,470
that make these scenarios into compelling dramas of the

107
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,720
globalization process.

108
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,147
