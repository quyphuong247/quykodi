00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020


1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:07,000
The concept of a global labor market is one of the fundamental and most

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,020
discussed aspects of globalization.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,390
There is worldwide concern about the present and future unemployment of

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,790
large numbers of workers because of the social unrest and political

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,560
instability that can result from labor markets that are unable to absorb

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,750
those who want and need jobs.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,740
Uri Dadush, senior associate and director of the International

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,210
Economics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,850
notes that anxiety about job markets has become an intrinsic part of

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,460
thinking about globalization.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,690
In the public imagination, he says, globalization has become inextricably

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,030
associated with outsourcing and surging imports that destroy jobs and

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,960
depress wages.

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,890
At this point, we will simply acknowledge that outsourcing has

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,930
become a socially and politically controversial topic regarding the

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,030
global labor market.

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,100
In a technical sense, this term refers to the relocating of jobs outside of a

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,530
company rather than continuing to have these functions

19
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,360
performed inside the company.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,860
Offshoring refers to the relocating of jobs to sites in foreign countries

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,570
primarily because there is a cost advantage involved in doing so.

22
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,400
While these terms have come to be used more or less synonymously, we will

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,640
employ the more commonly-used term "outsourcing" to refer to the

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,890
relocation of jobs overseas, thereby creating some unemployment at the

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,470
original location where the company is headquartered.

26
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,150
Later in this section of the course, we will take a closer look at the

27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,800
types of jobs that are more or less vulnerable to being outsourced to

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,050
other countries.

29
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,070


30
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,390
The idea of an integrated global labor market is an important aspect of that

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,160
global imaginary that makes us feel that we belong to a single global

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,320
community for better or for worse.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,600
There is a widespread sense that global employment in an economic

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,950
sector such as manufacturing is a zero-sum game, that more jobs in one

35
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,390
country must mean fewer jobs in another and that unemployment in the

36
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,170
factory or economic sector that has lost those jobs will persist for an

37
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,020
indefinite period of time.

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,120
The countervailing and more optimistic claim is that the loss of relatively

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,030
low-skilled jobs to outsourcing will be more than made up for when the

40
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,180
displaced workers are trained to fill more highly-skilled and

41
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,600
better paying jobs.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,700
This argument has been used before to argue that automation technologies,

43
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,540
such as the use of robots in factories, will not lead to mass

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,100
unemployment.

45
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,360
There are economists today, however, who no longer believe that the

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,300
retraining of workers will be able to keep up with the rate at which

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,940
automation will create unemployment on a global scale.

48
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,570
We have become accustomed to the idea that the many millions of Chinese

49
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,150
workers, whose labor has created the greatest export boom in history, will

50
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,260
always be employed.

51
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,160
At this point in the world's economic history, we tend to take their

52
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,770
permanent employment for granted.

53
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:38,730
But we should not, because it is a certainty that automated production is

54
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,650
going to destabilize the global labor market in ways that we do not yet

55
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,280
understand.

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,110
In this sense, the integration of the global market includes the labor

57
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,230
performed by both human beings and robots as well as the relocation of

58
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,600
jobs to other countries.

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,850
Automation, however, is more disturbing than outsourcing, because a

60
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,890
robot replaces a person, while outsourcing preserves the job at

61
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,140
another location.

62
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,750


63
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,110
Even as we acknowledge the interdependence of markets across the

64
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:21,450
world, we should also recognize that the global labor market is not nearly

65
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,960
as integrated as we often imagine it to be.

66
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,890
In a genuinely integrated world economy, workers would migrate freely

67
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,250
to new places of employment and settle there.

68
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,840
It is true, of course, that the second and third phases of globalization have

69
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,480
seen major labor migrations.

70
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,420
More than 10 million Mexicans have sought and found work

71
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,120
in the United States.

72
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,640
Over the past 50 years, millions of so-called guest workers have found

73
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,070
work in Western Europe.

74
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,855
As of 1996, there were almost 10 million foreign workers in Middle

75
00:04:56,855 --> 00:05:02,470
Eastern countries, including 60% of the workforce in Saudi Arabia.

76
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,870
About 300,000 Philippine citizens have migrated to ships around the world to

77
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,700
work as seafarers.

78
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,710
These foreign workers send home cash remittances on an economically

79
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,870
significant scale.

80
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,510
On a global scale, however, only a very small percentage of workers leave

81
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,630
their home countries to work overseas.

82
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,230
Even the liberal work rules of the European Union have not motivated more

83
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,430
than a few percent of Europeans to work in other countries.

84
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,490
The large wage differentials that persist between developing and

85
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,370
developed societies are more evidence that the global labor market is not

86
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,620
fully integrated, since workers in different parts of the world are not

87
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,570
being paid the same wages for the same work.

88
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,080
In this sense, outsourcing presents us with contradictory evidence about the

89
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,360
integration of the global economy.

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,150
Outsourcing operations point to the interdependent relationships between

91
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,340
companies in advanced and emerging societies.

92
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,790
And this is one indication of an integrated global economy.

93
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,630
At the same time, however, the decision to outsource is motivated by

94
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,950
the substantial difference in wages paid to workers doing the same jobs in

95
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,030
two different geographical locations.

96
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:32,080
For example, companies in the United States can often save money by

97
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,530
outsourcing work to companies in India.

98
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,190
In conclusion, we might say that confirming the integration of the

99
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,880
global labor market depends on which evidence one chooses to focus on.

100
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,020
Intercontinental wage differentials indicate less integration, while

101
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,920
geographically separated workers doing the same jobs indicate more

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,170
integration.

103
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,270


104
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,660
Exempt from the complexity of most global labor markets are some micro

105
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,410
labor markets that are far more integrated in an ideal sense than more

106
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,540
ordinary labor markets.

107
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,910
As Professor Dadush puts it, the market for top talent in a few highly

108
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,260
competitive arenas is clearly global.

109
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,320
In these labor markets, top athletes, entertainers, and academics are

110
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,660
granted both maximum mobility and substantial financial rewards.

111
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,250
These mini labor markets are utopian in the sense that nationality,

112
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,580
religion, and racial or ethnic identity matter less than they would

113
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,890
in many other venues of employment.

114
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,490
One might say that these global celebrities belong to a working elite

115
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,720
that symbolizes, for its global audience, an integrated and

116
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,500
meritocratic workforce that is unlikely to appear anywhere else in

117
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,830
the global labor market.

118
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,000
One major obstacle to a more integrated global workforce is

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,800
resistance to immigration across national borders.

120
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,490
As noted earlier, the presence of millions of undocumented, or illegal,

121
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,010
immigrants in the United States remains politically controversial.

122
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,520
The absorption of non-Europeans into the workforces of the European Union

123
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,350
has been accompanied by a great deal of resistance to the immigration and

124
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,950
employment of people of other racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.

125
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,840
These workers may face discrimination and lack of access to important

126
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,590
services like bank accounts.

127
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,860
The original guest workers, who were recruited to work in German factories

128
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,910
during the 1960s, came from Mediterranean countries, Italy, Spain

129
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,450
Greece, Turkey, Morocco, Portugal, Tunisia, and Yugoslavia.

130
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,200
While German officials believed that these workers would eventually return

131
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,670
to their countries of origin, it turned out that they were mistaken.

132
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,450
Temporary employment for many of them became a permanent

133
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,700
relocation to Germany.

134
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,250
The integration of these so-called migrants and their family members over

135
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,970
four generations has become a social crisis in Germany and in other

136
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,820
European countries.

137
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,760
In 2010, the chancellor of Germany, the prime minister of Britain, and the

138
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,300
president of France all declared that multiculturalism had failed as a

139
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,100
policy option for their societies.

140
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,020
In the meantime, it has been clear for many years that the gradual aging and

141
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,390
shrinking of the native German population will require the absorption

142
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:49,400
of large numbers of foreign immigrants to sustain the German economy and

143
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,005
support the older generation in retirement.

144
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:55,340


145
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,460
People from many African countries, desperately seeking entry into the

146
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,130
European labor market, over land and in small boats, now constitute nothing

147
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,860
less than a humanitarian crisis, as hundreds of people have drowned trying

148
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,230
to reach the Mediterranean coastlines of Spain, Italy, and Greece.

149
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:22,090
In 2006, the EU justice commissioner called for the creation of job centers

150
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,760
in Africa to keep Africans employed at home and thereby reduce

151
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,880
the pressure on Europe.

152
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,290
What is more, a successful program to employ educated Africans in Africa

153
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,300
would reduce the so-called brain drain that has taken many professionals,

154
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,670
such as doctors, out of Africa and to developed societies that

155
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,000
can use their services.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,230
These professionals belong to that special group of integrated global

157
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,105
labor markets that includes elite football players.

158
00:10:55,105 --> 00:11:00,460
In summary, obstacles to immigration and workplace discrimination in

159
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,940
developed countries are another factor that prevents a fuller integration of

160
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,190
the global labor market.

161
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,510


162
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:15,080
Global labor migration also provides crucial funds for the undeveloped

163
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,060
countries migratory workers leave behind as they seek employment abroad.

164
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,890
Foreign workers take these so-called remittances out of their salaries and

165
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,110
send this money back to their countries of origin.

166
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,800
The former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, has called

167
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,570
these remittances the single most immediate and tangible benefit of

168
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,770
international migration.

169
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:46,800
According to the World Bank, foreign workers sent $401 billion to their

170
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,270
families in developing countries in 2012.

171
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,110
This money can have a large impact on a local community or even a small

172
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,880
national economy.

173
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,540
For this reason, remittances can be thought of as a form of foreign aid

174
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,920
that comes not from foreigners but from that subpopulation of foreign

175
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,570
employees who help to sustain their families and fellow citizens in poor

176
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,280
countries that need all the capital inflow they can get.

177
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,720


178
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,750
The global labor market can be studied on a macro scale, or we can look

179
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:30,690
carefully at particular dynamics of this enormously complex labor system.

180
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,580
On a macro scale, we know that the global labor market has been unified

181
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,630
over the past several decades by China's decision to go down the

182
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,260
capitalist road and by the collapse of the Soviet empire.

183
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,490
Polish workers have headed for England.

184
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,570
And Russian hackers have been visiting the West in their own special ways.

185
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,080
China and India have lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.

186
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,350
The entry of huge numbers of low-skilled workers into the global

187
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,550
labor market has kept the wages of their counterparts in the developed

188
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,340
world from rising as much as they otherwise would have done.

189
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,780
The McKinsey Global Institute predicts that China and the advanced economies

190
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:19,290
are going to lack tens of millions of educated workers they will need.

191
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,310
And they will also lack tens of millions of jobs needed

192
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,560
by low-skilled workers.

193
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,382
