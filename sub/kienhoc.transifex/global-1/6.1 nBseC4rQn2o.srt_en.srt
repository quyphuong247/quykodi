00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770


1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,520
Globalization is a gigantic and amoral mechanism that may indirectly serve,

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,610
but does not aim to achieve, the goals of justice, ethical standards, or

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,320
economic and social equality.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,120
In One World, Ready or Not-- the Manic Logic of Global Capitalism, William

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,250
Greider offers a dramatic portrait of globalization as a blind and rampaging

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,420
behemoth directed mainly by its own appetites.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,800
Imagine, he writes, a wondrous new machine.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,060
Strong and supple, a machine that reaps as it destroys.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,750
As it goes, the machine throws off enormous mows of wealth and bounty,

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,510
while it leaves behind great furrows of wreckage.

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,080
What his book describes, Greider says, is the drama of a free-running

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,070
economic system that is reordering the world.

13
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,800
What is more, the wondrous machine that is remaking the globe appears to

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,190
be running out of control and heading towards some sort of abyss.

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,920


16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,670
It is clear that a globalization process that is being driven into an

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,450
uncertain future by the manic logic of global capitalism will challenge

18
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,270
policymakers who are bent on improving the human condition by pursuing goals

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,020
such as social justice and economic opportunity for all.

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,700
But if globalization is somehow beyond the control of human agents, can it be

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,090
compatible with the pursuit of social and economic justice?

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,560
A related and overly abstract question social scientists and political

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,040
activists have asked about globalization is whether it improves

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,050
or degrades human life around the world.

25
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,110
One approach to judging the effects of globalization has been to draw up

26
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:59,960
lists of its pros and cons, its presumed advantages and disadvantages.

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,740
Globalization is said to promote, among other good things, economic

28
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,290
growth, job creation, democracy, the global market, information flows,

29
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,510
cultural contact, and travel.

30
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,420
Its disadvantages are said to include the enriching of the privileged and

31
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,110
the impoverishing of the rest, poor working conditions, environmental

32
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,720
degradation, the erosion of social safety nets, and outsourcing of

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,090
millions of jobs to cheaper labor markets.

34
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,070
One problem with this balance sheet approach is that it does not integrate

35
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,370
the two sides of the ledger into a unified model of how

36
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,520
globalization works.

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,360
The other problem is that it is an abstract and bloodless way to portray

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,863
the human dramas and tragedies that result from globalization.

39
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:54,290


40
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,590
Calculating the effects of globalization requires us to

41
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,410
acknowledge that what we are calling the globalization process comprises

42
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,830
many subprocesses that have positive and negative effects on human

43
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,810
populations.

44
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,130
The global economy, as Greider puts it, divides every society into new

45
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,950
camps of conflicting economic interests.

46
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,450
We often hear simplistic references to winners and losers, as if

47
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,530
globalization were a contest that produces a final score that defines

48
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,105
the fates of its victors and its victims.

49
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:34,750


50
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,432
The theme of social justice appears in various sections of this course.

51
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:44,790
Let us define social justice as the achievement of decent living

52
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,250
conditions, gainful employment, civil liberties, and social opportunity for

53
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,770
all people, rather than for a particular social class or elite.

54
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,420
This means that any topic in this course that relates, for example, to

55
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,000
the enforcement of regulations, exposure to criminality, the global

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,910
labor market, or access to the internet is somehow related to the

57
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,640
theme of social justice.

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,560


59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,519
The primary thesis of this lecture is that the globalization process of the

60
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,990
past four decades, ever since the golden age of capitalism came to an

61
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,060
end during the early 1970s, has increased the advantages of wealthy

62
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,010
institutions and individuals around the world at the expense of entire

63
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,400
societies, along with the idea of the public good and the ideals of the

64
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,350
welfare state.

65
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,540
The major social and economic problem addressed in this lecture is,

66
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,280
therefore, the origins and consequences of extreme types of

67
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,720
inequality that are inherent in the globalization process.

68
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,500
Such inequalities are directly tied to the topic of social justice.

69
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,300


70
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,230
In his book Making Globalization Work, the Nobel Prize-winning economist

71
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,530
Joseph Stiglitz offers a series of critical observations about what he

72
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:20,200
regards as an unfair and dysfunctional globalization that derives from the

73
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,950
abuses of the special corporate and financial interests that have so

74
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,750
dominated the globalization process.

75
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,330
Stiglitz argues that globalization has harmed the developing world by

76
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,110
promoting destabilizing loans and investments, by failing to stop the

77
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,240
growth of poverty, by exporting to rich societies many of the

78
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,730
best-educated members of poor societies, and by maintaining

79
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,170
agricultural subsidies in rich countries where the average European

80
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:56,520
cow gets a daily subsidy greater than what more than half of the people in

81
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,110
the developing world have to survive on.

82
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,020


83
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,840
The key economic and political phenomenon we will briefly examine

84
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,290
here is what is known as the offshore world of secret international

85
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:17,860
financial transactions, tax havens, shell companies, and banking schemes.

86
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,690
The British journalist Nicholas Shaxon argues in his book Treasure Islands

87
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:29,150
that offshore is, as he puts it, the unacceptable price of globalization--

88
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,370
the darkest, nastiest side of global capitalism.

89
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,660
The term offshore refers not to a geographical location, but to the

90
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,870
juridical status of a location where secret financial transactions occur.

91
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,080
The offshore realm of the global financial system is traditionally

92
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,370
imagined to be a large collection of very small and exotic geographical

93
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,170
entities, such as the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean or the principality

94
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,380
of Lichtenstein, set high in the Alps and wedged between

95
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,160
Switzerland and Austria.

96
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,220
In fact, this image of picturesque microstates around the world providing

97
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,960
sanctuary for the tax-evading portions of the global financial elite is

98
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,680
profoundly misleading.

99
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,760
As Shaxon demonstrates, the offshore world is not a bunch of independent

100
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,880
states exercising their sovereign rights to set their laws and tax

101
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,010
systems as they see fit.

102
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,260
It is a set of networks of influence controlled by the world's major

103
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:44,350
powers, notably Britain and the United States.

104
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,670
The economic and political impacts of the offshore financial universe are

105
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:55,240
staggering, because enormous sums of money escape taxation and are not

106
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,050
invested in social development.

107
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,170
In 2005, the Tax Justice Network estimated that wealthy individuals

108
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:10,030
hold perhaps $11.5 trillion worth of wealth offshore.

109
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,490
That is about a quarter of all global wealth, and equivalent to the entire

110
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,680
gross national product of the United States.

111
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,830
The estimated $250 billion in taxes lost on just the income that money

112
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,210
earns each year is two to three times the size of the entire global aid

113
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,880
budget to tackle poverty in developing countries.

114
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,650
In April 2013, the Tax Justice Network, a reform group based in

115
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,540
Britain, released a much higher estimate of the wealth

116
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,800
that is hidden offshore.

117
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,960
Their overall figure for the end of 2010 was $32 trillion.

118
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,580
A Lichtenstein-based wealth adviser offered the opinion that capital

119
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:04,240
flight on this scale was due not do a desire to avoid paying taxes, but for

120
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,110
the purpose of, as he put it, obtaining the human right to privacy

121
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,480
and seeking confidentiality about financial affairs.

122
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,430
Shaxon and other critics regard tax evasion by wealthy individuals and

123
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,960
corporations as socially destructive behavior that does not involve any

124
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,580
sort of right to privacy.

125
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,360


126
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,860
The impact of massive tax evasion is also felt in the advanced societies.

127
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,060
In May of 2013, a European Union summit was discussing how the EU might

128
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:51,500
recover $1.3 trillion in revenues that were being lost every year due to tax

129
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,160
evasion and avoidance.

130
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,860
American companies, too, were sitting on $1.9 trillion of offshore funds

131
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,870
that were immune to taxation.

132
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,440
What could be done that might benefit the American economy?

133
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,930
American business groups propose that the US should adopt a territorial

134
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:19,690
system and stop taxing profits American companies earned abroad.

135
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,740
The problem with this solution, one commentator noted, was the tax-free

136
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,080
treatment of all the cash trapped overseas would cost the US Treasury

137
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,070
$130 billion over 10 years and cause more outsourcing of jobs and

138
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,050
production facilities out of the United States.

139
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,230


140
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,820
In 2013, the US Congressional Budget Office estimated that one corporate

141
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:56,050
accounting trick had cost the federal government about $76 billion in tax

142
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,600
revenue in 2007 alone.

143
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,800
Between 2009 and 2012, the Apple corporation's use of tax havens and

144
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:13,050
shell companies enabled it to avoid paying tax on $44 billion in profits.

145
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,870
At the same time, European authorities were looking into the tax avoidance

146
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,200
strategies that had enabled Google, Starbucks, and Amazon to pay minimal

147
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,750
taxes to the European societies in which they were doing business.

148
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,262
