00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290


1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,500
The next type of crime we will examine involves a relatively new kind of

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,220
imbalance of power that is inherent in the nature of the internet.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,190
Cybercrime can be defined as any crime committed using a

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,460
computer and a network.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,840
Most cybercrime targets its online victims for the

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,860
purpose of making money.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,130
Cyber-vandalism and cyber-stalking are carried out to satisfy aggressive or

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,000
bullying instincts that are directed at individuals or institutions.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,300
Cybercrimes include internet auction fraud, credit card fraud,

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,590
telemarketing fraud, Nigerian letter or 419 fraud, identity theft, advance

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,600
fee schemes, letter of credit fraud, investment fraud, denial of service

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,600
attacks, the spreading of malware, cyber-stalking, and the so-called

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,290
phishing scams that go after information such as usernames,

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,420
passwords and credit card information and often direct victims to fraudulent

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,020
websites that enable cyber-theft.

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,300
These are predatory crimes that can target and victimize anyone anywhere

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
who spends time on the global internet.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,010


19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,530
Cybercrime is the ultimate crime of globalization in the sense that it

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,410
reproduces most closely the logic of globalization itself.

21
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,210
Cybercrime operates on the internet that has become the nervous system of

22
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,580
the globalization process.

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,000
Now, let us examine some characteristics of this electronic

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,870
nervous system that accommodate both legal and illegal

25
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,570
enterprises on the net.

26
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,970
First, like the globalization process, the internet has expanded faster than

27
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,560
anyone's capacity to regulate it.

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,330
Similarly, it has evolved faster than our ability to construct comprehensive

29
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,630
safeguards against its abuse.

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,260
Just as globalization is promoted by increasing numbers of

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,169
computer-literate users, a growing number of internet users have more

32
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:14,090
access to cybercrime tools that have become easier to use.

33
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,900
It no longer requires extraordinary computer expertise to engage in

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,440
criminal activity on the internet.

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,210
Technological literacy thus drives both legitimate and criminal uses of

36
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,510
the internet.

37
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,970
This is a democratic aspect of globalization in action.

38
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,500
What is more, large numbers of computers put online by the growing

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,020
population of honest computer-literate people can be hijacked into serving

40
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,250
the malign purposes of online criminals who construct bot-nets that

41
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,510
can recruit thousands of computers around the world into a criminal

42
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,880
network operation.

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,620
The increasing number of computer-literate people in the

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,240
developing countries will produce a larger population of predatory online

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,910
actors who will focus their criminal efforts on a wealthier population of

46
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,950
internet users whose numbers will stabilize or even decline.

47
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:19,120
Here we see a demographic aspect of globalization being translated into a

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,780
growth in criminal behavior on the internet.

49
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,340


50
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,200
Second, globalization promotes opportunities for the less

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,320
conventionally powerful party in a conflict between two adversaries.

52
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,210
The internet offers remarkable opportunities for individuals or small

53
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,320
groups to mount massive electronic attacks against the websites and other

54
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,980
electronic operations of nation-states, multinational

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,280
corporations, or other powerful institutions located

56
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,080
anywhere in the world.

57
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,426
This equalizing trend is another democratic feature of globalization.

58
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:01,120


59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,500
Third, cybercrime represents the nightmare version of the global

60
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,540
connectivity that seems to abolish time and space and enable personal

61
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,870
contact across great distances.

62
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,140
Cybercrime makes possible the ultimate perversion of online intimacy.

63
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,650
A particularly vicious type of malware is called ransomware.

64
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,560
This malicious software encrypts data on the victim's computer

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,500
and paralyzes it.

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,830
A message displayed on the screen accuses the victim of having viewed

67
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,170
illegal material online or of having reproduced child pornography.

68
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,680
The criminals tell the victim that once he has paid them a ransom, his

69
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,990
machine will be unlocked.

70
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,940
One version of ransomware impersonates the US Federal Bureau of

71
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,210
Investigation--

72
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,680
the FBI--

73
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,040
and displays a picture of the user obtained via his own webcam.

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,740
The victim is then told to pay a fine or run the risk of being imprisoned.

75
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,620
The ransomware experience can deprive the internet victim not only of money

76
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,135
but of his or her dignity as well.

77
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:17,470
It is the online version of a home invasion and represents the

78
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,490
pseudointimacy of the internet at its worst.

79
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,200
