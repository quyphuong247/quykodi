00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350


1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,380
Globalization today requires many of the world's citizens to experience

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,080
nationality in relationship to global organizations of various kinds.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,250
The European Union presents us with an opportunity to observe the at times

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,420
tense relationship between nation states and a supranational

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,290
organization to which they voluntarily belong.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,650
In fact, the European Union could be seen as a kind of prototype of a

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,860
globalized world in which nation states are required to accept a great

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,750
deal of regulation and standard-setting

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,850
by a central authority.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,160
The member states of the European Union have agreed to accept several

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,930
kinds of directives from the EU headquarters in Brussels.

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:53,380
A regulation is a legislative act that must be enforced by all of the EU's 28

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,010
member states.

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,190
A directive is a legislative act that specifies a goal that all EU countries

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,920
must achieve, but allowing individual countries to decide how they are going

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,700
to meet this requirement.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,360
A decision is a directive that is binding on the country or cooperation

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,230
to which it is addressed.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,260
A recommendation or an opinion allows the EU to express its position on an

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,930
issue without imposing a legal obligation on

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,180
those to whom it applies.

22
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,270


23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,430
In the context of modern European history, which saw the emergence of

24
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,460
the Westphalian model of national sovereignty and territorial dominion

25
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,450
during the 17th century, the powers of the European Union represent an

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,620
extraordinary set of limitations on national autonomy.

27
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,940
At the same time, these powers have made possible the EU's historic and

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,980
progressive achievements.

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,970
These achievements include a supranational environmental policy,

30
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,510
supranational enforcement of privacy rules, supranational promotion of

31
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,789
women's interests, and supranational prosecutions of accused war criminals.

32
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,410
The political price for these achievements is less national

33
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,250
sovereignty for the member states, in other words, a classic trade-off.

34
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,450
National feelings, whether one considers them essential or merely

35
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,810
residual, will persist in many or most people in a nation state.

36
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,240
The survival of national languages and cultures is still regarded by most

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,260
people as a non-negotiable part of the bargain.

38
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,530
It therefore came as a shock to many Europeans when an EU official at the

39
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,340
top of the power structure appeared to dismiss the appreciation of national

40
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,480
cultures as ignorant and parochial.

41
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,370


42
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,800
This dramatic example of nations' vulnerability to the global ideology

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,860
of the supranational body was acted out in June 2013 when the President of

44
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,230
the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, denounced the argument of the

45
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,110
French government that Europe's movie and television industries had to be

46
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,850
excluded, at least in the initial phase, from a proposed transatlantic

47
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,860
trade accord with the United States.

48
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,550
The so-called French cultural exclusion was aimed at protecting

49
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:30,420
European cultural diversity in general and French cultural institutions in

50
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,700
particular.

51
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,770
What is more, the French delegation had an important ally in that the

52
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,080
International Trade Committee of the European Parliament had voted several

53
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,340
weeks earlier to approve an amendment to the transatlantic treaty asking for

54
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,610
the exclusion of the cultural and audiovisual services, including those

55
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,030
provided online, from the overall trade agreement.

56
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,430
The president of the European Commission responded to the French-led

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,590
proposal with an extraordinary public lecture on what he described as the

58
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,170
unquestionable benefits of globalization.

59
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,170
"The proposed cultural exclusion," he declared, "was part of this

60
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,320
anti-globalization agenda that I consider completely reactionary.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,570
Some say they belong to the left, but in fact they are culturally extremely

62
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,820
reactionary." While he said he favored cultural diversity, he argued that the

63
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,340
proponents of the cultural exclusion had no understanding of the benefits

64
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,360
that globalization brings also from a cultural point of view, in terms of

65
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,520
opening horizons and broadening our perspectives and the sentiment of

66
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,960
belonging to the same mankind, which he said, "I think is a very important

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:58,100
concept against all forms of narrow nationalism and protectionism."

68
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,780
In a word, the EC president simply cast aside the complex and important

69
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,790
debate regarding the possible social and cultural costs of a globalization

70
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,810
process that many have come to see as synonymous with the

71
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,850
homogenizing of the world.

72
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,980
When the French farmer and anti-globalization activist Jose Bove

73
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,580
dismantled a McDonald's store with a bulldozer in 1999, this act of

74
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,760
resistance made news around the world.

75
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,380
But there are also more subtle ways to examine or protest the Americanization

76
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,940
that has become an integral part of the globalization process.

77
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,070
What is so striking about Barroso's fervent endorsement of globalization

78
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,070
is its bludgeoning quality and the suggestion that opponents of

79
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,100
globalization are the same sort of nationalists who brought the

80
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,900
catastrophe of war to the European continent on more than one occasion

81
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,010
over the past century.

82
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,030
Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more categorical dismissal of the

83
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,070
importance of national identity in a globalized world.

84
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,280
And the triumphalism of the EC president's declaration will send

85
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,190
shivers down the spines of the millions of Europeans who, now more

86
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,910
than ever, resent the powers of the European Union and would be glad to

87
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,500
see it consigned to the dustbin of history.

88
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,265
