1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,270
Section 10 is about popular culture.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,630
What makes popular culture different from high culture?

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:14,540
High culture is a term that refers to various forms of art that are consumed

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,240
by a very restricted, smaller group of people.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,000
Traditionally in Europe, for example, members of the aristocratic classes

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,930
would commission, for their own enjoyment, a piece of music, or a

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,050
painting, or a sculpture.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,920
And this provided very important employment opportunities to some very,

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,940
very important artists.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,550
The idea that there is a high culture that is more complex, more refined,

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:53,290
elevated, in a way, and restricted to smaller groups that have the tastes

12
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,480
and the ability to understand it and enjoy it is really quite

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,380
a persistent idea.

14
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:07,220
This is an idea that is certainly not as influential as it used to be.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,180
Popular culture is generally considered to be less complex.

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,540
It is more accessible to much greater numbers of people.

17
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:27,580
Certain critics will consider it to be of a lower quality, simple-minded,

18
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:34,520
tasteless, saccharin, sentimental, melodramatic.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,870
In other words, demonstrating qualities that are not as elevated as

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,760
the qualities of better types of art would be.

21
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,430
So there's a qualitative aspect to this.

22
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,850
And of course, there's a huge quantitative aspect in that the

23
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,240
general assumption is that popular culture can be accessible to and

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,750
enjoyed, and consumed, by enormous numbers of people.

25
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:10,699
Numbers much larger than are listening to symphonies or going to art museums.

26
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,210
How does popular culture drive out high culture?

27
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,150
I don't think of popular culture drives out high culture.

28
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:27,450
I think that there's an audience for high culture that is likely to be

29
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,230
considerably smaller than the audience for various forms of popular culture.

30
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,440
One should not forget that it is perfectly possible for lots of people

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,890
to enjoy both, to enjoy classical music, for example, and appreciate it

32
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,640
for its qualities, and to enjoy popular music of various kinds and,

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,910
similarly, appreciate it for what it has to offer.

34
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,550
So these are not mutually exclusive categories--

35
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:06,040
certainly, these days, when a lot of trends in art have been in a

36
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,400
democratizing direction that--

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,350
I mean, you think of an Andy Warhol, for example, who turned, for better or

38
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,080
for worse, turned tomato cans into what some people

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,510
consider to be high art.

40
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,150
That's a real merging of the categories in a dramatic way.

41
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,680
Why does popular culture of any country go international and become

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,090
mass culture?

43
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,960
It is a fact that--

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,170
staying with the realm of music--

45
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:45,070
that there are artists, or musical groups, that produce music that

46
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,880
becomes enormously popular--

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,420
globally popular, in a significant sense.

48
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:02,550
Now that is a question of the talent and hard work occurring in a certain

49
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:08,100
place, a country, within a certain culture, with certain kinds of

50
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,280
production facilities and opportunities available so that

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,680
everything comes together in the right way, and you get a popular cultural

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,390
product that turns out to be enormously appealing to very large

53
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,090
numbers of people in various parts of the world.

54
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,400
That's the mystery of creativity.

55
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,834
Where do the Beatles come from?

56
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:43,960
To take the example, I believe, of way a musical group that literally

57
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,220
conquered the world in a big way, back in the 1960s, and remains a venerated

58
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,860
collection of musicians.

59
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,050
And there's a huge sort of musical corpus that comes from the Beatles

60
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,680
that is very much alive.

61
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,370
The real question is not why musical genius happens.

62
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,880
It happens.

63
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,340
That's hard to explain.

64
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,970
The more interesting question would be, why was it Britain that produced

65
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,000
the most influential music of the 1960s?

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,050
How can cultural exports harm the American image?

67
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,710
Popular culture can have a tremendous influence on how people from outside

68
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,830
the United States think of the United States and what it has to offer.

69
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,510
It is not all positive.

70
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,410
It is not all wide open spaces.

71
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,260
It is not all, I'm going to get in a convertible and feel liberated and

72
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,940
American by tearing down a highway going west through Nevada.

73
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,720
I mean, the Europeans have experiences like that.

74
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,820
We should also remember that enormously influential American

75
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,230
cultural material can create a very negative images as well.

76
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,190
There are going to be people all over the world who have never been to the

77
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,910
United States except in the sense that they've been watching popular films.

78
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,590
And many, many of them are going to conclude that the United States is a

79
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:25,720
very violent place, that all that matters is money, that guns and gun

80
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,995
play are everywhere, that there is a great deal of sexual

81
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:34,030
immodesty, et cetera.

82
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:41,100
So there is no one to one correlation between the actuality of American

83
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,070
society, and what happens in American society, and the entertainment

84
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:54,430
products that cross many national boundaries and wind up on televisions,

85
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,140
or in cinemas, in faraway places where people are going to draw their own

86
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,030
conclusions about what life in the United States is like on the basis of

87
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,310
the only evidence that is presented to them.

88
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,960
I mean, back in the '70s, for example, when the Dallas TV series was very

89
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,790
popular, it was a sensation in the United States, people in other

90
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:26,820
countries were forming ideas about the state of Texas that were wildly

91
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:34,160
inaccurate because the only evidence they had to judge was this program

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,990
about this wacky dysfunctional family on this make believe

93
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,650
branch up near Dallas.

94
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,680
So these things happen.

95
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,040
And it's easy to be misled.

96
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,440
What would it take for people to feel more like global citizens, rather than

97
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,530
citizens from their home countries?

98
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:00,110
I think popular music is an excellent way to approach this question, in the

99
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:06,750
sense that if you have lots of people, in many countries around the world,

100
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:13,280
enjoying, identifying with, even giving cult status to a popular

101
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,570
musician or a group of musicians like the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, I

102
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:25,330
think this does constitute a certain limited, but real, form of global

103
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,750
citizenship.

104
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,240
That we belong to a global community that identifies with this art form,

105
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,880
that identifies with this particular artist, that identifies with whatever

106
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,440
value system that artist may represents.

107
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,510
And here, I think we're talking more about young people

108
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,810
than about older people.

109
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,610
But that is a kind of global citizenship.

110
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,440
How does the section, section 10, popular culture, connects to the other

111
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,980
topics in the course?

112
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,050
It connects to a number of the other topics in this course.

113
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,200
Take, for example, sports.

114
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,790
Sports may be most appreciated, massively watched form of popular

115
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,060
culture on the face of the Earth.

116
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,570
Regulation is associated with popular culture in that there are going to be

117
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,170
societies that don't want certain popular cultural products on their

118
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,130
television sets, or in their cinemas, or maybe even in their iPods,

119
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,430
if they have them.

120
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:34,440
The whole national identity theme is relevant in that popular culture is

121
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,840
popular beyond national communities.

122
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,830
If an artist originates in a particular nation and achieves global

123
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:50,660
popularity, which many of them do, to what extent has that artists left his

124
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,230
or her nation behind and become a certain kind of a

125
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,290
global artistic citizen?

126
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:03,790
And of course, the media are really the platform on which popular cultural

127
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,490
forms are broadcast throughout the world.

128
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,350
Thank you, Dr. [? Herberman, ?]

129
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,080
for talking to us about popular culture.

130
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,330
Thank you.

131
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,915
