1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,200
The globalization of the media, the American journalist George Packer

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,730
wrote not long after the 9/11 terror attacks, was supposed to knit the

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,250
world together.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,940
The more information we receive about one another, the thinking went, the

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,860
more international understanding will prevail.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,240
The American media entrepreneur Ted Turner built the Cable News Network,

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,020
CNN, in the belief that human contact via mass media would resolve conflicts

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,360
and create goodwill.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,640
My main concern, he once said, is to be a benefit to the world, to build up

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,330
a global communications system that helps humanity come together.

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,490
Outside the media world, Turner became a committed internationalist, funding

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,570
the United Nations Foundation with a gift of $1 billion and sponsoring the

13
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,070
Goodwill Games, an international athletic competition that was held

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,200
five times between 1986 and 2001.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,620
One could say that along with his other pursuits, Ted Turner made a

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,106
prominent career as an idealistic internationalist.

17
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:13,600


18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,940
The idea that communication has calming and healing effects across

19
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,660
national borders has been accepted for a long time.

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:27,360
The 1797 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, for example, contained the

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,920
following optimistic speculation--

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,980
"The capitals of distant nations might be united by chains of signaling posts

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,560
and the settling of those disputes, which at present take months or years,

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,690
might then be accomplished in as many hours." In 1830, Samuel Morse, the

25
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,610
inventor of the Morse code used in telegraphy, said, "I see no reason why

26
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,630
intelligence might not be instantaneously transmitted by

27
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,900
electricity to any distance."

28
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,690
The development of the international telegraph confirmed this prediction

29
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,620
shortly thereafter.

30
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,380
Today, however, it is not short bursts of intelligence that are transmitted

31
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,950
around the world.

32
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,170
Countless sounds, images, and virtual reproductions of human experience are

33
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,800
exchanged among billions of people in more than 200 different countries.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,570
And we are still learning how to understand the consequences of these

35
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:34,220
virtual encounters experienced by people who know next to nothing of

36
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,500
significance about those they're encountering online.

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,240
We will come back to this topic, but now let us visit a long ago age of

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,380
optimism about the peace promoting effects that long distance

39
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,900
communications would surely have on the relations between nations.

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,230


41
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,740
Since the arrival of the telegraph in the mid-19th century, many people,

42
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,070
like Ted Turner, have associated instant communications with the

43
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,990
prevention or resolution of international conflicts.

44
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:14,000
As one telegraphy expert said in 1898, experience distinctly pronounces in

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,300
favor of the Pacific effects of telegraphy.

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,600
40 years earlier upon the completion of the first transatlantic telegraph

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,420
in 1858, the President of the United States, James Buchanan, exchanged

48
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,170
messages with Queen Victoria and proclaimed this telegraphic link

49
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,500
between continents a triumph more glorious because far more useful to

50
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,040
mankind than was ever won by a conqueror on the field of battle.

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,000
During the second half of the 19th century, there was much similar talk

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,480
of the moral influence of the telegraph and the universal kinship it

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,030
would create.

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,900
This sort of technological optimism repeated itself in another form during

55
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,430
the mid-1990's when some observers saw the internet as a liberating

56
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,440
cyberspace that would promote a sense of community among its users.

57
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,360
For example, in 1997, one computer scientist at the Massachusetts

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,070
Institute of Technology wrote of the possibility of computer aided peace.

59
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,240
In both cases, a kind of magical thinking about the benign powers of

60
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,390
technology overwhelmed more balanced perspectives about the consequences of

61
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,445
a dramatic technological innovation.

62
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:39,160


63
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,470
As we will see later in this section, early utopian visions of the internet

64
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,440
and its potential for doing good have given way to increasingly distopian

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,140
views of the internet and its effects.

66
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,800
This pessimism includes doubts about mass communications as a potential

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,270
vehicle of mutual understanding across national and cultural borders.

68
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,830
It is not surprising that dissolution about the peace promoting powers of

69
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,990
the cybersphere appeared after the destruction of the World Trade Towers

70
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,520
by terrorists in September of 2001.

71
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,060
The dramatic appearance of an apparently implacable hostility

72
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,200
between Christian and Muslim worlds portended a clash of civilizations

73
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,700
against which mass media alone could not possibly prevail.

74
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,740
George Packer wrote in 2002 that the utopian community promised by the

75
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,470
boosters of globalization had failed to appear.

76
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,740
That, as he put it, togetherness has not created the human

77
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,570
bonds that were promised.

78
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,790
In some ways, global satellite TV and internet access have actually made the

79
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,350
world a less understanding, a less tolerant place.

80
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,880
What the media provide, he says, is superficial familiarity, images

81
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,860
without context, indignation without remedy.

82
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,970
The problem isn't just the content of the media, but the fact that while

83
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,630
images become international, people's lives remain parochial in the Arab

84
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,420
world and everywhere else including here.

85
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,110
In Packer's view, mass media contact between politically or culturally

86
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:30,100
estranged populations appeared to be doing more harm than good.

87
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,050
The American journalist Thomas Friedman, who has written extensively

88
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,300
on globalization, expressed a similar viewpoint on the limited value of

89
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,500
media contact in 2002.

90
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,220
Friedman argued that technological connectivity could accomplish nothing

91
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,810
of value in the absence of social, political, and cultural connections

92
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,060
that created some real understanding across these boundaries.

93
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,490
And he too detected a kind of magical thinking about technological

94
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,900
innovations.

95
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,370
Because, he says, the internet has an aura of technology surrounding it, the

96
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,360
uneducated believe information from it even more.

97
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,310
They don't realize that the internet at its ugliest is just an open sewer,

98
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,615
an electronic conduit of untreated, unfiltered information.

99
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:26,740


100
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,390
Looking back over the two decades that have passed since the world wide web

101
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:36,730
went online in 1991, it is clear that what George Packer called the utopian

102
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,890
community promised by the boosters of globalization was wishful thinking.

103
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,770
There was no good reason to believe that the human condition in its

104
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,590
entirety complete with racial hatreds and criminal ambitions would not be

105
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,600
uploaded to the cybersphere.

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,720
But we should also recognize that it is not just technology that inspires

107
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,440
magical thinking.

108
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,810
The theme of globalization itself encourages magical thinking, because

109
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,580
it promises a useful theory of how the world system works and how this global

110
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,210
system might be manipulated to serve human ends.

111
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,000
