00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020


1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,200
It is now widely recognized that important aspects of the globalization

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,090
process facilitate transnational organized crime in a variety of ways.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,970
This section of the course will look at how this process promotes both

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,210
legal and illegal profit making activities at the same time by

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,390
exploiting, for example, the great global transportation and

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,710
communication systems that make globalization possible.

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,360
Our basic question for this section of the course is, what are the specific

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,000
characteristics of globalization that facilitate the illegal activities of

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,280
transnational criminals.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,500
The Italian sociologists Monica Massari has described the criminogenic

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,610
potential of the globalization process that is constantly creating new

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,110
opportunities for transnational criminals.

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,970


14
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,630
Globalization includes an enormous amount of economic activity that is

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:06,950
estimated to be in the range of between $65 to $85 trillion worth of

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,630
goods and services per year.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,690
As the volume of global trade increases, regulating what is being

18
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,300
shipped, as well as identifying the senders and receivers of packages or

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,740
cargo is becoming more difficult.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,940
This makes it easier for criminals to smuggle people or contraband, or steal

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,410
valuable products or materials from legitimate producers and customers.

22
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:38,120
It is estimated that transnational organized crime was an $870 billion

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,140
enterprise in 2009.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,810
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, what is striking

25
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,040
about the global map of trafficking routes is that the world's biggest

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,620
trading partners are also the world's biggest markets for

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,330
illicit goods and services.

28
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,380
This reflects the extent to which the underworld has become inextricably

29
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,580
linked to the global economy, and vice versa.

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,400
Nor do the criminals have to work at creating demand, as the UN report

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,580
notes, most of the trafficking flows examined in this report are the

32
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,160
product of market forces, rather than the plotting of

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,400
dedicated criminal groups.

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,090
Demand exists for drugs, prostitution, cheap labor, firearms, wild animal

35
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,450
parts, knock off goods, hardwoods, and child pornography.

36
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,290
The consumption of these goods apparently carries

37
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,540
little moral stigma.

38
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,990


39
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,620
There are two useful ways to survey the sheer scope of

40
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,960
transnational crime.

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,020
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime published in 2010 a long report that

42
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,140
lists transnational criminal activities in terms of illicit

43
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,140
commodities and specific threats.

44
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,740
Trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants, trafficking in cocaine,

45
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,100
heroin, firearms, environmental resources, and counterfeit products,

46
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,640
maritime piracy, and cybercrime.

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,970
This 300-page document is filled with interesting and detailed descriptions

48
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,960
of how transnational criminals plan and carry out their operations, and

49
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,830
about the annual consumption or confiscation of illicit products.

50
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,780
For example, the world consumed 340 tons of heroin in 2008.

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,780
15,000 kilograms of elephant ivory were confiscated in 2009.

52
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,810
2/3 of the anti-malarial chloroquine tablets sent to Ghana in 2003 were

53
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,960
useless, and therefore dangerous, counterfeits.

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Up to 40% of the wood-based products the European Union imports from

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,790
Southeast Asia may come from illegal logging operations.

56
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,480
About two billion counterfeit consumer items are shipped from China to the

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,010
European Union countries each year.

58
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,420
There are about 1.5 million victims of identity theft around

59
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,660
the world each year.

60
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,300
This list represents a very small fraction of the damage transnational

61
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,660
criminals inflict on innocent people around the world every year.

62
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,400
This kind of specific information about the types and effects of

63
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,150
transnational crime is absolutely necessary for the purpose of getting a

64
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,180
sense of how deeply these criminal activities permeate the daily lives of

65
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,520
people across the globe.

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,720
The second approach to understanding transnational criminal activities

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,880
looks at the global socioeconomic context in which these crimes occur.

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,600
This perspective allows us to think about the cause and effect

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,220
relationships that link people's living conditions to their propensity

70
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,025
to either commit or to become the victims of transnational crimes.

71
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:07,760


72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,700
Transnational crime is inextricably linked to the global distribution of

73
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,250
wealth and poverty.

74
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,300
Those who study globalization have various ways to describe the fact that

75
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,970
the globalization process benefits some populations

76
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,160
while it harms others.

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,380
One can speak in abstract terms about globalization's having positive and

78
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,750
negative consequences in different parts of the world, or

79
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,890
within a single country.

80
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:42,280
The economist Joseph Stiglitz writes of asymmetric globalization that has

81
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,520
put developing countries at a disadvantage because of unfair trade

82
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,190
agreements the developed countries have imposed upon them.

83
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:56,120
One also sees the term uneven globalization.

84
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,140
More candid depictions of the consequences of these imbalances of

85
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,730
power use terms like, the dark side of globalization, the underbelly of

86
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,430
globalization, or the dirty economy that co-exists

87
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,590
alongside the clean economy.

88
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,470
In the last analysis, this discussion is about the economic and social

89
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,960
inequalities that are created, or sustained, or amplified by the

90
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,310
globalization process.

91
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,160
We should always keep in mind that the dark side and the underbelly of

92
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,430
globalization have human faces.

93
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,750
In fact, studying the impacts of transnational crime in their gory

94
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,000
details serves as a useful antidote to the social science jargon that, in its

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,170
euphemizing way, numbs our ability to understand and empathize with the

96
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,630
experiences of vulnerable and traumatized people.

97
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,290
An enormous amount of transnational crime originates in the misery and

98
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,670
desperation that result from increasing economic

99
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,110
inequality around the globe.

100
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,090
A prime example of the dynamic that results from a porous border

101
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,990
separating prosperous and impoverished territories is the trafficking of

102
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,540
women for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

103
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,450
Most of the trafficking victims who end up in Europe come from the

104
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,770
relatively poor societies that were once the Western territories of the

105
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,520
former Soviet empire, such as Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, the Russian

106
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,190
Federation, and the Republic of Moldova.

107
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,040
Lacking opportunities in their native countries, most of these women are

108
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,180
persuaded to leave by promises of work, participation in beauty

109
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,730
contests, modeling opportunities, affordable vacations, study abroad

110
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,740
programs, or marriage services.

111
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,090
Studies from Ukraine indicate that 11% of the victims were trafficked with

112
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,840
the active cooperation of their husbands.

113
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,980
Some of the trafficked women who wind up in Europe come from other

114
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,650
parts of the world.

115
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,200
Traffickers in Latin America may also make use of entertainment networks,

116
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,400
fashion agencies, employment agencies, marriage and tourism agencies, and

117
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,610
newspaper advertisements to recruit victims.

118
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,350
This list of situations and venues does not even include the bars,

119
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,360
massage parlors, dancing clubs, pornography operations, and arranged

120
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,530
marriage schemes in which trafficked women can be placed.

121
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,850
This kind of information makes it clear that the transnational criminal

122
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,950
exploitation of vulnerable women who are deceived and manipulated into

123
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,720
traveling west to the prosperous Eurozone makes use of any number of

124
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,560
social venues and relationships that are perfectly legitimate, rather than

125
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,620
being criminal activities in and of themselves.

126
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,950


127
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,740
The human trafficking that was just described involves a basic feature of

128
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,060
globalization, the movement of large numbers of people across borders, and

129
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,370
the consequences that follow their displacement from

130
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,550
one place to another.

131
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,360
In this case, the victims are moved across borders to serve the clients on

132
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,430
their home territory.

133
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,760
Transnational sex crime also includes the reverse travel arrangement, known

134
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,020
as international sex tourism, where so-called sex tourists travel to

135
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,350
distant countries to engage in legal prostitution with adults, or what are

136
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,710
usually illegal sexual activities with children.

137
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:45,030
And here too, there are international organizations keeping watch.

138
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:51,310
The International Labor organization promulgated in 1999 the Convention

139
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,520
Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination

140
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,370
of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, including child prostitution.

141
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,640
The UN-affiliated world tourism organization defined sex tourism as

142
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,910
trips organized from within the tourism sector, or from outside the

143
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,800
sector, but using its structures and networks, with the primary purpose of

144
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,770
effecting a commercial sexual relationship by the tourist with

145
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,390
residence at the destination.

146
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,990
International hotel chains and airlines are indirect beneficiaries of

147
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,220
global sex tourism.

148
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,340
One might say that it is a sign of globalization when a social phenomenon

149
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,330
with criminal potential, such as human trafficking, catalyzes the formation

150
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,050
of international groups to criticize it, monitor it, or even attempt to

151
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,300
regulate it.

152
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,670


153
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,240
The universality of the human sex drive and people's attempts to satisfy

154
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,590
it creates social institutions or practices that are examples of

155
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,340
globalization.

156
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,160
These institutions and practices, as we've seen, often incorporating an

157
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,870
imbalance of power between exploiters and victims, and

158
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,720
between men and women.

159
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,160
One commentator calls the extremely profitable sexualization of many

160
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,160
societies based on social domination an increasingly central aspect of

161
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,290
current capitalist globalization.

162
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,580
The French legal scholar Marie-Claire Belleau has studied the traffic in

163
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,770
mail order brides and describes it too as a globalization phenomenon.

164
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:38,600
The global quest for romance, as she puts it, has been made possible by the

165
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,760
growing accessibility of information technology networks and

166
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,790
international travel.

167
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,160
In this theoretical scenario, the ultimate goal is an intercultural

168
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,880
marriage, with the objective of enabling the woman to emigrate.

169
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,660
The consequence of this global quest for romance is a flourishing and

170
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,330
lucrative industry involving the trafficking of women from the third

171
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,390
world to husbands in the first world.

172
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,050
The mail order bride industry is yet another example of a globalization

173
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,350
phenomenon that is based on an imbalance of power that takes the form

174
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,110
of social domination.

175
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,610
First, the men have money and the women do not.
