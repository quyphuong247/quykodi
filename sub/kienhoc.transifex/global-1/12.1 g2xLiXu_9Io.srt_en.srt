00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160


1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,380
The globalization of modern sport began during the last decades of the

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,500
19th century, a period of intensive internationalization we have

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,180
identified elsewhere in this course as the second phase of globalization from

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,800
the middle of the 19th century to 1914.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,930
We have also described the Red Cross, the scouting movement, and the

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,770
International Olympic Committee as idealistic internationalisms that

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,400
appeared during this period and have gone on to great success as global

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,570
institutions.

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,870
The establishment of the Olympic movement in 1894 coincided with the

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,830
sharply accelerated formation of a broad range of international

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,020
organizations during the last decades of the 19th century.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,320
Between 1855 and 1914, their overall numbers increased from a mere handful

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,230
to around 200.

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,890
These transnational organizations included some major sports federations

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,129
that appeared during the second phase of globalization.

16
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,140
The International Cycling Union was founded in 1900.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,216
The International Football Federation, FIFA, in 1904.

18
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,900
The International Swimming Federation, FINA, in 1908.

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,140
The International Track and Field Federation, the IAAF, 1912.

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,720
And the International Lawn Tennis Association in 1913.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,660
The earliest predecessors of the International Weightlifting Federation

22
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,110
date from 1890 and 1905.

23
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,120
The clustering of these dates of origin clearly demonstrates how the

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,490
early globalization of sport coincided with the intensive

25
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,615
internationalization of this era.

26
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:50,720


27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,330
The first phase of the globalization of sport thus coincided with many

28
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,000
other globalizations, including the international expansion of scientific

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,630
organizations and practical international projects such as the

30
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,130
Universal Postal Union.

31
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,130
Our modern sense of what the idealistic internationalisms can

32
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,650
accomplish has been profoundly shaped by our image of the Enlightenment

33
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,680
cosmopolitanism that dates from the late 18th century in Europe.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,910
The League of Nations, the United Nations, the vast empires of modern

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,570
science and sports, and countless international arrangements of equal or

36
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:35,420
lesser scope all trace their ancestry, to some degree, to the European

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,890
Enlightenment and its promise to serve what the American Philosophical

38
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:47,810
Society called in 1778 "the common interests of humanity."

39
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,250
The idea that international sport can contribute to the healing of conflicts

40
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,230
between nations was first formulated by the founder of the Olympic

41
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,970
movement, the French nobleman Pierre de Coubertin.

42
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,450
It is important to recognize that Coubertin's motive for creating

43
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,660
Olympic sport of internationalism was rooted in his own French nationalism.

44
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,640
Traumatized, like his entire generation of Frenchmen, by the

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,440
military disaster of the Franco-Prussian war, Coubertin saw

46
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,300
sport of competitions as having two kinds of strategic value.

47
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,230
First, Olympic games could mitigate international conflict.

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,260
Second, the cultivation of sport would strengthen the young French males

49
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,050
whose military service would defend France against future

50
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,060
threats from Germany.

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,980
Coubertin was only a reluctant Democrat, and he was not an

52
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,240
Enlightenment cosmopolitan.

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,320
Like the founder of the officially non-racial scouting movement Lord

54
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,550
Baden-Powell Coubertin was comfortable with European colonialism.

55
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,240
"Colonies," he wrote in 1902, "are like children.

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,080
It is relatively easy to bring them into the world.

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,170
The difficult thing is to raise them properly." There were no African or

58
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:13,060
Asian competitors at the first modern Olympic games in Athens in 1896.

59
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,390
By today's standards, the founder of the Olympic movement, like the founder

60
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,440
of the scouting movement, was a conventional racist of his time.

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,550


62
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,050
Observers of today's multiracial Olympic movement may find it hard to

63
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,110
acknowledge the sheer politically incorrectness of its founder.

64
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,190
The lesson here is that the early globalization of sport did not proceed

65
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,060
under the auspices of an international institution such as UNESCO, which has

66
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,180
an anti-racist ideology as well as many contacts in today's international

67
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,520
sports world.

68
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,730
In other words, it was perfectly possible back then to be

69
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,050
globally-minded without being particularly interested in human

70
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,850
rights, and exactly the same principle applies to the International Olympic

71
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,870
Committee today.

72
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,020
The ambition to make sure that all of the world's nations belong to the

73
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,420
so-called Olympic family is an example of amoral universalism, rather than an

74
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,230
ethically motivated universalism.

75
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,340
The IOC continues to do business with repressive dictatorships on a regular

76
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,030
basis while claiming that engagement with the Olympic movement and its

77
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:35,580
values will soften the hearts and change the minds of the authoritarians

78
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,150
to whom it grants the right to stage the games.

79
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,440
The IOC's rhetorical antidote to the brutal political realities associated

80
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,650
with putting Olympic games in Beijing in 2008 or Sochi in 2014 are

81
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,790
sentimental cliches about the Olympic family and its so-called values.

82
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,920
Later in this section, we will take a close look at the membership of the

83
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,440
IOC and the values it represents.

84
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,060
Now, let us return to the early phase of the globalization of sport in

85
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,920
search of other formative influences that coincided with the birth of the

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,605
Olympic movement just before the turn of the century.

87
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,640


88
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,120
The British empire was by far the most important factor in the early

89
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,210
globalization of sport.

90
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,890
By the end of the 19th century, the British ruled over the global empire

91
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,370
on which the sun never set.

92
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,930
At the elite British public schools, sports played an important role in

93
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,530
training the next generation of colonial officers and administrators

94
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,080
who would be called upon to discipline the darker-skinned populations of the

95
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,890
imperial realm.

96
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,470
In 1895, one headmaster described this doctrine of

97
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,120
imperial sport as follows--

98
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,950
"Englishmen are not superior to Frenchmen or Germans in brains or

99
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,850
industry or the science and apparatus of war.

100
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,870
But they are superior in the health and temper which gains in part." In

101
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,570
the history of the British empire, he says, it is written that England has

102
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,180
called her sovereignty to her sports.

103
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,260
The global diffusion of sport, notes Professor Alan Bairner, certainly owes

104
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,900
much to the imperial exploits of the British with sports such as cricket

105
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,940
and rugby union becoming rapidly and firmly established in various corners

106
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,190
of the British Empire.

107
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,920


108
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,120
In summary, the globalization of sport during the early period originated in

109
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,880
political strategies formulated by a French nationalist educator,

110
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,750
Coubertin, and the political elite in London that was

111
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,090
running the British empire.

112
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:55,430
We must also recognize, however, that both Coubertin and Baden-Powell,

113
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,330
despite the imperfect origins of their idealistic internationalism, were

114
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,120
genuinely visionaries of the second phase of globalization.

115
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Both men began by addressing the national security interests of their

116
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,030
respective nations and managed eventually to invent two of the great

117
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,130
and enduring international institutions of the modern age.

118
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,260
Both of these impresarios saw the advantages in creating mass movements

119
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,190
that would abolish barriers to membership and would appear to be

120
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,840
apolitical.

121
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,940
What neither foresaw were the changes their movements

122
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,090
would eventually undergo.

123
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:40,470
The Coubertin who eulogized the 1936 Nazi Olympics shortly before his death

124
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,310
did not really see the multiracial Olympic future.

125
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,840
Nor could the Baden-Powell who made a cult of manliness have imagined the

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,050
American Boy Scouts welcoming homosexual boys into its ranks.

127
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,500
But it was inevitable that the phase two globalizing of athletes and Boy

128
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,810
Scouts a century ago has evolved into phase three versions of these

129
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,280
genuinely global movements.

130
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,250
The imaginative power of the second phase of globalization has lived on in

131
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,960
the rhetoric of universalism that is the core of Olympic doctrine.

132
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,070
In this sense, Coubertin was a hugely important creator of that global

133
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,320
imaginary that enables us to see ourselves as members of a

134
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,480
single human family.

135
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,720
It has become a routine for prominent sports officials to proclaim their

136
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,130
faith in the power of sport to reach the entire global community.

137
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,110
Coubertin declared that "sport is the possession of all the peoples of the

138
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,660
world." It is, he says, a sign of singular superiority when an

139
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,800
institution can simultaneously take the form of a deep social

140
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,150
manifestation and still spread across the surface of the globe.

141
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,370
One of his successors as president of the IOC, the American business tycoon

142
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,500
and Olympic evangelist Avery Brundage said in 1965 that "the Olympic

143
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,400
movement today is perhaps the greatest social force in the world."

144
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,900
Leaders of FIFA have embraced the same sort of evangelism.

145
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,570
Jules Rimet, the third president of FIFA, as Alan Tomlinson has written,

146
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,780
was a Christian and a patriot--

147
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,270
his love of God and nation united in his passion for football.

148
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,410
He believed in the universality of the church and saw in football the chance

149
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:40,940
to create a worldwide football family welded to Christian principles.

150
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,160
And, like his countryman Pierre de Coubertin, Rimet believed the sport

151
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,330
could be a force for good.

152
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,800
Rimet's speech about football being the spiritual community to which we

153
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,150
all adhere was given at a FIFA conference in Rio back in 1950.

154
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:06,150
Today, it is unthinkable that a man of Rimet's integrity and sincerity could

155
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,050
ascend to the presidency of FIFA or any other major international sports

156
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,450
federation.

157
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,350
These positions are now dominated by the opportunistic and sometimes

158
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,140
corrupt sports politicians who populate the offshore

159
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,430
world of Olympic sport.

160
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,390
We will review this offshore cast of characters later in this section.

161
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,260
