00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,240
No presentation of global popular culture would be complete without a

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,780
celebration of the most charismatic and transformative musical instrument

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,150
of the modern era, the electric guitar.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,750
As the music historian Steve Waxman writes, since at least the 1960s, the

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,540
electric guitar has been the principal solo instrument of popular music.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,260
And electric guitarists have become cult heroes around who many fans

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,800
perceive the music to revolve.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,440
The electric guitar embodies the spirit of the most charismatic musical

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,350
style of our modern era, and that is the rock and roll music that began its

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,670
global career during the 1950s, and has continued to generate new styles

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,020
and thrive over more than half a century.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,410
That the Rolling Stones continue to tour the world as senior citizens in

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:02,540
the year 2013, is a testimony to the enduring appeal of this musical genre.

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,800
The triumphant role of the electric guitar in popular music has both

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,640
technological and sociocultural dimensions.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,090
In addition to the guitar electrification technology developed

17
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,800
during the 1930s and 1940s, the invention of audiotape during the

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,150
1940s, the production of unbreakable 45 revolutions per minute plastic

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,670
records during the 1950s, and television broadcasts of the iconic

20
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,090
Elvis Presley during the late 1950s, made possible the mass production and

21
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,130
distribution of a new form of popular music that became, as Andy Bennett has

22
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,210
written, the first musical form to exploit the potential

23
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,430
of the global media.

24
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,080
The global impact of rock and roll music penetrated the Iron Curtain, and

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,500
started rolling through the Communist Bloc countries as early as 1955.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,820
The party bosses in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,660
East Germany found they were facing an alien force they could not control.

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,680
Rock and roll music and blue jeans arrived in the Soviet Union via the

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,130
Moscow Youth Festival in the summer of 1957, and became permanent aspects of

30
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,970
Soviet youth culture.

31
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,700
The great Soviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich denounced the alien

32
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,120
primitivism of rock and roll, but it was too late to stop

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,110
this American invasion.

34
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,600
The electric guitar was now a global force.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,570
That, as one commentator puts it, best symbolized the blend of faith in all

36
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,830
things American, the excitement of technological horizons, and the

37
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,550
kinetic energy of consumer society's sudden superstar, the teenager.

38
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,630


39
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,850
As a boy growing up near New York during the late 1950s, I was

40
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,540
fascinated by what musicians were learning to do with

41
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,350
the electric guitar.

42
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,550
A famous example of a guitarist exploring the limits of the instrument

43
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,340
was Link Wray's instrumental Rumble.

44
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,950
As Rolling Stone magazine tells the story, when Link Wray released the

45
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,020
thrilling ominous Rumble in 1958, it became one of the only instrumentals

46
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,010
ever to be banned from radio play for fear that it might

47
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,800
insight gang violence.

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,520
Rumble is very basic rock and roll.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,180
Using the E, A and D cords, feedback and distortion effects, and featuring

50
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,910
a descent down E-minor pentatonic scale that is the backbone of rock and

51
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,290
roll as well as the rhythm and blues, from which it derives.

52
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,820
Here are a few bars from one of the most influential electric guitar solos

53
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,480
in the history of rock music.
