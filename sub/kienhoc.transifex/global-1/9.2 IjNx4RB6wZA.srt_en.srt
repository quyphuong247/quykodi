00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,390


1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:06,070
The remaining part of this section concerns a major dynamic of the global

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,420
labor market we have already referred to as outsourcing, or offshoring.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,250
For our purposes, both terms will refer to the relocation of work in

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,360
foreign locations at the expense of domestic workers who must

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,620
now find new jobs.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,360
It is not surprising that outsourcing has become a source of anxiety about

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,090
unemployment in the workforce and among politicians who are expected to

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,830
protect domestic jobs.

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,870
It is, of course, corporate executives, not politicians, who do

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,100
the hiring.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,480
And this brings us to a topic that is addressed elsewhere in the course,

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,900
namely the contest for power between nation states and multinational

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,150
corporations.

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,320


15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,180
In February of 2011, President Barack Obama attended a dinner with the most

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,180
powerful executives in California's Silicon Valley.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,860
As Steve Jobs of the Apple Corporation was making some remarks, the president

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,220
interrupted him with a question.

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,410
What would it take to induce Apple to manufacture iPhones

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,930
in the United States?

21
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,370
The reply from Mr. Jobs was brutally frank.

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,250
Those jobs aren't coming back, he told the president.

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,790


24
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,210
This exchange between the most powerful representatives of a great

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,500
multinational corporation and the world's mightiest nation state sums up

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,350
the powerlessness of the nation state when confronted by the implacable

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,310
logic of the global marketplace.

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,770
We sell iPhones in over 100 countries, one Apple executive observed on

29
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,420
another occasion.

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,170
We don't have an obligation to solve America's problems.

31
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,010
Our only obligation is to make the best product possible.

32
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,660
It takes 3/4 of a million workers to produce iPads and iPhones, but only 1

33
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:11,290
in 16 of them is employed by Apple in the United States.

34
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,800
This outsourcing scenario about relatively low-skilled workers, who,

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,410
according to Apple, outperform their American counterparts has become a

36
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,250
familiar globalization story.

37
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,730
Today, however, the new and more ominous story, certainly for a

38
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,230
professor, is about the possibility that many high skill jobs will become

39
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,200
vulnerable to being outsourced to lower cost foreigners with comparable

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,730
but less expensive skills.

41
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,650
At stake are entire sectors of the global employment market that have

42
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,720
sustained millions of highly educated and highly trained professionals, such

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,580
as academics and doctors and lawyers.

44
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,960
The outsourcing of professional work is now one part of the

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,690
global labor market.

46
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,580
Routine legal work, for example, is being outsourced from the United

47
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,810
States to firms in India.

48
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,480
Searching through large numbers of legal briefs and precedents or

49
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,820
examining documents and draft contracts are some examples of

50
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,850
currently outsourced legal work.

51
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,740
As of 2010, less than 1% of what Americans spent on

52
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,790
lawyers was going overseas.

53
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,110
But this percentage was rising.

54
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,710
Earlier in this section, we noted that both outsourcing and automation can

55
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,850
replace human workers.

56
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,190
The Economist magazine reported in 2013 that law firms are using

57
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,560
computers to search through masses of legal briefs and precedents.

58
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,710
Financial companies are using computers to monitor news feeds and

59
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,150
make financial bets on the basis of the information they uncover.

60
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,590
It is going to be interesting to see how highly trained professionals and

61
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,240
intellectuals around the world are going to respond to this challenge.

62
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,700


63
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,440
Medical tourism is a thriving example of the outsourcing of

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,050
professional work.

65
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,040
These scenarios involve people seeking medical or dental treatment or perhaps

66
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,650
medically unorthodox or disreputable procedures that cannot

67
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,630
be obtained at home.

68
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,510
Professor I. Glen Cohen of Harvard Law School has described three kinds of

69
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,320
medical tourism.

70
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,190
The first involves medical services that are illegal both in the patient's

71
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,130
home country and in the country that offers the service.

72
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,170
The second involves medical services that are illegal in the patient's home

73
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,990
country but legal in the country where the service is offered.

74
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,610
The third scenario involves a medical procedure that is

75
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,980
legal in both countries.

76
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,110
Regarding the third scenario, it is useful once again to look at a

77
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,700
comparison between professional services offered in the

78
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,310
United States and India.

79
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,630
Medical costs in the United States are the highest in the world.

80
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,630
For that reason, some American insurance companies and corporations

81
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,230
advise patients to seek much less expensive treatments, including heart

82
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,300
surgeries in hospitals in India and Thailand.

83
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,480
This trend could put many American doctors and even

84
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,740
hospitals out of business.

85
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,260
Indeed, anyone participating in this course can go online and survey what

86
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,450
this expanding market has to offer.

87
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,160


88
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,430
Medical tourism is an international business.

89
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,490
And many countries have embraced this entrepreneurial approach to joining

90
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,880
for-profit global medical network.

91
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,950
After Thailand's currency crisis in 1997, the government promoted Thai

92
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:03,040
medical facilities as desirable venues for plastic surgeries and eventually

93
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,190
sex change operation that required less of the psychological counseling

94
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,340
that is often mandatory elsewhere.

95
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,350
During the 1980s, Cuba initiated programs to attract foreign patients

96
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,530
from India, Latin America, and Europe for eye surgeries, heart procedures,

97
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,560
and cosmetic procedures.

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,070
The expanding and proliferating market for services offered by medical

99
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,240
tourism is a genuine globalization phenomena.

100
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,680
Its global regulator, insofar as this is possible, is the nonprofit Joint

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,220
Commission International.

102
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,400
Professor Manfred Steger's observation that globalization includes an

103
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,980
insatiable appetite for technology fits the

104
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,990
phenomenon of medical tourism.

105
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,440
Reproductive tourism in India matches Western women in search of surrogate

106
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,920
mothers with poor Indian women who can transform their economic status by

107
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,790
giving birth to other women's babies.

108
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,360
The cost is low, and the regulation is light.

109
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,860
Once again however, we confront a relationship made possible by

110
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,810
globalization that consummates a financial transaction entered into by

111
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,660
people of unequal social and financial status.

112
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,270
Medical tourism can also take the form of access to drugs that are restricted

113
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,940
in some countries and freely available in others.

114
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,340
Young Australian men take steroid vacations to Thailand.

115
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,590
The Anti Aging Institute of the Americas in Costa Rica offers hormone

116
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,440
replacement therapy that includes both testosterone and human growth hormone.

117
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,270
While American doctors are providing more and more testosterone therapy to

118
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,520
aging men, for better or for worse, the American Medical Association does

119
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,450
not endorse the use of human growth hormone for anti-aging purposes.

120
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,410


121
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,440
It is not surprising that the global medical labor market includes many

122
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,140
doctors who will perform procedures that other and perhaps more ethical

123
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,920
doctors will not.

124
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,660
We've already seen that the race to the bottom of the regulatory ladder is

125
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,610
a familiar feature of the globalization process.

126
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,530
In this sense, the offshore anti-aging clinic is comparable to the

127
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,559
offshore tax haven.

128
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,350
The race to the bottom of the regulatory ladder in a globalizing

129
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,250
world takes many forms.

130
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,140
It remains to be seen whether the global community will devise ways to

131
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,480
climb back up the regulatory ladder that will establish global norms that

132
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,230
are worthy of our respect.

133
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,502
