00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050


1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,100
Section 12 is about sports.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,090
Is the traditional idealistic view of the Olympic Games changing now that

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,260
the rampant use of doping drugs is continually being uncovered?

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,160
That's a good question.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,810
And there's a distinction that has to be made here, and that is the

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:23,470
distinction between the Olympic movement, per se, and the practices of

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,360
the athletes who are doping themselves.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:36,060
To a remarkable extent, the image and stature of the Olympic movement as an

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,260
idealistic internationalism is surviving rather well, even in the

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,610
face of all the doping scandals.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,430
Is it a problem?

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,570
Yes, it is a problem.

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:52,060
Are there people who are going to be disappointed in the Olympic Games

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,520
because there is so much doping being reported?

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,400
Yes.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,550
But it's still important to differentiate between the so-called

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:10,080
Olympic movement, which is advertised by the International Olympic Committee

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,090
as a kind of peace movement.

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,980
That the International Olympic Committee, or IOC, considers itself to

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:26,790
some extent a group of diplomats who have a global function, and that is to

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:34,900
manage international competitions amongst national teams that compete

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,610
against each other.

23
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:43,740
And the idea of the founder of the Olympic movement, the French nobleman

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,360
Pierre de Coubertin, was that this would have a kind of pacifying effect

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,360
on international relations.

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,540
Unfortunately, the past century plus of Olympic sport has also been the

27
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,890
bloodiest century in human history when you look at the wars that have

28
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,400
been fought and the number of victims who have died in these wars.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,950
So you can't establish a cause and effect relationship between Olympic

30
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:23,740
competition, which is a global event, and a decrease in the amount of the

31
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,520
violence that human beings are wreaking upon each other.

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,590
Why are there so many corrupt officials in the IOC?

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:38,090
There are a striking number of corrupt or ethically compromised people in the

34
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:47,310
IOC because the international sports federations in this day and age,

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,830
including the International Olympic Committee, constitute a kind of an

36
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:58,900
offshore enterprise zone for a lot of opportunistic people who are looking

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:11,160
for power, who are looking for a public profile, who just like to be in

38
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:18,220
control and enjoy the privileges of first class air travel, five star

39
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,990
hotels, et cetera.

40
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,600
Now, as far as the International Olympic Committee today, it's

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,930
important to remember that the president of the IOC between 1980 and

42
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,880
2001 was Juan Antonio Samaranch.

43
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,050
He was an unapologetic Spanish fascist.

44
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:48,590
So what this adherent of the authoritarian fascist Franco regime

45
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:57,940
brought into the IOC was a lack of regard for democracy, certainly a

46
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,990
deficient sense of human rights.

47
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:08,220
His standards promoted a self-serving culture inside the International

48
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,540
Olympic Committee that led to a significant portion of people being

49
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,510
expelled, actually, because they had accepted bribes prior to voting for

50
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,330
this city or that city regarding the siting of the games.

51
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,710
Most of the people in the International Olympic Committee as of

52
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,430
today are people who were picked by Mr. Samaranch.

53
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:44,640
That means that his standards had a lot to do with most of the people who

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,870
are today sitting in the IOC.

55
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:56,350
And so his standards regarding the sorts of people he wanted to see in

56
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,600
the IOC were probably different from yours and mine.

57
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,620
Are corporate sponsors the only interests the IOC answers to?

58
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,350
Who the IOC answers to.

59
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:15,750
You could say the IOC really answers to nobody because it is a self

60
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,970
selecting organization.

61
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,910
It is the IOC, as it exists, who picks the new members of the IOC.

62
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,440
So it's self-perpetuating in that sense, which means that reform is not

63
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,480
going to come quickly, if it comes at all, because in a certain sense, you

64
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,680
have like selecting like.

65
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,050
So there's real continuity there.

66
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:50,070
An interesting situation developed in the spring of 1999 when the IOC was in

67
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,970
terrible trouble due to revelations that a certain number of members of

68
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,870
the IOC had, at least allegedly, been paid bribes for their votes to situate

69
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,950
the games in this city or that city.

70
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,440
It was a huge scandal.

71
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,450
There was testimony on television in front of the United States Congress.

72
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,800
Mr. Samaranch was there looking uncomfortable.

73
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,340
And the reason this was an interesting episode is that it actually addresses

74
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,670
your question, to whom or what is the IOC accountable?

75
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:39,370
Now, caught in an embarrassing bribery scandal, Mr. Samaranch, the power in

76
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:48,160
the IOC, clearly felt that public relations measures were necessary

77
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,320
because, to a certain extent, he and the IOC were accountable to, let's

78
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,970
call it public opinion, that there is only so much scandal that any

79
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:07,090
institution can tolerate or survive before it becomes necessary to take

80
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,610
countermeasures.

81
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:17,300
And so the countermeasure that Mr. Samaranch cleverly took was to appoint

82
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,250
an ethics committee of outside dignitaries.

83
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,060
One of these dignitaries was former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,

84
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,350
another was a former Secretary General of the United Nations, et cetera.

85
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:40,560
And so what you do is you say, we, the Olympic movement, are indeed

86
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,870
accountable to the body of decent opinion in the world, and we

87
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,260
are going to change.

88
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,210
And in order to help us change, we are going to enlist these international

89
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:00,190
notables who will constitute a committee to which the IOC is actually

90
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,650
answerable.

91
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:06,270
Well, it was a clever trick and Mr. Samaranch got what he wanted, which

92
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,630
was to hang onto power.

93
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,080
With all this in mind, is there any hope for the IOC or the future of the

94
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,020
Olympic Games?

95
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:22,660
As long as there is a stable of corporate sponsors who want to use the

96
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:29,650
Olympic Games as a vehicle for commercial advertising, as long as

97
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:35,720
enough credible anti-doping work is being done so that the global sporting

98
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,299
public can say, well, at least they're trying, yes, this is a very, very

99
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:46,400
successful branch of the sports entertainment industry.

100
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,830
Say what you will about the IOC--

101
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,100
and I have plenty to say about those people--

102
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,175
the fact is they inherited a great franchise.

103
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:58,780
They are impresarios.

104
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,310
They are in show business internationalism, and there is a huge

105
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:11,650
demand for major sports entertainment in this age of globalization.

106
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,020
If some countries can't afford to compete at the elite level, how can

107
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,890
the Olympics claim fairness and values of equality through international

108
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,140
sports competition?

109
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,690
Well, sports is never a matter of complete equality.

110
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,880
There are people born with athletic gifts, and there are people born

111
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,140
without them.

112
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,000
There are wealthier countries that build extensive training facilities.

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,040
The International Olympic Committee will give certain kinds of assistance

114
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,790
to poor countries, but you can't level the playing field across the globe.

115
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,830
You can't come close to leveling the playing field across the globe because

116
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,070
there are going to be a lot of relatively wealthy societies that are

117
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:08,440
going to invest a great deal of money in making sure, for reasons of

118
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:16,670
sportive nationalism, that they are fielding a respectably performing

119
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,940
contingent of athletes at the Olympic Games, at the World Cup, at the World

120
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,680
Track and Field Championships, et cetera.

121
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,384
Can athletic competition really promote peace?

122
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:34,860
I don't think so.

123
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,920
I don't think there is a correlation between the growth of international

124
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,710
athletic competitions throughout the 20th century and a condition of peace

125
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,090
in the world.

126
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,500
How does this topic of sports connect to the other sections in the course?

127
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,070
The global sports world is involved with transnational crime in several

128
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:06,040
ways, whether it's drug trafficking, or match fixing and gambling--

129
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,050
international gambling activities that produce match fixing schemes that are

130
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,640
tremendously threatening to the popularity of the sport.

131
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,320
People want to see a real contest.

132
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,380
Sports is related to regulation.

133
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,990
There's all sorts of regulations that are required to run the global sports

134
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:35,460
empire, not just regulating drugs but regulating who is eligible, what the

135
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,690
rules are, all sorts of rules and guidelines that need

136
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,850
to be agreed upon.

137
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,630
The media are tremendously connected with sports for obvious reasons.

138
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:55,770
This is, again, the platform upon which this global entertainment goes

139
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,700
out to the world.

140
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,780
Sports is related to popular culture in the sense that it is arguably the

141
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,000
most popular culture of all.

142
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,380
The only competitor, I think, would be the global music business.

143
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:22,720
It is related to labor in the sense that a professional athlete, he's

144
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:31,500
certainly not a Victorian gentleman who is doing his sport simply for

145
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,460
idealistic reasons or to build character and show that what a fine

146
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,420
amateur he is.

147
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,460
That era is gone.

148
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,620
Is this person an amateur athlete?

149
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,900
In many cases, no.

150
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,220
Is this a professional laborer?

151
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,450
In many cases, yes.

152
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,970
Thank you, Dr. Hoberman, for talking to us about sports.

153
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,220
Thank you.

154
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,820
