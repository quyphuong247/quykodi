1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,500
This section has focused so far on how large number of democratic and some

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,370
authoritarian small countries and city states have managed to cope well with

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,170
the pressures of economic globalization.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,420
But the small country experience of the globalization process has other

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,200
dimensions that may have little or nothing to do with a country's

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,970
economic status.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,160
And feeling vulnerable to being besieged or overwhelmed by forces

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,250
originating in the outside world is one of them.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,440
For this reason, we should be aware that small countries cope with

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,250
cultural anxieties that can result from engaging with the

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,210
globalization process.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,420
For example, small and even much larger societies must adjust to the

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,560
triumphal march of the English language across the globe.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,610
American English is now the international language of business,

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,010
technology, science, and academia.

16
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,650
Native speakers often feel that their languages should absorb only a limited

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,020
amount of English vocabulary.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,120
Yet the use of the internet and American electronic products can make

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,200
this seem like an impossible task.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,260
Similarly, small countries cannot afford to dub American films into

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,940
their own languages.

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,850
This can mean exposure to more English than the native speaker wants to hear.

23
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,130
At the same time it is an effective way to improve one's knowledge of

24
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,280
English, which is widely regarded as an advantage in this age of

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,580
globalization.

26
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,540
Elsewhere in this course we had look at the dominant position of Hollywood

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,540
films around the world.

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,990
Some countries are concerned about the survival of national film industries

29
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,070
and support them with state subsidies as a matter of cultural self

30
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,320
preservation.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,360


32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,140
In fact, the globalization of culture produces two different reactions to

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,340
foreign cultural products in small countries.

34
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,150
Some people will take a cosmopolitan position and welcome foreign

35
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,060
influences as a broadening and enriching influence on their lives.

36
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,810
Other people will feel that pressures exerted by foreign languages in

37
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,720
popular culture forms constitute an invasion of their privacy.

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,270
And they will do what they can to ignore or resist these intrusions into

39
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,800
what they feel is their authentic national experience.

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,500
Small countries also pursue strategies of cultural self preservation in

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,490
response to anxieties about cultural survival.

42
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,770
In Switzerland and Macedonia, this includes Christian identity; in

43
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,420
Scandinavia and Holland, royal families; in Slovakia, a national

44
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,670
identity bill.

45
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,960


46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,110
Small countries also experience other forms of vulnerability.

47
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,080
There is for example, the humiliation of a high-profile national failure,

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,200
such as the sudden collapse of the global airline that had conferred

49
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,740
special status on a small country--

50
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,840
Swiss Air in 2001, or Ireland's humiliating loss of national

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,420
sovereignty following the financial collapse of 2010.

52
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,200
In recent years, the small country of Greece has experienced a partial

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,950
disintegration of their civil society as a consequence of national

54
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,890
bankruptcy and the austerity measures the European Union has imposed on the

55
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,690
Greek economy.

56
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,280
The much smaller country of Cyprus suffered its own humiliation in 2013,

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,070
when the troika of Germany, the European Central Bank, and the

58
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,600
International Monetary Fund imposed draconian measures on the banking

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
system of Cyprus.

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,320
Cypriot officials found themselves being lectured to by EU

61
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,060
officials half their age.

62
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,060
These traumas and failures have disproportionate effects, because

63
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,930
these societies are small and exposed to the power

64
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,660
exercised by larger countries.

65
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,280
They are also subject to directives from international organizations such

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,130
as the International Monetary Fund or the European Union, to which small

67
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,159
countries often look for protection in a dangerous world.

68
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:25,100


69
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,430
Small countries also develop self-assertive strategies directed at

70
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,910
a globalized world in which small societies must almost always play

71
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,360
niche roles.

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,030
On the grandest scale, these initiatives take the form of

73
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,420
diplomatic mediation or international humanitarian.

74
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,370
The 1993 Oslo Accords attempted to resolve the

75
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,980
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

76
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,440
A private Norwegian committee awards the Nobel Peace Prize.

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,730
Also in 1993, Belgium adopted a law expanded in 1999, that empower the

78
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,240
nation's courts to hear cases of atrocities--

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,830
including genocide and other crimes against humanity--

80
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,790
that occurred anywhere, without any connection to Belgium.

81
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,700
Critics have called this initiative small-country grandiosity, even

82
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,560
mocking the size of the Palace of Justice in Brussels.

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,350
By 2003, pressure from the United States and Israel had forced the

84
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,750
Belgians to abrogate the principle of universality underlying the original

85
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,930
law, thereby demonstrating that a small country had asserted of degree

86
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,850
of authority it was too small to exercise.

87
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,970
Switzerland is the headquarters of many international bodies and the home

88
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,950
of the Geneva Conventions.

89
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,030
Sweden and Canada, the latter of which I am also calling a small country,

90
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,380
have at times adopted the role of moral superpower.

91
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,750
Other self-assertive strategies include corporate national champions,

92
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,570
such as Nokia of Finland, hyper-tall buildings in Dubai and Taipei, sport

93
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,130
of nationalism and Olympic medals, literary exports, and even performing

94
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,290
well in the Eurovision Song Contest.

95
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,660
Another form of small country self-assertion is offering asylum to

96
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,860
fugitives, such as Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, who are under threat

97
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,460
from the world's only superpower.

98
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,530


99
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,000
In summary, the relationship between small countries and the dynamic global

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,660
framework within which they operate creates opportunities, along with the

101
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,920
dangers that can threaten societies that are small, dependent, and exposed

102
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,360
to potentially destructive external forces.

103
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,300
In this sense, danger and anxiety are the price the better-prepared small

104
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,400
countries pay for the chance to achieve disproportionate success in

105
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,930
the international competitions that constitute so much of what we call

106
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,550
globalization.

107
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,930
In other words, if being small and potentially vulnerable offer special

108
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,240
opportunities to achieve for example, a national consensus of strategic

109
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,280
value, then being a small country is a status larger countries

110
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,298
may at times envy.

111
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:29,720
Indeed, the history of utopian fantasies about small places such as

112
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,650
Switzerland, Sweden, Monaco, and Nepal, suggest that on the level of

113
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,080
imagination, small countries and kingdoms have long been

114
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,330
the envy of the world.

115
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,633
