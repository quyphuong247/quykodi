1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,610
Section four is about media and technology.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,250
Does this kind of connectivity, which is such an important part of

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,010
globalization, typically promote peace or violence?

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,580
Nobody knows.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:18,170
There is no social science calculus that can compute whether the enormous

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,370
connectivity that we're experiencing today over the internet is promoting

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,690
any particular social effect.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,340
What we can say is that for a long time, it has been assumed that new

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,250
communications technologies that speed up communications between groups of

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,370
people who are far apart--

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,800
the expectation is that this is going to promote peace and

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,520
international harmony.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,710
It's a kind of a magical thinking.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,900
We saw that back in the second half of the 19th century when remarkable

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,890
assessments of the effect of the brand new telegraph were made by the

16
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,300
President of the United States, for example, James Buchanan.

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:14,390
Each of the succeeding communications technologies, such as the radio,

18
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,710
television, internet--

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,630
all of these innovations have created fantasies about

20
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,560
their beneficial effects.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,580
And that just so long as we can get people in touch with each other, they

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,910
are not going to hate each other.

23
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,060
They're not going to be involved in unnecessary conflicts.

24
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:44,470
I think the consensus is that this is not an accurate assessment of the

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:52,700
effects of sheer mass connectivity, where anybody has access to the news

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,690
from just about any corner of the world.

27
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,590
People are expressing themselves on hundreds of thousands of websites--

28
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,490
some of them hateful, some of them humanitarian, many, many in between.

29
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,180
There is a great deal of material out there.

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,090
But nobody can say whether it is collectively, at the end of the day,

31
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,140
creating a positive or a negative effect.

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,570
Why does this kind of technology inspire so much magical thinking about

33
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,530
the future of human communications?

34
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:30,090
There is so much technological innovation that seems miraculous--

35
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:38,240
that seems as if only a magician could have created a way, for example, for

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,740
people to talk to each other through a very thin filament that goes for

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,000
thousands and thousands of miles.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,700
That you can talk into a microphone, and there's no wire, and people on the

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,360
other side of the world can hear you.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,820
Or if you Skype, somehow, magically, your friend or relative

41
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,950
appears on the screen.

42
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,830
Technology is very impressive that way, and in a certain sense, it

43
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:13,090
exceeds our understanding, our ability to grasp how this is done.

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,320
And a novel effect--

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,870
and especially a novel effect that has a pleasing or a beneficial outcome--

46
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,980
can seem magical.

47
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,170
So when does this magical thinking stop?

48
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,180
When do people start seeing technology realistically?

49
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,220
There comes a point where, without really understanding the science of

50
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,160
the technologies we use, we simply take them for granted.

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,500
If I get in my car and drive to work, there's an enormous amount about this

52
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,570
mechanism that I'm driving that I don't begin to understand.

53
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,010
I just take it for granted as a convenience.

54
00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:03,840
At first, it seems like a gift from above, but after a while, you

55
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,150
accommodate yourself to the fact that this is just another convenient that I

56
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,550
use in my life every day.

57
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,010
Why do you think the US has made it its agenda to ensure that censorship

58
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,690
is not an issue in other countries?

59
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,940
The United States of America is supposed to stand for free expression.

60
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,560
The word--

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,620
the concept--

62
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,870
freedom has a very profound resonance in the United States.

63
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:42,080
And politicians use the concept of freedom in a variety of ways to mean a

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,400
variety of things, some of which I don't think they understand.

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,950
But there is a sense that the United States is or is supposed to be a world

66
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,730
leader in certain respects.

67
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:02,690
And since freedom is a powerful, ideologically loaded, and positive

68
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,910
term in the American context, then exporting America means, among other

69
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:14,910
things, exporting an American idea about freedom that is taken for

70
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,840
granted by American policymakers and politicians to be a good thing.

71
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,760
If it's good for us, it'll be good for them.

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,200
That is a habit of thought that a lot of powerful countries have indulged

73
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:35,820
in, and sometimes to the detriment of the societies the United States or

74
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,700
other powerful countries have intervened in.

75
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,680
How does media content from foreign sources affect the autonomy of

76
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,880
developing countries?

77
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,920
One dimension of globalization is an imbalance of power between the

78
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,590
countries that produce a lot of culture, a lot of music, a lot of

79
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:03,290
television programming, a lot of films that do well around the world and

80
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,520
other countries--

81
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,580
sometimes smaller countries, sometimes not smaller countries--

82
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,430
that do not compete in the cultural--

83
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,310
specifically the popular cultural--

84
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,350
market with, for example, the United States.

85
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,380
So that there's an imbalance of power here in terms of what goes out of

86
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,730
certain countries and a lot of stuff that comes in to other countries that

87
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:35,950
don't produce culture in the same volume as the United States or India,

88
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,970
which produces almost 1,000 films a year.

89
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:46,010
For example, years ago, certain Israeli authorities got tired of all

90
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,880
of the English language music that was being played on the radio, because

91
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,020
that's what people wanted to hear.

92
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:58,470
And so they passed a law saying that 40% of all music played on the radio

93
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,650
was supposed to be in Hebrew.

94
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,790
And there were cultural conservatives in Israel who said, this

95
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,850
is the way to go.

96
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,900
There were more cosmopolitan people who said, you must be crazy.

97
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,550
Come on.

98
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,105
We're a part of the world.

99
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:15,550
It is more healthy for society to be open, to respond to what it is that

100
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,350
people really want to hear.

101
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,980
Now, the Israeli example is by no means the only example of countries

102
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,550
trying to regulate the inflow of cultural content.

103
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,650
Even larger and advanced countries, like France or Germany, for example,

104
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:39,710
can feel threatened by cultural exports, including the march of the

105
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,760
English language around the world and certainly across Europe.

106
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,480
So that in Germany, there is a certain amount of concern about too much

107
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,790
American vocabulary coming into the language.

108
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,700
There's a public debate about that.

109
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,570
In France, it has long been the case that the French government has

110
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,450
subsidized the French film industry.

111
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:09,440
And it is particularly important over the last 20, 30 years, because the

112
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,930
Hollywood films have been taking much more of the French cinema market than

113
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,660
they used to.

114
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:23,110
And so it becomes an urgent matter for the French film community, the

115
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,690
cultural community--

116
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,100
the political community, as well, that feels responsible for preserving

117
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,050
French culture.

118
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,500
The French are famous for worrying about this stuff.

119
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:40,070
The French are famous for setting up committees to try to limit the influx

120
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,140
of English vocabulary, for example, into the French language.

121
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,800
There's only so much success one can have with that sort of a policy.

122
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,510
Iceland has tried the same thing.

123
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,290
They're probably more successful, because they have a much smaller

124
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,850
language community to regulate.

125
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:09,200
But in general, a lot of cultural imports can stimulate anxieties about,

126
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,220
are we in charge of society in which we live?

127
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,990
Are we in charge of our own identity?

128
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,980
Are we in charge of who we are?

129
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,120
If we're only listening to Led Zeppelin and Bob Dylan, what is the

130
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:32,290
status of native music in country x, y, or z, which did not produce these

131
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,100
particular artists?

132
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,930
How does this topic of media and technology connect to the other

133
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,460
sections in the course?

134
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,520
It connects to a variety of other sections.

135
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,540
It certainly connects to popular culture, because the media are really

136
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,480
the platform that convey popular culture around the world.

137
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,430
There is a labor issue.

138
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:03,510
There is a global labor market issue in that the media include the capacity

139
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:10,290
to transmit lots of information and lots of conversations from one side of

140
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,790
the Earth to the other.

141
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:21,520
So that if one company in society x says, I cannot afford to pay people to

142
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,560
staff call centers in my country.

143
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,910
I'm going to send this work to India.

144
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,330
I'm going to do it off the satellite.

145
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:37,210
I have in India a reservoir of millions and millions of people who

146
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:43,060
know English very well, who are educated, and who can

147
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,350
take over this function.

148
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,280
So in a sense, you're outsourcing, in this particular case, relatively

149
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,690
low-skilled call center work to the other side of the world.

150
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,160
And you can do it because there is an electronic medium.

151
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,390
There is a transnational crime dimension to the media in that

152
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:11,720
cybercrime has become a very important type of crime in the world, and it is

153
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,540
increasing exponentially.

154
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:24,260
So that in that sense, the media are a tremendous gift to us in terms of the

155
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,790
opportunities to be connected.

156
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,510
The problem with the internet is that it can connect you to a lot of the

157
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,660
wrong people.

158
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:39,270
It can connect you to an unlimited number of clever criminals, people who

159
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,900
want to play dirty tricks of one sort or another.

160
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,850
So there's an underbelly to the global media in that sense, just as there are

161
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,120
tremendous benefits made available by the media.

162
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,160
Thank you for talking to us about media and technology, Dr. Hoberman.

163
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,410
Thank you.

164
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:58,970
