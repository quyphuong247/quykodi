00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200


1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,770
We have just seen that any comprehensive account of the global

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,290
shipping system must show how it is tied to other dimensions of

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,150
globalization, such as its impact on the natural environment, or whether

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,780
global governance can regulate its operations for the purpose of reducing

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,575
the harmful consequences of Maritime trade.

6
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:24,080


7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,100
The global labor market, which can be thought of as another world system, is

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,070
represented in the global shipping industry by two groups of workers.

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,220
First, there are the more than 1.2 million seafarers who operate the

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,870
world's shipping fleet.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,520
The International Labor Organization, or ILO, has pointed out that many

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,260
seafarers ply waters distant from their homes.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,280
Seafarers and ship owners are often of different nationalities, and ships

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,290
often operate under a flag different from their origin or ownership.

15
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:05,480
Seafarers are also frequently exposed to difficult working conditions and

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,470
particular occupational risks.

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,320
Working far from home, they are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse,

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,620
nonpayment of wages, noncompliance with contracts, exposure to poor diet

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,970
and living conditions, and even abandonment in foreign ports.

20
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,610
A Maritime labor convention addressing working conditions in the increasingly

21
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,610
globalized Maritime industry was adopted in 2006.

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,390
As of 2011, the ILO and the International Maritime Organization,

23
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,120
or IMO, had established working groups to study the problems seafarers

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,850
frequently face, such as personal injury claims, medical examinations,

25
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,350
and being stranded in remote parts of the world.

26
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,730
Here we must ask whether the promulgation of these internationally

27
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,890
recognized working standards is likely to be any more successful than the

28
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,595
IMO's regulation of Maritime pollution of the oceans and atmosphere.

29
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:10,320


30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,460
A second vulnerable population of workers who participate in the global

31
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,880
shipping industry are the ship breakers who dismantle decommissioned

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,500
vessels on the beaches of India, Bangladesh,

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,740
Pakistan, China, and Turkey.

34
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,160
The steel and other components of the disassembled ships

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,480
are sold for recycling.

36
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,310
There are an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 ship breakers at work on the

37
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,050
breaking beaches of Bangladesh alone, and another 100,000 people there are

38
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,680
indirectly involved in the business.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,000
Ship breaking is very dangerous work that exposes these desperately poor

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,610
laborers to many toxic substances, including asbestos.

41
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,260
Many fall from great heights or are crushed, or burned, or poisoned in the

42
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,570
course of doing this work.

43
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,820
In 2011, almost 200 ship breakers were killed or injured on the job in

44
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,960
Pakistan alone.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,240
In 2012, the German news magazine der Spiegel described these impoverished

46
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,970
laborers as the victims of slave-like working conditions.

47
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,005
The decline in global shipping that followed the financial crisis of 2007

48
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:29,870
and 2008 has forced ship owners to send more ships than ever onto the

49
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,530
breaking beaches.

50
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,330
More than 1,000 ships were scrapped in 2012, and business is booming.

51
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,700
The owners of the scrapping yards pay millions of dollars for a ship, while

52
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,965
they pay their work forces almost nothing.

53
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:47,510


54
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,800
Environmental management requiring compliance with the norms developed by

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,400
the International Organization for Standardization is impossible.

56
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,190
Similarly, the Basel Convention designed to control trans-boundary

57
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,350
movements of hazardous waste and its disposal is useless, because it is

58
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,320
unenforceable.

59
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,820
When the decision to scrap a ship is made at sea, beyond national

60
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,829
territorial waters, the Basel Convention has no jurisdiction,

61
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:21,709
meaning the most ships begin the journey to their final resting place

62
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,330
from the middle of the ocean.

63
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,080
The Hong Kong Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of

64
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,500
Ships, adopted in 2009, was supposed to solve this problem.

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,180
But as of February 2013, no country had ratified it.

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,060


67
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,630
Once again, we see how ineffective the formal adoption of voluminous rules

68
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,490
and regulations by international bodies can be.

69
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,050
These scenarios are a sobering reminder of how difficult, and

70
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,240
sometimes impossible it can be to enforce the global regulation of

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,020
business practices that are hazardous to workers, but

72
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,760
profitable to their employers.

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,230
In the hard and dirty world of ship breaking, this conflict of interest is

74
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,150
seldom resolved in favor of worker safety, no matter how many well

75
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,660
intended rules and regulations are ratified by UN sponsored international

76
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,910
organizations.

77
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,498
