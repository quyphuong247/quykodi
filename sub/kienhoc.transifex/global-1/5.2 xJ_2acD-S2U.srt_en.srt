00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280


1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,500
It would be a mistake to assume that the erosion of state power vis-a-vis

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,660
the multinationals means that the nation state is simply helpless in the

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,840
face of corporate power.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,920
As Greider noted in 2001, nation states, at least the largest and

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,730
strongest ones, have not lost any of their powers to tax and regulate

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,240
capital in commerce, to control international capital flows, and other

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,360
globalizing practices

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,270
In the face of market pressures, major nations simply retreated from exerting

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,710
those powers.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,100
And the United States as principal promoter and defender, led the way.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,230
Corrective action from Greider's perspective would be for nations to

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,290
begin to employ their neglected sovereign powers.

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,220
That is, to intrude purposefully into the marketplace and impose some rules

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,470
on behalf of society.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,690


16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,090
While Greider's blunt dichotomy between the interests of the

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,210
multinationals and the interests of society may seem oversimplified and

18
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,800
polemical to some, this course presents evidence that his analysis is

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,640
supported by substantial evidence.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,770
What is more, it is precisely the sort of candor that for many years has been

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,230
missing from public discussion of multinational's behavior, vis-a-vis

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,870
the societies they operate in around the world.

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,560
The logic of globalization, Greider says, has led in fact to a

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,970
redefinition of national interest, at least for the United States, in which

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,090
government policy assumes that advancing the well being of

26
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,690
shareholders in global firms as opposed to the general population,

27
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,235
workers, and communities, provides the highest overall benefit.

28
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:55,520


29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,600
By now it is clear that the study of globalization requires an examination

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,850
of the balance of power between nations and corporations.

31
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,430
But this relationship is more than just a balance of power.

32
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,460
There is also a balance of obligations, in that the varied

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,930
capitalisms of the Western democracies have been based on the premise that

34
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,400
nations and corporations need each other to build a good society.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
The origins of this idea can be traced back to the invention of the modern

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,230
corporation in Victorian England.

37
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,600
The mid-19th century English politician, Robert Lowe, the father of

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,760
the corporation and the inventor of the modern concept of limited

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,430
liability, described the new limited liability companies of his era in 1856

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,400
as "little republics," meaning that they were seen as democratic

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,290
institutions and were invested with, as he put it, "certain powers deemed

42
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,830
necessary to the successful prosecution of some design of general

43
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,150
utility and public benefit."

44
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,100
One historian has argued that these companies blurred the boundaries

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,170
between politics and the market, because each one

46
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,030
functioned as a mini democracy.

47
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,210
What is more, having developed outside the purview of the state, they changed

48
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:23,650
the modern world by ushering in the age of capitalism as we know it.

49
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,540
Invested with the respectability of internal democratic governance, these

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,150
"little republics" presented themselves as a legitimate alternative

51
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,340
to the authority of the Democratic state.

52
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,450
And the more wealth they created, the more prestigious they became in the

53
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,750
eyes of the citizenry.

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,280
Discussions of globalization over the past two decades have devoted much

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,100
more attention to multinational corporations than to the

56
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,950
characteristics of nation states.

57
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,800
The great multinationals after all, have had the advantage of acquiring

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,630
relatively recently the enormous power that has made them

59
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,030
rivals of nation states.

60
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,240
This makes it all the more necessary for us to understand how citizens

61
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,275
actually feel about national identity in an age of globalization.

62
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:17,240


63
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,630
The widespread belief that globalization is an unstoppable force

64
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,030
has caused observers to exaggerate its denationalizing effects on our

65
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,070
feelings about national identity.

66
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,500
One alternative to traditional nationality, the cosmopolitan ideal of

67
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,050
world citizenship, has been around for hundreds of years.

68
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,690
But it is not even close to replacing national feeling as a way of belonging

69
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,250
in the world.

70
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,220
It is true that the globalization process has in some ways undermined

71
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,370
state sovereignty by transforming the global market and by making national

72
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,780
borders increasingly ineffectual definers of national identity.

73
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,700
But less state sovereignty and more permeable borders do not necessarily

74
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,720
cause citizens to feel less emotional attachment to their nation states.

75
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,220
If anything, it seems more likely that the sense of an imperiled nation state

76
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,860
would intensify people's attachments to the places they have called home.

77
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,490
The persistence of national feeling in the European Union to take one

78
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,730
example, has been confirmed over and over again.

79
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,720
For example, the current crisis in the Euro Zone has dealt a severe blow to

80
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,420
the prospects for a European identity that might have replaced feeling like

81
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,160
a Belgian, or an Italian, or a Dane.

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,680
To be sure, the European crisis of recent years is not the ideal time to

83
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,320
be assessing citizen's feelings about feeling European.

84
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,970
But Europeans' willingness to exchange their national identities for a

85
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,830
European identity had never been much in evidence.

86
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,470
A Euro barometer survey released in May 2008 showed that nine out of 10 of

87
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,950
those interviewed identified with their native countries, while only

88
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,516
half felt a similar attachment to the EU.

89
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:21,260
And there is no consistent trend, since feelings of European identity

90
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,110
vary widely across the European Union.

91
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,490
Declining voter turnout in European Parliament elections is yet more

92
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,730
evidence that the great majority of European citizens remain emotionally

93
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,225
anchored in their home countries.

94
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:40,150


95
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,870
Acknowledging evidence of the persistence of national feelings helps

96
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,090
us to understand globalization, because we will be far less tempted to

97
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,040
conceptualize it as an all-powerful historical force.

98
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,130
Emphasizing the power of tradition and our emotional ties to native ground

99
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,680
may not be intellectually fashionable among globalisation theorists.

100
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,360
But acknowledging what is real and what is not is the only responsible

101
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,020
method for studying social phenomenon.

102
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,970
This allows us to think more clearly about the likely effects of

103
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,550
globalization.

104
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,520
It is also useful to keep in mind that nation states afford their citizens

105
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,010
essential benefits that no other social institutions, including

106
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,440
multinationals, can provide.

107
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,660
It is the agencies of nation states, not corporations, that are charged

108
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,080
with protecting their citizens from crime, discrimination, the abridgment

109
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,430
of basic rights, unemployment, and impure food and drugs, among other

110
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,180
hazards to safety and well being.

111
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,520
The moral of this story is that the study of globalization requires us to

112
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,070
resist the idea that all of human experience is best interpreted from a

113
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,200
global perspective that does not include the real and often

114
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,470
tradition-based world we inhabit.

115
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,458
