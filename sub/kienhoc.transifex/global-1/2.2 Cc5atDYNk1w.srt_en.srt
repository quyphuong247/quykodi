00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850


1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,540
The second phase of globalization covers the period of intensive

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,060
internationalization of transportation systems, communications, commerce,

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,130
science, and many other human activities that unfolded between the

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,660
middle of the 19th century and the collapse of second phase globalization

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,210
that resulted from the outbreak of war in August of 1914.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,430
During the second half of the 19th century, the Western world experienced

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,730
a dramatic intensification of international connectivity due to four

8
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,590
advancing technologies--

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,350
trains, steamships, the telegraph, and the postal system.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,930
These developments transformed people's expectations of what was

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,320
possible in much the same way that today electronic communications have

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,960
shaped our own expectations of what the 21st century has to offer us.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,540


14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,600
As early as the 1830s, the arrival of a letter from far away could inspire a

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
sense of wonder in the recipient.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,630
By the 1860s, transatlantic telegraphy provoked utopian and sometimes

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,920
hysterical expressions of joy in the expectation that instant

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,100
communications would put an end to the scourge of war.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,420
The period 1880 to 1914 saw a level of global economic integration that

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,055
matched or even exceeded that of the global economy today.

21
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,620


22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,960
The investment capital that flowed around the world, much of it

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,760
originating in London, contributed to the economic development of the former

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,730
colonies of the global British Empire--

25
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,340
the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

26
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,430
Small and remote British possessions around the world, such as the Cayman

27
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,130
Islands, the Bahamas, and Hong Kong, would eventually turn into so-called

28
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,240
offshore tax havens, serving a global economic elite.

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,090
Many of these subordinate microstates remain under British

30
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,840
control to this day.

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,600
Other European colonial empires established their own international

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,630
trade routes with their colonies in Africa, whose liberations would not

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,090
come until the last decades of the 20th century.

34
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,720
In fact, the oppression and exploitation of colonized populations

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,670
has always been an integral part of the global system.

36
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,755
Raw materials and more exotic goods flowed from the colonies across the

37
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:33,620
seas to Europe.

38
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,380
At the turn of the 20th century, an affluent inhabitant of London had

39
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,570
access to many products of foreign origin years before the fateful events

40
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,830
of August 1914 profoundly disrupted this world of unprecedented global

41
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,720
connectivity.

42
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,710
The second half of the 19th century also saw an extraordinary

43
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,290
proliferation of transnational organizations, many of which aimed at

44
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,710
improving the world in one way or another by promulgating humanitarian

45
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,505
ideals or a belief in the value of knowledge to human affairs.

46
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:13,430


47
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,010
We may call these organizations and their global campaigns or movements

48
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,450
the idealistic internationalisms.

49
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,060
The Swiss businessman and social activist Henri Dunant founded the Red

50
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,440
Cross in 1863.

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,410
The Salvation Army, a Christian international charitable organization,

52
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,190
was established in 1865.

53
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,940
And the world's only surviving language movement of this era,

54
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,000
Esperanto, appeared in 1887.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,700
Surrounded by Poland's language barriers and ethnic conflicts, Ludwig

56
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,840
Zamenhof invented the artificial language known as Esperanto in the

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,640
hope of making peace among the warring factions.

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,920
The French nobleman Pierre de Coubertin, an admirer of the British

59
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,660
sport system, founded the International Olympic Committee in

60
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,420
1894 with the goal of establishing better international relations among

61
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,570
the competing nations.

62
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,709
The Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel began awarding the Nobel Prizes in

63
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,960
1901 to scientists from any country.

64
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,720
The professed internationalist and openly racist Lord Baden-Powell

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,600
established the Scouting Movement in 1908.

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,260
It is worth noting that all of these second phase international

67
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,020
organizations, with the partial exception of Esperanto, have enjoyed

68
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,050
enormously successful global careers over the past century or more.

69
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,340
They were and they remain today exemplars of second phase

70
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,040
globalization.

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,920
Having demonstrated their usefulness, or at least their widespread appeal to

72
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,380
the global community, these global organizations testify to the enduring

73
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,510
stature of venerable movements that have always claimed to represent the

74
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,770
highest aspirations of mankind.

75
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,610
Perhaps some of these humanitarian activists realized at the time that

76
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,110
without the practical internationalism of the Universal Postal Union,

77
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,030
established in 1874, as well as the services of the transatlantic

78
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,090
steamship companies, their idealistic projects would have

79
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,810
faced insuperable obstacles.

80
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,415
