00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,570


1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,600
Section 7 is about global regulation of tobacco, of doping,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,080
whaling, and fisheries.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,150
What role do non-governmental organizations have in the context of

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,490
globalization?

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,680
Non-governmental organizations take on environmental tasks, humanitarian

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,705
tasks, medical tasks, social justice tasks that are not performed or are

7
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:30,940
not performed adequately in their view by nation states, by multinational

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,200
corporations, or by established international organizations.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,300
In other words, there is a lot of space left over for good works for

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,740
improving the human condition, for improving the environment, for

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,010
promoting the survival of animal species that is simply not done by

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,640
big, established, powerful organizations, which leaves a great

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,780
deal of room for many, many non-governmental organizations, or

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,110
NGOs, to step in and do necessary work.

15
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,950
How big are these organizations?

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,570
The staffs of these organizations tend to be small.

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,230
I noticed that Human Rights Watch, for example, says they have about 280

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,430
staff people.

19
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:26,430
But what really counts is global support, and so that Greenpeace will

20
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,500
announce that it has something like three million supporters around the

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,760
world, Amnesty International has also reported that they have about three

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,220
million members around the world.

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,140
The important ones really do have global reach.

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,940
Does the tobacco industry exemplify a contest for power between the

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,530
multinational corporation and the nation state?

26
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,670
Very much so.

27
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,670
The legal regime in a lot of countries right now is such that it is possible,

28
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:04,670
for example, by using investment law for a tobacco multinational to bring

29
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,990
suit against a sovereign state, a country, for trying to limit

30
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,910
disease-producing tobacco consumption among its own population.

31
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,120
That seems incredible, but it's true.

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:27,420
The tobacco multinationals have legal standing of that kind in any number of

33
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,840
legal systems around the world.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,430
Such is the relationship between the big tobacco multinationals and

35
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:45,100
sovereign countries that there is, in fact, a legal contest between these

36
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,300
two competing interests.

37
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:54,500
Now, in recent years, the tide has shifted in favor of countries which

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,290
have successfully attempted to cut down the number of smokers in their

39
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,320
own populations.

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,920
Will the tobacco companies ever be adequately regulated?

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,550
That depends on what one, from a public health standpoint, calls

42
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,450
adequate regulation.

43
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:17,420
Adequate regulation of a death industry, from my perspective, would

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,320
be shutting down the industry.

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,570
At this time, that is not legally possible.

46
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,390
If adequate regulation means halving the number of people in your

47
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,180
population who smoke, and that, roughly speaking, is what has happened

48
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,550
in the United States over the past 25 years or so, then that is quote

49
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,130
unquote, "adequate regulation".

50
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,790
That still leaves a tremendous amount of tobacco-related disease in the

51
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,180
American population.

52
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,600
So if adequate regulation is a significant drop in the morbidity and

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,460
mortality that is caused by tobacco consumption, then leaving the industry

54
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,990
active to one degree or another will be adequate from that point of view.

55
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,660
Ultimately, from a public health standpoint, the adequate regulation of

56
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,960
the tobacco industry is the abolition of the tobacco industry.

57
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,290
What makes the preservation of the whale species a global issue?

58
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:29,130
For the last 40 or so years, there has been a global environmental movement.

59
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:38,550
There is a sense that the biosphere that the human race and all living

60
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:46,190
things inhabit has an integrity and an enormous importance, of course, to the

61
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,620
survival of life on planet Earth.

62
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:56,280
This is taken seriously as a kind of ideal, that human beings are the

63
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,230
custodians of the natural order.

64
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:05,790
There is a religious rationale, at least in some religions, to preserve

65
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,800
the work of the creator, so-called.

66
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,340
There are non-religious reasons also to take very seriously the

67
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:22,550
preservation of the diverse life forms that exist on earth.

68
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,440
There is a survival motive, in the sense that when you intervene in the

69
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,070
ecological mechanism of the Earth as a whole, in a food chain, whether it is

70
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:43,820
by man made activity or whether it use the product of natural forces, there's

71
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,200
uncertainty about what the ultimate effect of that

72
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,370
intervention is going to be.

73
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:56,720
So there is a survival dimension to idealizing the entire planetary

74
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,930
biosphere as a system that really needs taking care of.

75
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:15,480
There is a more sort of idealistic motive in that a whale, for example,

76
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,980
is considered to be an intelligent creature.

77
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,200
Dolphins are considered to be intelligent.

78
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,460
Lots of animals have various kinds of intelligence.

79
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:32,930
And so the human race has to deal with the whole issue of how much respect is

80
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,730
properly accorded other creatures on earth.

81
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:44,640
So how one feels about the integrity of nature is taken very seriously.

82
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,940
And so preserving the whales is part of that.

83
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:59,110
And now if you feel like the vigilante whale protector, Paul Watson, that

84
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,480
whales are smarter than people, then you're even more

85
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,040
motivated to save the whales.

86
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,820
I don't think that view is shared by too many people, but that is part of

87
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,100
his radical environmental ideology that prompts him to go to the southern

88
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,140
oceans when the Japanese whaling fleet is there and to ram them, and to

89
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,520
interfere with their whale killing.

90
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,110
Is doping a medical, legal, or a moral issue?

91
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,470
It's all three.

92
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,330
It is a legal issue in the sense that there are several countries that have

93
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,690
actually passed laws against sports doping.

94
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:41,860
It is a medical issue because there is, and especially when you have

95
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,610
athletes and others, there are plenty of recreational athletes who use

96
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,250
hormones outside medical guidelines.

97
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,440
There's an army around the world of bodybuilders, possibly in the millions

98
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,150
who are using anabolic steroids and other drugs outside medical

99
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,090
guidelines.

100
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,130
Is it a moral, ethical issue?

101
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:11,530
Yes, if you see organized sport as a kind of human activity that is based

102
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,410
upon a social contract.

103
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,620
And this is a social contract that traditionally says, I'm

104
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,750
not going to cheat.

105
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,085
I'm going to obey the rules.

106
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:26,510
It is against the rules to ingest any of these hundreds and hundreds of

107
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:32,429
substances that are on the world agency's list, then that means that a

108
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,360
social contract is being violated by the person who takes the drug for the

109
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,850
purpose of enhancing his or her performance, and this is a big, big

110
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:48,730
cultural crisis in the world of high-performance sport at this time.

111
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,900
Doping controversies have occurred in various sports-- cycling,

112
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,720
weightlifting, baseball, and others--

113
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,920
but we haven't seen a large controversy in world football.

114
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,440
Why is that?

115
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,100
That's a very good question.

116
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,510
It is known, for example, that there was a great deal of doping of the very

117
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,790
successful Juventus Italian football team during the

118
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,990
second half of the 1990s.

119
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:23,730
So that the idea that world football is somehow doping

120
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,630
drug-free is not accurate.

121
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:36,180
The public's sense of whether a sport is doping-infested or not has a lot to

122
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:42,690
do with the public relations abilities of the head of the league, the

123
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,500
National Football League in the United States for example, which has been

124
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:56,430
very effective in suggesting to the world that they have their testing

125
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,190
program, that it works, and you hear very little doping news out of the

126
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,000
National Football League.

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,610
That is very curious, because if there is any type of athlete who would

128
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,890
benefit from anabolic steroid use, it would be these people who need to be

129
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,030
big fast and recover quickly from injuries.

130
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,450
So that my sense of it, as somebody who's followed this for a long time,

131
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,170
is the National Football League has been clever in the way it handled

132
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,400
public relations regarding whatever kind of doping is going on in that

133
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,620
league, and I think it is severely underestimated.

134
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:41,500
In world soccer, you have a similar situation in that the international

135
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:51,450
federation that runs world soccer, namely FIFA, is an international

136
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:58,140
federation that has famously and for years been involved in accusations and

137
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,530
confirmations of financial corruption.

138
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:09,340
When it comes to drug testing, FIFA points out that over the last four

139
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:15,960
World Cups, there has not been a single doping positive.

140
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,600
Thousands of athletes over the last four World Cup, and these are people

141
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,550
operating at the highest level, on some of these teams.

142
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,220
The best athletes in the world.

143
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,530
Not a single doping positive.

144
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,930
Well, I'm sorry.

145
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,700
I follow this issue.

146
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,260
That is not a credible result.

147
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:37,440
That is not a credible representation of the possible or probable use of

148
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,280
doping drugs by these people.

149
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,350
It's Alice in Wonderland, it is simply too good to be true.

150
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,350
Interestingly, they get away with it.

151
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,400
And that's where the public relations comes in.

152
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,690
All they have to do is say, look, we have a medical commission, we have an

153
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:58,280
extensive testing system, and the good news is that for the last four World

154
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Cups in a row they haven't found a single doping positive.

155
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:11,150
It's not just a question of testing, it's a question of what is the

156
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:17,270
integrity of the operation that is doing the testing, because there's

157
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:23,570
plenty of testing that can be corrupted in one way or another.

158
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,630
How does this section, section seven, connect to other topics in the course?

159
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,150
Well, we've just heard that it connects to sports.

160
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,070
There is a great deal of regulating that needs to be done in the global

161
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,257
sports world.

162
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:40,300
The attempt to regulate the consumption of doping

163
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,560
drugs is one example.

164
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,160
The attempt to limit the really negative fallout of match fixing that

165
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,840
would be organized for criminal gambling organizations, which is

166
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,920
apparently becoming worse and worse, the integrity of the

167
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,600
game has to be defended.

168
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,480
There are reports from all over of players being paid off.

169
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:13,640
Recently, the Belize football team claimed that they had refused bribes

170
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,860
to behave in this way or that way in a match against the United States

171
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,810
football team.

172
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:26,770
So sports is definitely a big topic here, as well as transnational crime.

173
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:32,880
Transnational crime needs to be regulated as best it can be, and both

174
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,730
of these are just enormous, enormous tasks to be carried

175
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,790
out on a global scale.

176
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:50,260
In the area of popular culture, there are societies, especially conservative

177
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:57,240
religious Jews societies, with that sort of value system that are going to

178
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:05,000
want to the in flow of various forms of televised content, entertainment,

179
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,340
regulated, because it is absolutely inappropriate in the eyes of certain

180
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,450
people in certain countries, or very large numbers of people in certain

181
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:22,880
countries that you broadcast nudity, that you broadcast even more modest

182
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,250
erotic content.

183
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:33,630
We've seen a number of cases where the regulation of cultural content has

184
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,530
become a very hot issue.

185
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,780
Global transportation systems also need regulation.

186
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,740
The planes have got to follow certain routes, they have got to follow

187
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,510
certain safety procedures.

188
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,840
The pilots have got to be able to speak adequate English so they can

189
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,480
talk to the control towers.

190
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,850
There's a lot of regulating to do in this global world of ours.

191
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,570
Thank you for talking to us about global regulation Dr. Hoberman.

192
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,820
Thank you.

193
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,370
