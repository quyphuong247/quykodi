00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520


1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,570
The International Olympic Committee, or IOC, and its major affiliates such

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,900
as FIFA can be understood as an offshore enterprise zone for make

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,820
believe diplomats, ambitious opportunists, and a number of

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,990
criminals whose corrupt behaviors and escapades have received less media

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,460
attention than they deserve.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,940
Let us begin with some of the personalities that have been recruited

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,400
by the IOC over the last few decades.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,050
Juan Antonio Samaranch, the unrepentant Spanish fascist who

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,750
occupied the IOC presidency from 1980 to 2001, brought with him from

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,620
Francoist Spain an authoritarian style that facilitated the bribery of many

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,740
IOC members, damaged the prospects for moving against doping, and produced a

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,280
generation of compliant formally elected appointees who were eventually

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,150
instructed to address the IOC President as excellency

14
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,910
In 1985, Samaranch conferred Olympic orders on the East German dictator

15
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,570
Erich Honecker and the architect of the East German doping

16
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,930
system Manfred Ewald.

17
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,210
By my count during his term of office, Samaranch presided over the induction

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,920
of 83 members and honorary members of the IOC.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,810
A striking number of those elected turned out to be criminals or frauds

20
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,200
or simply ethically dubious people whose presence among the Olympic elite

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,700
should raise serious questions about the values the

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,215
IOC claims to represent.

23
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:43,440


24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,920
Major General Francis Nyangweso, IOC 1988, served the murderous dictator

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,370
Idi Amin throughout the eight years of Amin's regime from 1971 to 1979 as

26
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,380
army commander, minister of culture, and ambassador.

27
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,440
In early 1973, Nyangweso went on the radio to warn the people of the Bugisu

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,800
district that any village found to be sheltering guerillas would be

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,130
destroyed completely.

30
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,740
The barbarities of Amin's rule included a body count estimated at

31
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,300
300,000 victims.

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,920
IOC President Sumaranch brought Nyangweso into the IOC in 1988.

33
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,290
Franco Carraro, IOC 1982 an Italian politician and football executive, was

34
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,470
forced out of the Italian Football Association as a consequence of his

35
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,590
involvement in the Calciopoli scandal that involved the rigging of

36
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,420
professional football games.

37
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,750
Yet he remains an IOC member.

38
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,760
In 2005, Carraro was denying that Juventus football players were still

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,200
doping following the revelations about their doping regimen during the team's

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,670
fantastically successful run during the period 1994 to 1998.

41
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:09,960
Paul Schmidt, IOC 1982, elected in 2010 as president of Hungary, was

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,820
forced to resign from office in April 2012 as a result of a plagiarism

43
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,670
scandal around his doctoral thesis.

44
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,810
The moral of this story is that while he's too crooked to be a Hungarian

45
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,750
politician, he's still a member of the IOC.

46
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,260
The former South Korean CIA operative and taekwondo entrepreneur Kim

47
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:36,470
Mi-Young, IOC 1986, wound up serving prison time in Seoul for corruption in

48
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,310
his native country.

49
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,660
Ivan Slavkov of Bulgaria, IOC 1987, was caught by journalists soliciting a

50
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,020
bribe in 2004.

51
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,530
In 2005, the ICO ethics committee ruled that his willingness to be

52
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,190
bribed and to solicit bribes for London's 2012 Olympic bid was contrary

53
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,700
to the ethical principles derived from the Olympic charter and the IOC code

54
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,080
of conduct, and it was of an extremely serious nature.

55
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,800
He was expelled from the IOC.

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,390


57
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:19,779
The Indonesian timber magnate Muhammad Bob Hasan, IOC 1994, a longtime crony

58
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:24,290
of the disgraced former Indonesian president Suharto, was convicted in

59
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,730
1998 of defrauding the Indonesian state of $75 million and sentenced to

60
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,840
a six year prison term.

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,940
The South Korean businessman Kuan-Hui Lee, IRC 1996, the chairman of Samsung

62
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,170
Electronics was convicted of bribery and tax evasion in 2008.

63
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,360
The Seoul Central District court imposed a fine of $109 million and a

64
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,100
suspended jail sentence of three years.

65
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,660
In December, 2009, the South Korean government pardoned Lee in order to

66
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,380
promote its bid for the 2018 winter Olympic games.

67
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,330
In February 2011, he was reinstated as a member of the IOC despite the fact

68
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,740
that he had violated ethical principles and tarnished the

69
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,320
reputation of the Olympic movement according to an IOC spokesman.

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,700
Guy Drut, IOC 1996, a French Olympic hurdling champion and former French

71
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,790
sports minister, was handed a 15 month suspended sentence in 2005 by a French

72
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:36,270
court on account of his involvement in a kickback scandal at Paris City Hall.

73
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,680
Pardoned by President Jacques Chriac, he remains in the IOC.

74
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,040
Primo Nebiolo, who was inducted into the IOC in 1994, served as president

75
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,570
of the international Track and Field Federation for almost two decades.

76
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,460
In 1987, he presided over the World Track and Field Championships in Rome.

77
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,200
The 1987 championships are remembered in part because Nebiolo was implicated

78
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,100
in a long jump cheating scandal that was staged to win a medal

79
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,370
for a fellow Italian.

80
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,140
Mario Pescante, IOC 1994, was president of the

81
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,830
Italian Olympic Committee.

82
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,740
He lost this position in 1998 on account of the corruption scandal that

83
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,050
closed the Olympic doping laboratory near Rome.

84
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,090
Pescante retained his position on the IOC and was made Minister of Sport by

85
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:36,790
Silvio Berlusconi after his election as Prime Minister in 2001.

86
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:44,280
Joseph Sepp Blatter, IOC 1999, has since 1998 been the president of the

87
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,290
International Football Federation, or FIFA, which in recent years has become

88
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,200
notorious around the world as a financially corrupt organization.

89
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,810
That FIFA president Blatter remains in office and in the IOC after the

90
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,530
revelations of corruption within FIFA in 2011 is a testimony to the sheer

91
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,390
power of the International Federation autocrats.

92
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,050
There is no one on earth with the statutory authority to

93
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,100
remove a Sepp Blatter.

94
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,790
No matter how ethically compromised he may be, only a majority vote of FIFA's

95
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,540
209 national associations can remove him.

96
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,070
And Blatter's various payoffs to national officials have ensured that

97
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,290
this will not happen.

98
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:39,320
Gunter Heinze, IOC 1981, a former general secretary of the East German

99
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,000
National Olympic committee, was an unapologetic facilitator of doping in

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,790
the former East Germany and who served on the IAAF medical commission.

101
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:54,830
Heinze remained an honorary member of the IOC until his death in 2010.

102
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:01,610
Manuela Di Centa, ICO 1998, is an Italian former cross country skier who

103
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:08,040
won seven Olympic medals, including two gold, at the 1994 and 1998 winter

104
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,430
Olympic games.

105
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,690
In October 2012, Di Centa announced that she would be suing the Italian

106
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:20,000
anti-doping activist and researcher Alessandro Donati in response to his

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,930
claim that she used the blood boosting drug EPO during her athletic career.

108
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:32,299
Her problem is that in 1999 the Italian magazine GQ reported that her

109
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,539
name had been found on the hard disk police had confiscated from the

110
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,510
medical office computer of the doping doctor Francesco Corcione.

111
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,470
According to the report, Di Centa was one of about 1,000 Italian and non

112
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,025
Italian endurance athletes who had been treated with EPO.

113
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:53,590


114
00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:00,390
To this list, we can add Joao Havelange, IOC 1963, the all powerful

115
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:07,690
FIFA president from 1974 to 1998 who resigned from the IOC in disgrace in

116
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,430
2011 following the disclosure of court documents that showed he had accepted

117
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,590
millions of dollars in bribes from the bankrupted marketing company ISL

118
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,350
during the 1990s.

119
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,780
By now it should be clear that IOC membership offers no guarantees

120
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,120
regarding the integrity of the people who are inducted into

121
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,040
this exclusive group.

122
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,970
At the same time, the sheer inspirational force of the opening and

123
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,990
closing ceremonies at the Olympic games has led millions around the

124
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,210
world to assume otherwise.

125
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:49,550
How, after all, could the custodians of the world's most popular secular

126
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,640
religion be anything other than honorable

127
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,580
international public servants?

128
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,090
For students of globalization, this story offers an important lesson.

129
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:07,360
Namely that there are different kinds of international isms and different

130
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,820
kinds of internationalists.

131
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,540
The internationalism of the humanitarian NGOs and the competent

132
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,600
agencies of the United Nations is an entirely different species than the

133
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,610
pseudo humanitarianism of the international sports organizations.

134
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,230
The political genius of the Olympic movement has been to promote the idea

135
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,390
that it is a peace movement.

136
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,400
This public relations strategy has coexisted easily with the

137
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,900
authoritarianism, the patriarchal management style, the tolerance of

138
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,750
corruption, and the socializing with dictators.

139
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,390
The sports autocrats are impresarios not statesmen.

140
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,440
And what they offer the world is show business internationalism.

141
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,268
