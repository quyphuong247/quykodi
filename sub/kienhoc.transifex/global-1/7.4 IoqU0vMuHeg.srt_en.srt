1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:06,060
At the beginning of this section, I said that global regulation is both a

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,790
fascinating topic of virtually unlimited scope and a tremendous

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,950
challenge for any international organization that is charged with

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,830
formulating, monitoring, and enforcing a uniform set of

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,350
standards around the world.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,150
Elsewhere in this course, we will explore the complex

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,310
world of global sport.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,369
We will focus primarily on sport at the elite level, which means the

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,840
global sports entertainment industry that includes the Olympic movement,

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,120
national and international sports federations, and transnational

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,710
professional sports leagues such as the UEFA Champions League, which

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,200
features teams from over 50 countries.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,720
This multi-dimensional system can be thought of as a complicated organism.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,990
This organism provides a huge global audience with what may well be the

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,400
most popular form of entertainment on Earth.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,870
That is why it's annual global economic activity has been estimated

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,400
at several hundred billions of dollars.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,280
This global system must regulate many matters including those having to do

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,000
with athlete's eligibility, the buying and selling of teams, and the staging

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,615
of international sports festivals.

21
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:29,180


22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,040
The sports world must also regulate various kinds of undesirable or

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,730
criminal behavior.

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,290
In May of 2013, UEFA president, Michel Platini, renewed his call for the

25
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,620
formation of a European sports police force to respond to widespread

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,250
problems that include sports betting, corruption and match fixing, sometimes

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,520
involving mafia type organizations and hooliganism in stadiums that can

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,400
include racist taunts directed at black football players.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,790
There is a global consensus that these behaviors impose on acceptable costs

30
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,490
on society.

31
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,180
The potential of sport to be a social resource has often been accorded

32
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,110
recognition by the United Nations.

33
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,800
For example, the 2005 International Convention Against Doping in Sport was

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,980
sponsored by UNESCO.

35
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,670
For the first time, governments around the world endorsed the use of

36
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,610
international law to combat sports doping.

37
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,240
In a legal sense, this was significant because the World Anti-Doping Agency,

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,140
or WADA, is a non-governmental organization.

39
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,170
And it's a world anti-doping code is a non-governmental document.

40
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,280
Neither WADA nor the National Anti-Doping Agencies possess the

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,370
police powers that governments do.

42
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,650
As we shall see, this situation has motivated WADA to pursue relationships

43
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,440
with governmental police agencies that have the power to make searches and

44
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,050
arrests and to confiscate the drugs they are able to take from organized

45
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,300
drug traffickers.

46
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,600


47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,340
In May of 2013, UNESCO and the government of Germany hosted 100

48
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,800
governments at the fifth World Conference of Sports Ministers.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,200
The purpose of this conference was to convince governments that the problems

50
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,370
of world sport constitute nothing less than a global crisis since sports

51
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,565
fraud is now a branch of organized crime that operates on a global scale.

52
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:44,850


53
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,950
To conclude this section on global regulation, we will examine the issue

54
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:55,140
that over the past 25 years has become both the most damaging and the most

55
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,130
publicized crisis afflicting global sport.

56
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,810
This crisis is the epidemic use of performance enhancing doping drugs by

57
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,570
a very large number of lead athletes around the world.

58
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,420
Sports officials attempts to regulate athletes doping practices began in

59
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,320
1968 with the first primitive drug tests that were carried out at the

60
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,700
Mexico City summer Olympic games.

61
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,600
Over the next 40 years, drug testing at the Olympic games administered by

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,100
the International Olympic Committee, or IOC, was spectacularly ineffective

63
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,440
as only one in every 1,000 Olympic athletes tested positive

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,280
for a banned drug.

65
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,870
The use of anabolic steroids and other doping drugs by elite

66
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,840
athletes was rampant.

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,180
And there was nothing even resembling a global regulatory regime that might

68
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,980
check or reverse the doping epidemic.

69
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,800
The establishment of the World Anti-Doping Agency in January, 2000

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,080
was the first credible effort by global sports officials to mobilize

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,400
against doping in league sport.

72
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,740
The founding of WADA represented a cooperative arrangement between the

73
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,550
IOC and a number of interested governments.

74
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,420
Its declared objectives are to provide comprehensive leadership in the

75
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,990
anti-doping campaign, to persuade anti-doping in international sports

76
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,250
organizations to comply with the WADA code, to promote the involvement of

77
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,840
public authorities and leaders in the anti-doping struggle, to encourage

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,540
anti-doping education, to create a scientific research program in support

79
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,490
of anti-doping, to ensure that anti-doping laboratories meet

80
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,230
international standards, and to be a respected organization whose corporate

81
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,330
governance and operating standards reflect best international practice.

82
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,790


83
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,700
In other words, WADA's function as a world agency is to play an

84
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,580
inspirational role, to motivate people and institutions with real power to do

85
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,710
their part to combat doping.

86
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,160
12 years after WADA went into operation, its director general was

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,730
asked what it would take to win the war against doping.

88
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,610
We cannot win the war, David Howman replied, that's just not possible.

89
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,970
But we can win battles along the way.

90
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:36,430
This was a sobering assessment of WADA's powers as a global regulator.

91
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,580
For more than a decade after WADA had come into existence, its leadership

92
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,340
was waking up to the fact that they were up against forces

93
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,590
they could not control.

94
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,320


95
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,560
The obstacles to effective doping control are currently unmanageable and

96
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,240
are likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future.

97
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,160
Let us examine some of the factors that contribute to

98
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,410
this pessimistic prognosis.

99
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,470
The most dramatic development in recent years has been WADA's decision

100
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,490
to rely less on drug testing technology and more on law enforcement

101
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,820
to detect and deter athletes who are tempted to use doping.

102
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,520
As the Guardian put it in February of 2011, the World Anti-Doping Agency has

103
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,950
announced a major refocus in the fight against illegal doping leading up to

104
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,790
the 2012 London Olympic games.

105
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,230
Rather than relying on testing and laboratory analysis, as has been the

106
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:42,140
case in the past, WADA wants to increase the number of non-analytical

107
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,870
convictions secured through intelligence from Interpol and border

108
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,680
control agencies.

109
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,010
There is in short an emerging consensus among key anti-doping

110
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:59,510
executives that the policing of doping should be joined by the international

111
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,720
and government agencies that are charged with hunting down the world's

112
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,970
most dangerous criminals.

113
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,940


114
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,160
WADA's pursuit of working relationships with police agencies

115
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,470
like Interpol is unlikely to reduce doping in a significant way.

116
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,910
Collaborations with law enforcement agencies may intercept some deliveries

117
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,660
of doping drugs, but the conventional estimate is that these confiscations

118
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,789
amount to only a small fraction of the actual commerce in illicit drugs.

119
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,789
In 2009, the head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimated annual

120
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,650
global illegal drug profits to be about 352 billion dollars.

121
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:51,160
This enormous amount of illicit money suggests that law enforcement agencies

122
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,600
are interrupting only a very small fraction of the illicit drug trade.

123
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,760
And it is this uncontrolled market that is supplying drugs to athletes

124
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,930
and to the rest of the world.

125
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,830
The sheer scale of this illicit trade suggests that WADA's alliance with law

126
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,830
enforcement agencies, that can barely make a dent in this global drug

127
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,060
trafficking, is likely to be of limited value.

128
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,090
Sport of nationalism, the idea that nations gain in stature by developing

129
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,850
world class athletes has subverted doping control for

130
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,990
decades in two ways.

131
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:35,270
First, national bodies can circumvent anti-doping rules and procedures with

132
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,540
or without the intervention of powerful politicians.

133
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,580
A brief survey of some recent doping cases illustrates some of the

134
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,260
complications that WADA faces as it attempts to create uniformly effective

135
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,160
regulation of doping cases around the world.

136
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,310
Second, governments can treat the development of high performance

137
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,720
athletes as a national priority and sponsor scientific initiatives that

138
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,355
may or may not involve the production of doping agents.

139
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,890


140
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,940
The pharmacological abundance of the modern world is another obstacle to

141
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,300
global doping control.

142
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,800
Doping by elite athletes who are monitored by WADA constitutes only one

143
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,580
type of performance enhancement within a much larger category of doping

144
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,950
practices that include nonathletic uses of athletic doping drugs by very

145
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,510
large numbers of people around the world.

146
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:41,980
The ongoing expansion of this huge and often unregulated pharmacopoeia means

147
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,800
that WADA must find a way to persuade elite athletes not to dope.

148
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,000
But how can anti-doping officials persuade elite athletes that they are

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,770
duty bound to abstain from this rising tide of enhancements?

150
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,770
How can these officials convince them that they have an obligation to

151
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,760
compete drug free to preserve the integrity of their own subculture?

152
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,430


153
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,410
Let us now summarize the three major obstacles to the global regulation of

154
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,050
doping drugs.

155
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,450
One, WADA's alliances with law enforcement agencies against

156
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,900
international drug traffickers are not an effective strategy to control

157
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,030
doping by elite athletes, because there are too many global trafficking

158
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,670
networks to keep track of.

159
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,210


160
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:38,330
Two, sport of nationalism has subverted doping control for decades

161
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,740
by mandating the production of high performance athletes

162
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,550
by any means necessary.

163
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,890
National anti-doping panels or courts have actually blocked or complicated

164
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,050
many doping cases brought by international federations.

165
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,980
Governments have sponsored research to push the limits of performance and

166
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,170
promote the production of doping drugs.

167
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:09,540
Finally, WADA's regulatory objectives are being undermined by the dramatic

168
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,300
expansion of pharmacological enhancements throughout modern and

169
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,310
emerging societies.

170
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:21,280
We are currently experiencing an expansion and a normalization of

171
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,560
pharmacological enhancements along with the resulting favorable attitudes

172
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,990
toward boosting various aspects of human functioning.

173
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,390
There are two possible outcomes to this drama.

174
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:40,310
Either WADA will somehow manage to create a countervailing ethos of self

175
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,830

00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,960
population whose behavior it regulates.

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,723
