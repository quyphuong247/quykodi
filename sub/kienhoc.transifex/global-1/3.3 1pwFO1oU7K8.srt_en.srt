00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030


1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,570
The global aviation system is similar to the global shipping system in

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,140
several ways.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,750
The largest jet aircraft, like the mega ships we've already discussed,

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,130
are extremely complex machines that only a limited number of manufacturing

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,560
giants are able to construct.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,690
Since 2010, for example, two South Korean shipyards, Hyundai Heavy

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,100
Industries and Samsung Heavy Industries, have built almost all of

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,110
the world's largest container ships.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,570
Similarly, Boeing and the European consortium Airbus are the only

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,470
aircraft manufacturers in the world capable of building intercontinental,

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,980
jumbo jets.

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,940
The rivalry between these two dominant companies has been intense.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:56,720
Over the period 2003 to 2012, Airbus delivered 4,503 aircrafts to the

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,890
world's airlines.

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,680
And Boeing delivered 4,091.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,650
Both aircraft manufacturers, like shipyards, outsource work on their

17
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,570
airplanes, although Boeing outsources far more production to hundreds of

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,540
foreign suppliers.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,570
Each company has accused the other of undermining fair market practices by

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,200
accepting government subsidies.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,360
The relationships that form between governments and giant corporations is

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,560
a fundamental aspect of globalization that we will encounter later in this

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,565
and in other sections of the course.

24
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:36,270


25
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,140
The second tier in global aircraft manufacturing is occupied by only two

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,020
producers of the regional jets that seat up to 125 passengers, the

27
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,800
Brazilian aerospace conglomerate Embraer was founded by the Brazilian

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,040
government during the 1940s and became a government-owned company in 1969.

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,100
It is now largely privatized, but the Brazilian

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,760
government retain some influence.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,000
The Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier is the private corporation

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,080
that shares the regional jet market with Embraer.

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,850
Although the so-called big boys club of commercial aircraft production

34
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,400
remains limited to a technologically sophisticated elite, it is not

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,520
surprising that in 2008 the Chinese political leadership created the

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,310
state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac, to

37
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:40,060
enter this global market under the banner of aeronautical patriotism.

38
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,970
This sloganeering makes Comac a fine example of a state-sponsored, national

39
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,810
champion, corporate enterprise.

40
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,130
As of January 2013, Comac was developing a medium-sized, regional

41
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:02,220
jet known as the ARJ21 and a larger jetliner called the C919, which is

42
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,740
roughly comparable to the Boeing 737 and the Airbus 320.

43
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,450
It is worth noting that both Airbus and Embraer are assembling aircraft in

44
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,440
China, and that more than 20 foreign firms are involved in the production

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,780
of the Chinese ARJ21.

46
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,950
These arrangements confirm the importance of interdependent

47
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:32,740
relationships across national borders in the area of global manufacturing.

48
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,720
Still, the prospects for a successful Chinese entry into the global market

49
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,860
for the largest and most advanced jetliners are not good.

50
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,260
Technical problems, a reliance on overseas suppliers, and foreign

51
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,050
concerns about the safety and reliability of Chinese-made jets

52
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,070
indicate that the Western monopoly on commercial aircraft production will

53
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,800
remain intact for the foreseeable future.

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,740


55
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,320
Global air traffic, like global shipping, pollutes the Earth's

56
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,030
atmosphere.

57
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,360
By 2010, the annual number of global airline flights had past 30 .

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,190
Million as of May 2013, it was estimated that air travel accounts for

59
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,100
up to 5% of the warming effect of greenhouse gas emissions.

60
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,340
And they are expected to increase by 150% by the year 2030.

61
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,620
Is global aviation capable of reducing the growing production of climate

62
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,360
changing, high altitude emissions?

63
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,330
Answering this question brings us back to the difficult problem of global

64
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,920
governance and the degree to which it can formulate and enforce regulations

65
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,730
within an enormous industry around the world.

66
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,670
Like the International Maritime Organization, which has failed to

67
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,020
limit pollution from ships, the International Civil Aviation

68
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,520
Organization, or ICAO, is a specialized agency

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,390
of the United Nations.

70
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,440
This body is charged with regulating world aviation, a task which includes

71
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,120
monitoring flight safety, the training of pilots, language training for

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,220
certain personnel, and environmental protection.

73
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:27,140
The ICAO website includes a document on climate change and action plans to

74
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:33,100
limit emissions that exposes the passive role of the ICAO in this

75
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,280
reform process.

76
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,030
This document announces what it calls "a roadmap for action" that invites

77
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,620
the 190 member states to voluntarily submit their national action plans to

78
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,200
reduce CO2 emissions through the year 2050.

79
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,490
The ICAO says that its action plans will allow states to showcase the

80
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,800
specific, voluntary measures they intend to take in order to improve

81
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,580
efficiency and thereby contribute to the global, environmental,

82
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:15,060
aspirational goals agreed upon had an ICAO assembly in 2010.

83
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,300
The proposed collaboration between the international organization and its

84
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,060
member states turns out to be a mutually helpful but ultimately

85
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,480
ineffectual process.

86
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,620
The role of the ICAO is to help the states prepare and showcase their

87
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,110
action plans, while the role of the states is simply to submit action

88
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,220
plans the ICAO will accept as good-faith efforts to improve

89
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,740
efficiency and curb emissions.

90
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,050
The ICAO requires nothing but the submission of a document.

91
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:58,090
Alas, it turns out that passivity and halfway measures have been the ICAO's

92
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,870
modus operandi for many years.

93
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:09,370
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol made the ICAO and its 190 member nations responsible

94
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,900
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from commercial aviation.

95
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,540
After seven years of negotiations that accomplished nothing, the ICAO gave up

96
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,690
and referred the matter back to its member nations.

97
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:29,220
The United States insisted that its airlines face no effective regulation

98
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,720
until the ICAO had produced a global deal.

99
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,960
By passing responsibility to the ICAO, the United States was exploiting the

100
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,280
official status of a global organization by using it as an alibi

101
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,430
for the United States to take no effective action

102
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,410
against global warming.

103
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,340
Both American airlines and politicians have lobbied hard against any sort of

104
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,020
meaningful progress aimed at reducing aviation emissions.

105
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,470
US Airlines, for example, have adamantly opposed a European Union

106
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,160
plan to regulate emissions from flights between EU countries.

107
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,210


108
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,830
Following an ICAO assembly held in Montreal in 2010, the US State

109
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,660
Department hailed what it called an historic agreement that adopted an

110
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,270
unprecedented global commitment to collective action among countries

111
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,200
around the world, developed and developing, to limit and reduce carbon

112
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,760
emissions from international aviation.

113
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,280
This self-congratulatory announcement is undone in the very next sentence of

114
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,460
the State Department press release which acknowledges that further work

115
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,750
is necessary before any practical results would be achieved.

116
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,330
The flowery prose about an historic agreement, aspirational goals, and

117
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:05,090
important advancements served as a smokescreen to hide the fact that all

118
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,550
of the announced targets were non-binding and carries no penalties

119
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,970
for noncompliance.

120
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,630
The European Union demonstrated a real interest in attempting to limit

121
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,380
emissions from commercial aviation but was consistently opposed by American

122
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,030
negotiators bent on preserving the status quo.

123
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,610
The fact that the countless aspirational documents produced by

124
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,430
international organizations are taken seriously by journalists and others

125
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:42,060
reminds us that it is always important to examine the rhetorical techniques

126
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,260
and the motives of international organizations that claim to be

127
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,220
regulating commercial enterprises.

128
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,880
Global aviation also presents us with an opportunity to look briefly, in

129
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,690
this section of the course, at another globalization topic.

130
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,470
In this case, small country survival in a world that is dominated by

131
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,740
mega-states and how they practice globalization.

132
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,960
In fact, aviation and small country self-assertion are closely related in

133
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,330
that national airlines have long played a special role in symbolizing

134
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,530
the nation state, enhancing its prestige, and expressing its global

135
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,780
aspirations.

136
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,680


137
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,590
The collapse of Swiss Air coincided with the dramatic reduction in global

138
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,130
airline traffic that occurred after the terrorist attacks of

139
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,720
September 11, 2001.

140
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,690
But the end of this iconic, national flag carrier airline is also a lesson

141
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,150
in how even a prosperous and admired small country, driven by national

142
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:57,250
pride and an appetite for prestige, can be seduced by the lure of maximum

143
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,100
involvement in the globalization process.

144
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,990
The Swiss Air leadership persuaded themselves that the airline had to

145
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,290
expand beyond its national boundaries to survive in the

146
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,730
global aviation market.

147
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,450
Having benefited from a domestic monopoly, these executives believe the

148
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,650
company was strong enough to expand abroad.

149
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,870
They just couldn't resist the idea of integrating Swiss Air into what they

150
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,110
saw as the globalization of the industry.

151
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,840
The problem, as the Wall Street Journal Asia put it, is that global

152
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,440
aspirations often caused managers to ignore the disciplined application of

153
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,000
an industry's basic economics and the importance of exercising control over

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,250
your investments.

155
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,340


156
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,330
The end of the Swiss Air is a dramatic example of the emotional significance

157
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,140
of a national flag carrier to a small national community.

158
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,530
As one commentator said, the loss of Swiss Air was particularly dramatic

159
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,700
for small but wealthy Switzerland, immensely proud of its reputation for

160
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,010
quality and reliability, attributes enshrined in the

161
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,530
national flag carrier.

162
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:21,300
Precisely because the globalization process promotes competition as a way

163
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:27,370
of life, it can also intensify a country's need to feel that it can

164
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,020
point to distinctive achievements that confer prestige on the

165
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,770
international stage.

166
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:39,080
And there is nothing like a huge jumbo jet that bears the nation's flag for

167
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,170
projecting the image of national distinction around the world.

168
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,420
