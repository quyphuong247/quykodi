00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460


1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,280
We have just been looking at the economic side of

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,220
the global film industry.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,990
But the more interesting questions about entertainment exports and their

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,260
presumed effects have to do with the qualities and characterized of the

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,320
entertainment itself.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,760
What sort of American content does an American-made film bring to a foreign

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,980
country in which it is shown?

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,990
How can we define American content in the first place?

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,500
Do different-media carrying American content do equally well?

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,400
And is it perhaps necessary for the producers of films made in the United

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,180
States to shape their products to appeal to the global cinema market?

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,500
Concerns about American cultural dominance assume that an American

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,330
cultural product contains a recognizable American quality that

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,490
suppresses or displaces the cultural products of other national cultures.

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:00,220
And if American content is as potent as it is often assumed to be, then it

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,510
ought to be equally potent when conveyed in similar media.

17
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,130
Yet American television programs are much less influential than American

18
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,540
films around the world.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,430
An American film headed to the global market could be

20
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,590
defined in several ways.

21
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,780
It might refer to any film that is produced in the United States or to

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,310
any film that is made by an American director or to any film that features

23
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,450
so-called American values, such as individualism, entrepreneurialism,

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,660
optimism, heroism, or the violence and aggression that are an

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,190
American media staple.

26
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,880
In fact, neither production in the US nor an American director guarantees an

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,620
American message.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,540
Hollywood, built largely by Eastern European Jewish immigrants, has never

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,270
been an ethnically American culture factory.

30
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,420
Similarly, Americans do not have a monopoly on American values, such as

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,010
individualism or heroism.

32
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,380
The idea of cultural purity is, to a great extent, an illusion that appeals

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,510
most strongly to the myopic, the nostalgic, and the xenophobic.

34
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,770


35
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,990
We might also ask how American are styles and behaviors that originated

36
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,720
in the United States and then go on to flourish around the world.

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,390
The bodybuilding culture that began in California was popularized by an

38
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,740
Austrian immigrant named Arnold Schwarzenegger and is now a global

39
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,190
phenomenon.

40
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,610
The Hell's Angels motorcycle club that started out in California in 1948 now

41
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,320
has branches in 27 countries.

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,250
Labeling cultural phenomena by nationality is a longstanding habit

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,790
that can distort our sense of which cultural products belong to whom.

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,500
In summary, doubts about the national essences of cultural products

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,060
undermine our assumptions about what is actually happening when national

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,060
products of foreign origin enter the cultural sphere of other people's

47
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,550
national experiences or identities.

48
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,190


49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,140
Current trends in global cinema show that the American film hegemony that

50
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,220
is one driver of cultural imperialism is in decline in a globalizing world.

51
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,520
The requirements of local cultures have become more important.

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,560
As of 2011, Hollywood films were losing market share in some Asian

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,580
markets to locally-made films.

54
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,680
Hollywood studios were also producing more films in local languages.

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,910
The storyline of a movie like Ghost Protocol plays out in a variety of

56
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,560
international locations to appeal to several foreign audiences.

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,510
Studios hire actors of different nationalities to appeal to specific

58
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,340
national markets.

59
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,460
At the same time, some concessions to local tastes are just superficial

60
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,590
adjustments of American formulas for making movies or television shows.

61
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,570
In 1998, the president of MTV described its 14 different 24-hour

62
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,269
feeds around the world as all different and all similar.

63
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,010
In China, he said, we have Mandarin 24-hour service that is 70% to 80%

64
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,290
Chinese music.

65
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,020
In India, it's Hindi pop and Hindi film music.

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,225
But it is presented in the familiar MTV style.

67
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:36,610


68
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,970
This strategy of targeting local audiences is compatible with and

69
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,260
accompanied by a search for universality that has become a

70
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,770
financial necessity for American producers.

71
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,910
Many American films could not be made without sales to the global market.

72
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,290
Studios are thus trying to come up with a formula for global content that

73
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,150
seeks to enable audience identification with human universals.

74
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,510
They're making films that have fairly universal ideas and themes.

75
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,400
They're not really culturally-specific, one film expert

76
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,080
said in 2013.

77
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,900
This process changes American filmmaking by promoting projects that

78
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,260
are expected to be internationally popular and by eliminating proposed

79
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,950
films that are thought to be of little or no interest to

80
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,480
non-American audiences.

81
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,700
But what are the universal ideas and themes that are supposed to give a

82
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,190
film global appeal?

83
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,510
While English language production is a major advantage in the global market,

84
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,160
there are other characteristics that are widely assumed to promote the

85
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,310
global appeal of a film.

86
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,910
These include simplified dialogue, visceral emotions, special effects,

87
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,680
and what one commentator has called the glitz and gloss, the sex, speed,

88
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,960
and violence of American popular culture.

89
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,610
In 2012, an MTV website bluntly stated that the company which provides visual

90
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,710
entertainment as well as music will need to pursue an aggressive creative

91
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,970
strategy in order to capture the attention of a generation with an

92
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,250
exceptionally short attention span.

93
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,820
The American sociologist Todd Gitlin has elaborated on the

94
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,640
nature of global appeal.

95
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,220
"We are good," he says, "at producing themes and story lines that appeal to

96
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,190
a global sensibility--

97
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,880
freedom, freedom of movement, freedom from family, from place, from Earth,

98
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,950
from roles, and speed, the rapidity of movement, of images, the intensity of

99
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,550
kinetic experience.

100
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:55,110
They want the sense of motion and the sense of a private utopia."

101
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,350
This analysis raises an interesting question.

102
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,190
If Americans are so good at producing cultural material that appeals to a

103
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,830
global sensibility, then how different can the cultural sensibilities of

104
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,736
Americans and their global audience actually be?

105
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:14,190
And does a convergence of sensibilities really impose a

106
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,180
monoculture on all of us?

107
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,210
The economist Tyler Cowen has pointed out that multiplicity can be part of

108
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,320
what we think of as a single culture.

109
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,770
As he puts it, "different cultures have more common components than

110
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:35,010
before, and individuals around the world are selecting from a commonly

111
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,790
diverse menu of choice.

112
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,710
The freedom to be different also means the freedom to sometimes choose the

113
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:49,060
same things." Is cultural imperialism at work if non-Americans choose to

114
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,740
watch American films, not because they've been brainwashed, but because

115
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,720
they freely choose this kind of entertainment?

116
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,270
Or is free choice in an age of Americanization simply an illusion?

117
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,770


118
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,330
The two highest grossing films in history are James Cameron's Titanic

119
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,160
and Avatar.

120
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,780
Titanic has made over $2 billion, while Avatar is closing in on $3

121
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,480
billion in global sales.

122
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,750
One critic explains the global success of Avatar as follows.

123
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:31,420
"The movie Avatar is a worldwide box office success, not merely because it

124
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,510
is a technological marvel of special effects, but because it is a religious

125
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,210
myth on the level of ancient texts like the Epic of Gilgamesh.

126
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,210
First, it is a postmodern multicultural critique of America and

127
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,600
Western civilization, where the good guys are primitive natives who worship

128
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,700
nature, and the bad guys are greedy multinational energy corporations,

129
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,990
protected by warmongering mercenary militia, facilitated by the scientific

130
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,830
depersonalization of nature.

131
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,070
Images and concepts of many religions, including Hinduism, animism, and

132
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,970
Christianity are integrated into its multicultural story,

133
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,870
creating global appeal.

134
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,640


135
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,300
In other words, the most commercially successful film of all time is an

136
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,700
American film promoting an anti-American message that has

137
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,950
demonstrated unparalleled global appeal at the box office.

138
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,560
Whether its extraordinary popularity derives from its technological

139
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,310
marvels, its anti-Western message, or its syncretic religiosity, or all of

140
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,790
these factors working together, we don't know.

141
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,040
