1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,850
International dissemination of popular culture forms that include the theme

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,740
of human sexuality can provoke conflicts between media that present

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,990
any form of erotic intimacy or nudity and religious conservatives who regard

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,080
such public displays as immoral.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,470
The importing of the Western reality television genre to the Arab world is

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,380
one example of such a culture clash.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,800
In 2004, the Middle Eastern version of Big Brother, a television program that

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,530
originated in the Netherlands in 1999, showed a young Saudi men kissing a

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,590
Tunisian beauty onscreen.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,230
Within two weeks, protests had forced the show off the air.

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,910
The show was based in Dubai and owned not by Western interests, but by a

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,980
brother-in-law of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,320
This program showed an abnormal way of living, which is totally opposed to

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,600
our thoughts, culture, everything, said a sheik from the fundamentalist

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,020
Salafi movement who led protests against the show.

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,390
It is not reality TV at all, he said, especially in our part of the world.

17
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,150
This sort of cultural conservatism in the Muslim world has been challenged

18
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,450
by a Turkish soap opera called Gumus, which features kissing, other mild

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,290
erotic touches, and the scandalously disordered lives that are familiar to

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,040
Western soap opera audiences.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,970
While Saudi clerics issued fatwas calling for the show's distributors to

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,090
be killed, Turks saw this kind of programming as an influential cultural

23
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,560
export that was changing sexual mores in the Arab world.

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,000
Just as American culture had changed Turkey, now it was the Turks who were

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,030
in a position to change Arab societies.

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,320
This liberal cultural policy is not, however, a regional norm.

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,000
In 2013, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting Network found itself in

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,460
trouble for inadvertently showing indecent and un-Islamic images of

29
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,240
female spectators while broadcasting international sports events.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,660
In the same year, the organizer of the Miss World competition in Jakarta,

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,680
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim majority country, announced that the

32
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,090
young female contestants in that year's pageant would not be appearing

33
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,820
in bikinis.

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,550
Cosmopolitan magazine is a sexualized American product that has become a

35
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,120
thriving example of global popular culture that has been adapted to many

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,370
cultural environments.

37
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,530
The publication known as Cosmo appears in no fewer than 64 international

38
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,800
editions in countries including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,300
Mongolia, Vietnam, Croatia, South Korea, Indonesia, India, China, and in

40
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,540
a regional Middle East Cosmo.

41
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,130
As in the case of Hollywood films, our principal challenge as cultural

42
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,870
analysts is to identify universal themes and local variations that

43
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,670
co-exist within a global cultural product.

44
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,500
It is tempting to say that sex is the universal theme Cosmo has to offer,

45
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,730
but that is not really accurate.

46
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,430
The universal dialect in the world of Cosmo is romance, a journalist once

47
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,100
pointed out.

48
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,980
Indeed, the various international editions of Cosmo make it clear that

49
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,810
sex, the erotic experience, not the sex act, is not the human universal it

50
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,150
is commonly imagined to be.

51
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,950
Sex is downplayed in the Chinese and Indonesian editions and sometimes

52
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,630
treated as passe in the Swedish and French editions.

53
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,420
In Azerbaijan, it is sex within marriage.

54
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,810
In some Middle Eastern countries, dating and premarital sex

55
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,730
are against the law.

56
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,680
The American edition always includes a brief sex manual along with the gossip

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,140
and fashion.

58
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,080
The editors argue that apart from the remarkably similar female models who

59
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,019
appear on covers around the world, the universal message Cosmo offers is the

60
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:22,940
empowerment of young women, no matter where they happen to be.

61
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,960
We are not a political magazine, the president of Hearst Magazines

62
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,770
International said in 2002.

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,010
But how Cosmo produces empowerment while keeping its hands off the levers

64
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,890
of power, he did not say.

65
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,153
