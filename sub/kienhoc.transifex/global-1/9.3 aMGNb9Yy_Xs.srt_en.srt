1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,640
Section nine is about global labor markets.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,950
How could automated production destabilize the global market?

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:13,920
If you have a situation where machines are doing a lot of the production that

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,620
large numbers of workers have done, then those workers are going to be

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,190
thrown out of work.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,280
And the question is whether they are going to be unemployed for the

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:31,600
foreseeable future or whether they can be retrained to fill other jobs,

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,350
possibly higher level jobs, better paid jobs, that are going to replace

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,940
the ones that have been displaced by technological inventions that allow

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,920
for very few people to supervise the production of lots and lots of product

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,490
by machines.

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,980
Why might a globally integrated market be beneficial?

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:04,290
A globally integrated market, ideally, would be one which is uniform,

14
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:13,300
literally across the planet, so that wages for any specific job would be

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,100
identical, whether it was country A or country B or country C. This is

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:27,210
potentially beneficial in that there would be an equality that usually does

17
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,060
not prevail.

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,970
In other words, the lowest-paid people for doing a particular kind of work

19
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,910
would see their wages elevated to the levels enjoyed by other workers in

20
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,940
other countries.

21
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,110
So this would be a way to prevent a certain number of

22
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,420
people being underpaid.

23
00:01:50,420 --> 00:02:00,720
It would also create equal access to products, on the part of everyone, no

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,320
matter where they were.

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,169
And ideally, globally integrated market would presumably abolish

26
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:14,690
tariffs, import fees for various kinds of products.

27
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:20,980
And this ought to lower the cost of all sorts of things for consumers in

28
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,230
many countries.

29
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,630
Why did the leaders of Britain, France, and Germany all announce the

30
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,800
failure of multiculturalism in 2010?

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,360
The leaders of Germany, France, and Britain announced the failure of

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,970
multiculturalism in 2010.

33
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,040
It was a kind of a domino effect.

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,240
What happened was that, in the summer of 2010, a certain politician and bank

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,870
official published a book that was very anti-immigrant in its ideology

36
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,130
and its tone.

37
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,870
And basically what he said was that the arrival of so many Muslim people

38
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,750
in Germany was, in effect, leading to a certain kind of a social

39
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,280
disintegration.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,130
This book became an improbable mega best seller.

41
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:23,670
It struck a chord in that segment of the German population that was already

42
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,750
upset about, alienated by, uncomfortable with the task of

43
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,130
integrating a lot of Muslims into what is, at least

44
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,190
formally, a Christian society.

45
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,990
This is not an easy process for anyone.

46
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,820
And there are lots of European societies who are having this

47
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,480
experience.

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,790
And it can be very difficult.

49
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,150
The publication of this book and its sudden fame and popularity put

50
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,750
pressure on the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.

51
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,350
And she put her finger up into the political wind and said, the wind is

52
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,010
blowing away from the multicultural ideal.

53
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:16,170
I'm going to curry favor in the electorate by, in effect, saying on

54
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:24,430
the one hand, well, the author of this book, Mr. Sarrazin, has expressed this

55
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,400
in too extreme a manner.

56
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,350
But by the same token, we must acknowledge that there is a problem.

57
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:42,270
And so her political wind vane was moving in response to the perceived

58
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,750
political mood of the nation.

59
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:51,200
The next thing you know is that the president of France, Mr. Sarkozy, and

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,360
the prime minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, were making

61
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,520
more or less identical statements.

62
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:10,290
That they, too, wanted to protect themselves politically from the force

63
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,385
of anti-immigrant opinion in their own Western European society.

64
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:19,970
So these are three prosperous Western European societies.

65
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:28,530
These are not borderline places where there's an economic emergency that is

66
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,460
going to really inflame feelings against immigrants, as is currently

67
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,420
the case in Greece.

68
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:43,660
That was not the conditions that the leaders of Germany, France, and

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,670
Britain were addressing.

70
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:52,620
But their political unease with the unease about the cultural integration,

71
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,790
or failure to culturally integrate large numbers of Muslims in particular

72
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:03,360
into the societies, that they decided to align themselves with the

73
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,720
conservative position that multiculturalism had been tried and it

74
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,210
had failed.

75
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,510
How does the perceived failure of multiculturalism affect

76
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,370
global labor markets?

77
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:23,140
50 years ago, Germany invited many foreign workers from the Mediterranean

78
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:30,000
area to come to Germany to help build the so-called economic

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,140
miracle of the 1960s.

80
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:41,700
And they assumed that these people were going to work and then go back

81
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,260
where they came from.

82
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,970
This did not happen.

83
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,200
But the big point is that you had a labor shortage in a relatively

84
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,390
wealthier part of, namely, Germany, Northern Europe.

85
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,760
The less-wealthy populations are going to be supplying immigrant labor at the

86
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,480
invitation of the Germans in the 1960s.

87
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,910
1970s, they decide to turn off the tap, and they are not going to be

88
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,760
taking any more immigrant workers.

89
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,070
So the sense that the integration process is going well or that it is

90
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:25,430
going badly is going to affect the views of politicians and policymakers

91
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,160
regarding whether or not to allow additional foreign labor to come into

92
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,820
your society.

93
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,500
Have multinational corporations suffered consequences

94
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,020
for taking this position?

95
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,970
Not to a large extent, in my judgment.

96
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:48,650
Now, in the year 2013, we have seen major multinational executives

97
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,890
testifying to Congress and being questioned by members of Congress as

98
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:59,700
to how in the world do you get away with paying so little in taxes?

99
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,510
At which point one of them said, we'll take a look at the law that your

100
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,730
institution wrote regarding corporate taxes.

101
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,060
And that was an appropriate rejoinder.

102
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,170
Apparently some of the lawmakers we're not conversant with the laws that

103
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:24,400
permit American corporations to pay relatively little in taxes compared to

104
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,820
what the treasury might want them to pay.

105
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,159
We know many low-skill jobs have been outsourced from the US

106
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,330
to places like India.

107
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,580
Will various high-skill jobs also be outsourced?

108
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,549
That's a very good question.

109
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:45,160
A lot of call center jobs, for example, have been sent overseas to

110
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,920
places with large English-speaking communities, like India or the

111
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,131
Philippines.

112
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:58,180
The prospects for high-skill jobs being outsourced, in fact, is

113
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,570
increasing.

114
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:06,630
If you can communicate intercontinentally, and we know we can

115
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:13,190
through fiber optic cables and on and off of satellites, then you can send

116
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,450
more sophisticated tasks than answering customer calls, for example,

117
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,010
to the other side of the world.

118
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,620
And this is already happening in the case of, say, legal work.

119
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,160
There are certain kinds of legal work that is either repetitive or involves

120
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,390
a very systematic searching of documents, for example, which can be

121
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,270
outsourced.

122
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:46,150
You can give this kind of work to much lower-paid legally trained people in

123
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,620
India, shall we say?

124
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,330
Some of this can also be given to computers.

125
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,820
So in that sense, there's two kinds of outsourcing of relatively

126
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,900
highly-skilled work.

127
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,310
You can give it to a machine that has the software to handle it, or you

128
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,860
could give it to lower-paid people on the other side of the world who have

129
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,440
the skill set and maybe a quarter or a fifth of the salary for doing the same

130
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,330
kind of work the junior lawyers would be doing in the United States.

131
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,320
How does this section on global labor markets connect to other topics in

132
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,910
this course?

133
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,880
This section connects to several other sections of the course.

134
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,550
Take, for example, the theme of social justice.

135
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,170
We're interested in the social justice issues that come up in the context of

136
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,420
globalization.

137
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,810
Exploited groups of workers are certainly a social justice issue.

138
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:55,450
So legal and practical protections for vulnerable, often low-paid workers, is

139
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,740
a social justice issue that is tightly bound to the whole question of the

140
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,580
global labor markets.

141
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,840
Who is going to be exploited?

142
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,430
Who is going to be benefiting?

143
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:16,390
In the case of national identity, to what extent are we going to preserve

144
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:22,860
the labor market for natives, as it were, citizens,

145
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,170
the domestic workforce?

146
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,350
And to what extent is it advantageous?

147
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,400
And then the question becomes, advantageous for whom to bring in

148
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,160
workforces from other countries?

149
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,360
There's another national interest issue that is connected to global

150
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,700
labor markets, and that is, what will the reaction of the working force at

151
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:58,710
home or the political parties be if we absorb or try to absorb a large number

152
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,910
of foreign workers into our society?

153
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:07,550
The global labor market theme is also related to the global transportation

154
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:14,090
networks in that there are large numbers of workers and lots of

155
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:21,380
vulnerable workers associated with the commercial shipping business, such as

156
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:27,970
the more than 1 million seafarers who are out there on these huge ships,

157
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,020
basically sustaining the world economy.

158
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,000
These are, in some ways, dangerous jobs.

159
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,210
They're lonely jobs.

160
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:42,400
And they are a workforce that needs more protection than they get.

161
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,220
A second example would be the ship breakers, who are very poor and

162
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,120
vulnerable people paid very little to dismantle ships on the beaches of

163
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,780
India, Bangladesh, and a few other countries.

164
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,720
So our study of global transportation systems is also going to bring us into

165
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,360
contact with important issues with regard to the global labor market.

166
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,415
Thank you for talking to us today about global labor

167
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:08,360
markets, Dr. Hoberman.

168
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,610
Thank you.

169
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,170
