1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,260
Globalization is the most complicated phenomenon on Earth.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,790
So how can we understand it?

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,450
This course shows that if we use concepts such as systems, competition,

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,560
and connectivity, we can get very close to an understanding of what

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,650
globalization is and how it works.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,290
This material is going to show you how to visualize, to actually see

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,630
globalization in many ways.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,970
For one thing, we are going to be showing you lots of maps, very

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,900
instructive maps of the entire world that demonstrate how the systems that

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,180
operate on a global scale actually work.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,250
These maps of various global systems are going to play a key role in

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,960
helping us understand these networks and how they can create global

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,460
communities.

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,460
We can look at maps of airplane routes, shipping routes, or Facebook

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,440
communications across the globe.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,070
We can look at the undersea cable system that makes

17
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,020
the internet possible.

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,820
These are the fiber optic cables that are the indispensable basis of the

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,410
incredible internet resources we take for granted as an electronic

20
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,980
phenomenon.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,430
We should be aware that the internet requires many thousands of miles of

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,250
cables similar to those that made possible the telegraph communications

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,500
of the 19th century.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,170


25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,340
How we imagine globalization is also of great practical significance.

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,850
If we fear globalization, this fear will have political and policy

27
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,530
consequences.

28
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,710
A multinational corporation that embraces globalization because it

29
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,530
seems to be a process that promotes profits around the world in various

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,490
markets will imagine globalization as a guarantor of its profitable future.

31
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,890
But those who fear globalization may think of it as a kind of a monster

32
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,500
that has invaded their private lives.

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,920
We've learned, for example, that the intrusive capacity of the internet

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,210
includes global surveillance by an intelligence service such as the

35
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,220
American National Security Agency.

36
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,470
Global surveillance too is one aspect of globalization.

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,610
Do we want to imagine globalization as the surveillance of the world's

38
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,130
electronic communications by intelligence agencies?

39
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,820
Or do we prefer to imagine globalization as a way to implement

40
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,920
rules and regulations that will reduce poverty and labor exploitation,

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,250
prevent the overfishing of the oceans, and slow the relentless warming of the

42
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,910
Earth's atmosphere?

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,610
In this sense, what we see as globalization is a product of our

44
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,140
deepest wishes and fears.

45
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,553
