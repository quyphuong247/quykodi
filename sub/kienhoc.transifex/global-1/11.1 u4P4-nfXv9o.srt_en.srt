1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:06,460
On September 18, 2006, the chairman of the governing board of the Swiss

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,670
National Bank, Jean-Pierre Roth, gave a speech in Singapore, a city-state

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,760
often referred to, he said, as the Switzerland of Asia.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,340
These two small states, he noted, shared important characteristics.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,610
Both exist in the proximity of larger and more powerful states.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,230
Both are at the top of the world list when it comes to making foreign

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,470
investments.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,320
Both must produce high-technology products and first-class services that

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,710
are competitive on the world market.

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,870
Finally, both must be open to international markets in an age of

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,740
globalization.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,140
The speaker did not mention Singapore's ambition to follow

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,290
Switzerland's example as a tax haven for the wealthy.

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,090
We want to be the Switzerland of Asia, a Singaporean banker

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,570
said back in 2004.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,970
In fact, Singapore is projected to be the world's leading global offshore

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,240
wealth center by the year 2020.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,040
Many of the world's smallest states and territories have done very well as

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,510
offshore tax havens that conceal or launder huge sums of money for tax

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,780
evaders and criminals.

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,870
The purpose of this section is to examine how small countries with

22
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:29,420
populations of less than 20 million cope with the globalization process.

23
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,410
This is an interesting question in part, because history tells us that

24
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:40,000
larger nations have generally found it easier to survive than small ones.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,650
Still, the membership of the United Nations has almost quadrupled since

26
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,890
1945, suggesting that global conditions have somehow promoted small

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,920
countries' survival in recent decades.

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,570
Today, about half of the world's 242 countries and dependent territories

29
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,380
are small or even micro national and political entities.

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,470
For reasons we want to understand, some small countries have done very

31
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,150
well in the context of globalization, while others have not.

32
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,050
So the major question we will examine in this section is, how do so many

33
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,080
small countries survive and even thrive in an age of globalization?

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,115
What do they have that other small countries do not?

35
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:31,330


36
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,180
Small countries can be divided into advanced and less-developed

37
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,520
categories.

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,480
Singapore and Switzerland are advanced societies, whose per capita incomes

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,370
are ranked fourth and sixth in the world by the World Bank.

40
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,360
In fact, measured by per capita income, 18 of the top rankings are

41
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,060
occupied by small countries, including such well-known tax havens as

42
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,480
Luxembourg, Macau, Singapore, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Ireland.

43
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,410
All five of the small Scandinavian countries--

44
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,050
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland, none of

45
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,480
which are tax havens--

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,110
rank in the top 20 in the world.

47
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,140
On the OECD Better Life Index, small countries occupy 11

48
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,210
of the top 15 rankings.

49
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:25,190
If we count Australia and Canada, which I regard as small countries,

50
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,690
then it's 13 of the top 15 in the world.

51
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,540
All five of the Scandinavian countries rank in the top 50.

52
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,380
On the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, small countries occupy 16 of

53
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,810
the top 20 positions in the world.

54
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,090
All five of the Scandinavian countries rank in the top 21.

55
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,190
Interestingly, non-advanced small countries, such as Latvia, Costa Rica,

56
00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:00,130
Albania, Lithuania, and Croatia also appear on the EPI list.

57
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,330
According to the 2012 Corruptions Perceptions Index, published by

58
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,210
Transparency International, 14 of the 15 least corrupt countries in the

59
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,180
world, counting Australia and Canada, are small countries.

60
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,140
All five of the Scandinavian countries rank in the top 11.

61
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:25,840
In summary, it is well known that small countries dominate on various

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,470
quality of life and global citizenship world rankings and even rankings for

63
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,720
competitiveness.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,960


65
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,470
Many small countries also belong to the list of least-developed countries

66
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,760
that are divided into landlocked developing countries and small island

67
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,600
developing states.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,590
There is also the alliance of small island states, an intergovernmental

69
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,130
organization comprising 40 low-lying coastal and small-island countries

70
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,120
that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise

71
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,370
caused by global warming.

72
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,940


73
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,140
This section deals primarily with a small countries that have done well

74
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,610
during the current age of globalization.

75
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,890
We want to understand their shared characteristics and whether the

76
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,310
globalization process itself may provide an especially favorable

77
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:26,330
environment for those small countries that are prepared to engage with it.

78
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,880
In 1994, the prominent economist Gary Becker argued that being small has

79
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,300
some intrinsic advantages.

80
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,490
First, a small economy may be forced to specialize in niche markets that

81
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,880
larger economies cannot serve in an efficient manner.

82
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,100
Second, the more homogeneous economy of a smaller society will be less

83
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,010
vulnerable to disruption by conflicts and disagreements.

84
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,190
Third, small economies are less exposed to trade quotas and other

85
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,340
restrictions on trade, because their smaller output does not threaten

86
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,590
larger producers.

87
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,770


88
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,420
Two decades later, David Skilling, of the Landfall Strategy Group, offered a

89
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,790
more detailed analysis of the advanced small country's economic performances

90
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,810
in a globalized world that tends to confirm Becker's arguments.

91
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,590
Small developed countries, he writes, have performed strongly over the past

92
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,910
several decades, out ranking large developed countries on many economic

93
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,950
and social measures.

94
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,810
Once again, smallness is seen as a competitive advantage.

95
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,940
Small countries, he writes, tend to have better developed sensing

96
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,870
mechanisms in terms of what is happening in the rest of the world.

97
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,480
And the humility that comes with this perspective means that they are more

98
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,600
likely to be able to change course when necessary to adapt to a changing

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,770
global landscape.

100
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,470
Skilling argues that the advanced small countries benefit from more

101
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,160
effective government; more coherent national strategies; a greater

102
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,220
capacity for innovation, education, and creativity; promotion of human

103
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,680
development and social outcomes; and high levels of social capital and

104
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,460
trust that promote social cohesion and reduce the potential

105
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,390
for internal conflicts.

106
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,420
Small countries, he says, have much less margin for error.

107
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,670
And they know it.

108
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:37,980


109
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,920
Small country disadvantages include exposure to big power conflicts and

110
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,580
their own small domestic markets that just cannot support certain kinds of

111
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,440
economic development.

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,660
At the same time, a small domestic market may force a small country's

113
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,340
companies to enter the international market, thereby turning a disadvantage

114
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,130
into an advantage.

115
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,680
They simply cannot afford the policy fatalism that can affect the

116
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,230
decision-making process in large countries.

117
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,270
Singapore's Economic Strategies Committee, the Danish Globalization

118
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,560
Council, and the Mission for Finland Project show small countries engaging

119
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,780
with globalization in a focused and deliberate way.

120
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,980


121
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,020
An enthusiastic embracing of globalization has become a mandatory

122
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,799
public ritual for the advanced small countries.

123
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,010
The reports of the Singaporean, Danish, and Finnish committees are

124
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:44,030
filled with globalization jargon that signals these countries allegiance to

125
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,590
the ideology of market globalization.

126
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,800
Singapore is presented as a leading global city in the heart of Asia bent

127
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,260
on retaining its core competitive advantage and attracting talent from

128
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,710
around the world.

129
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,490
Singapore has a competitive edge in quality of life and

130
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,700
multicultural diversity.

131
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:12,540
It aspires to be a lifestyle hub for big spenders in the manner of Dubai.

132
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,180
The city-state's competitiveness as a hub for the arts needs further

133
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,860
development.

134
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,230
The Danish Globalization Council, set up in 2005, has produced a

135
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,360
comprehensive strategy for Denmark in the global economy.

136
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,890
The aim, the report says, is to ensure that the globalization process is

137
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,640
beneficial for all.

138
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,460
And there's work to be done.

139
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,250
For example, the Danish research system lacks competition.

140
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,390
Competition is too weak in several business sectors and in a number of

141
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,690
infrastructural areas.

142
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,350
Ideological terms such as entrepreneurship, innovation,

143
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:59,530
efficiency, and open competition are now the standard idiom.

144
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,030
The Finish Country Brand Delegation, saluting the idiom of corporate

145
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:08,530
advertising, aims to increase Finland's appeal to the rest of the

146
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:14,320
world and to reinforce Finland's international competitive edge.

147
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,620
All of these documents have two audiences--

148
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,640
the citizenry that requires mobilization and the international

149
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,230
community that needs to hear the globalization jargon, so that it will

150
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,800
take small countries seriously as global players.

151
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,443
