1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,750
Section three is all about ships, planes, and pollution.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,180
And as you say in the lecture, most of the world's cargo is

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,000
transported by ships.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,390
So how big are these giant cargo ships?

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,990
The biggest ships are on the order of a quarter mile long, sometimes even

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,390
bigger than that.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,410
And one way to get a sense of how big the biggest container ships are--

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,970
more than 400 meters long--

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,020
is to compare the biggest container ships with one of the enormous

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,600
aircraft carriers deployed by the United States Navy.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,150
Now, those aircraft carriers are approximately 1,000 feet long.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,370
The biggest container ship in the world is going to be approximately one

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,000
football field longer than a big, big aircraft carrier.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,230
So you're talking about enormous vessels that are built to an enormous

15
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:05,489
scale in order to accommodate, at this point, maybe 15,000 containers.

16
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,270
These are huge, huge man-made objects.

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,750
How many crew members does it take to operate the biggest

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,190
ships in the world?

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,310
Let's take as an example one of the enormous aircraft carriers deployed by

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,360
the United States Navy.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,170
These ships are about 1,000 feet long, maybe somewhat longer.

22
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:32,030
And they will have crews on the order of 5,000 people.

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,530
The aircraft carrier, having one function, is going to have about 5,000

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,190
people on board.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:44,240
The quarter-mile-long container ship can be operated with as few as 13

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,320
people to take 15,000 containers from one point to the

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,620
other side of the ocean.

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,700
Do crew members have to have the same nationality as ship owners?

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,065
No.

30
00:01:57,065 --> 00:02:04,040
There are over 1 million sailors out there crewing the tens of thousands of

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
large commercial vessels.

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,690
And they come from many different countries.

33
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,009
A disproportionate number of them are Filipino.

34
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,230
The ship owners are always looking to cut costs--

35
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,520
save money here, save money there.

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,650
And so hiring from a lot of third-world countries is going to make

37
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:30,390
more sense from an economic standpoint for the ship owner than hiring from

38
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,200
richer societies.

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,030
If a ship registers in a certain country, does that country

40
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,480
regulate that ship?

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,710
Yes.

42
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:45,340
The ship owner will very often not regulate in his own country because he

43
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,295
may see there a regulatory burden he doesn't want to deal with.

44
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:57,640
And so in many, many cases, the ships are registered in faraway places that

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,910
are the maritime equivalent of offshore tax havens so that the ship

46
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:12,690
owner can operate the ship more inexpensively, even if he is avoiding

47
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,990
certain regulations that may be desirable regulations from the

48
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,620
standpoint of the safety of the ship and the crew.

49
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:28,040
So that there is, in effect, this offshore option for ship owners to

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,790
register ships in places that cut costs.

51
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,240
And at the same time, they are hiring lots of crews from third-world

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:44,365
countries who can be paid less than sailors from more developed countries.

53
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:48,020
Do airlines enhance the image of the nation-state?

54
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,120
It has long been assumed that airlines do enhance the images of nation-states

55
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,240
and especially for small countries.

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,210
You think, for example, of the small Scandinavian countries that formed the

57
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,530
Scandinavian Airlines System, SAS, many years ago.

58
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,180
Little Belgium created Sabena airlines.

59
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:17,529
The Swiss created Swissair, which collapsed in dramatic fashion in 2001

60
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:22,210
and was experienced by this small country as a kind of a trauma.

61
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:28,970
So that there is a tradition of many, many nations saying, we have to have

62
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,760
our own national airline simply to advertise ourselves across the globe.

63
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,270
Do ship companies also enhance the image of the nation-state?

64
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,730
Not in the same visible way that the airplanes do, unless

65
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,280
it's a small country.

66
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,360
In the case of Denmark, you have the Maersk Corporation that is building

67
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,320
and operating enormous container ships, and at this point building the

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,410
biggest container ships in the world.

69
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,510
Now, that is, of course, of disproportionate importance to a small

70
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,680
economy like the Danish economy.

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,970
Norway is another example of a small country of only a few million people

72
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,290
that has a long maritime history.

73
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,700
There was one point not that far back when at any given moment, there were

74
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,630
30,000 Norwegian sailors at sea.

75
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,430
And the Norwegian fleet was ranked in the top 5 or 10 by tonnage.

76
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:41,200
So you can have a great impact on the image of a country and a substantial

77
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,370
economic benefit if it's a small country that has a substantial fleet

78
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,290
out there on the oceans.

79
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,140
As you say in the lecture, the IMO and the ICAO are failing to regulate the

80
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,800
pollution put out by these ships.

81
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,870
What could happen if this continues to go unregulated?

82
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,290
Well, the two major consequences of pollution that originates with ships

83
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,400
are global warming gases.

84
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,690
The global shipping fleet is contributing on the order of 2 or 3%

85
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,660
of all the global warming gases that are produced in the course of a year

86
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,690
on planet Earth.

87
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,410
The other sort of pollution are tiny particulates that come out of the

88
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,000
smokestacks--

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,480
many, many thousands, millions of tons in the course of a year.

90
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,860
And if this particular material is carried ashore--

91
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,060
and this will be especially harmful to people living along coastlines--

92
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,530
then there are thousands and thousands, according to the

93
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:53,820
epidemiologists, of people who are going to be dying of diseases caused

94
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,400
by very fine particulate matter that they breathe and that originated

95
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,560
coming out of the smokestack of a ship.

96
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,030
Why is this environmental pollution not more regulated than it is?

97
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,030
Global regulation is a very difficult business.

98
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,800
In order to regulate the discharge of ballast water--

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,870
to take an example--

100
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:29,510
would mean putting at least one observer on every ship and regulating

101
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:38,240
exactly how the ballast water was handled in this port or in that port.

102
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,600
The International Maritime Organization is not putting an

103
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,296
inspector on every ship out there.

104
00:07:45,296 --> 00:07:50,180
There is an assumption that the shipping companies are going to behave

105
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,590
responsibly.

106
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,350
That is not, of course, a safe assumption in every case.

107
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,130
And of course there's going to be behaviors that save money.

108
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,130
At the same time, they are polluting a marine environment.

109
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,800
In what ways does the section, transportation, connect to all of the

110
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,700
other topics in the course?

111
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,380
Well, there are a variety of ways in which transportation can be linked to

112
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,850
other topics in this course.

113
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:27,410
Labor is one example, where you have more than 1 million seafarers out

114
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,970
there at any given time and whose working

115
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,909
conditions are often dangerous.

116
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,580
They are far from home.

117
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,080
Their labor protections are not as good as they always should be.

118
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,610
And so there is one vulnerable population.

119
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:49,250
The second labor topic in the area of shipping is the ship breakers, which

120
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:56,000
is to say a large and very, very poor group of primarily men who work the

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,140
beaches of South Asia taking ships apart when it is time for them to be

122
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,810
dismantled.

123
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,020
The ship owner says, it is no longer sufficient for me to

124
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,030
operate this ship.

125
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:15,130
And so what they do is that they rev up the engines, and they run the ship

126
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:21,380
aground on a beach at high tide at the greatest speed they can manage.

127
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:30,630
And at that point, thousands of poor workers are going to be taking the

128
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:37,120
ship apart with welding torches and hammers and crowbars and some

129
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,770
surprisingly primitive equipment.

130
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:44,220
But when you have thousands of people working on a ship that's 700, 800, 900

131
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,470
feet long, eventually, they're going to take that ship apart.

132
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,180
And the owners--

133
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,770
who pay millions, by the way, for some of these ships that

134
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,300
come up on the beach--

135
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,250
are going to do very well by recycling, especially the steel.

136
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,640
There's enormous amounts of steel in a ship that's 800 feet long

137
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,080
or 1,000 feet long.

138
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,930
So they'll recycle the steel.

139
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,870
But they will also recover all sorts of other materials that went into the

140
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,360
construction of the ship.

141
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,390
And they'll do very well by selling this stuff on the recycling market in

142
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,280
their country.

143
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,110
It could be India or Bangladesh or Thailand.

144
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,640
