00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,010


1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,380
Tax avoidance by corporations can threaten the economic

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,570
viability of a nation.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,460
In 2011, the US Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, raised

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,390
what he called the basic question about whether it makes sense for us as

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,340
a country to allow certain businesses to choose whether they are treated as

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,700
corporations for tax purposes or not.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,300
It is not, he said, a fundamentally sustainable balance now.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,560
But there is more at stake here than simply balancing the national budget.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,425
The political economist Ronen Palan has pointed to the fundamental

10
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:44,370
ideological shift that occurs when the interests of the sovereign investor

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,140
are treated as more important than the goals of full employment and universal

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,870
welfare, when open market ideology is valued more than citizenship itself.

13
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,050
This shift, he says, is violent.

14
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,060
Its effects on the majority of the population in the world are violent.

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,720
And it is all too often advanced by violent means.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,880
But it is presented in technocratic, neutral language, the language of

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,060
market efficiency, equilibrium, and so on.

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,790
Shaxson makes the same point about the offshore global system made possible

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,640
by the global deregulation of banks and corporations.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,260
The damaging result, he says, is nothing less than a head-on assault on

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,160
New Deal principles in the US, on the foundations of social democracy in

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,340
Europe, and on democracy, accountability, and development in

23
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,930
vulnerable low-income countries across the world.

24
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,620


25
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,000
In other words, massive tax avoidance innovation are a prescription for

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,340
social injustice in societies around the world.

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,810
During the spring of 2013, observers of the offshore system could feel

28
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,510
change in the air.

29
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,020
Over the previous several years, the American government had been

30
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,340
pressuring Swiss banks to reveal the identities of tens of thousands of

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,850
American depositors who had been evading the federal taxes they owed to

32
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,700
the US Treasury.

33
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,060
This unrelenting pressure on Swiss banks succeeded.

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:28,070
In 2009, UBS handed over 4,450 client names to the US Department of Justice

35
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:34,810
and paid a fine of $780 million for having enabled US clients to evade

36
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,920
paying taxes on their Swiss deposits.

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,140
As of June, 2013, the Swiss government was considering a proposal to induce

38
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,020
banks to release even more client names and pay an enormous fine of up

39
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,840
to $10 billion to the US government, which they would eventually recover

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,090
from the banks.

41
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,920


42
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,630
This unequal contest between the US government and the Swiss banks was a

43
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,490
bilateral affair.

44
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,620
But now in 2013, a wider and deeper reaction against the offshore tax

45
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,690
haven system is underway.

46
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,490
In April, 2013, the International Consortium of Investigative

47
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:22,560
Journalists, a Washington-based group, released 2.5 million files documenting

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,610
the offshore bank accounts and shell companies of wealthy clients and tax

49
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,240
dodging corporations.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,370
This WikiLeaks-like action produced instant results.

51
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,720
The French president, Francois Hollande, ordered his entire cabinet

52
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,670
to reveal their net worth.

53
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,590
German officials said they were very gratified that many offshore accounts

54
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,240
set up by German banks would now be exposed.

55
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,950
Europe, The Economist magazine wryly observed, is

56
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,600
turning on its tax dodgers.

57
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,490


58
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,960
But any effective assault on the offshore tax haven system must be as

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,390
global in scope as the system itself.

60
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,670
Such an effort would require the resources and political will of

61
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,760
countries around the world.

62
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,710
In the meantime, there are laws and events that can move the reform

63
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,610
process along.

64
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,280
The European bailout for Cyprus, that ruined two banks filled with offshore

65
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,980
Russian money, sent a clear message that tax havens are not as safe as

66
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,660
they once were.

67
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,900
German tax authorities have acquired information about secret offshore bank

68
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,350
accounts by going onto the black market for this kind of data.

69
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,990
The US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act puts pressure on foreign financial

70
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,940
institutions to release information about their accounts held by their

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,570
American clients.

72
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,170
Singapore announced in 2013 it would make the laundering of profits from

73
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,470
tax evasion a crime.

74
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,290
In April, 2013, Luxembourg said its bank secrecy policy

75
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,060
would expire in 2015.

76
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,940
News about Starbucks' paltry tax payments to the British Exchequer

77
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,510
embarrassed Prime Minister David Cameron, who proceeded to formulate a

78
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,955
10-point plan to combat global tax evasion for the G8 meeting in Northern

79
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:21,390
Ireland in June of 2013.

80
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:27,700
We might note that in 2011 Cameron's coalition had passed a law that

81
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,450
excused UK-based corporations from paying tax on their offshore earnings,

82
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,650
an action one commentator called a corporate coup d'etat.

83
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,860
Before the G8 Summit, a British government briefing declared that tax

84
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,960
evasion and avoidance are issues whose time has come.

85
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,920
After years of abuse, people across the planet are

86
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,650
rightly calling for action.

87
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,280
Historically-informed observers noted that this ostensibly heartfelt

88
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,810
declaration had come from the government of a nation that had

89
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,450
organized history's greatest offshore tax haven empire.

90
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,290
According to the 2011 Financial Secrecy Index, if the entire British

91
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,890
network of secrecy jurisdictions were considered, it would easily be ranked

92
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,550
number one in the world.

93
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,990
The United States, another G8 member, is also a major tax haven.

94
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,350
For many years, the tiny state of Delaware has enjoyed legendary status

95
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:36,170
as the ultimate and unstigmatized tax shelter for corporations.

96
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:41,870
As of 2012, Delaware was home to almost a million corporate entities,

97
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,260
public and private.

98
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,250


99
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,870
Despite the actions against the global tax haven network, dismantling the

100
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,960
offshore tax shelter system faces serious obstacles.

101
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,650
Prior to the G8 Summit, Prime Minister Cameron managed to get all 10 of

102
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,910
Britain's Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies to sign on to a set

103
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,090
of core principles for the sharing of tax information.

104
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,230
Yet many of these offshore jurisdictions objected to even being

105
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,400
labeled as tax havens, even though this modest concession to reality was

106
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,940
already long overdue.

107
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,060
At the G8 Summit, the prime minister failed to persuade the leaders of

108
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:31,140
Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Russia to

109
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,400
endorse meaningful action against the tax havens.

110
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,430
Cameron was unable to get any G8 countries to support Britain's call

111
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,370
for registries of beneficial ownership of companies, it would be made public.

112
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,470
He could not get Russia and Germany to publish national action plans to

113
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,150
combat tax evasion.

114
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,650
And he failed to get the G8 leaders to agree that an agreement on automatic

115
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,090
exchange of tax information should be open immediately

116
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,600
to developing countries.

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,200


118
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,860
A G8 declaration, that called on global officialdom to fight the

119
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,310
scourge of tax evasion, rang hollow.

120
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,890
But what about the populations that have been most severely impacted by

121
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,400
the global offshore system that operates through legal trickery and

122
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,140
criminal theft?

123
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,280
According to the African Development Bank and Global Financial Integrity,

124
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,670
the combination of corruption and legal corporate accounting tricks,

125
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:38,100
occurring during the period 1980 to 2009, resulted in a net outflow from

126
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,299
Africa of up to $1.35 trillion.

127
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,480
Developing countries, according to Shaxson, lost up to $1 trillion

128
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,340
dollars in illicit financial outflows just in 2006.

129
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:59,520
That is $10 for every dollar of foreign aid flowing in.

130
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,740
Small wonder, many Africans see the globalization project as a form of

131
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,380
colonialism in disguise.

132
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,850


133
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,130
The G8 Summit of 2013 made its own small gesture toward recognizing what

134
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,540
globalization and its offshore system have done to Africans and the

135
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,230
countless impoverished inhabitants of other developing societies.

136
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,090
Prime Minister Cameron told his global audience that the G8 meeting had

137
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,720
produced a decorations that has the potential to rewrite the rules on tax

138
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,280
and transparency for the benefit of countries right across the world,

139
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,190
including the poorest countries in the world.

140
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,230
Perhaps, at some point, the poor countries might be allowed to

141
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,800
participate in a new G8 deal on the automatic exchange of tax information.

142
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,530
One obstacle the prime minister faced, he says, was misgivings about handing

143
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,210
over sensitive tax details to countries not deemed competent or

144
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,980
trustworthy enough to handle it with care.

145
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,160


146
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,660
Before the G8 and African Policy Group chaired by the former South African

147
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,150
President Thabo Mbeki had proposed three topics for the G8 agenda, a

148
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,180
global system of tax information sharing, the identification of the

149
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,750
real owners of bank accounts, and public reports by multinational

150
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,590
corporations about their tax payments in all of the countries in which they

151
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,060
conduct business.

152
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,270
It would be scandalous, the country director for ActionAid in Zambia said,

153
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,370
if the G8 tax deal excludes African and other developing countries from

154
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,390
access to tax haven information.

155
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:53,070
But as we've seen, no offer of this kind was made to the offshore systems'

156
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,025
primary victims in Africa.

157
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:57,980


158
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,250
The recalcitrance of the G8's white leadership, in the face of this

159
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,010
collegial approach from the black African delegation, recalled the old

160
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,060
imperial arrangement the offshore system has preserved.

161
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,040
To this day, Britain's financial elite makes big profits from the expired

162
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,120
empire's assortment of island statelets, such as Bermuda and the

163
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,300
Caymans, and a micro territory like Gibraltar.

164
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,310
This system, like the entirety of the offshore financial universe, will

165
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,830
fight hard against the prospect of its own demise, especially since it

166
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,910
retains the covert support of the very governments whose tax coffers the tax

167
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,180
havens deplete.

168
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,440
Time will tell whether public outrage over offshore tax evasion will

169
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,650
eventually force the hands of the Western politicians who have shown so

170
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,240
little interest in consigning the offshore system to

171
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,580
the dustbin of history.

172
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,960
