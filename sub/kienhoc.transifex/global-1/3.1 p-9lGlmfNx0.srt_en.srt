1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,680
Global transportation systems are the indispensable basis of economic

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,380
globalization.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,990
The first part of this section provides some basic information about

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,010
the world's largest ocean-going vessels that carry

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,360
different types of cargo.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,630
Approximately 90% of world trade is carried by ships.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,810
As of 2006, 7.4 billion tons of goods passed through the world's seaports.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,690
As of 2010, the volume of the world shipping trade exceeded 30 trillion

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,560
ton miles and was growing faster than the global economy as a whole.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,590
Estimates suggest there are about 100,000 large ships carrying cargo and

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,160
passengers on the oceans of our planet.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,880


13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,030
The three most important types of cargo ships are bulk carriers, oil and

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,260
natural gas tankers, and container ships.

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,870
The largest of these vessels are among the most massive, man-made structures

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,230
ever built.

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,560
The largest ship ever constructed, a supertanker referred to as the

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,020
ultra-large crude carrier Seawise Giant, displaced more than 260,000

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,880
tons and was 458 meters long.

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,030
It was, in other words, more than a quarter mile in length, longer than

21
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,280
the Empire State Building, too big to navigate the English Channel, and at

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,720
the time was considered the largest, self-propelled,

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,860
man-made object ever built.

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:39,150
The supertanker Pierre Guillaumat, at more than 274,000 tons, was even more

25
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,540
massive than the Seawise Giant.

26
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,780
This mammoth of the seas was 414 meters in length and too big to pass

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,130
through the Panama or the Suez canals.

28
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,630


29
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,860
Over the past four decades, container ships that carry thousands of

30
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,270
standardized, metal boxes filled with goods have driven the once-familiar

31
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,840
cargo freighter almost to the point of extinction.

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,180
As of today, the primary role of container ships is to move

33
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,700
manufactured products from China across the Pacific Ocean to ports

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,760
located on the West Coast of the United States.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,240
Then they sail, often empty, back to China to pick up the next 10,000 or

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,860
15,000 containers for the voyage back to California.

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,440
Walmart, the world's largest retailer, imported $30 billion worth of goods

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,050
from China in 2010, and this number is going up.

39
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,050
Walmart has ordered, and has exclusive use of, the world's

40
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,420
largest container ships.

41
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,300
These quarter-mile long, floating platforms, which can transport 15,000

42
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,110
containers per voyage, are built in Denmark by the Maersk Corporation.

43
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,840


44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,990
Maersk has now commissioned a new fleet of 20 even bigger container

45
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,410
ships that are being assembled in South Korea using components made in

46
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,210
China and elsewhere.

47
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,880
These enormous vessels are the result of what Maersk calls "a massive,

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,430
international effort" and will be able to carry 18,000

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,560
containers across the oceans.

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,070
They will be too big for most American ports to handle and will call on only

51
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:30,930
13 ports around the world, all of them located in Asia and northern Europe.

52
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,620
While these ships are too large even for the expanded Panama Canal, which

53
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,590
is scheduled to be ready for business in 2014, they will be able to navigate

54
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,290
the Suez Canal and will thereby save Maersk millions of

55
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,200
dollars in fuel costs.

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,230
Other fuel savings will come from an innovative hull design, smaller and

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,730
more energy-efficient engines, and a waste heat recovery system that

58
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,890
generates extra energy from moving the ship through the water.

59
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,970
The enormous dimensions of these vessels make ocean shipping the most

60
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,710
energy efficient type of long-distance transport.

61
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:14,060
Global merchant marine fuel oil consumption in 2007 amounted to 369

62
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,970
million tons or somewhere between 2% and 4% of the world's annual fossil

63
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,540
fuel consumption.

64
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,970
Still, there is an enormous difference between the fuel efficiencies of the

65
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,400
larger ships and the big cargo planes that are engaged in

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,370
transporting cargo.

67
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,590
The new Maersk container ships will transport a ton of cargo 368 times

68
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,370
more efficiently than a jumbo jet.

69
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,460
While this is an impressive number, it represents only one side of the

70
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,170
relationship between global transportation networks, energy

71
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,450
sources, and man-made effects on Earth's atmosphere.

72
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,990


73
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,780
Global transportation systems present us with an excellent opportunity to

74
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:05,020
study how one great planetary system intersects with other major systems

75
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,550
that, together, make up the globalization process.

76
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,840
In this sense, the global transportation networks can be seen as

77
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,630
interlocking parts of a world system.

78
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,500
Let us now look at how these transportation networks, the world's

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,070
natural environment, and the ability of global governance to enforce

80
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,180
universal regulations are related to each other.

81
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,280
One thing we will find is that the magnificent technological achievements

82
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,340
of marina engineering have global consequences, and that the entire

83
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,980
world community must deal with these consequences effectively.

84
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,980
Global transportation networks have profound impacts on a natural system,

85
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,920
the global environment, in two ways.

86
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,770
First, maritime ship traffic pollutes the air.

87
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,130
It was reported in 2009 that only 15 of the world's biggest ships produce

88
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:08,240
as much pollution as the world's 760 million cars.

89
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,130
The low-grade, ship bunker fuel used by an estimated 90,000 cargo ships

90
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,500
produces a huge volume of airborne particles that kill many thousands of

91
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,100
people around the world and inflict hundreds of billions of dollars a year

92
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,370
in health costs on coastal populations.

93
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,110
Just one of the world's largest ships generates more than 5,000 tons of

94
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,000
sulfur oxide gases every year, while a car produces only 100

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,300
grams of this pollutant.

96
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,140
Even the most technologically-advanced container ships consume dirty,

97
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,160
low-grade, bunker fuel that produces a tremendous amount of air pollution.

98
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,680
These emissions constitute between 15% and 30% of the world's

99
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,930
smog-forming pollution.

100
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,340


101
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,630
Another environmental problem due to world shipping is the transporting and

102
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,990
discharging by ships of ballast water that can contain many biological

103
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,520
materials, including plants, animals, viruses, and bacteria.

104
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,180
The introduction of invasive species and organisms into marine ecosystems

105
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,600
can cause serious ecological damage.

106
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,930
This process is the maritime equivalent of spreading dangerous

107
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,280
viruses around the world via intercontinental airline flights.

108
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,040
We should keep in mind that these biological invasions have been

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,760
underway since the great voyages of exploration that began in 1492 and

110
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,900
continued throughout the 16th century.

111
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,490
It is estimated that up to 5 billion tons of ballast water circulate around

112
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,070
the world each year.

113
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,160
Two technological solutions to the threat of aquatic, invasive species in

114
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,500
ballast water are the use of disinfectants and

115
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,095
microwave heating systems.

116
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:03,080


117
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,940
Like many other threats to the world's environment, the various forms of

118
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,130
ship-generated and ship-borne pollution require effective regulation

119
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,350
within the context of global governance.

120
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,100
The International Maritime Organization, or IMO, was founded in

121
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,250
1948 and currently has 170 member states.

122
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,830
In 1973, the IMO adopted the International Convention for the

123
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,990
Prevention of Pollution from Ships.

124
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,350
The problem is that the IMO's global governance has clearly failed to

125
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,880
prevent the enormous volume of pollution we have just described.

126
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,430
In fact, such failures of global governance are common.

127
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,510
We should also note that the failures of the IMO have occurred with the

128
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,850
cooperation, or one might say the collusion, of a membership that

129
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,410
includes most of the world's nation-states.

130
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,020
This disparity between the upbeat proclamations of official global

131
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,050
organizations and their failures to remedy real-world problems is a

132
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,260
chronic and disheartening aspect of global governance.

133
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,610
The strategic importance of global shipping is clearly illustrated by how

134
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,400
China has positioned itself within the maritime world.

135
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,180
As the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer, China must

136
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,990
maintain an enormous and secure system to transport cargo by sea.

137
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,570
Although it has ordered what will be the world's largest container ships

138
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,390
from a South Korean builder, it's China that is still the world's

139
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,760
leading shipbuilder by tonnage.

140
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,390
By weight, China built two fifths of the world's ships in 2012.

141
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,010
State-owned Chinese companies control one fifth of the

142
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,020
global container fleet.

143
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,120
The Chinese are building or investing in a large number of seaports around

144
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,010
the world, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Karachi, [? Carrais, ?]

145
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:10,020
Antwerp, Suez, Singapore, Togo, Djibouti, and Myanmar.

146
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,440
Indian officials regard what they call this "string of pearls" as a potential

147
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,540
threat to India's national security.

148
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,470
In 2012, China's state-controlled port building company had $12 billion in

149
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,220
orders for construction projects outside of China.

150
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,950


151
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:36,580
In 2013, it was reported that China was planning to invest $40 billion in

152
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,270
a canal across Nicaragua that would compete with the Panama Canal.

153
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:47,520
In summary, and to put the Chinese strategy in historical perspective,

154
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,220
just as the British Navy once guaranteed the shipping routes of the

155
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,180
East India Company, today, the expanding Chinese Navy provides

156
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,230
maritime security for the Chinese commercial fleet that now serves the

157
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,600
greatest exporting economy the world has ever known.

158
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,203
