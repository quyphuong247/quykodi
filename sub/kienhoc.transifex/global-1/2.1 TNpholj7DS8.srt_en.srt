00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040


1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,770
We can divide the history of globalization into three phases that

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,860
have elapsed over the past 500 years.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,950
Phase one begins in 1492, with the voyage of Christopher Columbus to the

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,930
new world, and continues with later European voyages of exploration that

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,500
eventually made possible the formation of Europe's colonial empires.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,700
Who were these explorers, and why were their voyages unlike passages across

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,170
oceans that were made during the prehistoric period, true forerunners

8
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,420
of what we call globalization?

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,680


10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,420
The Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, financed by the Spanish

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,010
crown, completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean that created a

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,590
European awareness of the North and South American continents.

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,220
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama was the first to lead a maritime

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,100
expedition to India in 1498.

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,280
The conquistador Hernan Cortes brought much of Mexico under Spanish control

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,770
in the early 16th century.

17
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,170
Ferdinand Magellan completed the first circumnavigation of the world between

18
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,650
1519 and 1522 in the service of King Charles I of Spain.

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,780
Sir Francis Drake achieved the second circumnavigation of the Earth in the

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,780
late 16th century, and played the role of a global buccaneer, carrying out

21
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,310
attacks and confiscating foreign treasures around world.

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,790
These adventurers were globalizers for three reasons.

23
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,600
First, they engaged in the state-sponsored acquisition of

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,880
strategically significant knowledge that enabled nations such as England

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,840
and Spain to establish colonial empires across the globe.

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,130
Second, they carried out state-sponsored expeditions to

27
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,480
confiscate wealth that could become the property of the state, thereby

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,760
anticipating future alliances between states and private companies.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,300
Third, state sponsorship of global trading monopolies was a foreshadowing

30
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,820
of state-sponsored national champion global corporations of the modern era.

31
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,270


32
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,160
The monopoly of trade granted to the East India Company by Queen Elizabeth

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,270
I in 1600 is a prime example of the state-corporate partnership that today

34
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,050
takes the form of the state capitalism practiced on the larger scale by

35
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,980
China, and by many other countries.

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,810
At the same time, the East India Company was the great progenitor of

37
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,360
the modern multinational corporation that benefits from the protections

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,940
provided by the nation state.

39
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,940
The limited liability it offered to its shareholders promoted the

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,490
development of investment capitalism by limiting the financial risk

41
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,965
undertaken by their investors.

42
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,910


43
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,870
Today's global economy confirms the importance of this showpiece

44
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,370
enterprise of the first phase of globalization.

45
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,010
State-controlled companies are thriving and have enormous influence

46
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,410
in emerging economies, such as those of China, Brazil, and India.

47
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,490
These state-owned enterprises can also become monopolies in their own right,

48
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:25,850
along the lines intended once upon a time by the imperial monarch of the

49
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,100
16th century.

50
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,258
