00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,110


1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,760
In the previous lecture, we were studying a global, and so far a very

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,940
one sided struggle for control over the internet.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,950
But American administrative hegemony over the internet is benign compared

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,550
to the hegemony of intelligence agencies, such as the American

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:24,870
National Security Agency, and the British GCHQ over global electronic

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,900
communications.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,860
Journalistic reports that began appearing in June 2013 described

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,270
electronic surveillance by American and British spying agencies on a scale

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,690
that caused widespread alarm in the United States, in the United Kingdom,

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,940
and in many other countries.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,390


12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,130
The NASA's PRISM operation mines the enormous amounts of data from the

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,600
giant online internet companies, like Facebook and Google.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,380
It's spies on the telephone and online activity of enormous numbers of both

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,580
Americans and others.

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,110
Two of the British spying projects are called Mastering the Internet and

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,970
Global Telecoms Exploitation.

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,470
These operations collect and analyze a huge volume of online

19
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,590
and telephone traffic.

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,680
The third, known as the Tempora Project, has collected a vast amount

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,150
of data from the tapping of the fiber optic cables that carry internet

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,520
traffic around the world.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,900
These revelations, provided by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, have

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,530
enlarged our sense of how we should see and evaluate the

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,880
internet and its potential.

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,060


27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,350
In June 2008, the head of the National Security Agency, Lieutenant General

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,740
Keith Alexander, was visiting a British intelligence gathering station

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,260
in Yorkshire, and articulated the core ambition of an

30
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,900
organization like the NSA.

31
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,910
"Why," he asked, "can't we collect all the signals all the time?"

32
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,670
This confession of a lust for omniscience led the Guardian newspaper

33
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,750
to comment, "the gravitational pull towards total surveillance is as

34
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:29,650
inevitable as it is secret." While American internet giants like Facebook

35
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,870
and Google ingest and store vast amounts of information about people

36
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,320
who have chosen to engage with these services, the fact remains that these

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,590
electronic operations are surveillance engines as well as commercial

38
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,550
enterprises.

39
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,610
Among the NSA revelations of June 2013 was the once secret partnership

40
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,720
between the commercial internet giants and the US intelligence establishment

41
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,470
that uses their treasure trove of data.

42
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:08,550
Both corporations and spy agencies practice data mining, the Analysis of

43
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,900
vast quantities of information in the search for patterns of activity that

44
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,760
might indicate suspicious or criminal behaviors.

45
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:26,090
In summary, the NSA, GCHQ combined operation exercises a hegemony over

46
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,140
global communications traffic that makes the powers of ICAN look almost

47
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,390
insignificant.

48
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,230


49
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:40,800
The NSA, GCHQ revelations raise the question whether people do want to

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,590
live in a world where the dominant intelligence agencies define and

51
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,090
enforce the limits of what all other citizens are allowed to know about the

52
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,080
mechanisms and misuses of political power.

53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,680
This is the totalitarian social universe of which the anti-NSA Edward

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,570
Snowden said, I do not want to live in a world where everything I say and do

55
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,300
is recorded.

56
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,750
Even in a democracy, a world run by and for intelligence agencies would

57
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,279
create an Orwellian soft terror of political intimidation, blackmail,

58
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,490
extortion, sadistic harassments, and a criminalization of investigative

59
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,225
journalism carried out by faceless and untraceable security bureaucrats.

60
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:34,900


61
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,810
These enormous and previously secret operations have now become part of the

62
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,660
global imaginary that shapes our view of what the global internet is, and

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,210
what it can become.

64
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,470
The world now knows, and to a far greater extent than was previously the

65
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,950
case, that the internet is, in fact, a surveillance engine, in addition to

66
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,790
its other roles.

67
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,060
Public knowledge of what governments are doing in cyberspace in secret has

68
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,720
turned out to depend on a very small number of people, such as Edward

69
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,440
Snowden and Julian Assange, the founder of the WikiLeaks website that

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,710
challenged the most powerful spy agencies in the world by releasing

71
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,550
online hundreds of thousands of secret communications

72
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,800
between government offices.

73
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,310


74
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,130
The whistleblower is, or has chosen to become the ultimate outsider from the

75
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,560
perspective of a national security state that claims an absolute mandate

76
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,890
to track the communications of the entire world in secret.

77
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,100
The making public of what governments regard as state secrets is the nation

78
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,950
state's version of a mortal sin, and states make every effort to track down

79
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,410
and punish these heretics.

80
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,720
Opinions will differ on whether these people are to be considered traitors,

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,745
or deluded narcissists, or citizen heroes.

82
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:04,440


83
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,180
On June 2, 2013, Julian Assange published a commentary in the New York

84
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,030
Times on Google's role in the expanding American

85
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,800
national security state.

86
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,710
Assange wrote this essay while holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in

87
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,720
London, a fugitive from Swedish justice and a target of American

88
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,400
prosecutors bent on retaliation for WikiLeaks' mass release of

89
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,270
confidential American government documents.

90
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,500
Only days before newspapers around the world began to publish the secret

91
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,560
materials made available to them by Edward Snowden, and before information

92
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,720
about the collaboration between the major American internet companies and

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,480
the NSA became known, Assange wrote of what he called the ever closer union

94
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,450
between the State Department and Silicon Valley.

95
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,510
Google, he claimed, had thrown its lot in with traditional Washington power

96
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,550
elements, from the State Department to the National Security Agency.

97
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,000
The advance of information technology epitomized by Google, he concluded,

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,980
heralds the death of privacy for most people, and shifts the world toward

99
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,230
authoritarianism.

100
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,160


101
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,320
We heard at the beginning of this course that systems and connectivity

102
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,320
are two of the primary characteristics of globalization.

103
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,820
The internet that now functions as a surveillance machine is an ultimate

104
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,740
version of a system that promotes connectivity.

105
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,330
This state of connectedness is often identified with the presumed benefits

106
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,810
of cultural exchange or community cohesion.

107
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,100
It has a positive connotation.

108
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,660
But connectedness, as the secret and strategic use of the internet shows,

109
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,240
can also be synonymous with invasion of privacy, and a potential for

110
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,400
political intimidation of those who are spied upon.

111
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,290
The great power approach to public knowledge of its secret operations, or

112
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:16,800
security, claims a right to absolute authority on a global scale.

113
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,820
Regarding the fugitive Edward Snowden, one Republican senator said, "I hope

114
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,580
we'll chase him to the ends of the Earth," and he warned the Russians

115
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,180
that their handling of Snowden was related to their membership in the

116
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,299
world community.

117
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,140
The exile of the whistleblower, or traitorous, as some might say, is

118
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,510
imagined as a total condition that is made possible by the global hegemony

119
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,850
of the great power.

120
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,340
The NSA revelations of June 2013 make it clear that the internet can

121
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:58,030
function as an instrument of that kind of global hegemony.

122
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,980
We should also note that the claim to absolute and global jurisdiction has

123
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,660
also been made by a prominent supporter of Edward Snowden, was also

124
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,040
an adviser to WikiLeaks.

125
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,540
Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish judge who in 1998 issued an international arrest

126
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,450
warrant for the former Chilean president, General Augusto Pinochet on

127
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,370
charges of torture and murder said, "what is being done to Mr. Snowden and

128
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,700
to Mr. Julian Assange for making disclosures in the public interest is

129
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,890
an assault against the people."

130
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:42,860
From their opposing perspectives, the national security state and the global

131
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,520
information activists see the world as a single and unified jurisdiction

132
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:54,730
inside of which only one of two absolute standards must prevail.

133
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,940
The world is either a hunting ground, or it is a sanctuary for the

134
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,070
dissidents who defy great power claims about their need to practice total

135
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,470
secrecy on behalf of maximum security.

136
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,825
