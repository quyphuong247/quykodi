00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030


1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:06,340
The third phase of globalization that began in 1945 was made possible by the

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,920
long economic expansion that followed the end of the Second World War.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,280
New global economic reforms agreed upon by the United States and its

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,120
wartime allies in 1944 provided a new framework for international commerce

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,620
and finance.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,760
The period from the late 1940s to the early 1970s has been called the Golden

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,910
Age of Capitalism, this new global economic order, aimed at preventing a

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,100
return of the catastrophic economic conditions that had brought on the

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,470
Great Depression of the 1930s.

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,740
The political implications of this new global economic order

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,560
were and remain profound.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,520
This international arrangement called for close cooperation between

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,910
nation-states, as opposed to the destructive economic competitions

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,160
between nations of the 1930s.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,220
New international financial agreements and institutions, such as the

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,280
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, provided a new kind of

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,650
global financial stability.

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,640
States were empowered to set their own economic policies, including setting

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,120
levels of taxation that were very high by today's standards.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,170
States had the power to tightly regulate capital flows across national

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,020
borders, thereby limiting the potentially destructive influence of

22
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,720
foreign speculative investors.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,860
Far more than is the case today, politicians were able to maintain a

24
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,860
significant degree of control over the banking sector.

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,420
Today, by contrast, the banking sector has demonstrated that it has the power

26
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,170
to challenge the economic authority of nation-states to an

27
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,420
unprecedented degree.

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,210


29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,660
Finally, this new global economic arrangement made possible the

30
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,940
expansion of the welfare state and the protections it provides to the

31
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,539
economically vulnerable as well as to more financially secure citizens who

32
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,470
may face illness or unemployment.

33
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,600
The expansion of the welfare state has been made possible by government

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,740
regulation that created a balance of power between governments, large

35
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,100
corporations, and the financial sector.

36
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,560
This strategic balance allowed governments to create social

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,520
arrangements, such as the advanced welfare state.

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,590


39
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,160
The Golden Age of Capitalism ended during the early 1970s.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,500
It has been succeeded by slower growth and a series of global financial

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,850
crises related to the triumph of neoliberal market globalism.

42
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,780
This political and economic arrangement is based upon a

43
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,090
deregulation of the corporate sector, the privatization of public

44
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,960
enterprises and institutions, tax reductions for businesses and

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,060
individuals, the setting of limits on the powers of labor unions, reducing

46
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,960
the role of government in the formulation of social policies, and

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,530
deregulating capital flows in the new global investment markets.

48
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,870
These developments have coincided with the flourishing of unregulated

49
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,030
offshore financial institutions and shell company strategies, some of them

50
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,970
legal, others illegal, they have facilitated massive tax evasion by the

51
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,420
rich and embezzlement from the poor.

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,310
These financial schemes retard social development in developed and

53
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,760
undeveloped countries alike by removing trillions of dollars from the

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,645
societies that need them to promote social development.

55
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:49,330


56
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,510
Post-war globalization after 1945 has also produced a global political

57
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,410
dimension apart from the political forces that have

58
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,850
promoted neoliberal policies.

59
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,380
The founding in 1945 of the United Nations, the successor to the League

60
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,080
of Nations that had failed during the 1930s, marked a renewal of the

61
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,730
idealistic internationalism that flourished prior to

62
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,710
the first World War.

63
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,610
The United Nations embodies hopes for effective global governance and

64
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,610
regulations that remain largely unfulfilled.

65
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,620
The emergence during the postwar period of many Non-Governmental

66
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,770
Organizations, or NGOs, has been a response to the limitations of

67
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,870
international institutions, such as the United Nations.

68
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,440
NGOs also respond to the fact that many nation-states are unwilling or

69
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,220
unable to formulate or carry out a variety of important humanitarian and

70
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,490
environmental projects.

71
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,710
For this reason, the globalization of our own era includes NGOs, such as

72
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,630
Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Transparency

73
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,510
International, and Greenpeace, among many others.

74
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,340
NGOs are modern examples of idealistic internationalism, and their missions

75
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,630
remind us that today's globalization can be defined to include global

76
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,620
responsibilities to poor and vulnerable people as well as to the

77
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,480
endangered planet we all inhabit.

78
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,803
