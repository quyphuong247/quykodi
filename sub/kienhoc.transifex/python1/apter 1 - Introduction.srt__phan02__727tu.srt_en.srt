95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,890
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs
supposed to do.

96
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,010
And sometimes you're
running a program

97
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,010
like Moodle-- an open source
learning management system,

98
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,029
or Sakai-- another open source
learning management system.

99
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,480
And sometimes, you'll even
get paid to do that, right?

100
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,560
Sometimes do it for free,
sometimes you get paid.

101
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,495
Sometimes, you write
things for yourself.

102
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:30,390

103
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,900
But if you think about
it, all these applications

104
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,635
on my iPhone, somebody's
making some money off of these.

105
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,260
They may not be able
to quit their job,

106
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,800
but a surprising number have
been able to quit their job

107
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,240
or start small companies.

108
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,480
Maybe not gigantic companies
but small companies.

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,080
So these people that can
put applications inside

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,630
of our computers
are programmers.

111
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,760
Because they understand
the way that we

112
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,230
talk to these computers.

113
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,050
And part what I'm
going to try to do

114
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,500
is to get you to move from the
mindset of the end user, who

115
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,080
thinks of this as
something just to click on,

116
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,840
to the mindset of
the programmer, who's

117
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,790
kind of on the inside
trying to get out to you.

118
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,380
So that's, as we move
from user to programmer,

119
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,210
we move from outside to inside.

120
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,711
And we think of the
world out there,

121
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,501
and it's like, what
are they going to push?

122
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,190
What button are
they going to push?

123
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,960
So here's kind of
a picture of that.

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,400
So on the outside, we're users.

125
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,430
We click on buttons,
we click on websites,

126
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,810
we click on buttons on our
phones, et cetera, et cetera.

127
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,840
But what's really going
on inside of all that is

128
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,430
there's a computer with a bunch
of hardware inside of that.

129
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,020
And it has inside of it data,
networks, other information,

130
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,720
and software-- is what
makes all that make sense.

131
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,670
And so, part of what
I want you to do

132
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,610
is I want you to stop
thinking about how

133
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,600
to use these things
from the outside

134
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,490
and we move to
becoming a programmer.

135
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,770
We're someone on the inside.

136
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,510
We are with the CPU,
we are with the memory,

137
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,480
we are with the
network connection,

138
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,760
we are doing things
on behalf of the user

139
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,940
and presenting them
back up to the user.

140
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,700
So why be a programmer?

141
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,977
Now, this class is
specifically not

142
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:13,060
trying to turn you into a
professional programmer.

143
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,805
Even though I'd be very proud
if after five, ten more classes,

144
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:18,180
you were professional
programmer,

145
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,544
but that's not the
purpose of this class.

146
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,460
Sometimes you just want
to get something done.

147
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,480
You've got an Excel
spreadsheet at work,

148
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,000
and the data is not right.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,610
You've got the data
from somebody else

150
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,160
and it's got extra
spaces where it shouldn't

151
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,584
have it or missing fields.

152
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,250
Or something, you've
got to do something

153
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,210
to it that Excel can't do.

154
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,960
And you're stuck saying I
want to mess with this data

155
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,620
and put in Excel
so I can do my job,

156
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,036
but it's a pain in the neck
and I have to sit and bring it

157
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,050
into a text editor
like Microsoft Word

158
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,250
and go line by line and
make all kinds of mistakes

159
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,650
and clean the data up.

160
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,210
You can write a
program to do that.

161
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,126
And that's kind of
programs we're going to do.

162
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,600
Programs that serve our
needs inside the computer,

163
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,950
but to serve our needs.

164
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,470
Professional programmers tend
to build things for other people

165
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,729
to use, right?

166
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,770
They tend to build things
and everyone else does.

167
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,510
But we're going to build
stuff primarily for ourselves.

168
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,940
So, what is code?

169
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,730
What is software?

170
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,760
We use these words pretty much
independently-- a program.

171
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,630
It's really a sequence
of stored instructions.

172
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,420
We learn the language
that this talks,

173
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,220
and then we will feed the
instructions in, one at a time.

174
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,640
It takes them one at a time,
it gives us back a result,

175
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,010
we give a next one.

176
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,089
Give it back, in out, in out.

177
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:32,130
So it's really a sequence
of stored instructions.

178
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,000
But it's more than that.

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,175
It's like our creativity.

180
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:39,050
And if you've been using
some of my software,

181
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,090
like my MOOC software.

182
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,090
I spent about a month
writing all that stuff.

183
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,140
And it's like, it's me.

184
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,120
It's my vision of how cool
stuff ought to work, right?

185
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,586
And so, it's more than just
getting something done.

186
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,960
It's also a sense of pride
and a sense of accomplishment.

187
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,250
Especially if you're
giving something

188
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,710
that other people
can make use of.
