designed to be easy to use.

566
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,616
Can anyone guess what the reason
for the Python language name

567
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:42,115
is?

568
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:54,290

569
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,210
So, let's see.

570
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,540

571
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,570
Python was named after
a famous British comedy

572
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,330
show that was in the '60s
and '70s and '80s I think,

573
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,360
named Monty Python.

574
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,320
Monty Python's Flying Circus.

575
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,160
And so, I think he
was trying to capture

576
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,780
a playfulness, a certain kind
of silly, fun aspect of Python.

577
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,075
And, so there we go.

578
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:22,700
Enough of that.

579
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,220
We done?

580
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,720
Yeah.

581
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,075
OK, the music's done now.

582
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:26,490
Thank Heaven for that.

583
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,890
OK.

584
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,770
So again, this is a language.

585
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,920
And this Guido,
he made it for us.

586
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,850
He made choices.

587
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,560
He said, we're going
to put a colon here,

588
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,527
and I think we should,
like, indent this

589
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:38,360
and do these things.

590
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,720
And he's made choices.

591
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,710
And some languages, people
like some different,

592
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,750
or better than others.

593
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,440
It's kind of an artistic choice.

594
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,270
And I like to equate this to
learning a language to speak

595
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,697
with people, with humans

596
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:58,530
When we're a baby, we
don't know how to talk

597
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,190
and we start babbling--
baba blah blah blah blah.

598
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,710
Maybe we even just start
crying is first thing we do.

599
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,970
But we're on this
strange planet.

600
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,776
We've got to talk to this thing.

601
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,150
So we have to
learn its language.

602
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,090
And we're not going to
learn it right away.

603
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,806
You don't go like,
hey, study all night

604
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:15,930
and you know this language.

605
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,480
There's no way you can do that.

606
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,980
Although.

607
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,271
Rosetta Stone might be a good
way to teach programming.

608
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:22,335
Maybe I should take
some of their ideas.

609
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:25,200

610
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,820
So, the thing that's
different about learning

611
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,340
a human language versus
learning a programming language,

612
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,750
is that when we're
learning a human language,

613
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,390
we're talking to a
human and they're

614
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,640
going to do correction for us.

615
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,251
So, if I say a word
incorrectly like, [SLURS WORD].

616
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:43,750
Right?

617
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,294
I don't know, that
was pretty dumb.

618
00:26:45,294 --> 00:26:47,460
Someone listening will say,
oh, I know what he said,

619
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,380
I know what he said.

620
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,140
But Python and computers
aren't really listening.

621
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,240
They're kind of dumb.

622
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,590
They can't really correct our
mistakes for us because they

623
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,220
don't know what we're trying
to say; they really don't.

624
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,450
They're very literal.

625
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:11,630
And so, it is really common
in the beginning to get upset.

626
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,060
Because we say something we
think it's cute, and it says,

627
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,600
syntax error.

628
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,140
And we go like, OK,
let me try this--

629
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,754
and it says syntax error.

630
00:27:21,754 --> 00:27:23,920
And so, we get this notion--
I had this problem when

631
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,270
I was first programming.

632
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,830
I would like, here's my
program, do you like it?

633
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,240
And it would say, syntax error.

634
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,060
Now, the problem is they could
reword the messages to be

635
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,820
a little nicer, perhaps.

636
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,280
But the syntax error isn't
really a judgment on you

637
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,860
that says you're a failure.

638
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,170
The syntax error
is really saying,

639
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,570
I don't know what you're
saying, I'm confused,

640
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,380
I only know a few things,
and what you just said

641
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,570
is not something I understand.

642
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,600
So instead of thinking of
the program, the Python,

643
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,090
as some kind of evil, demonic
monster that just hates

644
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,640
you and just keeps
saying, syntax error--

645
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,580
think of Python more like a dog.

646
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,850
Right?

647
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,840
Can you talk to a dog?

648
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,220
Can you say, lovely sunset
we're having, to a dog.

649
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,490
Because dog's not going
to understand that.

650
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:21,920
The dog does understand some
things like, food, bath, walk.

651
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,260
But it doesn't understand
the accumulated works

652
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,900
of Shakespeare.

653
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,640
So when you talk
to a dog, you got

654
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,960
to be careful to talk the
subset of the vocabulary

655
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,320
that the dog knows.

656
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,030
And so, this is a key thing,
when you're first learning,

657
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,690
there's only certain set of
things that Python understands.

658
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,970
It turns out, it's
easier to teach you
