00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,360

OK.

287
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,170
And so let's sort of
take a look at this.

288
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,510
And so we start with are
there any parentheses?

289
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,540
And the answer is no.

290
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,680
There are no parentheses.

291
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,710
So let's go next.

292
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,080
Power.

293
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,700
And so the power says,
OK, let's look across

294
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,030
and find those things that
are raised to a power.

295
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:17,350
And the 2 cubed, or 2 the
third power, is the power.

296
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,060
So we're going to do that one.

297
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,030
And then the way
I do it when I'm

298
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,150
sort of doing these
slowly is I rewrite it.

299
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,960
So the 2 to the third
power becomes 8.

300
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,690
So it's 1 plus 8 over 4 times 5.

301
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,190
And then now we can say, power?

302
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,727
That's taken care of.

303
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:33,810
Now we're going to do
multiplication and division.

304
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,570
And we go across.

305
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,660
Now we have both a division
and a multiplication.

306
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,140
And multiplication and division
are done at the same time.

307
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,750
So that means we
do left to right,

308
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,880
which means we do the first
one that we encounter first.

309
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:52,580
So that will be 8 over 4,
because of the left to right

310
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,440
rule.

311
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
And so we find that one.

312
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,900
And that's the one that
gets computed next.

313
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,490
And that turns into two.

314
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,850
And again, I like to rewrite
these expressions just

315
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,779
to keep my brain
really, really clear.

316
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,570
After a while, you just
do it in your head.

317
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,452
But I rewrite them.

318
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:08,160
When I was first
learning them, at least,

319
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,250
I rewrote it all the time.

320
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,110

321
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,560
And so next, looking at this,
there's a multiplication.

322
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,220
We're not done with
multiplication yet.

323
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,040
So the 2 over 5
is the next thing.

324
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,580
And then we do that calculation,
and that becomes 10.

325
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,890
And again, we rewrite it.

326
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,020
And now we've done
the multiplication.

327
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,730
And we're going to
do addition next.

328
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,820
And that's just 1 over 10.

329
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,940
And that becomes 11.

330
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,560
And so basically,
this big long thing

331
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,700
through a series of
successive steps becomes 11.

332
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,725
And indeed, when we print
it out, that's what we get.

333
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,840

334
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,820
So there's the rules that
are parentheses, power,

335
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,470
multiplication, addition,
and then left to right.

336
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,750
But smart people usually
just put parentheses in.

337
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,850
So here's an example.

338
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,790
Go back, go back.

339
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,370
Here's an exam question.

340
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,050
Now, I wouldn't write
this code this way.

341
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,330
I would put a parenthese here.

342
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,860
And a parenthese there.

343
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,194
It's the same thing.

344
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:18,610
Because that's exactly-- the
2 times 3 is going to happen.

345
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,390
And the 4 over 5
is going to happen.

346
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,150
And then the plus and minus
will happen left to right.

347
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,880
But why not make it
easier on your readers

348
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
and just put the parentheses in?

349
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,323
Because they're redundant.

350
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,140
They're not necessary.

351
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,520
But away you go.

352
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,082
Now if you don't
want it to happen

353
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:36,540
in that order, of course, then
you have to put parentheses.

354
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,180
If you want the
addition to happen

355
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,040
before the multiplication, then
you have to put parentheses in,

356
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,180
which you can.

357
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,520
But we tend to recommended that
you use more parentheses rather

358
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,810
than less parentheses.

359
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,610
Now Python integer
division in Python 2,

360
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,130
which we are using
Python 2 for this class--

361
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,400
there's a new Python 3
that the world is slowly

362
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,490
transitioning to.

363
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,600
And a lot of people are
using it and teaching,

364
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,630
but it's not as common
sort of in the real world

365
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,349
with libraries and utilities.

366
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,099
And so we'll stick with
Python 2 for a few more years

367
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,876
until Python 3 really
kind of turns the corner.

368
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:16,000
It's nice to have it there.

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,420
But there's so much Python.

370
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,690
And it's so popular,
Python 2, that it's just

371
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,260
kind of hard to get
everybody up to Python 3.

372
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,184
So in Python 2, integer
division truncates.

373
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:31,376
And you saw that before,
where I did the 5,280 by 1,000

374
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,769
and I got 5.

375
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,310
But we can look at a couple of
examples that make this really

376
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,990
very quite clear.

377
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,060
So 10 divided by 2 is
5, as you would expect.

378
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,650
9 divided by 2 is 4, not
exactly what you'd expect.

379
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,470
You kind of expect that
to be 4.5 instead of four.

380
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,860
But in Python 3, it will be 4.5.
