189
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,580
https://youtu.be/UR6a_wZ8ido
done other than caret and
dollar sign for the end of line

190
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,780
is the wild card characters.

191
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,580
And so we use cards
possibly in like DOS

192
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,600
where we can use
question mark or star in

193
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,020
like a dir command or
dir dot star dot star

194
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,105
if you're familiar with that
or even a Unix command like ls,

195
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,890
you know, star dot whatever.

196
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,730
This is not how regular
expressions work.

197
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,890
And the problem is
that dot, dot is--

198
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,039
it matches a single character
in regular expressions.

199
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,570
Asterisk means any
number of times.

200
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,280
So if I look at this
and color code this

201
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,970
to make a little
more sense, the caret

202
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,201
is actually kind of part of the
regular expression programming

203
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:55,700
language.

204
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,930
Says, I'm a virtual character
matching the beginning of line.

205
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,630
The x is a real character.

206
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,040
The dot is part of the
regular programming

207
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,610
language-- any character.

208
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,990
Star is part of the regular
expression programming that

209
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,520
says the immediate previous
character many times s--

210
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,310
0 or more times.

211
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,840
And then colon
matches the colon.

212
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,820
And so if you look
at lines, these

213
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,950
are the kinds of lines that
will give me a true because they

214
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,850
start with an x followed by some
number of characters followed

215
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,860
by colon.

216
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,910
So that's true.

217
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,630
Start with x followed by
some number of characters

218
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,240
followed by colon.

219
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,150
OK, and so that's
basically how this works.

220
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:40,980
And so this five
character string,

221
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,900
there are-- some of these
things are like instructions

222
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,480
and some of them are the actual
characters were looking for.

223
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,650
So the x and the colon are the
characters we're looking for

224
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:55,270
and the caret, dot, and
star are programming, right?

225
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:00,000
They are logic that we're
adding to the string.

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,520
OK, so let's say for example
you're-- part of any of these

227
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,910
things and part of the stuff
we've done so far has to assume

228
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,427
that the data is some
level of being clean.

229
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:12,260
And so the data that
I've been giving you in

230
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,620
boxed up TXT is
not inconsistent.

231
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,930
It doesn't have, like,
too much weirdness in it.

232
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,309
I'm not trying to trick
you and mislead you

233
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:22,850
although we had situations where
you sort of get a trace back

234
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,710
because you think there's
going to be five words.

235
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,150
You grab a line, you break it,
and there's only two words.

236
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,775
And you get a trace
back because you're

237
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:32,720
looking at the fifth word
or something like that.

238
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,310
But if your data is less
clean or even if you just

239
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,840
want to be real careful, you
can fine tune your matching.

240
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,570
So here's that same match.

241
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,790
Give me a character x followed
by any number of characters

242
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,857
followed by a colon.

243
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:48,190
And that's what I'm looking for.

244
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,050
Give me lines that
match that pattern.

245
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,230
So this x starts at any
number of characters.

246
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,970
Colon, great.

247
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,304
That's any number of
characters-- great.

248
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:56,720
Oh wait, and there's
an email that

249
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,030
says x plane is two weeks
behind schedule colon two weeks.

250
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,240
Well, the regular
expression didn't

251
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,766
know that dash made
sense to you and you just

252
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,890
assumed that everything
that started with a capital

253
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,470
x had a dash after it.

254
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,750
So x is what it starts with--
any number of any character--

255
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,030
and then a colon.

256
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,460
So this becomes true.

257
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,470
This may not make you happy.

258
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,290
It may not be what
you're looking

259
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,640
for because you haven't
been specific enough

260
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,260
in your regular expression.

261
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,540
So we can be more specific
in our regular expression.

262
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,330
So for example, this is a more
specific regular expression.

263
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,820
It still says start with an
x as the first character,

264
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,230
then a dash-- that's
a real character,

265
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,615
not a-- then this next thing,
instead of being a dot,

266
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:49,526
it's backslash capital
S. It's on the sheet.

267
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:51,530
Oh, it's not on the sheet.

268
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,370
I lost the sheet.

269
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,974
Come back, sheet.

270
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,125
I lost the sheet.

271
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,850
I can't live without my sheet.

272
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,430
Backslash capital S means
a non-whitespace character.

273
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,010
So that means
spaces won't match.

274
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,910
And then I change
the asterisk zero

275
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,400
or more times thing to a plus.

276
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,350
And that means
one or more times.

277
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,800
Here's a character, a
non-whitespace-- these two

278
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,050
things kind of work together--
a non-whitespace character

279
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,450
at least one time as many
as we like and then a colon.

280
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,710
So if we look here,
it starts with x

281
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,960
dash any number of
non-whitespace characters

282
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,710
and ends in colon--
starts with x dash
