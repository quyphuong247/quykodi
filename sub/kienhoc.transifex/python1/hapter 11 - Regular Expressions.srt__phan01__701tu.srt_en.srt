Hello and welcome to chapter
11, regular expressions

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,470
from the book Python
for Informatics,

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,650
Exploring Information.

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,420
that you're watching or
listening to right now.

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,080

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,860
So regular expressions
are an interesting thing.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,240
You've seen from the
chapters up til now,

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,850
I've had a singular focus
on pulling information out

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,520
of data.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,850
Raw data, this mailbox
file that perhaps you're

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,150
getting tired of already.

15
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,650
But it's a lot of
fun, because I can

16
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,884
have you go look for
something and pick it out

17
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:39,550
and you're doing
something that would be

18
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,350
really painful to do by hand.

19
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,892

20
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:47,100
And while it's not all about
computing, there's games

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,420
and there's things like
weather computations

22
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,180
that do calculations,
pulling extracting data out

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,700
is a big part of computing.

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,090
And so there's actually
a library that's

25
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,340
built specifically do this.

26
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,700
And if you start doing
a few finds and slicing,

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,000
it gets long after a while.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,500

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,600
Like split, for example,
really saved us a lot of time.

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,160
But sometimes, the data
that you're looking for

31
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,550
is a little more
sophisticated than broken

32
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,130
into spaces or colons
or something like that.

33
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,110
And you just want to tell
something to go find,

34
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,260
I see what I want
and I see where

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,920
it's embedded in the
string, go get it for me.

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,720
And regular expressions are
themselves a programming

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,220
language.

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,810
They're like a really smart
wild card for searching.

39
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,590
So we've used wild cards in
various things in search.

40
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,960
But they are a really smart
version of a wild card.

41
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,320
And so regular expressions
are quite powerful.

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,700
And they're very cryptic.

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,325
And as a matter of
fact, you don't even

44
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,870
need to learn them if you
don't feel like it, right?

45
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,470
I've got this little guide.

46
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,070
I need a guide for myself
when I do regular expressions.

47
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,067
It sometimes takes
me a few minutes

48
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,400
to write a regular expression
to do exactly what I want.

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,890
So in a way, writing
a regular expression

50
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,370
is like writing a program.

51
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,350
It's highly specialized to
searching and extracting data

52
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,419
from strings, but it's
like writing a program.

53
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,960
And it takes a while
to get it right.

54
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,380
And you have to change this,
what about a slash there.

55
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,130
But they actually are fun.

56
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,750
And they're a great way
to exchange little program

57
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,960
snippets to say, oh yeah,
I'm looking for this.

58
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,230
Oh, here's a little reg
expression you might try.

59
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,650
So they're like
programs themselves.

60
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,970
It is this language
of marker characters.

61
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,650
So when we look for
regular expressions,

62
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,390
some characters like
ABC, have meaning as ABC.

63
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,476
But some characters, like
carrot or dollar sign

64
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:42,850
mean the beginning of the line
or at the end of the line.

65
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,330
And so we encode, in this
string, a program, basically.

66
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,180
So it's a rather
old school language.

67
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,630
It's from a long time.

68
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,790
It predates Python, which
is over 20 years old.

69
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,630
It also marks you as
a little cool, right?

70
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,810
It's a distinct marking that
makes it so that you know

71
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,510
something other people don't.

72
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,370
So you can know how to program.

73
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,578
But if you know regular
expressions, they'll be like,

74
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:13,360
whoa, I tried to look at
those and they're tough.

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,990
In a way, knowing regular
expressions is like a tattoo.

76
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,450
So it's casual Friday.

77
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,200
And that's why I'm
wearing a t-shirt today

78
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,660
and so I figured I would
come in today in a t-shirt.

79
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,160
But seeing as how
it's the first I'm

80
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,618
wearing a short
sleeved shirt, it's

81
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:29,580
also first time I can show
you my real tattoo here.

82
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,340
So here's my real tattoo.

83
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,700
And in the middle is the
Sakai, the open source

84
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,150
learning manager system,
always close to my heart.

85
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,810
And then you have
the IMS logo, which

86
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,260
is IMS Learning Tools
and Operability, which

87
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,190
is a standard that
means a lot to me.

88
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,740
Blackboard, OLAT, Learning
Objects, Angel, Moodle,

89
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,920
Instructure, Jenzabar,
and Desire2Learn.

90
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,670
I call this the
ring of compliance.

91
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,280
Because these are all of the
first six or seven learning

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,930
management systems that complied
with the IMS Learning Tools

93
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,070
Interoperability Standard
and Specification,

94
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,220
which is something that I spent
a lot of my life making work.
