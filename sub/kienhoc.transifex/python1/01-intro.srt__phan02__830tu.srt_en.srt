We're with the CPU, we are with the
memory.

93
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,370
We are with the network connection.

94
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,600
We are doing things on behalf of the user,
and presenting them back up to the user.

95
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,580
So, why be a programmer?

96
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,850
Now, this class is specifically not trying
to turn you

97
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,650
into a professional programmer, even
though I'd be very proud

98
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,180
if after five, ten more classes you were a

99
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,530
professional programmer. But that's not the
purpose of this class.

100
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,320
Sometimes you just want to get something
done.

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,860
You got an Excel spreadsheet at work and
the data's not right.

102
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,750
You got the data from somebody else and
it's

103
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,240
got like extra spaces where it shouldn't
have it or

104
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,120
does missing fields or something, you gotta do
something to it that Excel can't do.

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,640
And you're, you're stuck, like, saying,
Aw, I

106
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,920
want to, I want to mess with this data and

107
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,620
put it in Excel so I can do my job, but
it's a pain in the neck.

108
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,960
And I have to sit and bring it into a text
editor like Microsoft Word

109
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,530
and go line by line and make all kinds of
mistakes and clean the data up.

110
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,960
You can write a program to do that,

111
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,320
and that's the kind of programs we're
going to do.

112
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,810
Programs that serve our needs inside the
computer, but to serve our needs.

113
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,690
Professional programmers tend to build
things for other people to use, right?

114
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,650
They, they tend to build things that
everyone else does.

115
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,480
But we're going to build stuff primarily
for ourselves.

116
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,720
So.

117
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,820
What is code?

118
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,570
What is software?

119
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,660
We use these words pretty much
independently, a program.

120
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,530
It's really a sequence of stored
instructions.

121
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,790
We learn the language that this talks, and
then

122
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,110
we will feed the instructions in, one at a
time.

123
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,720
It takes them one at a time, it gives us
back a result, we give it the next one.

124
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,020
It gives it back, in, out, in, out.

125
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,030
So it's really a sequence of stored
instructions.

126
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,890
But it's kind of more than that.

127
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,290
It's, it's sort of like our creativity,
and if you've been using some of

128
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,040
my software, like my MOOC software, I

129
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,980
spent about a month writing all that
stuff.

130
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,700
And it's like, it's me.

131
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,070
I mean I'm, it's my vision of how cool
stuff ought to work, right?

132
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,380
And so it's more than just getting
something done.

133
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,930
It's also a sense of pride and a sense of
accomplishment.

134
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,580
Especially if you're giving something that
other people can make use of.

135
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,090
It's really, I think it's very creative.

136
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,580
And it's what attracted me to being a
programmer in the first place.

137
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,230
It's that I could, I could leverage the
abilities inside of here,

138
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,790
and I could do things, cool things, on
behalf of the user.

139
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,570
So, code, software, a program.

140
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,720
So, let's get a non-technical example of
this.

141
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,880
So, I'll have you link out to the YouTube
[COUGH] for this.

142
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,170
This is the Macarena.

143
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,700
The Macarena is a song that

144
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,750
has with it a well-known dance that
everyone

145
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,730
seems to know, or either get taught very
quickly.

146
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,993
So I'll, I'll stop and let you watch the
Macarena, and then come back.

147
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:22,016
[BLANK_AUDIO]

148
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:23,590
So welcome back.

149
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,680
I hope you enjoyed that.

150
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,600
In a sense what we've got there is

151
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,580
a program.

152
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,830
A program for human beings.

153
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,749
And, maybe you learned that at a club or

154
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:36,160
something, and they told you what to do
next.

155
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,740
Well, I can teach you how to do

156
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,160
the Macarena by writing a simple program
right now.

157
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,210
So here's my Macarena.

158
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,990
While the music plays, means you do it
over and over

159
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,570
and over again, to the beat, that's kind
of like computers.

160
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,620
They do things in a beat.

161
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,000
They happen to have three billion beats a
second.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,300
But as it were, so we're going to do this
multiple times so

163
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,180
we have this whole group of instructions
that we're going to do, right?

164
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:05,130
Left hand out and up, right hand out and
up, flip left hand, flip right hand, left

165
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:11,960
hand to right shoulder, right hand to left
shoulder, et cetera, et cetera.

166
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,170
Now this particular little program has a
mistake in it.

167
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,350
Actually several.

168
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,141
I want you to look and see if you can find
the mistakes in the program.

169
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:29,093
[BLANK_AUDIO]

170
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,480
So here are the places that have the
mistake.

172
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,040
Right?

173
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,850
The mistake is

174
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:43,910
right ham to the back of the head, and
left hand to right hit, not hip.

175
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,790
Now if you're in a bar and you take a ham
and you hit somebody

176
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,360
in the back of the head, that's not very
nice when you're dancing to this song.

177
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,270
These are what's called bugs.

178
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,550
Now a human reading this

179
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,910
would say, oh, I think they meant to say
"hand" here.

180
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,380
But a computer is much more literal than
people.

181
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,530
We'll see a couple of exercises where
we'll see that people

182
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,780
can correct little mistakes like this, but
computers they cannot, right?
