Hello and welcome to
Python for Informatics.

3
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:06,070
Right now, we're going to
cover chapter one on Charles

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,380
Severance from the
University of Michigan.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,910
And I'm the author, and
I'll be your lecturer

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,560
for this online lecture of
the first chapter of the book.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,150
This lecture, and my slides, and
the book as a matter of fact,

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,900
are all open.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,360
Open content, open materials.

13
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:31,370
It's important to be
explicit about copyright,

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,620
and so I say it right
at the beginning.

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,400
So if you have not yet done
it, please install Python.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,200
You're going to do
it sooner or later.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,174
And you actually might as well
do it before this lecture.

18
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:47,590
You can listen to this lecture,
obviously, without Python,

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,270
but it allows you to play
with some of the things.

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,480
And we might even do a little
bit of Python in this lecture

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,260
and show you Python
in the lecture.

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,280
And so, you can go along if you
have Python in another window.

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,050
There is
pythonlearn.com/install.php has

24
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,030
instructions for Microsoft
Windows and Macintosh.

25
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,190
And it's not on this slide, but
I just uploaded instructions

26
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,040
on how to do this on a
Raspberry Pi-- the new really

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,130
cool $25 computer.

28
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,270
And they are really easy
and straightforward.

29
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,770
They're complete screen
recordings, step by step, 10,

30
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,830
15 minutes at the maximum.

31
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,780
You can stop them,
you could start them,

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,450
you can download them
to your hard drive.

33
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,570
They will walk you through what
it takes to install Python,

34
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,140
if needed.

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,910
Install text editor, if needed.

36
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,830
And then run your very
first Python program.

37
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,000
And you're going to have
to run a Python program.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,600
So, this is as good of a
time as any to stop and get

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,900
that done and then come back.

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,190
OK?

41
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,730
So, now, back to
the introduction.

42
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,650
So, computers, basically,
want to be helpful.

43
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,060
They are programmed-- matter of
fact this is a micro processor.

44
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,370
This is really just
an electrical part.

45
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,120
It's got wires and
circuits inside of it.

46
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,130
And somebody spend a
lot of engineering time

47
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,380
to make it so that
these pins in the back

48
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,860
take instructions from
us, from operating

49
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,080
systems, from the hard
drive, from the memory.

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,480
Instructions come into here
and then results come out.

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,340
It's really sort of a very
programmable hand calculator,

52
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,820
and it's our job to
put instructions in.

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,000
This thing, in a sense, is
wired to be curious about what's

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,020
next, right?

55
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,400
It's is like, tell me
what you want to do next?

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,610
What do you want to do next?

57
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,440
What you want to do next?

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,148
And after that, what
you want to do next?

59
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:47,060
And it just happens to do that
a billion or so times a second.

60
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,250
And so, that's sort of
the low level piece.

61
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,020
But you can also think
if you have a PDA,

62
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,830
something like this, all
of the buttons on here

63
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,660
are some kind of, what's next?

64
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,400
Right?

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,530
Each of those is something
begging for my attention.

66
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,750
Some application developer who's
built a really cool application

67
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,980
and says, please use
me, please click me,

68
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,680
I am nothing without you.

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,920
We humans are the things
that cause computers

70
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,360
to start doing something.

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,970
And this will sit here
happily until I've

72
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,600
caused it to do something.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,158
Now, whoa.

74
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,106
Whoa.

75
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:25,900
Hope it's still OK.

76
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,400
Yeah.

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,530
Seems to be fine,
seems to be fine.

78
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,510
Takes a licking and
keeps on ticking.

79
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,910
So, these anyone can use, right?

80
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,472
They say even animals can
use a Macintosh smartphone.

81
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:40,180
And so you don't have
to be a programmer,

82
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,790
but to get this to
do what you want,

83
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,650
you need to learn a
different language.

84
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,870
And we need to learn the
language of the instructions

85
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,000
to tell it what to do.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,560
So, that's what
we're going to do.

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,550
We're going to learn
how to talk to this.

88
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,540
Yo!

89
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,140
Because it's asking
us a question,

90
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,880
and we have to give the answer.

91
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,625
So, what's a programmer?

92
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:05,070
A programmer is somebody
who writes a program, which

93
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,000
is a script or a set
of instructions that

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,400
tell one of these kinds of
things what it is that they're
