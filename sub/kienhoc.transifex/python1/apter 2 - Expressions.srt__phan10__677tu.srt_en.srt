856
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,850
https://youtu.be/IXXHH6ztsSA
So one better way
to write it would

857
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,640
be to make the
variables very simple.

858
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,700
And then cognitively, we humans
can figure out which is which.

859
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,605
Because again, it's still
only about matching.

860
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:45,524
The a has to match the a.

861
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:46,700
The b matches the b.

862
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,419
And the cs match.

863
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:49,960
It's actually the
exact same program.

864
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:57,730
a = 35, b= 12.5, c equals
a times b, and print c.

865
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,990
Python sees these
as the same program.

866
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,150
It doesn't care
what we name them.

867
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,660
Now a human will be much
appreciative if you say here,

868
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,780
you can either have
this one or this one.

869
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,905
This one will make
them a lot happier.

870
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:13,460

871
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,500
OK?

872
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,560
So that is certainly
cognitively easier.

873
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,810
But it's not really
giving you any sense

874
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,330
of what's going on here.

875
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,330
So an even better way to
write this exact same program

876
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,660
to do the exact
same thing would be

877
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,440
to choose variables
named hours, rate,

878
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,810
and pay if indeed that
is what you're doing.

879
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:39,452
Now you can look at this and
you go, oh, well shoot, 35

880
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:40,410
is the number of hours.

881
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,130
And 12 and 1/2 is the rate.

882
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,531
And the pay is the number
of hours times the rate.

883
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:46,280
And then we're going
to print out the pay.

884
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,130
That makes a lot of sense.

885
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:54,270
So this is really an awesome
and wonderful characterization.

886
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,130
And if that's what
you're doing and if those

887
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,280
are hours, rate, pay,
it's a great thing

888
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,040
to name your variables.

889
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,444
But this is where beginning
students get confused.

890
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,110
And so sometimes I'll
write it this way,

891
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,859
and sometimes I'll
write it this way.

892
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,400
Because you'll look
at this until you

893
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,150
get a little more sophisticated
a little more skilled,

894
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:17,530
and you say, like, does Python
know something about payroll?

895
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,400
Is hours a reserved word?

896
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,350
Is rate a reserved word
and pay a reserved word?

897
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,290
Are these things that
Python knows about?

898
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,350
And the answer is no.

899
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,270
Python sees these three programs
as exactly the same name.

900
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,260
It's just this person really
made a very bad choice

901
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,450
of variable name.

902
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,710
This person made a less bad
choice of a variable name.

903
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,620
And this person made a
really awesome choice

904
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,810
of variable name.

905
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:45,090
So the difference between
these two things is style.

906
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,220
They are the exact same program.

907
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,610
And Python is equivalently
happy with these.

908
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,630
But humans are most happy
when the variables are

909
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,180
easy to remember and
they are somewhat

910
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,870
descriptive of what they're
expected contents will be.

911
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,980
That's mnemonic to
help you remember

912
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,700
what you were meaning to do
when you write the program.

913
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,742
This is still a bit cryptic
having these really short

914
00:41:08,742 --> 00:41:09,950
one character variable names.

915
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,070
It's still a bit cryptic.

916
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,960
So you have a couple
of assignments

917
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,120
at the end of the chapter.

918
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,280
One of the assignments
is to write a program

919
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,450
to prompt the user for hours and
rate per hour and compute pay.

920
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,500
So I won't do this
here, but just

921
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,091
a couple of sort of odd things.

922
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,595
You're going to be
using raw input.

923
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:37,130

924
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,630
But remember that
hands a string in.

925
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,862
So you're going to have to use
float to function to convert it

926
00:41:44,862 --> 00:41:46,820
to a floating point
number, so you can actually

927
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,350
do a calculation.

928
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:51,220
And then you're going to have
to use multiplication and print,

929
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,190
so multiplication
and then print.

930
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,130
So it's some combination of raw
input, float, multiplication,

931
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:05,630
and print constructed to make
your program do exactly this.

932
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,370
So this is the end
of a chapter two.

933
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,530
We talked about types,
reserved words, variables,

934
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,279
the mnemonic how you choose
variable names-- we'll

935
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:16,820
hit this a couple more times,
because choosing variable names

936
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,780
is always problematic--
operators, operator

937
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,410
precedence, which just means
like does multiplication happen

938
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,600
before plus, parentheses.

939
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,690
Integer division is a little
weird, because it truncates.

940
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:35,190

941
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:38,790
9 over 10 = 0.

942
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,070
That's the integer
division truncating.

943
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,965
Conversion, this is
like the int float.

944
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:47,900

945
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,020
And then user input,
which is raw input.

946
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,110
And then comments,
which are ways

947
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,720
for you to add human readable
text to your program.

948
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,620
OK.

949
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,470
See you next lecture.
