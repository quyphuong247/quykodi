377
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,670
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs
There's nothing
to fear from this.

378
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,050
It's just not that smart.

379
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,580
So, this is the thing
that's program to ask

380
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,450
the question, what's next?

381
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,800
And then we have to have
a set of instructions

382
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,420
that feed this thing really
fast-- billions of times

383
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,470
a second.

384
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,610
And that's what this.

385
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,580
This is the random
access memory.

386
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,620
And we have memory chips and
they're connected together

387
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,000
through the motherboard.

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,500
So we have the main memory and
we have the central processing

389
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,070
unit.

390
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,630
And this is where our high
speed instructions come from,

391
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,550
this where a high
speed data is stored,

392
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,460
and this is the thing
that asks, what next?

393
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,127
And it reads its
instructions from here.

394
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:01,501
And you see that can-- boop--
they're not quite connected

395
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:03,910
together, but eventually
they're connecting together.

396
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,230
Don't feel too bad about
this hardware, it's all old,

397
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,890
and it's all broken
and can't be hurt.

398
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,810
So, the next thing we got
is input/output device.

399
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,720
I'll go back to my Raspberry Pi.

400
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,550
So the Raspberry Pi
has a USB that you can

401
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,060
connect a mouse or a keyboard.

402
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,220
It has an HDMI that you
can connect a monitor to,

403
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,640
it has an ethernet connector.

404
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,160
So these are all examples
of input/output devices.

405
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,806

406
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:36,930
And then, the last thing on the
screen is the secondary memory.

407
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,660
So this RAM, on
the Raspberry Pi,

408
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,390
the CPU, the central
processing unit, and the RAM

409
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,570
are all in this one
chip in the middle.

410
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,670
It's called SoC, or
system on a chip,

411
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,080
where they put more parts there.

412
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:56,510
So in a sense, they've
collapsed this and this,

413
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:02,110
and a lot of this, all down in a
Raspberry Pi to one little guy.

414
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,530
But it's still architecturally
the same thing.

415
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,977
There's a central
processing unit.

416
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:06,810
There's main memory.

417
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,170
There's graphics
cards, et cetera.

418
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,410
So input/output
devices-- oh and this guy

419
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,580
has input/output devices, too,
like USB, keyboard, monitor, et

420
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,080
cetera.

421
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,530
So there are very similar,
it's just this is new

422
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,890
and this is old.

423
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,370
Everything gets smaller
when it gets newer.

424
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:25,870
OK.

425
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,060

426
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,250
OK, so last thing we're
going to talk about

427
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,670
is the secondary memory.

428
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,430

429
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,850
When the power goes off,
these things sort of go away.

430
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,990
The data in this RAM goes away.

431
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,550
It's just designed to be
really fast, but not permanent.

432
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,190
So we need a place
that's permanent.

433
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,710
That's what
secondary storage is.

434
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,370
That's what this
secondary storage is for.

435
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,640
This is permanent.

436
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,340
This is fast.

437
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,515
And it cha cha cha
cha really fast.

438
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:01,450
But this is permanent
and this is slower.

439
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,000
OK?

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,475
So the secondary
memory-- you got

441
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:08,030
two kinds of secondary memory--
oh, dropped it on the floor.

442
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,840
Two kinds of a secondary memory.

443
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,575
I'll start with
the Raspberry Pi.

444
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:16,010
The secondary memory of the
Raspberry Pi is this SD card.

445
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,470
It's like a disk drive.

446
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,560
It still is permanent,
does not require power

447
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,180
to maintain it's data,
the data stays permanent.

448
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,210
So in the future, we will
see more of these flash style

449
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,300
drives and SD style drives.

450
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,160
So the Raspberry Pi is kind
of alluding to the future.

451
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,770
There's a disk drive in here.

452
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,340
It's not really a disk,
it's also flash memory.

453
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,620
But in the old days, in the good
old days back when I was a kid,

454
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,220
our secondary memory
was a disk drive.

455
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,123
And it had platters,
and it spun,

456
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,850
and it made a satisfying noise.

457
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,710
And it would move in
and out to read data.

458
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,290
And I'll show you a
video of this just a bit.

459
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,200
And so these would record the
data on the magnetic platters,

460
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,700
and then when the
power's taken off,

461
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,470
the data would
still be magnetized.

462
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,590
And then it would go and
move to the right spot,

463
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,450
spin it around,
and read the data.

464
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,840
And again, this is kind of
messed up in a pretty bad way.

465
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,410
So, there we go.

466
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,870
Central processing unit
brings the operation.

467
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,040
Main memory, fast but goes
away when we power off.

468
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,120
Input/output devices--
keyboards, et cetera.

469
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,850
And then storage that maintains
its data across power cycles.

470
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,940
OK.
