941
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,680
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs
In this case, since x
is 5, we execute it,

942
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,350
then we come back here,
we're going to another one.

943
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,390
If x is greater than 20-- well
this turns out to be false.

944
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,910

945
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,610
So we skip that.

946
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,370
So bigger does not run.

947
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,590
That line never runs.

948
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:22,130
So the output is
smaller, [? finni. ?]

949
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,890
Now, here, we can take a look
at it in the picture diagram.

950
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,230
We run x equals 5,
we ask a question--

951
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,490
this doesn't hurt x
to ask the question.

952
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,960
Is x less than 10?

953
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,810
The answer is yes.

954
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,780
So we drive down this little
path, we print smaller.

955
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,780
And then we rejoin the freeway.

956
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,870
Is x less than 20?

957
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:42,380
No.

958
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,340
So we skip and we continue.

959
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,710
So this never gets executed.

960
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,330
So you can think
of it either way.

961
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:53,280
You can think of it either sort
of like gestalt. Say, if this

962
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,100
is true, do what's indented.

963
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,600
Or you can imagine a little car
driving down a highway making

964
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,500
turn choices as it goes.

965
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,300
They're equivalent.

966
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,900
Over time, it's probably
you'll just start seeing this

967
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,404
and start thinking this way.

968
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:08,070
But sometimes it helps
to think about it

969
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,810
this way for a little while.

970
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,100
OK.

971
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,410
Now, the next thing I want to
show you is repeated steps.

972
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,760
Steps that happen over
and over and over again.

973
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,970
OK?

974
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:23,280
And that again, when
I said, oh, computers

975
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,030
are good at handling
a billion words, well

976
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,870
that means it has to have a
loop, or a repeated section.

977
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:28,692
One for each word.

978
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:30,400
It's going to do
something for each word.

979
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,930

980
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,540
So here we go, and
in Python-- let's

981
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,880
pick a different festive color.

982
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,910
Let's pick purple
as a festive color.

983
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,990
So here's our program,
starts at the beginning.

984
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,252
Sets the variable n to 5, and
then a key word, reserve word,

985
00:42:48,252 --> 00:42:49,350
while.

986
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:53,300
While n greater than 0-- again,
this is asking a question.

987
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,080
This is asking a question--
is n greater than 0?

988
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,240
That's a question.

989
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,580
If yes, we're going to do this.

990
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,990
If no, we're going to do that.

991
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,750
Over here, if it's
true, we're going

992
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,060
to execute the
indented part, and then

993
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,720
come back and do it again.

994
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,280
If it's false, we're
going to skip down.

995
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,020
So it's kind of like an if,
except it keeps doing it

996
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,440
over and over and over again.

997
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,690
So it comes in, sets n to 5.

998
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,740
Is n greater than 0?

999
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,950
Yeah, sure.

1000
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,090
So we print n, outcomes 5.

1001
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,800
Then it says, n
equals n minus 1.

1002
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,190
So n becomes 4.

1003
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,910
We can change colors.

1004
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,935
Then it goes back up.

1005
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:35,690
Goes back up, and asks
the question again.

1006
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:40,290
n is 4, it's still greater
than 0, so it comes through.

1007
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:45,010
Prints out 4, subtracts
1, so n is now 3.

1008
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:45,800
Goes back up.

1009
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,700

1010
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,620
Is n greater 0?

1011
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,690
Yes, it is.

1012
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,350
Print out 3.

1013
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,290
Subtract 1, now it's 2.

1014
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:58,200
So outcome 3 and 2.

1015
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,890
And it goes back up.

1016
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:00,960
Still greater than 0?

1017
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,040
Yes, it is.

1018
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,790

1019
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,570
Now it's 1.

1020
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:11,000
Now we subtract 1, it becomes 0.

1021
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,890
Is it greater than 0?

1022
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:12,590
No.

1023
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,370
And we finally leave.

1024
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,440
And we finally drop down.

1025
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,280
And so the last thing
becomes the printer blastoff.

1026
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,810
So this is a loop.

1027
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,910
The notion that we're going
to run this little bit of code

1028
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,445
five times.

1029
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:33,060

1030
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,130
We're going to run this
little bit of code five times.

1031
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:39,830
And loops have these things
we call iteration variables.

1032
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,590
And that is this n.

1033
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,530
It's a variable
that specifically

1034
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,930
is changing each time it
goes through the loop.
