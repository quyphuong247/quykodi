00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:11,417
https://youtu.be/mBTuV7VMIrI
So now we want to talk about
how we place the database and

2
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:13,925
the database software in
relative to the other

3
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:18,310
aspects of the programming environment
that we're going to build.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,980
And we're going to talk both about
large projects and small projects.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,440
And a large project would
use sort of a web site. Like,

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,560
you know maybe you build a web site to
track comic books or something, and

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,590
you store all the data in the database.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,610
And so, in a large project, and we're
not going to do it in this, so much in this

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,510
class, but I figured it's time now that
we're learning about databases to sort of

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,540
give you a sense of how they're
used in these online systems.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,590
And maybe in a future course
you'll see how they're used,

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,040
and learn how to do
this in large projects.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,200
But there are generally sort of two roles.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,530
One is the person who
writes the application and

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,492
produces the user interface for
the application, and for the web site.

16
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:56,780
And then there's the other that actually
sort of monitors and adjusts the database,

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,000
and that person is
the database administrator.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Often in a large project,

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,960
you will get some advice as an application
developer from a database administrator.

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,310
And the idea is is that
database tuning and

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,250
monitoring is a somewhat specialized job.

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,200
And so in a professional environment,

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,030
like the open source learning management
system that I work on named Sakai,

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,850
in production I don't get as
a developer, and so that's who I am.

25
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,100
This is me, I'm a developer.

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,650
I write cool code, I make really
neat widgets for the end user, and

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,750
this is the end user in a web browser,
talking to my cool thing,

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,270
and I add a little button and
stuff like that.

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,660
And I write code that actually talks
to the database, the database server,

30
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,640
which is both code plus
the data storage itself.

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,050
And I write code that talks SQL to the
database server and gets data back, and

32
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,080
then formats it for the end user,
and that's what developers do.

33
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,420
They're the ones that create
application software.

34
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,660
The database administrator, generally
we don't let the developer talk to

35
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,950
the production database directly, because
we're afraid the developer will break it.

36
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,900
And that's probably because there's
been a lot of experience where

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,120
developers broke it.

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,120
So, we have a special person
called the database administrator.

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,750
And they're the ones that
are allowed to talk to the database.

40
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,210
Now, because the database is both storage

41
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,210
and software, it can take SQL
queries from many different sources.

42
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,640
Both the application, or database tools.

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,770
And so the database administrator has like
a direct way to talk to the database and

44
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,480
get data back.

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,530
And so if something's going wrong, like a,
it's gotten really large, what's going on?

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,370
So the database administrator will start
running commands straight to the database.

47
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,570
Whereas the developer generally
has no access to the real database,

48
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,530
Eventually we can write a new version
of the application software.

49
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,520
And so that's kind of the split between
the roles between developer and

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,740
database administrator in large projects.

51
00:02:55,835 --> 00:03:00,135
And the database administrator helps
with the design and implementation.

52
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,865
And often a database
administrator is shared

53
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:05,025
across a number of software projects.

54
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:08,725
But that's not exactly what
we're going to do, right?

55
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:12,755
So it'd be nice, and maybe you have a job.

56
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:15,375
Maybe you do have a job that there's
a database administrator, and

57
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,975
it'll kind of look like that.

58
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:21,700
But right now, during this class,
we've met the database

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,880
administrator and the application
developer and they're both you.

60
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,180
Okay?
They're both you.

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,970
Or me.

62
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,680
Right?

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,280
And so what's going to happen now
is you get to do both roles.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,690
And later, if you have somebody
to help you with it,

65
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,560
you might turn more into
the developer side, or

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,890
more into the database administrator
side, that's perfectly fine.

67
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,600
So we still have a database system, right?

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,670
And that's got both the logic, the
software that makes the database smart, and

69
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,960
the data itself, and we talk to it.

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,600
And the program we're going
to use initially right now,

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,800
is we're going to study
the DBA way of doing business.

72
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,770
You're going to write SQL, you're going
to talk to this little piece of software

73
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,700
that's going to submit stuff directly.

74
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,720
And so, you are going to act
as a database administrator.

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,750
We're going to create tables,
put data in them and

76
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,460
we're just going to type stuff into
this application called SQLite browser.

77
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,570
There are others of these applications
that are like database administrator

78
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,780
applications.

79
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,500
Much later, much later we are going
to start writing Python programs.

80
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,790
And in those programs we're going to talk
to the same database files using SQL.

81
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,600
And we're not going to write
programs that have a web interface.

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,030
That would be like Twitter or
Comicbookregistry.com or whatever.

83
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,710
We're going to have various
sources of inputs.

84
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,670
Sometimes files, sometimes network, and

85
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,150
we're going to write programs
that read this stuff.

86
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,070
And clean it up.

87
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,240
Often there's a cleaning step.

88
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,690
And then we are going to write
the data into a database.

89
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,480
And so we're going to grow this data,
fill it up, and then we'll sort of be done

90
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,860
with this phase of acquiring data, and all
our data will be sitting in a database.

91
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,610
Then we will write another Python
program to read this data and

92
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,450
maybe make a pretty file.

93
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,520
And even later in the class,
we will be visualizing that or

94
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,080
sending it to various other places.

95
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,200
You might send it to R to
do statistical analysis, or

96
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,800
Excel to do some simple analysis or
visualization, or

97
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,730
we'll use JavaScript to make pretty
pictures and spinning things and whatever.

98
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,950
So, the basic pattern
here is it's the same.

99
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,580
We're going to have sort of apps and
then we're going to have DBA.

100
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,970
But they're both you.

101
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,660
So the thing we're going to
focus on first is right here.

102
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,520
The database we're going to use is a thing
called SQLite, and the software we're

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,800
going to use is what I told you to install
right at the beginning, a while ago.

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,220
Hopefully you've done that, SQLite browser,
because otherwise you can't

105
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,540
talk to the database, unless you
have something equivalent to this.

106
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,730
And they do exist.

107
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,210
But the basic pattern is,
read data, clean it up,

108
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,660
stick it in the database in a sensible and
organized way.

109
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,900
And then write other applications to
make sense of it and analyze the data.

110
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,860
And that's what we're
going to be doing coming up.

111
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,840
So, when we build this data,
I mentioned the word schema, right?

112
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,540
That we come up with a contract for

113
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,670
exactly the way the data
is supposed to look.

114
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,250
And with this contract,

115
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,520
the database software can make
the best use of itself, right?

116
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,340
It can make good use of the disk drive.

117
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,540
It can make good use of
all these other things.

118
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,460
And so, we call this the database model.

119
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,940
And it's best thought of as a contract.

120
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,135
Okay, we're going to talk into this file.

121
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:36,185
There's going to be magic things
that are stored in here.

122
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:37,995
We use this database software.

123
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:42,525
And the schema is our way to inform

124
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:46,405
the database how we think this,
how we're going to use the data and

125
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,445
let the database figure out the way
to play it, where to put it.

126
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:51,515
I'll put this thing over here,
I'll put another thing over here, and

127
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:53,825
I'll put a little shortcut over here.

128
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:55,090
We don't care about that.

129
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,700
We say this is the data model we're going
to work with, and you the database code

130
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,900
are supposed to be really smart and figure
out how to make the most sense of that.

131
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,610
So the data model is not just the SQL
to query it, but the data model is our

132
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,460
contract about the shape of what we're
going to store and retrieve in our database.

133
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,806
So there's a number of common database
systems, I've mentioned several of them.

134
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:24,124
Oracle is awesome.

135
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:30,120
It's a company that was effectively
created just to make a database system.

136
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,890
And they were founded at the birth
of the relational movement, and won

137
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,620
because they were very good at it.

138
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,200
The others who didn't win were
like IBM, and others,

139
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,910
although they all had relational
databases as well. A lot of those other

140
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,660
vendors who let, well I don't think
letting Oracle win is the right word.

141
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,480
Those vendors that Oracle

142
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,690
out-competed were the ones that
didn't embrace this relational stuff.

143
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,488
Because I was in college when they
saw what was coming down and

144
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:06,629
some of us were like, ah,
relational, too much math.

145
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:09,340
Give me the quick, dirty stuff, right?

146
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,800
And it took a while for
the relational model really to win,

147
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,210
but when it won, it won big time.

148
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,050
And Oracle was a company that
made a bet on it winning.

149
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,630
And so by the time we all realized,
whoa, it's a good idea,

150
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,350
because we all thought it was a bad idea,
or at least I did, it was too late.

151
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,650
Oracle had the best implementation
of the good idea that we all

152
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,980
finally realized was a good idea.

153
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,860
And so, Oracle kind of wins.

154
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,810
So then what happens is Oracle's kind
of the old dog in the marketplace,

155
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,540
the very expensive, commercial, a lot
of people think it's simply the best.

156
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,120
But there's alternatives
that are quite nice.

157
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,760
There's MySql, which is a open source.

158
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,530
MySql has been purchased by Oracle,
but continues to be open source.

159
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:57,585
If you really want to be open source,
there's a MySql MariaDB. MariaDB, it's called.

160
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,350
It starts with an M on purpose so

161
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,110
that it starts with
the same letter as that.

162
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,990
So MariaDB is a copy of the open
source version of MySql

163
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,110
which was made at the moment
that MySql was purchased by

164
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,370
But MySql remains open source so
a lot of people who use

165
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,250
MySql are switching to Maria, but
a lot of people just keep using MySql.

166
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,600
And if Oracle does something bad with
MySql, we'll all switch to Maria and

167
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,790
that'll be the end of that.

168
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,130
So at that point, Oracle hasn't done
anything really bad with MySql,

169
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,930
and so it's okay.

170
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:37,765
So we tend to use MySql for online
web sites, a lot of web site stuff.

171
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:41,295
Oracle tends to be used for
enterprise kinds of things.

172
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:47,105
And then another one that's very popular
is SqlServer, it's the Microsoft one.

173
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:49,135
You may have even used
Microsoft Access and

174
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:52,300
you might have even done like a screen,
where you're dropping things down

175
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,160
that turn out to be SQL under the
covers, don't know.

176
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,750
SqlServer for
Microsoft is a very good product.

177
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,640
Some enterprise organizations are all
Microsoft and so they use SqlServer.

178
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,110
Don't feel bad, pretty much
everything I'm going to talk about

179
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,810
applies equally to SQL because
SQL's a standard and that's nice.

180
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,940
There's another one called
Postgres that's also open source

181
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,540
that's very nice and it's kind of
more of an imitation of Oracle than MySql.

182
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,960
MySql is designed to be simpler and
faster and

183
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,200
solve less problems than Oracle,
but do them super fast.

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,360
And that's why it's often
very popular in web sites.

185
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,900
Postgres is sort of
more of a rich database

186
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,490
that's very much a direct
competitor of Oracle.

187
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,070
MySql is its kind of own world.

188
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,090
And we're not going to use any of these.

189
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,890
If you go take sort of a web class,
you will probably use MySql and

190
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,610
everything I'm going to teach you
in this class is useful there.

191
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,450
Okay? All the knowledge, all the SQL.

192
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,680
But we're going to use a thing
called SQLite.

193
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,410
Lite meaning little, tiny, not very heavy.

194
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,130
And so, SQLite is what's
called an embedded database.

195
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:03,180
And MySql or Oracle are whole
pieces of separate software

196
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,692
that we sort of talk across
a network connection to.

197
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:10,620
But SQLite is actually part of software,
and so it's built in.

198
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,159
Your car, if it's a reasonably modern car,

199
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,560
probably has five copies of SQLite
in it, right?

200
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,330
So your car has SQLite.

201
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,340
If you have a fancy music player in
your car, it probably is using it.

202
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,630
If you have an iPhone, it probably
has 30 copies of SQLite in it, because

203
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,720
SQLite is designed to be really small,
so small that you actually don't have

204
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,930
to separate it, you just build
it into the application, and

205
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,990
the thing that matters most to us
is that it's built into Python.

206
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,370
It's already there in Python.

207
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,640
So that's super awesome, right?

208
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,930
And it's fast and
aimed at smaller amounts of data, but

209
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,490
because in Python we're doing data
analysis, we will make good use of SQLite.

210
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,840
And the fact that it's built in
just makes our life really simple.

211
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,910
We don't have to install
a bunch of software.

212
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,510
Python has it with nothing
more than an import statement.

213
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,780
You know how this story goes.

214
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,360
If you're in Python and
you've got to get something done,

215
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,910
the first thing you do is figure
out what import statement you need.

216
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,590
Okay?

217
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,020
So that gives us a sense the of the SQL
applications that we'll be using.

218
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,740
Up next we're really going to
start writing some SQL.

219
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,421
Make a database and put some tables in it,
and put some data in those tables.
