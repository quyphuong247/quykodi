666
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,440
https://youtu.be/IXXHH6ztsSA
And so welcome is a literal.

667
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,260
And then Chuck is coming
from this nam variable.

668
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,410
So this is a two-line program.

669
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,100
I think this is one of
your assignments actually.

670
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,960
Well, it's one of the
exercises in the book

671
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,330
to prompt for a user's
name and then welcome them.

672
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,410

673
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,000
So raw input is a function
that issues a prompt,

674
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,300
waits, and then takes
whatever string is entered,

675
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,805
and then returns it, and then
puts it into that variable.

676
00:30:29,805 --> 00:30:33,450

677
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,040
So now we're going
to create kind

678
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,200
of the first useful program.

679
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,170
It's not a powerful program.

680
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:48,279
It is an interesting problem of
the fact that for some reason

681
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,820
there's a difference
in the numbering

682
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,930
scheme of United
States elevators

683
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,210
and European elevators.

684
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,120
European elevators, the
floor that you walk out on

685
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,770
is the 0 floor.

686
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,620
The floor above
that is the 1 floor.

687
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,280
And the floor below that, the
basement, is the minus 1 floor.

688
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,360
And so you walk in
and you can either

689
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,610
go up the elevator
or down the elevator.

690
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,030
Of course, in the United States,
the floor that you walk in

691
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,290
is the 1.

692
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,110
And then there's the
2 floor above that.

693
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,120
And then there's the basement.

694
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,620
So this is the imagination that
the Americans have as to how

695
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,160
to number floors.

696
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,290
The Europeans go 0, 1, minus 1.

697
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,620
So children who
go to hotels learn

698
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,279
instantly the notion
of zero and the notion

699
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,320
of positive and negative
numbers and the symmetry

700
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,310
between positive and
negative numbers.

701
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,260
I mean, I just wish the
United States hotels

702
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:47,530
would switch to this I
to teach young people 0

703
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,340
immediately and
negative numbers.

704
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,770
So we somehow think that
numbers in the United States

705
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,946
start at 1, and then there
are no negative numbers.

706
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:56,820
There's the basement.

707
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,716

708
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:03,650
I wonder why that
is, but whatever.

709
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,220
For people to travel a lot,
they may be confused by this.

710
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,010
They need a way to convert
back and forth between the US

711
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,480
and European numbering system.

712
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,140
So this is a simple
program that demonstrates

713
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,140
a real classic pattern of
input processing and output.

714
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,670
It's just three lines.

715
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,950
But it has the essential
things that all programs that

716
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,310
are useful-- they
generally read some data,

717
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,320
do some work with the
data, and then produce

718
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,040
some kind of results.

719
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:42,780
And so the first line is a raw
input that effectively puts out

720
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,600
a prompt.

721
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,550
And the wait.

722
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,950
It says, please enter
your Europe floor.

723
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,180
It sits there.

724
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,940
We type a 0.

725
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,070
Then 0 goes into int.

726
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,280
But it is a string.

727
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,510
It is not a number.

728
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,700
It is a string.

729
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,820
So we can't add to it.

730
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,140
But we can take and convert
it to an integer with the int

731
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,340
function, int of imp.

732
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,360
That's a string being
converted to an integer.

733
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,040
So now it's a real numeric 0.

734
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,425
We can add 1 to that.

735
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:14,250
And we sum that together.

736
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,030
And we put it into
the variable usf.

737
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,230
And then we print
US Floor comma,

738
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,940
and then whatever the
variable for usf is.

739
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,350
And out come US Floor 1.

740
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,720
So you're written a very
simple elevator floor

741
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,306
conversion from a European
floor to a United States floor.

742
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:34,680
Don't ask about
negative numbers.

743
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,888
It's not really good at that.

744
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,880
But from 0 and positive
numbers, it works great.

745
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,680

746
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,020
So another thing to think about
in any programming language

747
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,610
is comments.

748
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,030
Comments are like commentary.

749
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:57,180
And basically, it's a way
for us to add notations

750
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,050
for ourselves or for
other humans interspersed

751
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,460
in the code.

752
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,029
And so in Python, anything
after a pound sign is ignored.

753
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:08,320
You can have a pound sign at
the beginning of the line,

754
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,179
and then the whole
line is ignored.

755
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,630
There are two or three
reasons why you could do this.

756
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,389
One is sort of like
paragraph headings, where

757
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,170
you can say what's
going to happen

758
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:21,140
in English or your language.

759
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,639
And you can write
documentation that

760
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,659
says, this code was written
by Charles Severance December,
