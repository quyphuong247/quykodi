Hello.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,080
And welcome to Python for Informatics.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,630
Right now we're going to cover Chapter
One.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,650
I'm Charles Severance from the University
of Michigan.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,190
And I'm the author.

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,590
And I'll be your lecturer, for this online
lecture of the first chapter of the book.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,910
This lecture and my slides, and the book,
as a matter of fact, are all open.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,930
Open content, open materials.

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,440
It's important to be explicit about
copyright, and

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,630
so I say it right at the beginning.

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,580
So, computers basically want to be
helpful.

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,255
They are programmed.

15
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:44,940
[SOUND] Matter of fact, this is a
microprocessor.

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,260
This is really just an electrical part.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,280
It's got wires and circuits inside of it.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,190
And somebody spent a lot of engineering
time, to make it so that these pins in the

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,580
back take instructions from us, from
operating systems,

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,960
from the hard drive, from the memory.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,330
Instructions come into here and then
results come out.

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,710
It's really sort of a very programmable
hand

23
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,690
calculator and it's our job to put
instructions in.

24
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,950
This thing, in a sense, is wired to

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,570
be curious about what's next, right?
It's like

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,260
It, it's, like, tell me what you want to
do next.

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,170
What do you want to do next?

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,510
What do you want to do next, and after
that, what do you want to do next,

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,950
and it just happens to do that a
billion or so times a second.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,120
And, so that's sort of the, the low-level
piece, and, but you can also think, if

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,350
you have, like, a PDA, something like
this,

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,690
all the buttons on here are some kind of,

33
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,580
you know, "what's next?"

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,290
Right?

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,090
Each of those is sort of something begging

36
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,620
for my attention, some application
developer who's built a

37
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,940
really cool application and says please
use me, please

38
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,510
click me, I am sort of nothing without
you.

39
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,460
We humans are the things that sort of
cause computers to start doing

40
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,976
something and this will sit here happily
until I caused it to do something.

41
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:04,370
Now, [SOUND] whoa!

42
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,220
Whoa.

43
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,950
Hope it's still okay.

44
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,480
Yeah, it seems to be fine.

45
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,420
Seems to be fine.

46
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,080
Takes a lickin', and keeps on tickin'.

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,790
So, these, anyone can use, right?

48
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,800
They say even animals can use a Macintosh,
smartphone.

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,070
And so you don't have to be a programmer.

50
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,580
But to get this to do what you want

51
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,030
you need to learn a different language,
and we need to

52
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,940
learn the language of the instructions to
tell it what to do.

53
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,410
So, that's what we're going to do.

54
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,420
We're going to learn how to talk to this.

55
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Yo!

56
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,320
because it's asking us a question, we have
to give the answer.

57
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,770
So, what's a programmer?

58
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,490
A programmer is somebody who

59
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,470
writes a program, which is a script or a
set of instructions that tell

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,810
one of these kinds of things what it is
that they're supposed to do.

61
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,870
And sometimes you're running a program
like Moodle, an open source

62
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,550
learning management system, or Sakai,

63
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,010
another open source learning management
system.

64
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,330
And sometimes you'll even get paid to do
that, right?

65
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,800
Sometimes you do it for free, sometimes
you

66
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,500
get paid, sometimes you write things for
yourself.

67
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,900
And and but, if you think about it, all
these

68
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,690
applications on my iPhone, somebody's
making some money off of these.

69
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,430
They may not be able to quit their job,
but a surprising number

70
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,990
have been able to quit their job or
start

71
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,170
small companies, maybe not gigantic
companies, but small companies.

72
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,840
So these people that can put
applications inside of our computers

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,160
are programmers, because they understand
the way that we talk to these computers.

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,920
And part of what I'm going to try to do is
to get you to move from

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,850
the mindset of the end user who thinks of
this as something just to click on

76
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,500
to the mindset of the programmer, who's
kind of

77
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,680
on the inside trying to get out to you.

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,870
So that's, as we sort of move from user to

79
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,090
programmer, we move from outside to inside
and we think

80
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,420
of the world out there and it's like what
are

81
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,100
they going to put, push, what button are
they going to push.

82
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,450
So here's kind of a picture of that.

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,550
So on the outside, we're users, we click
on buttons, we click

84
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,600
on websites, we click on buttons on our
phones, et cetera, et cetera.

85
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,980
But what's really going on inside all of
that is there's a computer with

86
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,810
a bunch of hardware inside of that, and it
has inside of it data,

87
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,490
networks, other information. And software
is what makes all that make sense.

88
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,550
And so, part of what I want you to do is
I want you to stop

89
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,420
thinking about how to use these things
from

90
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,380
the outside, and we move to becoming a
programmer.

91
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,610
We're someone on the inside.
