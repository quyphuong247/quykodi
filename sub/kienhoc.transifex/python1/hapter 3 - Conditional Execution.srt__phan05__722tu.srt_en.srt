381
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:45,570
https://youtu.be/VXyRfgnzL2o
So that's what we
have shown here.

382
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,570
We say is x = 4.

383
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,120
Is x equal to question mark?

384
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,980
If it's yes, we're
going to go here.

385
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,894
If it's no, we're
going to go here,

386
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:54,310
going to execute
one or the other,

387
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,360
and then we're
going to continue.

388
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,600
So we're really at a
fork in the road here.

389
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,710
We're are at a fork in the road,
going to make a choice, and one

390
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,970
or the other, but never both.

391
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,670
So we're going to do one thing.

392
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,410
Or we're going to
do another thing.

393
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,089
We're going to do
one of the two.

394
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,089
And depending on the
question that we ask

395
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:17,869
is which one that
we're going to do.

396
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,550
So here's a little bit of code.

397
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,170
x = 4 .

398
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,420
Is x > 2?

399
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,960
The answer is yes.

400
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,970
Then we come out
and hit this else.

401
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,490
And we automatically
skip, because we're only

402
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,972
going to do one of the two.

403
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:33,930
And here's the picture.

404
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,590
x = 4.

405
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,250
Is x equal to, yes,
print, done, which

406
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,780
means we'll never do
both this and that.

407
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,200
Never do both, both sides.

408
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,230
We're going to do one or
the other of the sides.

409
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:55,180
And just sort of going with the
box, this is our box, right?

410
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,110
It's sort of the indent,
followed by the final indent.

411
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,037
The else is really
kind of part of it.

412
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,620
And then we can draw
the picture here.

413
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,160
It has one entry and one exit.

414
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,670
OK, so we have one-way ifs.

415
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,950
And we have two-way ifs.

416
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,463
And now we have multi-way ifs.

417
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:16,110

418
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:23,540
So here is a multi-way if.

419
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:29,430
And it introduces a
new reserved word--

420
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,240
elif, which is a
combination of else and if.

421
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,020
And this one probably just as
easy to talk about the picture

422
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,950
here.

423
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,670
The first question is asked.

424
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,650
There's still going
to only be one.

425
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,870
One, and only one, of these
three choices are going to run.

426
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,500
Once it's run one,
then it's done.

427
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,410
So the way to think about
this, if x is less than two,

428
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,577
we're going to run this one.

429
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:57,785
And then we're going to kind
of flush all the way out

430
00:18:57,785 --> 00:18:58,760
to the bottom.

431
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,340
If x is not less than two,
and it's less than 10,

432
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,300
we're going to run this one
and flush out the bottom.

433
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,330
And if x is not less than two,
and x is not less than 10,

434
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,660
we're going to run this one
and flush out the bottom.

435
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:18,590
So one of these three-- one,
two, three-- is going to run.

436
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,490
And it's going to run
based on the questions that

437
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,570
are being asked.

438
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,690
The questions do get
asked in an order.

439
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,010
And the order does matter.

440
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,530
So that is a multi-way if.

441
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,690
If elif else-- so this is
kind of like an otherwise.

442
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,429
The else is like an otherwise.

443
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,470
One way or another, we're
going to run something.

444
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,080
And if none of these first two
have run, we will run this one.

445
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,450
We call it a multi-way if.

446
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,260

447
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,650
So here's a example
of our multi-way if.

448
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,070
If we say x equals 0-- x
= 0-- is it less than two?

449
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,130
Yes, it is.

450
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,480
So we run small, print "Small."

451
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,150
And then we flush
out the bottom.

452
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:08,140
If we switch instead x to 5--
x is 5-- is it less than 2?

453
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,480
No, it is not less than 2.

454
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,410
Is it less than 10?

455
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,740
Well, 5 is less than 10,
so the answer is yes.

456
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,060
So we print "Medium," then
we flush out the bottom.

457
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,090
One, and only one,
are going to execute.

458
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,290
Now, in this case,
we got x is 20.

459
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,470
And so we come through here.

460
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,430
Is it less than two?

461
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,630
No, it is not.

462
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,620
It is less than 10.

463
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,630
No, it is not.

464
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,300
So we're going to do this one,
and then flush out the bottom.

465
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,440
If we go here,
it's false, false.

466
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,379
Go here-- all else being
equal, we run that one.

467
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:39,920
So this one doesn't
run, and that one

468
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,530
doesn't run, because
these are like gateways.

469
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,630
If it were true,
it would run it.

470
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,890
But it's false, so
we're going to skip.

471
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,580
This one is false, so
we're going to skip it.

472
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,040
But then we hit the else.

473
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,460
That's like a catch-all.

474
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,010
And then if none
of these were true,

475
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,388
then it will run the else.
