1129
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,480
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs
I doubt it.

1130
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,310
If you are, maybe
you're a computer.

1131
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,730
Maybe I'm talking to computers.

1132
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:44,992
Maybe you're all computers!

1133
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:46,200
I'm certainly not a computer.

1134
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,324
Maybe you're all computers.

1135
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,290
OK, enough of that.

1136
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,280
No, that's probably
not how you did it.

1137
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,530
What you probably did,
was you had your eyes

1138
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:57,380
move around the whole
thing very rapidly,

1139
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,170
and the first thing
that you figured out

1140
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,210
is that there were
one-digit blobs,

1141
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,330
there were small, medium,
and large blobs of purple.

1142
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,680
And the first thing you
knew, right away, was

1143
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,370
there was no point at looking
at any of the small blobs.

1144
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,800
Your brain just threw the
blobs away really quick.

1145
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,790
Then you say, OK, given that
there's no four-digit numbers,

1146
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,310
there are three-digit numbers.

1147
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,101
Then, what you probably
did, is you started

1148
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:25,670
looking for the first digit.

1149
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:28,930
You say, look, there's some
ones, is there any twos?

1150
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,000
Quickly you decided
there are no twos.

1151
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,660
So you knew that you had
to look for the big blobs

1152
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,230
and the second
digit was probably

1153
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,560
the thing that mattered.

1154
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,950
Then you start getting
to the nines-- you say,

1155
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,490
OK, there's some nines.

1156
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:44,367
So that means it's
one nine something.

1157
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:46,700
Then that was the part that
you probably had to go check

1158
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,230
to find the-- oh, where
the heck was the 190?

1159
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,480
Ugh.

1160
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,340
Oh, 198.

1161
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,130
Right there.

1162
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,220
Had it color coded,
I could even see it.

1163
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,360
OK

1164
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:04,500
But the point is, humans
are great at eliminating

1165
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,560
bad solutions really fast.

1166
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,470
And you probably
looked at how big,

1167
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,854
how much purple was on the,
screen eliminating the areas

1168
00:50:12,854 --> 00:50:13,770
that were less purple.

1169
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:17,340
Because you know that your
brain quickly and instinctively

1170
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:23,210
knew that the more purple
meant a larger number.

1171
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,440
Computers don't do any of that.

1172
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,770
They don't do any of that.

1173
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:32,830
So, in order to make you feel
a little more like a computer,

1174
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:36,050
I have another test.

1175
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:40,560
And again, the goal is not
just to find a large number,

1176
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:46,290
but to monitor, as you go,
what your brain is thinking

1177
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,540
while you're doing this.

1178
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,760
OK?

1179
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,650
Do you get it?

1180
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,930
How are you attacking
the problem?

1181
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:56,520
What is your feeling as
you're attacking the problem?

1182
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,650
Are you a computer, or not?

1183
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,170
Here we go.

1184
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,878
I'm only going to give
you a few seconds.

1185
00:51:01,878 --> 00:51:20,840

1186
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:27,340
So, what did you get?

1187
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:33,240
My guess is that most of
you just said, I don't care.

1188
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,084
This is such a hard problem.

1189
00:51:36,084 --> 00:51:37,000
It's a stupid problem.

1190
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,070
Or, I'll try to turn my head
upside down, or something.

1191
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,780
It's a really hard problem.

1192
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,864
The other one was kind of easy.

1193
00:51:43,864 --> 00:51:45,280
You might not have
got it, but you

1194
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,260
had this natural
instinct that allows

1195
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,020
you to approach the problem.

1196
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,430
OK, I'll show you what
the right answer is.

1197
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:57,590
The right answer
is-- right there.

1198
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,460
It is 197.

1199
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,780
Yay.

1200
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,320
Right.

1201
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,110
You can't-- even if I tell
you, there you are-- you know,

1202
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:08,100
what is this?

1203
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,170
Is this 500 or 2 00?

1204
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,240
[MOANING]

1205
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,880
Actually, the only way I can do
this, is I flip it to find it.

1206
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,590
I mean, it's just not
what humans are good at.

1207
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:23,640
This is a little bit more like
how computers see the world.

1208
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,480
But the fact that the data
is frontwards or backwards

1209
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,190
should make no difference.

1210
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,230
Right?

1211
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,570
Computers need a strategy.

1212
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,800
We need to give them a strategy.

1213
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,570
OK.

1214
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,380
So here we go.

1215
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,420

1216
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:45,560
One last experiment.

1217
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,900
Now, I'm going to show
you numbers one at a time.

1218
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,920
And at the end, I
want you to tell me

1219
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,840
what the largest number
that you saw was.

1220
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,810
Ready?

1221
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,565
Here we go.

1222
00:52:58,565 --> 00:52:59,106
First number.
