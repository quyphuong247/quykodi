286
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,170
https://youtu.be/VXyRfgnzL2o
this x here comes
all the way back out.

287
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,280
So it lines up.

288
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,780
The rest of these
are kind of weird,

289
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,620
in that comments don't matter.

290
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,280
Blank lines don't matter.

291
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,670
And so it just is
sort of you have

292
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,650
to get mentally get used to the
notion that these don't count.

293
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,340
They can really,
cognitively mess you up.

294
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,540
So these don't count.

295
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,010
And now if I look through
it with the comments hidden,

296
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,310
it starts in column
one, ignore, ignore.

297
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:12,250
It goes in, stays in, ignore,
ignore, ignore, comes out.

298
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,240
So it all makes sense.

299
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,330
Those comments and blank lines
are just kind of confusion.

300
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,980
So increasing and decreasing
indent has meaning in Python.

301
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,370
We'll learn more
about this in a bit.

302
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,620
Our programs won't get
this complex right away,

303
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,600
but it's important to
think these indents aren't

304
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,000
just pretty, they actually
are communicating something

305
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,210
to Python.

306
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,420
And what they're communicating
is basically what's in a block.

307
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,060
And it shouldn't
take you very long

308
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,950
when you start looking at
Python to sort of visualize

309
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,280
these blocks.

310
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,480
So here's a big
block, this block here

311
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,630
that's got these three things.

312
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,380
And then this is
a block as well.

313
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,690
And you can kind of say,
well, here's an if statement.

314
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,280
And then these are the
two statements that

315
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,530
are part of that if statement.

316
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,830
So mentally you kind of
make these block pictures.

317
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,830
So here's another block.

318
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,402
This is that for loop.

319
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:05,360
This part's the indented
part, but then there's

320
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,769
a block inside of the block.

321
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,560
So you've got to start
seeing that as well.

322
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,360
So this is a block
that has to do--

323
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,450
this green block is the one
that has to do with the if.

324
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,700
And then there's a block here.

325
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,170
And then this is
a great big block,

326
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,720
because this is where
it finally de-indents.

327
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,480
So don't worry about it yet.

328
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,470
But at some point, you're going
to start seeing this indenting

329
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,430
and de-indenting as
defining blocks of code

330
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,514
for various purposes.

331
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:33,180
Now, we don't have
all the purposes yet,

332
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,550
but we'll get there.

333
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,860
So we saw in that previous
thing one block within a block.

334
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,600
And we're going to do that.

335
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,370
We can have ifs.

336
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,980
We can have loops
that get indented.

337
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,370
But then we can
indent even more.

338
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,290
We call that nested,
where there is

339
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,700
an indented area that's in an
area that's already indented.

340
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,470
So here's a nested decision.

341
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,380
And it might be easier
start on this side,

342
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,030
where I'm going to have a first
choice is x > 1, yes or no?

343
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,789
And if it's yes,
I'll do some work.

344
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,580
And then I'm going to
ask another question,

345
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,170
and if that's yes, then
I'm going to do this.

346
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,250
Then I'll come all
the way back in.

347
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,980
And the way we encode
this in Python is x = 42.

348
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,460
If x > 1, it's true.

349
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,810
So we continue
working in the indent.

350
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,480
And now we say, oh, if x <
100, which is still true.

351
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,610
So we go in farther.

352
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,760
And we do this.

353
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,080
And now we come out.

354
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,580
We don't come out to here.

355
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,730
We actually keep going
all the way to here.

356
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,970
So that ends both blocks.

357
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,970
And so if you sort of
think about this-- again,

358
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,490
this is where I want you to
start seeing what's in a block

359
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,410
of code, and what's
not in a block of code,

360
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,650
and how the indents put
a boundary on the blocks

361
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:51,000
of code-- the first thing you
should see is that purple part,

362
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,910
the x < 100 print.

363
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,030
That's kind of a box.

364
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,680
And you can see the box on
the flow diagram, as well.

365
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,070
The boxes are there.

366
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,640
The boxes on the
flow diagram are

367
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,475
places where there's one
entrance and one exit.

368
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:08,670

369
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,240
And then, there's also sort
of a larger box, right?

370
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,020
There's this if box that
includes the smaller box.

371
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,480
So there's this nesting,
which is boxes within boxes

372
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,470
or indented areas
within indented areas.

373
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:26,060

374
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,480
Now, that was what we call
a one-way decision, where

375
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,160
you're doing if, and this code
either runs or doesn't run.

376
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,150
It is extremely common to want
to basically say, look, I'm

377
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,580
going to do one of two things.

378
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,865
I'm going to ask a question.

379
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,990
If the question is true,
I'm going to do one thing.

380
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,281
If the question's false, I'm
going to do another thing.
