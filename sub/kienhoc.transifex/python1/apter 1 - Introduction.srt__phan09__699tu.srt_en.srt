753
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,250
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs
and I want you go
back, and remember

754
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,630
that x I gave you before?

755
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,350
Go get that one back, and add
50 to that, and put that in one.

756
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,600
So now, I've got something in
x and I got something in y.

757
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,110
And, let's print y out.

758
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,970

759
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,060
What's in y?

760
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,570
Go look in y, where you put
that, and let's print it out.

761
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,200
150.

762
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,120
So, we're doing simple things.

763
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,802
And, actually, most programming
is a series of simple things.

764
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:21,760
The number of statements,
different statements,

765
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,130
you can do is relatively few.

766
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,450
So we are talking to Python.

767
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,880
Let's run back to the slides.

768
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,960
There we go.

769
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,960
And so, we give it a
series of commands,

770
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,440
and you can do the same thing
sitting on your computer,

771
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,800
and you type exit or
quit, with parentheses,

772
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,460
to get out of it
when you're done.

773
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,120
And that ends the
interactive session.

774
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,680
This is interactive
Python, where

775
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,080
it's asking us
command by command

776
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,270
and then interpreting, or
running those commands,

777
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,620
as we finish.

778
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,270
So, you'll be doing in
some kind of a window.

779
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,170
There's a different way
to do it on Windows.

780
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,710
My install documentation
on pythonlearn.com

781
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,960
gives you all of this,
tells you everything to do.

782
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,830
So now we're basically
talking to Python.

783
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,199
So what language?

784
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,320
I've got to still teach
you this language.

785
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,790
So what we say when we
get a hold of Python,

786
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,810
what kinds of things?

787
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:23,659
Just like any language, a human
language, there's vocabulary,

788
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,860
there's basic words,
there's variables

789
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,830
and reserved words in Python.

790
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,300
Then we combine those
in lines to make

791
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,590
sentence-like structures,
that themselves are not

792
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,710
a full story.

793
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,020
And then we make
a story out of it.

794
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,120
Now, the story is in
the Python language, not

795
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,989
English or French,
or a human language,

796
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:46,800
but it still is kind of a
sequence of small pieces

797
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,000
that build to make
bigger pieces that then

798
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,630
build to make a whole program.

799
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,590
So here is, again,
that same program.

800
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,230
Right?

801
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,100
That same program
of how to count

802
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,520
the most common word in a file.

803
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,900
And I mentioned before, that
it starts by opening the file,

804
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,590
it reads the data from the
file, splits it into words,

805
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,700
counts them all up, and
then finds the biggest one

806
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,230
and prints it out.

807
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,940
So, name is like a word, equals
is another word, raw is a word.

808
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,420
All these things are
words; each of these things

809
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,740
is like a sentence.

810
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,680
There are blocks of stuff,
they're kind of paragraphs.

811
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,985
There's kind of a
paragraph, paragraph-- maybe

812
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:29,230
I should put a
different color here--

813
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,500
here's a paragraph and a
paragraph and a paragraph.

814
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,050
And then at the end of the
day, once you understand it--

815
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,300
and you will understand
this before it's all over--

816
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,520
this is kind of like a story.

817
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,020
Right?

818
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,330
It holds together, it has
a beginning, a middle,

819
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,840
and an end.

820
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,190
Again, don't worry
about the detail.

821
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,520
We've got plenty of chapters
to cover this detail.

822
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,490
Don't worry about this
particular program.

823
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,520
I'm just sort of getting into
the sense that you'll get it.

824
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,640
But we'll start simple.

825
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,830
So, the first thing
that you've got

826
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:04,040
to know how to do in Python,
is know what not to do.

827
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,140
Or, when you use
these reserved words,

828
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,380
they have very special
meaning to Python.

829
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,510
It's like when you
say, I don't think

830
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,900
you're going to get any
food today, to a dog.

831
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,660
The dog hears the word
"food" and nothing else.

832
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,880
So food is a reserved
word for dogs.

833
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,580
Walk, bath-- they're
other reserved words.

834
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,080
So what it really means is, you
can't use these for anything

835
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,520
other than what
they mean to Python.

836
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,400
So, print tells it
to print things.

837
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,350
Return is used in functions.

838
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,600
"Else", "if"-- these
are words that if Python

839
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,450
sees the word "if", it's
like, this means something.

840
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,830
Don't use it for any other
purpose except it's stated

841
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,630
purpose; we'll learn
what those are.

842
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,970
Now if we talk about sentences,
sentences are, in Python,

843
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,750
like a line that
have pieces to them.

844
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,880
So, here is three
pieces of code.

845
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,300
One is x equals 2.

846
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,240
That says, take and find me a
piece of memory in your RAM,
