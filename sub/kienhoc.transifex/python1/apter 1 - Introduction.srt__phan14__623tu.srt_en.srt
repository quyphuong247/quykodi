1223
00:52:59,106 --> 00:53:12,020
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs

1224
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,747
What was the largest number?

1225
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:21,380

1226
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,940
As a matter of fact, how
did you solve that problem?

1227
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,046
You solved that
problem, most likely,

1228
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:29,920
because you didn't--
you couldn't look at all

1229
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,800
the numbers the same time, so
you probably created a variable

1230
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,530
in your head without
even knowing it.

1231
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,280
And you put into
that variable, you

1232
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,320
called the variable, the
largest number I've seen so far.

1233
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,600
And you hadn't seen
any, so let's say

1234
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,625
the largest number you've
seen so far is negative 1.

1235
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,870
Then, I showed you 3.

1236
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:55,910
And you said yourself,
well, negative 1

1237
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,202
is no longer the largest
number I've seen,

1238
00:53:58,202 --> 00:53:59,452
so I'm going to keep that one.

1239
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:01,910
I'll keep 3, that's
largest I've seen so far.

1240
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,930
And now I see 41.

1241
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:08,340
41 is larger than 3,
so I will keep that.

1242
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,490
And now I see 12.

1243
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:13,550
Now, 12 is crap because it's
nowhere near as good as 41.

1244
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,830
So I'm keeping 41.

1245
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:17,694
9.

1246
00:54:17,694 --> 00:54:18,560
9.

1247
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,490
Not nearly as good as 41,
so I'll throw that away.

1248
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:22,750
74?

1249
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:23,670
Better, better.

1250
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:24,170
Keep it.

1251
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,330
Keep that one.

1252
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,450
So I'll keep 74.

1253
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,279
And the last number's 15.

1254
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:30,820
Don't even know it's
the last number,

1255
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,540
but we don't want
to keep that one.

1256
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,650
And so now, we're done.

1257
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,000
So we know that at the end,
what was during the loop

1258
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,079
the largest so far,
is the actual largest

1259
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:42,870
of all the numbers.

1260
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:47,330
And we don't remember exactly
how many numbers there were.

1261
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:49,150
So that's like thinking
like a program.

1262
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,360
This kind of sliding window.

1263
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,730
Didn't matter if I gave you
a billion numbers or five

1264
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:57,070
numbers-- I think the were
five numbers, actually.

1265
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:00,130
This notion of the largest
so far is a powerful notion.

1266
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,320
As a matter of fact, it's
central to the program

1267
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,450
I've been showing you.

1268
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,970
I don't want you try
to understand this,

1269
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:14,050
but this part in the purple--
this part in the purple

1270
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:18,070
is really saying, I'm going to
loop through the counts of all

1271
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:18,600
the words.

1272
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,310
So it's got a word
like, "the" is 15 times

1273
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,370
and "clown" is four times.

1274
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:27,290
And it's going to loop through
all the pairs of word value

1275
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,630
combinations.

1276
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,130
And it's going to
basically say, I'm

1277
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,565
going to go through
the counts that I have,

1278
00:55:32,565 --> 00:55:34,940
and I'm going to check to see
is the count I'm looking at

1279
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,820
is bigger than the biggest
count I've seen so far.

1280
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,450
And if it is, I'm
going to remember it.

1281
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:42,600
Now don't worry about this.

1282
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,141
We haven't covered
any of this stuff.

1283
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,790
That's a chapter two,
three, four, five, six.

1284
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:51,100
But this is an
algorithm, a paragraph,

1285
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,300
a pattern that allows you
to find the largest number.

1286
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,855
And we'll look at this
again in great detail

1287
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,500
in upcoming chapters.

1288
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,280
So this is thinking
like a computer,

1289
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,930
having the sliding window
across the long list of numbers

1290
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,220
and coming up with
something that

1291
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,420
is the answer that you need.

1292
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,220

1293
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,500
OK.

1294
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,660
So that's the end
of this lecture.

1295
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,230
Read chapter one.

1296
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:21,160
Write your hello world program.

1297
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,620
Make sure if you haven't,
get Python installed.

1298
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:28,500
As you read this chapter, and
even as you install Python,

1299
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,040
and even as you write
the first program,

1300
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,440
don't get too stuck
on the details.

1301
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,880
I was confused for like
eight weeks-- well,

1302
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,840
probably six weeks-- in my
first programming class.

1303
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,620
You'll be confused, too.

1304
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,240
Just sort of wander
through with me.

1305
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,990
Keep at it.

1306
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:48,810
It will start making sense at
some point that's up to you.

1307
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,960
I can't tell you when
it's going to make sense.

1308
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,560
So, don't stare at
everything until you get it,

1309
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,920
just keep digging in and keep
understanding and keep playing,

1310
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,820
and sooner or later this will
make a lot of sense to you.

1311
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,380
I promise you.

1312
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,400
See you next lecture.

1313
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,171
