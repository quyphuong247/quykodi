Python, than to teach
Python to listen

660
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,390
to whatever you have to say.

661
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,210
Things like Google make
it seem intelligent,

662
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,120
so that you kind of type
anything to Google, right?

663
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,300
Well, yeah, billions of dollars
later, Google for at least

664
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,430
like short things,
can seem like it knows

665
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,200
what you're talking about.

666
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,780
In terms of programming,
it's a lot easier for you

667
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,270
to figure out the exact, precise
way to say it, rather than make

668
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,095
it so that we have to spend a
billion dollars on something

669
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:13,300
like Python to figure out what
you mean in your programs.

670
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,870
So, let's start
talking to Python.

671
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,640
We're talking to Python.

672
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,700
So if you've installed
Python properly,

673
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,440
whether it's on a Mac or a
Windows or on a Raspberry Pi,

674
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,020
at some point you'll be
in a terminal program

675
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,196
and you'll type Python to make
Python run in interactive mode.

676
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:36,570
You might have type C colon
backslash something something

677
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,170
Python in Windows.

678
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,730
But at some point,
you're running Python.

679
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,270
Now Python, itself,
is a program.

680
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,840
It's a program
that is asking you

681
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,701
to type the Python language.

682
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:49,200
Now the interesting
thing is, you've

683
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,640
got this Chevron
prompt here, and it's

684
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,810
kind of another
version of what's next.

685
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,260
I told you that
this hardware was

686
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,020
designed to always want the
next instruction to come in.

687
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,540
Well, Python, once we
start it, it really

688
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,620
has no idea what to do.

689
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,960
It is waiting for you
tell it what to do, OK?

690
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,730
So, let me see if I can
pop something up here.

691
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,790
So here we go.

692
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,510
Clear that.

693
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,610
And now I'm going to type--
get this a little closer--

694
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,900
I'm going to start Python.

695
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,450
So it's the operating system
now is asking me, what next?

696
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,590
And I'm saying, oh, the
thing I want to do next

697
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,420
is I want to run Python.

698
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,690
So, here we are.

699
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,750
We're sitting in the
Python interpreter.

700
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,360
And it's asking, what next?

701
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,320
OK?

702
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,160
Now, it's like I just
landed on a planet,

703
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,620
and it's like, take
me to your leader.

704
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,460

705
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,890
Take me to your leader.

706
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,240
That's what you always say
when you land on a planet

707
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,730
and are confronted by
some kind of a robot.

708
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,560
And it says, syntax error.

709
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,710
Remember it's a dog.

710
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,105
It should just say, arf, right?

711
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:05,730
I could say, take me
me to your leader.

712
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,770
Arf.

713
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,270
OK?

714
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,530

715
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,585
Are you friendly?

716
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:17,070

717
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,990
I don't think I
spelled friendly right.

718
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,890
Syntax error.

719
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:25,340

720
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,290
Are you dumb?

721
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,130

722
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,620
Syntax error.

723
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,100
Pretty dumb.

724
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,710
I hate computers.

725
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:41,590

726
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,990
Syntax error.

727
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,561
It doesn't seem to
have a sense of humor.

728
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:46,060
Try this.

729
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,940
Knock knock Knock knock.

730
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,750

731
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,760
No sense of humor.

732
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,850
So here's the
problem, it wants us--

733
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,910
it doesn't hate
us-- it just wants

734
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,920
to know what we want done.

735
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,280
So, we need to know
the Python language.

736
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,440
Luckily, I know a bit of Python.

737
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,345
So I'm going to say,
hmm, hey, Python,

738
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:16,350
I'm going to want some data.

739
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,520
I want to make a variable
named x-- just a little place

740
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,040
in your memory, go find it.

741
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,250
Go find one of your
spare places in memory.

742
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:29,450
And I want you to
put 100 in that, OK?

743
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,400
Do that.

744
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,390
Now, it's happy, because
I know the language.

745
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,371
Bonjour.

746
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,580
So we know the language.

747
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,940
But it's saying, what next?

748
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,740
So we have to put a program in.

749
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,480
So, let's see.

750
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,952
I'm going to say,
hey, Python, I'm

751
00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:49,410
going to make a
variable called y--

752
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,750
another area in your
memory-- labeled y,
