00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,535

Any questions?

477
00:20:58,535 --> 00:21:01,740

478
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,647
OK, well, I'm going to ask
you a question in a second.

479
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:11,570

480
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,220
OK, so just a couple of
things that probably you're

481
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,050
wondering about.

482
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,240
You don't actually need an else.

483
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,680
You can have a multi-way.

484
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,610
X = 5, if x < 2,
there is no else here.

485
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,380
You'll notice that this
print just comes back.

486
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,702
And so this way it could,
if both of these are false,

487
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,660
skip them both and just
run right through here,

488
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,800
and there's no else clause.

489
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,150
OK, so in this case, the
way this one's going to run

490
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,620
is x = 5.

491
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,410
If x < 2, it's not.

492
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,910
And it skips to here.

493
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,620
Else if x < 10, which it is,
it will run that one and come

494
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,160
here.

495
00:21:49,160 --> 00:22:00,050
But for a different value
of x, like 95, if x was 59,

496
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,920
this would be false.

497
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,690
It would skip it.

498
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,572
This elif would still be false.

499
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,280
It would skip it.

500
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,970
And the only thing that would
print out would be "All done."

501
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:14,190
OK, you can also
have many elifs.

502
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,059
So better change to green.

503
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:18,850
It checks this one.

504
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,060
If it's true, it
runs the first one.

505
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,476
If it's false it,
checks this one.

506
00:22:21,476 --> 00:22:25,160
If that's true, it runs
this one, and then it skips.

507
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,130
And so the way to
think about this

508
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,500
is it just goes through
and checks this one false,

509
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,210
this one false, false, false.

510
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,930
Oh, I finally found one.

511
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,150
And now I'm done.

512
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,470
It still is going to do
one, and only one, of these.

513
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,330
This one has an else, so sooner
or later it is going to do one.

514
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,450
And it only will do the else
if all of these are false.

515
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,920
All have to be false.

516
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,094
Then it will actually come
and hit the else clause.

517
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,635
It's great, because there are
lots of situations where you're

518
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:58,280
like, oh, is it before
8:00 in the morning,

519
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,890
or is it between 8:00 and noon,
or is it between noon and 5:00,

520
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,940
or after 5:00, after midnight?

521
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,350
So here coming up is a question.

522
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,354
And there's two puzzles.

523
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:16,770
And I'm going to stop so you
can look at them for a while.

524
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,200
And I want you to figure
out, in both sides of this,

525
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,580
which of the lines
will not execute,

526
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,660
regardless of the value for x.

527
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,830
So on both sides,
there is a line

528
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,990
that won't execute, regardless
of the value of the x.

529
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,200
Which will never print?

530
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,650
There's two problems--
problem A problem B. OK, I'll

531
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,284
have some coffee
while you think.

532
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:55,000

533
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,620
OK, hopefully you paused it,
so that you could actually

534
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,064
think for a bit.

535
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,480
So I'm going to
guess you probably

536
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,470
got the first one right.

537
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,720
That's pretty straightforward.

538
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,304
I mean, actually you're in great
shape if you got both of them

539
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:06,803
right.

540
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:09,040
If you got any of them
right, you're in great shape,

541
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,430
because that means you're
starting to get it.

542
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,013
It's starting to
like, oh, I am seeing

543
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:14,230
kind of this flow picture.

544
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,380
There's a picture.

545
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,570
I look at these characters
that seemingly looked

546
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,600
like gibberish and
a picture arises,

547
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,730
or a pattern of
execution arises.

548
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,220
That's what we want to see.

549
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,025
So in the first one,
which will never print?

550
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:30,650
Well, we're looking
for kind of a value

551
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,860
for x which will be defective.

552
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,374
So if x is less than two,
we're going to do this else.

553
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:38,040
If x is greater than or equal to
2, we're going to do this else,

554
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,950
we'll do that.

555
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,390
Well, here's the
problem with this one.

556
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,860
For all values of x, x < 2
is either going to be true,

557
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:53,949
or for x >= 2 is
going to be true.

558
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:56,490
So it's going to run this one,
or it's going to run that one.

559
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,056
So for big numbers--
numbers above 2--

560
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,180
it's going to run this one.

561
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,680
Below 2, it's going
to run that one.

562
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,060
So this one is
never going to run,

563
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,190
because one of the first
two is going to be true.

564
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,300
And so the third else
situation is not going to run.

565
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,520
Hope you got that right.

566
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,500
OK, so let's take a
look at the next one.

567
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,951
So the question is, is x < 2 2?

568
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:19,450
Do this.

569
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,290
If x <20, do that.

570
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,260
And if x < 10, do this,
and otherwise do that.
