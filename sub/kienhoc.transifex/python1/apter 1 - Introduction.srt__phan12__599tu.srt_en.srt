1035
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,969
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs
And that way, we can
control the loop.

1036
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:49,510
We can decide when
it starts and when

1037
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,230
it stops we can tell if we're
at the beginning, or the end,

1038
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,820
or the first one,
or the last one.

1039
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,500
We'll do a lot of
stuff with loops.

1040
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,430
This is an iteration
variable because we iterate,

1041
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,740
repeatedly iterate,
through the loop.

1042
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,240
OK?

1043
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,200

1044
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,350
Any questions?

1045
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:06,580
[CHUCKLES]

1046
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,850
Can't do questions.

1047
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,380
OK.

1048
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,920
So now, if we go back
to the little story

1049
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,260
that I-- you've got several
chapters to understand,

1050
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:15,950
don't worry.

1051
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,050
You actually got like
through chapter nine,

1052
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,190
so don't try to understand
this program right now.

1053
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,600
I'm just trying to give you a
sense of what the picture is

1054
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,780
going to be, right?

1055
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,360
So here are some
sequential statements

1056
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,720
because they aren't indented.

1057
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,100
Those five lines are sequential.

1058
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,190
They just go one
after the other.

1059
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,280
Then we have four.

1060
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,040
And it's indented.

1061
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,280
This is a loop.

1062
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,520
This is going to run
a bunch of times.

1063
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,550
Then we're done with that, we
do some more sequential stuff.

1064
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,080
Now we have a four
loop, and that's

1065
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,470
going to run a bunch of times.

1066
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:54,230
And then we have an if,
which may or may not run.

1067
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,530
So this little block of
code is conditionally

1068
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,290
executed, based on
something, and here's

1069
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,760
the question we're asking.

1070
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,922
So that's the question.

1071
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:05,380
And then at the
end, we do a print.

1072
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,450
Now, again, don't try to
make too much sense of this.

1073
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,630
I'm just trying to
show you sequential,

1074
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,832
repeated, repeated, conditional.

1075
00:46:15,832 --> 00:46:16,650
OK?

1076
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:20,700
Just those concepts show up
in pretty much every program

1077
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,380
that we build.

1078
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,260
OK.

1079
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,390
So let's do a couple
more little exercises

1080
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,040
that get you sort of in the
mindset of being a programmer.

1081
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,530
And how programmers tend to
have to think about problems

1082
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,490
a little bit differently.

1083
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,530
So here we go.

1084
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,340
This, I call this an
animated short story.

1085
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,610
And your job, I'm going to give
you several sets of numbers,

1086
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:48,000
and I want you to
find the largest

1087
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,760
number in the list of numbers.

1088
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,230
Now, it's not so important to
know what the large number is,

1089
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,760
but also to think about how
your mind attacks the problem.

1090
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,690
What your eyes are
doing, what your mind

1091
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,750
is doing, how you break
a bigger problem down

1092
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,510
into smaller problems.

1093
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,970
How a human solves this problem.

1094
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,750
And then we'll focus on how
a computer might have to look

1095
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,300
at the problem differently, OK?

1096
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,900
So don't just get the answer,
that's not so important.

1097
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,870
Think about how
you get the answer.

1098
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,750
So don't just scroll ahead in
your YouTube and cheat and go

1099
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,080
get the answer.

1100
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,380
Think about actually
solving the problem,

1101
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,550
and then monitor what your
brain is thinking as it goes.

1102
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,620
So, here we go.

1103
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,460
So I'm going to give
you a list of numbers

1104
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:35,110
and you are tell me what
the largest number is.

1105
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,020
Ready?

1106
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,066
Set.

1107
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:37,566
Go.

1108
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:49,540

1109
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,137
I didn't make it easy.

1110
00:47:51,137 --> 00:47:52,720
You're looking for
the largest number.

1111
00:47:52,720 --> 00:48:05,370

1112
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,810
Did you get it?

1113
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:08,126
Did you get it?

1114
00:48:08,126 --> 00:48:09,750
Did you have to go
back a couple times?

1115
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,730
Actually, I don't care
what the answer is.

1116
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,560
The question is-- how
was your brain solving?

1117
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,060
OK.

1118
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,010
You probably want
to know what it is.

1119
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,710
The answer is 198.

1120
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,140
That was the largest number.

1121
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,890
Of course what I was
doing is I was moving

1122
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:26,320
it to make it difficult.
But here's the thing--

1123
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,745
how do humans look at this?

1124
00:48:29,745 --> 00:48:33,150
Do humans-- did you look at
25, then you looked at 1,

1125
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,270
then you looked at 114,
did you just look at them

1126
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,890
slowly one at a time?

1127
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,160
Like this?

1128
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,230
Or no?
