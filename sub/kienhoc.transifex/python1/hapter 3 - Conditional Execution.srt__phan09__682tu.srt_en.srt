761
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,130
https://youtu.be/VXyRfgnzL2o
And if it works, it's great.

762
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,380
And if it fails, it runs this
and sets it to negative 1.

763
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,820
And afterwards, we either have
the number or a negative 1.

764
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:17,409
And so, if the person enters
42, it says nice work.

765
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:19,409
Let's show you where it runs.

766
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:22,989
If the person says 42,
it runs through here,

767
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:25,340
gets the string 42,
converts that to an integer,

768
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,030
skips here, and
then says nice work.

769
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,639
And that's how it runs.

770
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,710
If on the other hand,
they type fortytwo--

771
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,040
the words-- this gets to
be the string fortytwo.

772
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,370
It runs here.

773
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:43,100
This blows up, so it comes
and runs this part here.

774
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,500
And then it says if ival
> 0, which is not true.

775
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,500
So it runs this part
and says not a number.

776
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,370
So this is our way of
compensating for user input

777
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,630
that might have errors in it.

778
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,800
Errors that we're anticipating,
because you'd rather

779
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,580
at least put up some
kind of a message,

780
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,080
rather than just
have a traceback,

781
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,810
if you're writing code
for somebody else.

782
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,950
It just kind of is
not very classy.

783
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:16,100

784
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,090
The classic program
to do this is a time

785
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,590
and a half for overtime pay.

786
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,200

787
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,050
So you get some pay
rate, like $10 an hour

788
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,320
for your first 40 hours.

789
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,190
And then you get 15 hours
for any hours above it.

790
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,700
So you have to sort of
say, OK, if this ends up

791
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,040
being some kind
of a thing where--

792
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,460
let me draw that picture
a little better--

793
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,019
hours greater than 40,
you're going to do one thing.

794
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:46,560
And if hours are
less than 40, you're

795
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,760
going to do another thing.

796
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,800
So you have two
payout calculations.

797
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,630
If the hours are
greater than 40,

798
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,180
then you're going to do
overtime calculation, which

799
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,870
is kind of like 40
times the regular rate,

800
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,650
and then the number of excess
hours, like 5 overtime hours,

801
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,620
times the rate times 1 and 1/2.

802
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,370
So this is kind
of the calculation

803
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,530
that happens if the hours
are greater than 40.

804
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,260
And then if the hours
are less than 40,

805
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,660
it's just pay equals
rate times hours.

806
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,500
So you're going to do
one of two calculations,

807
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,950
depending on how it works.

808
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:27,710
So that's one of the programming
problems for this chapter.

809
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,300
That's a classic.

810
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,892
Is the classic if then else.

811
00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:33,100
You can actually do it with
if then if you're tricky.

812
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,650
There's a lot of
ways to do this.

813
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,840
So pick one and do it.

814
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,630
Now, the next thing
I want you to do

815
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,810
is I want you to take
that same program,

816
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:48,730
do it again in another
assignment, or another problem

817
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,500
in the chapter, and have some
kind of a non-numeric input

818
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,470
and have it blow up.

819
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:59,900
So if they type something
like nine, put out an error.

820
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,490
Or if they type something
here put out an error.

821
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:07,100
Now, don't write
a loop-- no loop.

822
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,160
This is one execution
of the program.

823
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,107
And this is another
execution program.

824
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:12,190
Later, we can write loops.

825
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,648
We haven't even
talked about loops.

826
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,220
So this is running it twice.

827
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,700
All I want you to do is exit.

828
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,240
So take a look in the book
as to how to just get out.

829
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,750
So I don't want
you to try to say,

830
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,810
I'm going to prompt for these
numbers until I get a good one.

831
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,880
We'll do that later.

832
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,060
I just want you to deal with
the fact that you read a thing.

833
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,827
You use the try to convert to
a float and see if it works.

834
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:36,160
And if you don't, you just quit.

835
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,410
Don't try to be tricky
and repeatedly prompt.

836
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,230
So don't repeatedly prompt.

837
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,676
One prompt, and then quit.

838
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:50,750

839
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,800
So this is conditional
execution-- if, if then else,

840
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,340
and then I added a
little bit with the try

841
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,780
and except as well.

842
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,230
And the try/except is really
a limited kind of a problem.

843
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,130
It really is to compensate
for errors that you

844
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,720
anticipate are going to happen.

845
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,180
And you can imagine
what you want

846
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,770
to do as a replacement
for what those errors are.

847
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,620
See you next lecture.
