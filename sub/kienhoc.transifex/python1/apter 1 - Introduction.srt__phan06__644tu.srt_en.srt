471
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,250
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs
And, I just said all that, OK?

472
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,410
So then, the question is,
where do you belong in this?

473
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,670
Where do programs live?

474
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,060
Where do we write?

475
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,300
And the answer is, we
live in the memory, right?

476
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,490
What we do is, we put our
programs into the memory,

477
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,370
and then the CPU pulls the
programs out of the memory.

478
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,600
So we have to write our programs
and put them into the memory.

479
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,242
When we start them
and run them, we're

480
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:01,700
really loading them
into the memory

481
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,800
so they can be fed
rapidly to the CPU.

482
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,970
Now the computers
don't really execute

483
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,700
Python, like, if x
less than 3, print,

484
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,500
but that's what we
tend to want to write.

485
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,130
Because what the computers
really execute is this thing

486
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,620
called machine languages,
which is a series of 0s and 1s

487
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,590
that pretty much
translate directly

488
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,010
to what's on these pins.

489
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,020
There's voltages
that go up and down.

490
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,930
That's called machine language.

491
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,920
Source code, like
Python, is written

492
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,300
in a way that's most convenient.

493
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,380
Well, at least more convenient.

494
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,780
Machine language is what's most
convenient for the hardware.

495
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,380
So we have to translate
from source code

496
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,270
to machine language.

497
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,820
And that's what the Python
program does for us.

498
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,420
We write in Python,
and Python translates

499
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,090
to machine language for us.

500
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,350
So I got a couple of
videos they give you

501
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,680
a sense of how this all works.

502
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,549
We'll start with CPU.

503
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,090
And what this is
going to do, is this

504
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,660
is going to show you
the intensity of how

505
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,990
much electricity--
that thing that

506
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,000
gets hot inside your computer
is this little guy right here.

507
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,765
And we're going to see in this
video just how hot it can get.

508
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:15,140

509
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,189
OK, so welcome back.

510
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:18,980
So the next thing I'm
going to show you-- I

511
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,260
showed you a hard
disk that didn't work,

512
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,760
but we're actually
going to show you

513
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,160
real short video on
how a hard disk works

514
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,720
that someone took the cover
off and actually applied power

515
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,350
to it.

516
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,808
You don't want to
do this yourself,

517
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,310
if you have a hard drive.

518
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,780
I've read, and some people
say, that you can do it

519
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,400
for a few minutes
and then the drive

520
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,720
destroys itself if you
run it with the cover off.

521
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,940
So let's take a look at this.

522
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:53,300

523
00:22:53,300 --> 00:23:00,600
OK, so now we're going to talk
a little bit about Python.

524
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,820
Python is a
programming language.

525
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,870
Python is a way
that we communicate.

526
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,400
Now, Python wasn't
invented by computers.

527
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,980
We invented Python,
as humans, as a way

528
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,960
to encapsulate our instructions.

529
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,560
There's lots of different
programming languages-- Python,

530
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,194
JavaScript C++, tons of them.

531
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:22,610
Python is just one
of them that we

532
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,140
happen to teach in this class.

533
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,640
Now, I'll start with a little
Harry Potter reference.

534
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,410
Parseltongue is the language
of serpents and those

535
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,720
who converse with them.

536
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,810
An individual who can
speak Parseltongue

537
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,220
is known as a Parselmouth.

538
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,470
And it's a very uncommon skill
and maybe even hereditary.

539
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,540
Nearly all known
Parselmouth are descended

540
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,690
from Salazar Slytherin.

541
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,100
There's our Harry
Potter reference.

542
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,640
Python is the language
of the Python interpreter

543
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,750
and those who can
converse with it.

544
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,130
We are going to converse
with the inside of a computer

545
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,320
pretty soon.

546
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,040
An individual who
can speak Python,

547
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,080
is known as a Pythonista.

548
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,520
It is an uncommon skill
and may be hereditary.

549
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,210
May not be hereditary, too.

550
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,630
Nearly all known Pythonistas
use software initially developed

551
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,720
by Guido van Rossum.

552
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,250
Guido van Rossum,
this guy right here.

553
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,354
Yo, Guido, what's up?

554
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,520
Let's put a mustache on him.

555
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,950
Yo, Guido.

556
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,460
Sorry.

557
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,810
I should be nice to him.

558
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,320
He is the inventor of Python.

559
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,660
Python's over 20 years old.

560
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,000
He invented it to make
it an easy language,

561
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,500
but was both easy and powerful.

562
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,350
And that's why it's
a great language

563
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,780
to start your learning with.

564
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,530
It's a powerful
language, but it's also
