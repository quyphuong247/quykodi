00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,960
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs
It's really-- I think
it's very creative.

190
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
And it's what attracted
me to being a programmer

191
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,810
in the first place.

192
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,630
That I could leverage the
capabilities inside of here,

193
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,940
and I could do things, the cool
things, on behalf of the user.

194
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,620
So code, software, a program.

195
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,530
So, let's get a non-technical
example of this.

196
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,896
So, I'll have you link out
to the YouTube for this.

197
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:25,010
This is the Macarena.

198
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,470
The Macarena is a song that
has with it a well known dance

199
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,970
that everyone seems to know, or
either get taught very quickly.

200
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,289
So, I'll stop and let you
will watch the Macarena

201
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,100
and then come back.

202
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,280

203
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,799
So welcome back.

204
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,020
I hope you enjoyed that.

205
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,690
In a sense, what we've
got there, is a program.

206
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,220
A program for human beings.

207
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,800
And maybe you learned that
the club or something and they

208
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,380
told you what to do next.

209
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,100
Well, I can teach you how to
do the Macarena by writing

210
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,440
a simple program right now.

211
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,850
So here's my Macarena.

212
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,150
While the music plays, it
means you do it over and over

213
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,469
and over again, to the beat.

214
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,760
That's kind of like computers
they do things in a beat;

215
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,110
they happen at 3
billion beats a second,

216
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,204
but as it were-- we're going
to this multiple times.

217
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:15,995
So we have this whole
group of instructions

218
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:18,370
that we're going to do, right?

219
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,690
Left hand out and
up, right hand out

220
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,920
and up, flip left
hand, flip right hand,

221
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,880
left hand to right shoulder,
right hand to left shoulder,

222
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,180
et cetera, et cetera.

223
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,250
Now, this particular little
program has a mistake in it.

224
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,460
Actually several.

225
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,440
I want you look and see if
you can find the mistakes

226
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,065
in the program.

227
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:48,330

228
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,030
OK.

229
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,400
So here are the places
that have the mistake.

230
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,900
Right?

231
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:59,030
The mistake is right ham
to the back of the head,

232
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,040
and left hand to
right hit, not hip.

233
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,340
Now, if you're in a
bar and you take a ham

234
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,250
and you hit somebody in
the back of the head,

235
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,490
that's not very nice when
you're dancing to this song.

236
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,380
These are what's called bugs.

237
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,750
Now, a human reading
this would say,

238
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,010
I think they meant
to say hand here.

239
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,500
But a computer is much
more literal than people.

240
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,852
We'll see a couple of exercises
where we'll see that people can

241
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:28,940
correct little mistakes
like this, but computers,

242
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
they cannot.

243
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,860
Right?

244
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,891
So we have to fix these bugs.

245
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:34,640
And we have to say,
right hand and we have

246
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,260
to say, hip when we mean hip.

247
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,400
So we have to be explicit.

248
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,960
Computers do exactly
what we say they

249
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,830
don't do what we mean to do.

250
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,900
So let's clear that.

251
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,690
Here's another example.

252
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,010
OK, let's see how
this comes out.

253
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,650

254
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,590
You're supposed to count
the number of times

255
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,290
the word "the" appears
in this sentence.

256
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,360
Count it.

257
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,900
The word "the", how many times?

258
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:15,810

259
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,816
OK.

260
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:18,440
It's your turn.

261
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,660

262
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,360
Now here, this is not
something humans are good at.

263
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,930
I moved it around, I played a
little music, I confused you,

264
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,045
I put a picture of a clown car
in the upper left hand corner,

265
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:39,350
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

266
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,420
Now it turns out,
that computers,

267
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,600
once we tell them what to do,
are very good at concentration.

268
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,900
It can easily go
through 30 words

269
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,020
and find the most common
word, or 3 million words

270
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,350
and find the most common word.

271
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,770
And it'll never make a mistake.

272
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,780
But we first have to give
it a set of instructions.

273
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,540
So, I don't want you to
learn this right now,

274
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,780
but this is a Python program.

275
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,890
Let's say that I wanted let
you count words in files, OK?

276
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,430
I say, hey, I know
how to program Python.

277
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,820
I'll send you an email and
I'll send you this program.

278
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,720
Just stick it into Python and
it will count words for you.

279
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,970
You got a million words,
a million lines in a file,

280
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,990
you want to find the
most common word.

281
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,230
So I will send you this
file called words.py.

282
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,890
I spent little time, it's
a friendly gift to you.
