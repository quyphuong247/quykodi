191
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,030
https://youtu.be/IXXHH6ztsSA
does over 1 minus
x, which gives you

192
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,860
0.4, then it multiplies
these three things together,

193
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,540
giving 0.93.

194
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,490
And then what it is all
done with all of that,

195
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,615
it takes that 0.93, and
then puts it back into x.

196
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:05,240
And so this is just
sort of emphasizing

197
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,580
how the right-hand side is
computed to produce a value,

198
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,040
then it is moved
into the variable.

199
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,990
And that is why you can
have x on both sides.

200
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,690
Because this is like the
old, and this is the new.

201
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,520
The old x participates
in the calculation.

202
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,445
And then when the calculation
is done, it becomes the new x.

203
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:29,580
I hope that makes sense.

204
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,070
So this on the right-hand side
here is a numeric expression.

205
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,590
So we have a number of
different operators.

206
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,160
Some of them are instinctive,
intuitive, the plus

207
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,260
and the minus.

208
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,320
The reason some of these are
so weird is in really old days,

209
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,920
we didn't have too many
things on the keyboard.

210
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,054
And a lot of programs
are very mathematical.

211
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,720
And so they figured out what was
on the keyboard of the computer

212
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,710
equipment of the
day, and then they

213
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,080
had to fake certain things.

214
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,710
So it turns out that plus and
minus were on the keyboard.

215
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,500
And so plus and minus are
addition and subtraction

216
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,620
respectively.

217
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,570
There was no kind of times
operator for multiplication.

218
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,460
And dot was used
for decimal point.

219
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,470
So they used asterisks
for multiplication.

220
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,530
So in computers, languages,
nearly all of them,

221
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,770
they basically use a
times for multiplication.

222
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,860
Slash is used for division.

223
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,820
So we say like 8/2,
which is 8 divided by 2.

224
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,700
Raising something to the
power, like 4 squared,

225
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,260
that is double asterisk.

226
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:38,140
And then remainder is if
you do a division that

227
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,540
gives you the remainder
rather than divisor.

228
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,300
So 8 over 2 is 4, remainder 0.

229
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,006
So the remainder is what you get
with this particular operator.

230
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,380
There's a few cool
things that we

231
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,640
can do with remainder that we
won't talk about right away.

232
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,670
But it's there.

233
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,130
And so here's just a couple
of sample expressions.

234
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,976
I

235
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:05,000
Let's give me green, OK.

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,760
So again, I'm using
a Python interpreter.

237
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,360
So this is just the prompt.

238
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,790
The chevrons are the prompt.

239
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,700
Create the variable
xx, and assign it to 2.

240
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,550
Retrieve the old
value in an addition.

241
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,680
Then print it out and put it
back into xx, so xx has 4.

242
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,630
yy, this is a multiplication.

243
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,250
440 times 12 is 5,280.

244
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,500
yy over 1,000, this is
little counterintuitive.

245
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,350
Because yy is an
integer, it then

246
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,180
does it in a truncated division.

247
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,340
So 5,280 divided by 1,000 is 5.

248
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,230
And so that's an
integer division.

249
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,010
We'll see in a second about
floating point division.

250
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,550
Now we take the variable
jj and we set it to 23.

251
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,980
And now we're going to use
the modulo or remainder

252
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,280
operator to say what
is the remainder when

253
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,694
we divide this jj by 5.

254
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:03,110
And so if you think
about this, we

255
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,920
take old long division, 23
divided by 5, you end up

256
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,620
with 4, and then remainder 3.

257
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,590
The modulo operator, or the
percent, or the remainder

258
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,110
operator, gives us
back this number.

259
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,420
And so that's why kk is 3.

260
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,630
It is the remainder
of 23 when divided

261
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,140
by 5 or the remainder of
the division of 5 and 23.

262
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:34,770
And the raising to the
power 4 cubed is 4**3.

263
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,480
And so that end up being 64.

264
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,950
So that's just operations.

265
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,520
Now just like in
algebra and mathematics,

266
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,670
we have rules about which
operations happen first.

267
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,920
In general, things
like the power

268
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,120
happens before the
multiplication and division,

269
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,500
and then the addition
and subtraction happen.

270
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,070
So there are some rules when
you're looking at an expression

271
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,490
and trying to calculate
what its value is.

272
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,930
If you don't have parentheses,
it follows these rules.

273
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,350
And so the rule that sort
of trumps all the rules

274
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,390
is that parentheses
are always respected.

275
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,360
So a lot of us just write these
with parentheses in place, even

276
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,100
sometimes, though,
you don't need it.

277
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,030
Then after parentheses
have been handled,

278
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,950
then it does exponentiation.

279
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,340
Then it does multiplication,
division, and remainder.

280
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,150
And then it does
addition and subtraction.

281
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,110
And then, all else being equal,
it just works left to right.

282
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,930
So let's look
through an example.

283
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:46,040
So here is a calculation
that is 1 plus 2 times 3

284
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,450
divided by 4 over 5.

285
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,340
And the question is what
order does this happen?
