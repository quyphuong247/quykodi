283
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,590
https://youtu.be/G721cooZXgs
And this is what I
type in-- now I'll

284
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,060
give you kind of outline on
what this is going to do.

285
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,160
The first thing it's going to
do is open the file and read it.

286
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,540
Then it's going to split
the lines and files

287
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,880
into words based on the spaces.

288
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,730
Then it's going to run through
and accumulate numbers like,

289
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,850
this word is one,
this word is one,

290
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,974
oh I saw that one again
so I turned that to two.

291
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:51,890
That's what this does.

292
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,848
It's a loop, it goes
round and round and round,

293
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:55,440
one for each word.

294
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,530
Then what we're going to
do is write another loop

295
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,120
that's going to figure out
which is the most common word,

296
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,450
by looking through all
those little histograms

297
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,540
that we built up.

298
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,900
And then it's going to print
those things are very end.

299
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,330
And this can certainly
do Python words.py

300
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,660
and read clown.txt and tell
us that the word "the" occurs

301
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,840
seven times.

302
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,960
But it can find out that a
different thing as the word

303
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,730
"two" and it occurs 16 times.

304
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,287
And it's just as fast.

305
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:25,870
So yeah, you have
to learn a language,

306
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,780
and you have to tell it
what to do, but once you do,

307
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,950
it'll do it for a million or a
billion words, and be happily.

308
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,890
And so you don't have
to do menial work,

309
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,230
once you understand the way
to instruct the computer

310
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,529
to do menial work.

311
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,570
[IMITATES KEYBOARD CLICK]

312
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,890
So, we always start
all programming classes

313
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,980
with hardware architecture.

314
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,250
I don't think it's essential, so
don't get too excited about it.

315
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,600
It's a good use of terminology.

316
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,520
So we can have some
words say like, CPU,

317
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,880
and you don't freak out.

318
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,842
Or memory, or RAM, or disk
drive, and you don't freak out.

319
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:02,550
I don't want to turn
into a hardware nut,

320
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,557
I just want you to
have a few words,

321
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,390
so we can talk about
what's going on inside.

322
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,640
Because, in a sense, we're going
to be writing programs to do

323
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,390
stuff-- both data,
instructions, et cetera.

324
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,620

325
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,120
Here's some hardware that I
just bought a couple weeks ago,

326
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,540
and I'm really in love with.

327
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,520
And that is the Raspberry Pi.

328
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,240
This is a single board computer.

329
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,870
It's got storage on an SD card.

330
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,660
Right there.

331
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,800
That's the operating
system and the data.

332
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,290
And it's got the both
the microprocessor,

333
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,240
and the memory is
in here as well,

334
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,370
and it looks up with USB
and HDMI and various things.

335
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,780
And, if you want,
in this course,

336
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,500
you probably can do all the
homework using a Raspberry Pi,

337
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,610
if you so desire.

338
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,610
So, this is what hardware
really looks like.

339
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,250
It's kind of the
inside of something.

340
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,790
Normally it's inside of a case
and you don't get to see it.

341
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,040
And that's what it looks like.

342
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,400
It's kind of got this green
and little silver and gold.

343
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,560
I think they're very beautiful.

344
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,815
They're very pretty.

345
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,940
A lot of engineering goes
into making these things.

346
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,920

347
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,960
And so, we have a block diagram
of what's going on in here.

348
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,010
And there just some terminology.

349
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:21,130
The brains of it all-- well, we
draw this block diagram partly

350
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,110
because-- and this is
a, from a-- oh, parts

351
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,710
are coming off of this.

352
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,010
I don't know what that was.

353
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,360
It's OK, it's broken anyways.

354
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,860
If you have a desktop
computer, this

355
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,484
is more like what it
looks like inside.

356
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:36,225
This part is called
a motherboard.

357
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:38,370
And it's kind of like
the thing that connects

358
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,197
and brings everything together.

359
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:41,280
It's got a bunch of wires.

360
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,100
Each one of those little
lines here is a wire.

361
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,040
It's covered with a lacquer.

362
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,180
And then, there are things
to penetrate the board

363
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,910
and then connect
to various chips.

364
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,630
And this whole thing is
what this picture is,

365
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,207
but it really is connecting a
number of different components.

366
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,790
The central processing
unit, that I've

367
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,220
spoken of before-- put that
back down-- central processing

368
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,470
unit is the closest thing
to computer has to a brain.

369
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,330
But it's barely a
brain; it's really

370
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,650
just a super fast
programmable calculator.

371
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,820
We make it flexible
by our creativity

372
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,800
when we write programs.

373
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,420
We make it seem intelligent.

374
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,920
It's people that
make an intelligent

375
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,080
by taking our own knowledge
and putting it in.

376
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,860
This is not,
itself, intelligent.
