00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,080
We’ve spent some time talking about the problems with third variables that make it

1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,429
difficult to know if the effect we observe is really due to the independent variable.

2
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:19,500
There are a range of other things that we have to think about, so that we can be confident

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,860
that our independent variable is really the thing that causes changes in the dependent

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,860
variables.

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,680
These are possible sources of bias, and we need to try and control them to reduce their

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,930
effect.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,641
The first are demand characteristics—this is where participants respond in the way they

8
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,660
think the experimenter wants them to respond.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,960
The classic example of this is Clever Hans the Counting Horse.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,810
It seemed that this horse could count, because his owner would ask him a math problem, like

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,750
“what’s 2 plus 3?” and the horse would stomp his foot five times.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,700
Pretty smart horse, right, but he couldn’t count, he just knew what his owner wanted

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
him to do.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,800
He’d learnt to stomp his foot until the owner’s body posture changed so that he

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,330
would get a reward.

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,000
So his owner knew the answer, and the horse picked up on the body language to get a reward

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,250
for stomping the correct number of times.

18
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,810
What about Placebo effects—this is when people get better when they do some sort of

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,250
intervention with them that they think will make them better.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,420
Even if they&#39;re in a control condition where there is no treatment, if they think they&#39;re

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,810
going to get better, people do often actually improve.

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,170
It&#39;s really important with clinical trials that they use placebo drugs when they&#39;re testing

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,070
the effect of a new drug.

24
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,619
It’s the same thing with interventions in psychology.

25
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,549
You&#39;ve got to have some other intervention that has the same amount of contact with participants

26
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,259
but doesn&#39;t implement the change process that you hope is going to happen.

27
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:48,670
You still have to do something with participants, but it&#39;s just not the intervention based on

28
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,080
the theory.

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,049
This helps you take into account people’s expectations that they will get better.

30
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,900
Experimental bias—this is where experimenters tend to let their expectancies alter the way

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,380
they treat their participants.

32
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,460
It can be unconscious.

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,380
Sometimes it can be conscious.

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,320
How do we control bias?

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,470
Well, we can use a single-blind study, or even better we can use a double-blind study.

36
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,200
This just means that in the double-blind study, the participants and the experimenter don&#39;t

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,770
know the purpose of the study or perhaps they don&#39;t know what experimental condition the

38
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,930
participant is in in the study.

39
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,420
Single-blind just means only one of them is unaware.

40
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,430
You might be wondering how can an experimenter run his or her study when they don&#39;t know what the purpose

41
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,620
of the study is.

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,590
Well, it&#39;s pretty simple: they hire somebody to do the actual testing for them and you just

43
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,870
don&#39;t tell that person what the prediction is and what experimental condition the person has

44
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,740
been assigned to.

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,340
Nowadays with a lot of the computer-based testing, you can also set the computer up

46
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,240
to randomly allocate people to the conditions without telling you what it is until after

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,450
you&#39;ve collected your data.

48
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,140
I&#39;m not going to say much about sampling, except that it’s rare that we can test everyone

49
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,110
in our population of interest when doing an experiment.

50
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,400
We’d have to have a pretty small population.

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,400
So we have to select a subset of people to test, for practical reasons.

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,190
And also statistically, once we’ve collected a certain number of observations, our conclusions

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,180
aren’t going to be likely to change, so we don’t need to collect data from everyone

54
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,540
in the world.

55
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,959
We call this subset of people from the population a sample.

56
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,550
If you want to generalise your findings to the population, you have to ideally use random

57
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:38,709
sampling from the population so that everybody has an equal chance in participating, or you can

58
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,690
use representative sampling where you purposefully sample to get the particular characteristics

59
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,520
that you need in your sample.

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,129
Sampling can be kind of complicated and can have a lot of implications for what you can

61
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,819
say about your results and what they mean for the population as a whole.

62
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,900
If you do all of your research on undergraduate psychology students, there are some problems

63
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,030
in generalising the effects you observe to the wider population because undergraduate

64
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,129
psychology students have certain characteristics that are different from the general population.

65
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:11,519
It&#39;s not a random sample.

66
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,470
It does limit what you can say about phenomena in general, and this has been a bit of a problem

67
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,889
for psychology for a while.
