00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,820
So now that you are familiar with the structure of a lab report, it should be as simple as

1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,020
just filling in all the necessary information for the different sections, right?

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,670
Unfortunately not!

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,500
We can all type words onto a page, but good writing is not that easy.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,200
It requires skill, knowledge, and a lot of rewriting.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Here are some tips to help.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,180
Let’s start at the paragraph level.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,660
Generally speaking, a paragraph should really be an idea.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,629
If our paragraph is three pages long, we’re trying to fit too much information into that

9
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:42,629
paragraph.

10
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,329
So, we should think about what the point is that we want to make in a paragraph, and then

11
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,280
structure it accordingly.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,989
When structuring a paragraph, the first sentence should describe the topic of the paragraph

13
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,649
also known as the topic sentence.

14
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:05,089
So, we should start with a clear statement of the idea that we’re going to be describing.

15
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,900
The next sentences should elaborate on the topic of the paragraph by going into greater

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,900
detail.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,140
This is where we start to talk about the specifics of the research studies or our interpretation

18
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,940
of the studies.

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,300
We should not make these sentences too long, as each sentence should deal with a particular

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,300
point.

21
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,420
So, try to avoid writing sentences that are three lines long.

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,790
The sentences in our paragraph should discuss closely related ideas and develop our argument

23
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,720
in a logical manner.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,860
Any other ideas we think of, we don’t just add them to the same paragraph.

25
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,960
Our new ideas FORM the basis of our other paragraphs.

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,730
It’s really important that when we move from one paragraph to the next, that we link

27
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,210
the paragraphs together.

28
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,280
So, we should finish each paragraph in a way that provides a hook for the next paragraph,

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,340
or the next section of our writing that the reader can relate to.

30
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,590
It’s really important that one paragraph flows logically to the next.

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,180
For example, we might conclude that there are some interpretational problems with the

32
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,819
research as a last statement in a paragraph.

33
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:22,280
Then in the next paragraph, we can explain what these problems are in detail.

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,940
There are some excellent books available that provide great tips for writing, like Editing

35
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,780
Made Easy by Kaplan, The Element of Style by Strunk and White, and On Writing Well by

36
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,069
Zinsser.

37
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,400
These books will not help you specifically with writing a psychology research report.

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,880
However, they will help you with your writing in general.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,030
You’ll learn how to structure clear and succinct sentences, and the general intent

40
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,030
we should have when we write.

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,260
It’s absolutely worth it to spend a bit of time reading these books to learn how to

42
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,599
write well.

43
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,049
If you haven’t got the time to read all of these books, I would suggest for you to

44
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:01,980
read “Editing Made Easy” by Kaplan.

45
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,639
It’s  not a big book, but it may make a big difference to how you write.

46
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,849
In the book, Kaplan wrote about 12 golden rules for great writing.

47
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,110
These include:

48
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,849
Write and edit to express, not to impress - So, get rid of technical sounding words.

49
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,640
Always write so everything can be easily understood.

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,279
Always write so that nothing can be misunderstood.

51
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:33,480
Say what you mean, clearly and simply - So, no point hiding behind complex sentences.

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,249
Use short sentences.

53
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,310
Use short paragraphs.

54
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,180
Use the shortest, simplest words possible - Most of the time, we can delete half of

55
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,409
the words we write and not change the meaning of what we’re writing.

56
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,739
Write in the active voice.

57
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,830
Avoid unnecessary words.

58
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,220
Use verbs for action.

59
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,439
Avoid clichés and jargon.

60
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,379
And if in doubt, leave it out - so, everything we keep in our writing should have a clear

61
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,049
reason for why it’s there.

62
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:08,969
Finally, The University of Queensland has created a very popular course on edX.org called

63
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:15,019
Write101x where you can learn strategies in grammar and style to help enhance your writing

64
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:15,549
in general.
