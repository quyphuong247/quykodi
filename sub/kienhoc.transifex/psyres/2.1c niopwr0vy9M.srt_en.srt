00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,080
The rest of our report, should be a more detailed version of our Abstract, starting with the

1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,750
Introduction, introducing the reader to the research topic that we are writing about.

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,240
Typically, when writing a story, the Introduction sets out the scene.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,590
The author introduces the main characters of the story and tells the reader a bit about

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,850
them.

5
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,640
When writing a lab report, ultimately, we’re doing a similar thing in the Introduction.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,860
However, instead of fictional characters, we introduce the researchers who have conducted

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,120
studies in the research areas that we’re interested in.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,229
We unfold the research concepts and theories that they have previously proposed and tested.

9
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:51,890
We then identify AN INTERESTING research question by critically analysing the existing research.

10
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,049
We need to communicate our research question in the Introduction, because THIS is what

11
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,370
makes OUR story interesting to the reader.

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,390
Maybe our research question is testing the prediction of an EXISTING THEORY, or generating

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,119
a new theory based on the findings of PREVIOUS RESEARCH.

14
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,030
Maybe it’s CONTRASTING PREDICTIONS from different theories, or even iDENTIFYING A

15
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,140
GAP in our knowledge––something that nobody has looked at yet.

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,050
Whatever point we arrive at through critically analysing the literature, we need to set out

17
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,270
the LOGIC for our thinking, and be clear about what OUR contributions will be to the area

18
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,030
of research that we’re interested in.

19
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,080
Apart from the Abstract paragraph, the first paragraph of the Introduction is one of the

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,180
MOST important paragraphs in our whole report.

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,900
Because, this is where we make the case for the importance of our research.

22
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,930
We should conclude our first paragraph with a clear statement about what our research

23
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,979
question is.

24
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,060
Writing a lab report is not meant to be like a murder mystery or a game of hide and seek,

25
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,610
where we leave the reader until the end of the Introduction to find out what we’ll

26
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,409
be investigating in our report.

27
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:05,720
It’s more like show and tell, where we show the reader what our research question is,

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,649
and then tell them all about the literature that relates to our research question.

29
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,910
So, to create an interesting Introduction, we highlight the IMPORTANCE of our research

30
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,910
first.

31
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,750
We then describe what we know from EXISTING RESEARCH and how they’re related, and pose

32
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,020
the RESEARCH QUESTION that we’ll be investigating in our report.

33
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,319
This is EXCITING!

34
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,550
We’re taking our reader on a journey.
