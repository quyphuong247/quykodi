When writing research papers, some people like to write in passive voice, and others

1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,219
prefer active voice.

2
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:15,540
So, what do we mean by this?

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,750
Well, this sentence, “This paper was read by a team of researchers.”, has been written

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,500
in a passive voice.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,189
The subject in this sentence is “this paper”.

6
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,080
Whereas, “A team of researchers have read this paper.”, has been written in an active

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,140
voice.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,550
The subject in this sentence is “a team of researchers”.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,680
So, if the subject is performing the action, then it’s an active voice.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,690
If the subject is having the action done to it, then it’s a passive voice.

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,940
In a sentence, the word “By” often suggests that a passive voice is being used.

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,300
As a funny, but useful tip, if you’re able to add the phrase “by zombies” at the

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,440
end of your sentence, then you have written the sentence in a passive voice.

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,360
For example, this sentence, “The questionnaire was administered to participants in a lab….

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,210
By zombies”, has been written in a passive voice.

16
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,030
Sometimes, we can use passive voice when we want to direct our focus on the object or

17
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,360
the recipient of the action as opposed to the individual person.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,860
For example, “The participants were instructed to read a questionnaire” emphasises the

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:32,170
reading of the questionnaire, and not so much on who actually gave the instructions.

20
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,250
However in most cases, active voice can be more engaging for your readers.

21
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,140
It’s not necessarily wrong to write in a passive voice, it’s just that sentences

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,050
written in a passive voice tend to be longer and less direct compared to those written

23
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,170
in an active voice.
