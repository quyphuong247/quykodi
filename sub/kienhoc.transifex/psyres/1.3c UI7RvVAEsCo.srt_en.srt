Survey research is the next type of research design.

1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,170
One of the major advantages of survey research is that we can ask people about behaviours

2
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:21,590
that are difficult to observe... maybe water conservation, drug taking, or even study behaviour.

3
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,630
The other major advantage is that we can easily ask a lot of people, so we can obtain a large

4
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,560
sample of responses from the general population.

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,120
This is especially the case if we put our survey online for people to complete.

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,980
Other ways we can do survey research are by giving people a paper questionnaire in person,

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,800
or even conducting an interview where the interviewer asks the questions on the survey.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,489
These interviews can either be in person or done on the telephone.

9
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,039
Obviously, surveying people in person or via interview requires more resources.

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,490
But, the reason why we might conduct a survey via an interview in person or on the phone,

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,540
is that we can ask people to talk more about their responses to particular survey questions.

12
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,660
We can also get more detail if their responses are ambiguous.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,060
Interviews are also good for respondents who might not be able to read and write with a

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,660
high level of proficiency.

15
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,220
For example, children.

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,940
Also, for people who don’t necessarily have access to the internet, an online survey is

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,880
not particularly useful.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,300
So we might use a telephone interview instead.

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,100
Surveys are also good at measuring difficult to observe behaviour.

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,850
I want you to imagine that I&#39;m interested in people’s water conservation behaviour.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,180
My key dependent variable is how long people spend in the shower.

22
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,260
If I wanted to do that as an observational study, I&#39;d have to go around to all of your

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,099
homes in the morning and peek through your shower window and time how long you&#39;re in

24
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,250
the shower for.

25
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,759
That would be hugely impractical in terms of the time required, and plus it’s creepy

26
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,950
and I&#39;d get arrested.

27
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,970
People’s water conservation behaviour is a difficult-to-observe behaviour.

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,030
So instead, I would interview you or give you a survey asking, “How long did you spend

29
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,100
in the shower this morning?”

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,870
We could do that online in about five minutes rather than me spending hours running around

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,289
to people&#39;s homes.

32
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:11,620
However, the problem is that I&#39;m relying on you to tell me what your behaviour was, and

33
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:14,440
that&#39;s self-report data.

34
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,390
Self-report data can be unreliable for a number of reasons.

35
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,450
For example, you could have lied about the length of time you spent in the shower because

36
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,010
you intentionally wanted to deceive me.

37
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,450
Maybe you lied because you wanted me to perceive you as more responsible than you are.

38
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,800
Or, maybe because you just simply forgot how long you actually spent in the shower.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,140
Therefore, intentional deception, social desirability, and reliance on memory are the three main

40
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,550
reasons for why self-report data can sometimes be unreliable.

41
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,970
Just say for example you know you had the luxury of a 35-minute shower this morning,

42
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,800
because you were having trouble waking up.

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,070
Then, I come along and say, &quot;Hey, guys, I want to survey you about your water conservation

44
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,230
behaviour.

45
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,920
Can you just fill out this survey and tell me how long you spent in the shower this morning?&quot;

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,040
You don&#39;t want to look like you wasted water, so you might go, &quot;This morning wasn&#39;t typical.

47
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,300
Normally, it&#39;s five minutes.

48
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,010
I&#39;m just going to write down five.

49
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,690
That’s going to make me feel better and not look so bad in front of others.

50
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,890
I&#39;m going to write down five.&quot;

51
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,360
That’s the effect of social desirability.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,400
You know what the “desired” answer is that would make you look good to other people.

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,380
What if instead of water conservation, I&#39;m interested in drug-taking behaviour.

54
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,210
So, I ask my students in class to put up their hands if they have taken cocaine, ice, meth,

55
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,900
or any other illegal drugs in the last two days.

56
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,860
Most people who have taken any of these things won’t answer that.

57
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,010
So they will be intentionally deceptive, in this case, to avoid any nasty legal consequences

58
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,210
from admitting to drug use.

59
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,270
Both social desirability and intentional deception will be worse when survey respondents think

60
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,740
they are identifiable.

61
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,010
For example, if we ask them to fill out detailed information about who they are on the survey,

62
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,380
or if we conduct the survey or interview in person or on the phone.

63
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,200
Surveys are also susceptible to memory effects because often they rely on memory.

64
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,740
Imagine I&#39;m interested in your dental history, or dental hygiene, and I ask you about

65
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,581
the number of times you visited the dentist between the ages of three and five, and I

66
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:18,660
also ask you what happened at each of these trips to the dentist.

67
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,459
There&#39;s going to be a lot of mistakes.

68
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,700
Asking people to self-report on behaviours that happened a long time ago is difficult.

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,620
Even asking about behaviour from weeks ago can be difficult.
