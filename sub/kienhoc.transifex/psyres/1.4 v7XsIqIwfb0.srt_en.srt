0
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,380
So the second last stage of the scientific method is to analyze the data and arrive at

1
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,910
your conclusions.

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,680
I&#39;m going to do the data analysis for the lab report in this course because we could

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,110
spend several courses talking just about doing data analyses.

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,401
In a later topic in this course, you will look at the data analyses and an example results

5
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:26,401
section.

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,550
We’ll give you some help to understand those findings, so that you can draw some conclusions

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,989
about whether the results support the predictions made in the lab report.

8
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,270
You will want to think about whether there are any other explanations, and whether can

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,739
we generalise our findings to other people&#39;s situations.

10
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:46,750
The final step is to report your findings so that other people can see what you did—so

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,070
there&#39;s public scrutiny—and that the study can potentially be replicated.

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,350
Your lab report is going to be a written report of a research study.

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,370
You will only be writing the Introduction and the Discussion.

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,500
We&#39;ll be giving you an example of the Method and Results sections to help you write your

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,110
Discussion.

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,009
Sending your research findings out for peer review and public scrutiny is an essential

17
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:10,470
part of the scientific method.

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,740
When studies are critiqued and repeated, our confidence in those findings, generally, goes

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,740
up.

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,150
If other researchers have trouble repeating those findings, our confidence in those findings,

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,000
generally, should go down.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,630
This is how we can incrementally uncover and help explain human thinking and behaviour.
