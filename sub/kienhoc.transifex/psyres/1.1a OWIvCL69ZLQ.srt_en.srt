Many people have been interested in the topic of Psychology.

1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,330
Every year, we have over two thousand students enrolled in our Introduction to Psychology

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,590
course here on campus.

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,419
One of the reasons for why people have developed an interest in psychology over the years might

4
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:21,640
be related to the media.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,349
I’m sure you’ve seen loads of tv shows where the detectives are working with a profiler

6
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:30,470
to track down a serial killer, with lots of wild speculation about what the killer is

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,270
like based on some small clue left at the crime scene.

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,860
Or maybe at a social gathering it’s likely that you have had the experience of others automatically

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,120
assuming that you can “read their mind”, when you tell them that you’re studying

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
Psychology.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,050
Or, maybe people start to tell you about a weird dream they had, and they want you to tell

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,730
them what it means.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,430
Well, as cool as it would be, to be able to read minds or interpret people’s dreams,

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:02,190
and track down serial killers, these aspects of Psychology are not necessarily the main focus of Psychology,

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,560
and are not what Psychology is necessarily about.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,619
So, what IS Psychology?

17
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:13,050
Sometimes, Psychology is called the study of the bleeding obvious, or characterised

18
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,080
as telling us what we already know in words we don’t understand.

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,080
If this is the case, then we don’t really need to study anything in psychology, as we

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,860
can just rely on what we already know.

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,260
Is that a fair characterisation of psychology?

22
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,690
Is it all just common sense?

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,640
In some ways, everyone is kind of a naive psychologist.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,090
We all have our theories about how the social world works.

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,039
That’s how we get by in our day to day lives.

26
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:41,420
But, how accurate is our common sense understanding of psychology?
