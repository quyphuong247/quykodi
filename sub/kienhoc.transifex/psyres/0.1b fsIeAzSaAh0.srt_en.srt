[Blake McKimmie] Welcome to the PSYC1030 X-Series of courses.

1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,780
This series includes Introduction to Social Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Clinical Psychology,

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,130
and Psychological Research Methods.

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,380
You will learn why we think and behave the way we do, how we develop throughout our lives,

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,210
about some common psychological illnesses and treatments, and how we conduct and report

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,590
psychological research.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,180
Hi, I’m Blake McKimmie.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,210
You will be hearing from me throughout the series, as well as from a number of my colleagues

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,719
here at the School of Psychology at The University of Queensland.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,879
Together, these four courses are PSYC1030, an introductory psychology course, taught here

10
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:40,879
on campus.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,410
Each year about 2,500 students take this course, and now you can join them.

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,489
You can take each course on its own, or together as a whole series.

13
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,170
For each topic in these courses, you will watch a series of course videos, do some activities,

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,359
and also complete some quizzes.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,420
There is a quiz before you watch any videos, and one at the end.

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,300
Don’t worry, we will only be grading you on this second one.

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,050
Research shows that repeated testing is one of the best ways to enhance your learning.

18
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,540
To make sure you do your best, it’s a good idea to do the topics in order, especially

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,100
because we will be quizzing you on the previous topics as we go through.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,400
And don’t forget to take a look at the list of extra resources at the end of each topic.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,210
We’ve got quite a bit to cover, so it’s important that you spread your learning out

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,560
over a few weeks for each of these four courses to give yourself the best chance possible.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,860
By better understanding ourselves and others, we hope that we are in a better position to

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,310
create change in our lives and the world.

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,040
And world peace.
