00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,250
Now let’s talk about case studies and case study research.

1
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,689
A case study is where we conduct an in-depth investigation of an individual or situation.

2
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:21,700
If we&#39;re looking at a series of case studies, we call that case study research.

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,600
The idea here is we obtain information about people through interviews, psychometric tests,

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,730
other tests, direct observation records, and things like that.

5
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,030
This is how we got a lot of in-depth data originally about what areas of the brain were

6
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,940
responsible for different functions.

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,760
We&#39;ve now got machines that can temporarily interfere with regions of the brain.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,739
We&#39;ve got machines that can look into the brain and see where the blood is flowing during

9
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:49,150
certain activities, so we can identify different brain functions.

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,890
Before these machines were invented, researchers had to use a different approach to study how

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,440
the brain works.

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,210
If they wanted to find out which part of the brain controlled face recognition, speech

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,210
production, integration of visual processing, any of those sorts of things, they had to

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,110
wait until somebody had a brain injury and lost that ability before they could start

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,020
their investigations.

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,790
The researchers had to work out which part of the brain the individual had injured, and

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,909
what ability they had lost.

18
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,390
So if the person now had a problem with face recognition, for example, you might conclude

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,930
that the region they injured is responsible for face recognition.

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,770
The case study research was really important for originally mapping out what bits of the

21
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,360
brain did what.

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,360
Obviously, there&#39;s a bit of a problem with subjectivity, as some case study research

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,619
relies on subjective judgements.

24
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,720
The researcher typically knows what they are looking for, so they might end up seeing what

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,340
they expect to see.

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,040
Also, there is some question about how well the findings of case study research generalise

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,970
to the whole population.

28
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,079
This is because we’re sampling a small number of people, typically non-randomly, from the

29
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,579
population.

30
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,469
We don&#39;t get to choose who has a brain injury.

31
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,860
There are some concerns that the people we are studying might not actually be representative

32
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,670
of the general population.

33
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,619
Obviously, with more recent advancements of how we can image the brain, we can use more

34
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,880
representative samples of people.

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,270
However the sample sizes are often still reasonably small due to the costs and time involved in

36
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,720
doing this sort of research.
