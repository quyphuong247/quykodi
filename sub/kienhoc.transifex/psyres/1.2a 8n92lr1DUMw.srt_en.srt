00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,360
So, now we all agree that we can’t rely on our own common sense to explain psychological

1
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,509
phenomena, let’s talk about the scientific method, and how we can use the scientific

2
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,680
method to help us develop an understanding for why things happen.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,440
The scientific method consists of five main steps.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,880
The first step is to FORMULATE a testable hypothesis.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,860
In the second step, we DESIGN the study.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,870
The third step is where we CONDUCT the study and COLLECT the data.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,700
The fourth step is to ANALYSE and EVALUATE the data.

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,860
And finally, we REPORT the findings.

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:45,260
We&#39;re going to talk mainly about step one and step two: formulating a testable hypothesis

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,640
and designing a study.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,380
Step three is something we will talk about as part of the lab report that you complete

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,380
for this course.

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,870
You will have the chance to see what it’s like to take part in a study.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,950
For your lab report, you will see the results from the data analyses.

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,399
I&#39;ll complete the data analyses for you, because this is not a course on data analyses.

16
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,470
However, you will have the opportunity to evaluate the data, learn what the data means,

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,880
and learn how to report the findings.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,330
We will cover these last two steps later in this course.

19
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,650
Okay, step one: formulate a testable hypothesis.

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,230
Here we take our theory and translate it into a testable prediction.

21
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,480
We do this by generating a hypothesis.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,600
A hypothesis is a prediction about a relationship between two or more variables.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,159
Our hypothesis is generated from theory.

24
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,540
It has to be specific and testable.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,630
This means it has to make a statement about the directional relationship between variables.

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,259
We predict that if variable A increases, variable B will also increase.

27
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,250
Or maybe we predict that as variable A increases, variable B actually decreases.

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,110
We can&#39;t just say, &quot;This is related to that.&quot;

29
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,680
Or, as one thing changes so will the other.

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,420
We have to actually describe the nature of the relationship.

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,780
Once we have our prediction, to test it, we have to translate our variables from abstract

32
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,420
constructs into something concrete.

33
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,910
To do this, we have to operationalise the variables.

34
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,170
We will talk more about this, but first you need to know that there are two types of variables

35
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,610
we will focus on: the Independent Variables and Dependent Variables.

36
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,871
The Independent Variable is what we control and manipulate.

37
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:27,330
The Dependent Variable is what we measure.

38
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,530
The Dependent Variable is the outcome that we think are influenced by the Independent

39
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,530
Variable.

40
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,849
An easy way to remember the difference between the variables is that the Dependent Variable

41
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,840
depends on the Independent Variable.

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,810
There are other types of variables that we look at in psychology, like subject variables,

43
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,940
measured predictors and outcome variables, and so on, but for now, let’s focus on Independent

44
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,829
and Dependent variables, and how we operationalise them.
