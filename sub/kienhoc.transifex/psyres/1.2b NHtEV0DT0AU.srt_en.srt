00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,360
When we operationalise variables, we are turning abstract concepts into concrete variables

1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,170
that we can then directly measure or manipulate.

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,529
If you think about hunger—how can we measure hunger?

3
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:23,140
If we had a theory suggesting that our hunger is dependent on our emotions, how can we measure

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,640
hunger to see if it is related to our emotions?

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,860
One thing we could do is just ask people to rate how hungry they are on a scale.

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,570
Maybe from 1, not at all hungry, to 7, very hungry.

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,960
This would be a self-report measure of hunger.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,829
There are some problems with self-report measures.

9
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,460
We’ll come back to these later.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,160
How else could we measure hunger?

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,319
We could measure how much food people actually eat when presented with a full plate

12
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:50,469
of food.

13
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,250
If they&#39;re hungry, they should eat more.

14
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,109
But, there are some limitations to measuring hunger this way as well.

15
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:00,709
Or we could do something like what Pavlov did with his dogs, and measure the amount

16
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:04,600
of saliva people produce when presented with a full plate of food.

17
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,210
We could literally just suction out people’s saliva, as the more hungry they are, the more

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,690
saliva they would produce.

19
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,080
As you can see, there are a number of different ways we can measure hunger.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,520
What if we wanted to manipulate hunger?

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,210
Imagine our theory suggests that being hungry makes people do worse on a test.

22
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,570
In this example, we’re not trying to measure hunger anymore, we’re manipulating it.

23
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,460
What we could do is divide a group of people in half.

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,740
We move half of the people into a room and lock them up for eight hours.

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,650
For the other half of people, we take them to the cafeteria and instruct them to eat

26
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,620
whatever they want for eight hours.

27
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,900
Afterwards, we bring the two groups of people together, and get them to do a test.

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,530
To see if hunger has an effect on test performance, we can compare the test performance between

29
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,610
our hungry group and our non-hungry group.

30
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,770
This is one way we could manipulate hunger.
