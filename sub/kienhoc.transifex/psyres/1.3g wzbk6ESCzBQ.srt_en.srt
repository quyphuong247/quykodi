0
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,700
By allocating our participants using time of day, there could be a whole host of things

1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,690
that change from morning to afternoon.

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,539
So imagine that we do measure higher heart rate and blood pressure for those people we

3
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,030
tested after watching the violent film in the morning compared to the non-violent film

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,939
in the afternoon.

5
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,810
Is that because of the level of violence in the film, or the time of day?

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,250
Well, we simply don’t know because they both vary in the same way.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,620
It could be that we tend to get different people for the morning session compared to

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,829
the afternoon session.

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,400
Maybe the more anxious people are more likely to want to get their commitment out of the

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,430
way early in the morning.

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,540
And maybe they naturally have higher heart rate and blood pressure due to their higher

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,290
anxiety levels?

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,760
The relaxed people wanted to sleep in, so they turned up to the later session, and they

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,170
are calmer and so have a lower heart rate and blood pressure.

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:03,400
So pre-existing differences in our study participants could explain the difference we observed.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,750
We can&#39;t tell the difference between the effect of the film and the effect of the type of

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,910
person who&#39;s going to make it to the morning session or the afternoon session.

18
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,340
Random assignment can help us remove this possible alternate explanation for any difference

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,280
that we might observe.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,820
For random assignment to cancel out these individual differences, we have to show both

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,460
films in the morning and both films in the afternoon.

22
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,200
For people who turn up in the morning—you flip a coin.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,910
If they get heads, they go to one film—tails, they go to the other film.

24
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,600
People who show up in the afternoon, you do the same thing.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,090
That way, you&#39;re going to have roughly an equal number of people with different levels

26
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,780
of base level arousal in both film conditions.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,120
Then it can&#39;t be due to individual differences, like anxiety.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,500
We also would call this type of alternate explanation a confounding variable.

29
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,740
A confounding variable is a third variable that co-varies with our independent variable

30
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,460
that makes it difficult to work out what the effect of the independent variable is.

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,040
In the initial version of the film experiment I described, the confounding variable—you

32
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,510
could think of that as time of the day or temperament of the person who turns up, or

33
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,930
something like that.

34
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,090
We don&#39;t know what causes a change in heart rate and blood pressure because we&#39;re getting

35
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:25,349
systematic co-variation between the independent variable and the third confounding variable.

36
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,870
When we use random assignment, that&#39;s not a problem because what was the confounding

37
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,830
variable is no longer systematically varying with the independent variable.

38
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,030
With the ice cream and drowning at the beach example, there was a confounding variable

39
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,799
there in terms of number of people at the beach or even the temperature.

40
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:50,250
When it&#39;s hotter, more ice creams get eaten, more people go swimming, and more people there are to drown.

41
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,909
We&#39;d have to do that really unethical and illegal experiment that I described to disentangle

42
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,560
these things.

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,661
Third variables can make it difficult to tease apart cause-and-effect relationships, and

44
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:02,430
so we use random assignment.
