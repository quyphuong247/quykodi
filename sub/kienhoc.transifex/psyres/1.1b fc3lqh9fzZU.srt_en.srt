00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,280
All right, how do you think you went?

1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,809
Are you feeling confident about your answers to the previous activity?

2
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,410
Would you like to find out what the correct answers are?

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,460
Okay...

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,480
Well, they&#39;re all false!

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,060
Did you answer all false to the statements?

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,140
If we look at the poll results, most people would have got at least one wrong, maybe many

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,570
of them wrong.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,279
When I’ve done this activity in my class, in a room of 500 university students, only

9
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,090
a handful get them all correct, so don’t worry if you got a few wrong.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,680
You’re in good company.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,250
Okay, what&#39;s the point of what I&#39;m doing?

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,260
Am I trying to show you that you don&#39;t know anything about psychology?

13
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:45,079
No, that&#39;s not the point.

14
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,839
The point is this: we often have intuitive understandings of psychological phenomenon,

15
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:52,480
because we experience them every day.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,170
Maybe we&#39;re exposed to them in the media, or maybe we learn about them from interacting

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,510
with other people.

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,969
However, our ideas about psychology are often incorrect.

19
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:07,760
Therefore in psychology, we conduct systematic research using the scientific method to test

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,720
the different psychological phenomenon.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,080
And so, Psychology is the scientific study of human behaviour and thinking.
