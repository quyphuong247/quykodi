00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,780
So I asked you to imagine that we ran a study where we showed people either a violent or

1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,240
a nonviolent film, and then measured their heart rate and blood pressure to test the

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,750
prediction that violent films cause heart rate and blood pressure to increase.

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,730
The independent variables in this study, the thing that we manipulated, is the violence

4
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,460
level of the film that people watched.

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,120
The dependent variable, the thing that we measured, is heart rate and blood pressure.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,650
Now we’ve got to the manipulation of the independent variable, we need to talk about

7
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,219
how to do this properly because we want to manipulate the independent variable while

8
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,719
holding other variables constant.

9
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,969
We have to make sure we are using random assignment.

10
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:52,000
What that means is everybody has an equal chance of being in either condition.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,760
We use some randomized method of allocation.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,179
Maybe I rolled a dice, flipped a coin, or wrote computer program to allocate people

13
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,289
to the two conditions.

14
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,330
In the study I described to you—everybody who turns up for the morning testing session

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:11,630
gets the violent film, and everybody who turns up in the afternoon gets the non violent film.

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,580
We didn&#39;t use random assignment - what condition you are in is determined by the time of day,

17
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,450
you don’t have a random chance of being allocated to either condition.

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,720
What&#39;s the problem of not using random assignment?

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,190
What could be a difference between people who turn up in the morning and people who

20
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,549
turn up in the afternoon?
