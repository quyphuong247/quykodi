When writing a lab report, it’s like writing a story or a novel.

1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,830
Instead of telling the story of a drama, we’re telling the story of the research that we

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,349
did and why we did it.

3
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,800
Lab reports have a particular structure.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,230
This can sometimes be difficult to see at first.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,770
However, once you’ve read a few lab reports, you will start to get a sense of what to expect

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,340
in the different parts of a report.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,530
We can help speed this up by taking you through the structure and purpose of a lab report.

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,100
Knowing this structure will help you write your own lab report, which has been set as

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,359
your assessment in this course.

10
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,010
The general structure of a lab report looks like this.

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:51,379
We start out with the title page, which contains the title, the author, and their affiliation.

12
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:56,249
The Abstract is a summary of the purpose of our research study and its findings.

13
00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:01,800
The Introduction is where we develop our research question and hypotheses.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,230
In the Method section, we outline the participants, the materials and procedures of our study.

15
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,830
The Results section is where we test our hypotheses and report our findings.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,660
The Discussion section is where we summarise our findings in relation to our predictions

17
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,100
and the existing literature.

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,570
This is where we highlight the strengths and limitations of our study, the implication

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,500
of our findings, and our conclusions.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,450
Lastly, the References, is where we list the literature we’ve reviewed and cited in our

21
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,450
report.

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,380
So altogether, this is the structure we should use when writing our lab report.
