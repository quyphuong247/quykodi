Tại sao việc tạo ấn tượng lại quan trọng tới vậy

1
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,540
Những ấn tượng này có vai trò rất quan trọng trong đời sống. Chúng giúp chúng ta định hướng

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,820
được các tình huống xã hội chúng ta tham giam vào,
đồng thời giúp ta đánh giá đối tượng giao tiếp

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,029
với chúng ta.

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,509
Trong các cuộc bầu cử, ta có thể hình thành ấn tượng tích cực hay tiêu cực về một ứng viên nhất định

5
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:29,159
dựa trên vẻ bề ngoài và cách cư xử của họ

6
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,509
Điều này sẽ ảnh hưởng tới quyết định bỏ phiếu của ta.

7
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,570
Tương tự như vậy, khi ta gặp mọi người tại bữa tiệc, ta thường có thể nhanh chóng biết được

8
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,480
 người mà ta muốn nói chuyện cùng

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,570
Ấn tượng cũng quan trọng hơn đánh giá của ta về người khác

10
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,530
Trong khi ta hình thành ấn tượng về người khác thì họ cũng 

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,530
điều tương tự

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,140
Và những ấn tượng mọi người có có thể ảnh hưởng tới cơ hội và kinh nghiệm

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,140
mà ta có

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,400
chẳng hạn có thể ảnh hưởng tới việc liệu ta có nhận được việc ta muốn không 

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,790
hay liệu có ai muốn nói chuyện với ta trong một bữa tiệc hay không.

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,260
Hiện tại, truyền thông xã hội là ví dụ hiển nhiên nhất về việc con người ta cố gắng xoay sở với những ấn tượng 

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,189
mà người khác có về họ. 

18
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:14,869
Khi bạn chọn ảnh đại diện hoặc cập nhật trên mạng

19
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,609
Bạn thường quan tâm xem người khác sẽ nghĩ gì về bạn

20
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,200
Vậy nên, việc hình thành ấn tượng thường được hiểu là 

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,710
quá trình mọi người liên kết thông tin về người khác 

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,719
và đưa ra kết luận đánh giá chung về người đó

23
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,740
Vậy thì chúng ta có thể hình thành ấn tượng theo những cách nào?

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,159
Về cơ bản thì có 2 kiểu mẫu hay giả thuyết về cách ta tạo ấn tượng.

25
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,710
The algebraic models and the configurational model.

26
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,750
Let&#39;s talk about the algebraic models first.

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,729
Anderson (1965) was the main proponent of the algebraic models of impression formation.

28
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:50,859
He thought that impressions were formed on the basis of the mechanical combination of

29
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:54,350
information that we know about a person.

30
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,100
Anderson proposed that there could be three different ways that this information could

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,479
be combined.

32
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,670
The first of these was the summative model, the second the averaging model, and the third

33
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,240
he called the weighted averaging model.

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,430
To illustrate how these models work and the differences between them, let&#39;s consider an

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,430
example.

36
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,220
I want you to imagine that you are at a party.

37
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,970
At this party you meet somebody for the first time.

38
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,130
Let&#39;s call him &quot;Bob&quot;.

39
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,280
Almost immediately we notice a few positive things about Bob.

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,439
He&#39;s funny, he&#39;s clever, and he&#39;s pretty good looking.

41
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:34,069
We also notice that he&#39;s not very polite, and unfortunately has a poor taste in music.

42
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,420
Now, we like each of these attributes to a different extent.

43
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,750
We can represent our reactions to each of these attributes with a rating of likability.

44
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,930
So we feel most positively about the attributes of being funny and clever, and a bit less

45
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,750
positively about being good looking - we&#39;re not totally shallow after all.

46
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,069
While we don&#39;t like the attribute of not being polite very much, we really don&#39;t like someone

47
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,170
having a poor taste in music (because otherwise we could end up listening to a lot of dodgy

48
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,890
music).

49
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,840
According to the summative model of impression formation, we could arrive at an overall impression

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,799
of Bob by simply adding all of our reactions, or likability ratings, up, and we arrive at

51
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,510
an overall impression of three.

52
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,980
Nice to meet you Bob, that must mean that we like you!

53
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,969
According to Anderson&#39;s averaging model of impression formation, we could also arrive

54
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:28,310
at an overall impression of Bob by averaging our likability ratings.

55
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,629
We just take the overall sum of the ratings and divide by the number of ratings.

56
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,989
So we take three and divide that by five, as we know five attributes about Bob.

57
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,150
This gives us an impression of zero point six for Bob.

58
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,150
Hmmm.

59
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,409
It&#39;s still a positive impression, so we must still like Bob.

60
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,220
The third possibility, according to Anderson, was the weighted averaging model.

61
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,700
This is based on the idea that each attribute that a person possesses is associated not

62
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,800
only with our likability rating, but also with a weight that represents how important

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,519
that attribute is in a particular context.

64
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
For example, being funny and polite might be important in a social setting because those

65
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,069
attributes help us have a nice time together.

66
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,650
However, if you are going for brain surgery, you probably wouldn&#39;t give much weight to

67
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,810
being funny and polite, you are much more interested in your surgeon being clever and

68
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,810
skilful!

69
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,050
So, we could use these weights to modify the likability ratings in the following way.

70
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,750
For each attribute, we multiply the likability rating with its associated weight.

71
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,060
For example, we take positive three for the attribute of funny and multiply that by three.

72
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,600
And so on for each of the other attributes.

73
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,860
We then sum up all of these weighted likability ratings, and take the average by dividing

74
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,020
by the number of traits, which in this case is five.

75
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,569
This gives us an overall impression of 1.4.

76
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:46,569
Phew!

77
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,110
That took a bit of mental arithmetic.

78
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,280
Anderson tested these three models by systematically varying each of these bits of information

79
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,620
under controlled settings in the lab.

80
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,580
His research suggests that, perhaps surprisingly, the weighted averaging way of forming impressions

81
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,630
is the best match for the impressions that people actually formed.

82
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,810
But is that really the case?

83
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,960
If it was, wouldn&#39;t there be long pauses at parties whenever people met for the first

84
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
time?

85
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,669
Wouldn&#39;t people with calculator watches be at a massive social advantage?

86
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,090
Well, while it appears that the weighted averaging model describes the impressions that people

87
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,860
form, it doesn&#39;t necessarily tell us about the actual process they use to arrive at those

88
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
impressions.

89
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,160
So let&#39;s talk about the configurational model of impression formation.

90
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,139
The configurational model of impression formation is based on Gestalt principles, or the idea

91
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,569
that the whole is greater than just the sum of the parts.

92
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:43,790
According to this model, people combine information they receive about someone into an overall

93
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,610
impression that is quite different from the simple sum of reactions to individual items

94
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,010
of information about that person.

95
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,460
The reason why this happens is because the people&#39;s traits are not all used in the same

96
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,790
way to form an impression.

97
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,389
Asch (1946) thought that there were two main types of traits or characteristics: central

98
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,430
traits, which are more influential, and peripheral traits which take on different meanings in

99
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,330
the context of different central traits.

100
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,389
So let&#39;s do a quick activity to try and demonstrate the effect of these two different types of

101
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,139
traits.

102
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,430
Let&#39;s imagine that you are at another party.

103
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,690
At this party you meet another person for the first time, let&#39;s call him Mike.

104
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,300
In a second, you are going to see a list of traits, or attributes, that describe Mike.

105
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,490
When you read this list, I want you to quickly form an impression, and then rate Mike on

106
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,639
an additional attribute not in the list.

107
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,949
Once you&#39;ve done this, we will spend some time talking about this model of impression

108
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:39,569
formation.
