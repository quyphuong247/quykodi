The American Psychological Association developed a standard writing style for scientific writers

1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,490
writing and publishing works in the areas of social and behavioural sciences.

2
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,060
This style is known as the APA style, and is outlined in the Publication Manual of the

3
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,130
American Psychological Association.

4
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,990
The APA style provides us with guidelines regarding formatting.

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,780
So for example, the font, size of the font, margins, and so on.

6
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,510
It also provides us with guidelines regarding how we should be citing other scientific research

7
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,270
and sources.

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,930
Although some publishing bodies have their own guidelines regarding formatting when scientific

9
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:53,640
writers submit manuscripts to them, APA formatting is an overall standard style of formatting

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,660
that most scientific writers across different disciplines, and worldwide, have adopted.

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,681
So, we would like you to start adopting the APA style and formatting in your writing as

12
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:05,550
well.

13
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,840
Along with the guidelines of how to write in APA style, the APA manual also provides

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,880
some general tips for scientific writing.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,740
There is a lot of information in the APA manual regarding the different guidelines for formatting

16
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,479
and citation, some of the information might not be very useful for what you need to complete

17
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:26,479
your report.

18
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,619
So, we will just cover the basics of APA style and formatting to get you started with your

19
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:33,890
own report.

20
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,149
Feel free to revisit this information when you need to.

21
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:43,750
Ok, this is what a manuscript using APA formatting looks like.

22
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,799
And this is what the paper looks after it has been published in a journal article.

23
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,560
At the manuscript stage, this is what you should aim for when writing your report.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,380
The text is typed, double-spaced on standard A4 sized paper with 2.5cm margins on all sides.

25
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,289
The text is clear and highly readable.

26
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:10,610
The font used here is Times New Roman, 12 pt in size.

27
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,760
The manuscript includes a page header at the top right corner of every page.

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,970
The page header is normally the title of the manuscript.

29
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,300
To create a page header, all you need to do is insert page numbers to the right, and type

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,330
the title of your report in the header to the left using all capital letters.

31
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,010
The page header is a shortened version of the actual title for your report, and should

32
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,680
not exceed 50 characters including spacing and punctuation.

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,040
All text throughout your report should be double-spaced.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,480
When we write numbers using APA formatting, we write the number as a word if it is below

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,690
ten and we use figures to indicate numbers that are 10 and above.

36
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:02,520
For example, when we write 12 participants, we write the number 12 as a figure.

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,430
For numbers that are grouped together for comparison, for example, 2 of 16 responses,

38
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,620
we write the numbers as figures, regardless of whether or not the numbers are above or

39
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,860
below 10.

40
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:21,159
We write numbers as figures when we use them to represent time, dates, and age.

41
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,159
For example, 2 years ago, 1 hour 30 minutes.

42
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,110
As well as when we use them to denote a series, book, or table.

43
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,439
For example, Table 1, Group 4, page 55.

44
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:42,540
However, we use words for numbers that are below 10 and are not used to represent precise

45
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,540
measurements.

46
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,670
For example: eight items, nine pages.

47
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,269
We also use words for numbers that are at the beginning of a sentence, title, or heading.

48
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:59,439
For example, Fifty-seven percent of participants responded, or Ten participants improved after

49
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,670
the treatment, while 3 participants did not.

50
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:10,230
A lab report should include four major sections: the Title Page, Abstract, Main body, which

51
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:18,430
includes the Introduction, Method, Results, and Discussion, and then the References section.

52
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:25,380
We will now talk about the formatting of each section in turn using the APA style.

53
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,650
However, for your lab report, you will need to include in your submission the Title page,

54
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,750
the Introduction and Discussion sections from the main body, and the References section.

55
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,210
You do not need to write the Abstract, Method, or Result sections in your lab report.
