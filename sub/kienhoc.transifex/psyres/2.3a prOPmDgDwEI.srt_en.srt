Have you ever read a paper that was extremely difficult to read and you wondered why it

1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,290
wasn’t written in more simple sentences?

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,130
Sometimes research is written in a way that is needlessly complicated.

3
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,380
Often we see sentences like this “The research will allow for the provision of greater understanding

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,130
of student preferences.”

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,180
What we see here is an example of a writer replacing a verb with an Abstract noun.

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,180
Now remember?

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,200
A noun is a naming word and a verb is a doing word.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,910
“the provision of” in this sentence is the Abstract noun.

9
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,140
The word “provision” is not a doing word or a verb.

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,130
Rewriting this sentence by changing the noun into a verb would be “The research will

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,010
provide a greater understanding of student preferences”.

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,900
The word PROVIDE here is the verb.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,480
Rewriting the sentence this way makes the sentence sound shorter, active, and more to

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,510
the point.

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,039
So we should use verbs to do the job of verbs!
