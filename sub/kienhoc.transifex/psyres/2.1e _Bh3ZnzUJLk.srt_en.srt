00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:12,210
The Discussion section is where we relate our results back to our research question.

1
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,090
This is where we explain whether our findings were consistent with our predictions or not.

2
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,600
And also how those findings fit in with the broader literature on this topic.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,310
We essentially come back to the issues we identified in the Introduction and talk about

4
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,800
those in the context of our results.

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,850
Ultimately, we want to answer some specific questions.

6
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,170
Using the story analogy, we should be asking ourselves:

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,100
“How do our results relate back to the main characters of the story?”

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,550
“How do our results affect the main characters of the story?”

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,469
Specific to our lab report, therefore, the question is:

10
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:53,700
“How do our results affect the existing research and theories, developed by other

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,079
researchers, relating to the research topic that we have just investigated?”

12
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,850
The first paragraph of our discussion should be a summary of our research question and

13
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,339
what we found.

14
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:08,860
In the next paragraph, we should expand on the first, and relate our findings back to

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,880
our research question and predictions.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,750
In the following paragraphs, we relate our findings to the background literature that

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,250
we talked about in our Introduction.

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,500
This is where we have the opportunity to talk about WHAT our findings ACTUALLY mean in relation

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,670
to the existing literature.

20
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,020
We then talk about the possible strengths and limitations of our research study, our

21
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,960
recommendations for future research, and conclusions from our report.

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,829
So, in the Discussion section, we talk about our findings and relate them to existing literature.

23
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,900
Ultimately, we’re answering the question “What does our results mean in the grand

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,360
scheme of things?”

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,970
We highlight the strengths of our research study as well as the possible limitations,

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,399
and provide our suggestions for future research.
