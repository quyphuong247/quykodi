0
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,940
The body of your report should also start on a new page following the Abstract.

1
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,990
The Introduction is the first part of the body.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,480
Method is the next.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,070
Then followed by Results and Discussion.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,430
Your Introduction should start with the title of your report on the first line and centered.

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,400
The first paragraph of your Introduction should begin directly beneath the title.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,180
Each paragraph should follow directly from the previous paragraph with the beginning

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,800
of the paragraph indented.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,370
If you have a long Introduction, it can be broken up using subheadings.

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,620
All subheadings should be bolded and formatted according to the level of the heading.

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,720
All works and ideas that you refer to in your report should be referenced as in-text citations.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,470
This includes books, journal articles, and websites.

12
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,579
In-text references that are not used for citing direct quotes from another source only require

13
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:08,360
the author and the year of publication in the citation.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,259
For example, McKimmie, 2016 or Masser &amp; McKimmie, 2016.

15
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:21,969
For sources that consist of more than two authors, we write all the names of the authors

16
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:29,990
in text like Masser, McKimmie &amp; Terry, 2016, but if we use that same in-text citation again,

17
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,709
we write it as Masser et al., 2016.

18
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,380
All sources that are cited in your report must appear in your reference list at the

19
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,939
end of your report.

20
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,509
Your reference list is the last section of your report, so it should appear at the end.

21
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,189
It provides the information necessary for your readers to retrieve the sources you have

22
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:54,560
cited in your report.

23
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,409
Each reference you add to your reference list must be cited in your report.

24
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:05,570
The title “References” begins on a new page, centred on the first line and bolded.

25
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,669
Again, all text should be double-spaced.

26
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:13,460
There are some basic rules for writing each reference in the reference list.

27
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,840
All lines after the first line of each reference should be indented approximately 3cm from

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,580
the left margin.

29
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:28,069
The authors&#39; names are inverted, so last name first, and then initial their first names.

30
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:34,220
Capitalise only the first letter of the first word of a title, and the first word after

31
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,590
a colon if you use one.

32
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,580
Italicise the name of the journal and issue number.

33
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,620
And the page numbers go at the end of each reference.

34
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,200
The list of references should be alphabetised by the last name of the first author of each

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,040
reference.

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,870
If you come across papers published by the same first author, you then alphabetise them

37
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,719
by the second and subsequent authors.

38
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,549
If you’re listing papers published by the same author or authors in your reference list,

39
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:08,680
then you order them by year.

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,420
If the year is the same, then you simply add a letter, starting with the letter ‘a’,

41
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,419
after the year, in the order that the papers are cited in the lab report.
