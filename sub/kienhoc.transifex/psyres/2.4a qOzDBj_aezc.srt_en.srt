00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,620
So, we’ve been talking about some common mistakes people make when writing, and some

1
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,240
tips for writing in general.

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,220
What is it about writing a psychology research report that we have to pay special attention

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,220
to?

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,009
Well, it’s important that we follow a particular style when writing a research report.

5
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:31,460
The details of this is in the style guide published by the American Psychological Association.

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,950
This writing style is known as the APA style.

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,410
Before we get into the details of the APA style, let’s go through some general tips

8
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,720
about writing research reports.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,840
The first is that we should try to stay away from abbreviations, because sometimes, it

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
makes it difficult for the readers to track what the abbreviations stand for.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:01,020
For example, abbreviating a theory name such as social identity theory as SIT, can become

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,960
confusing if we’re using a lot of other abbreviations like SCT for social categorisation

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,579
theory, or if we only use the abbreviation once or twice.

14
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,020
This can become more problematic when we’re using abbreviations for concepts and theories

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,039
that are not well known.

16
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:24,619
We should only really use abbreviations for commonly used terms if they’re generally

17
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,159
accepted.

18
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,770
Using abbreviations is not the way to reduce our word count.

19
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,030
So in general, try to avoid using them and make the reading process easier for your reader

20
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,009
by spelling the words out.

21
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,450
Next, we should avoid using quotes when writing.

22
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,790
We should only use quotes when we’re discussing the words from the quote.

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,600
We shouldn’t use quotes to fill out the rest of our sentence because someone else

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,579
said it in a particular way.

25
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,530
A quote included in a piece of writing should only be used if we’re actually analysing

26
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,929
or critiquing the quote.

27
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:02,840
Otherwise, it’s much better to write in our own words what we think the theories mean

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,229
or what the findings tell us.

29
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:10,899
When doing this, don&#39;t just reword or paraphrase the existing material, think about what it

30
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,140
means and then write it in our own words.

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,799
We should never simply copy text from another author’s work, because that’s plagiarism.

32
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:26,849
Not only is plagiarism against the rules at universities, we’re not demonstrating our

33
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:32,769
understanding of the material when we just copy what someone else has written.

34
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,470
Another tip is that we should Avoid saying the same thing twice.

35
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,129
For example, the sentence: “The past research found that…”

36
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:44,230
All research is past research if it’s published.

37
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,370
Repeating the same thing twice like this can sound repetitive and lose the reader’s interest.

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,220
In this example, we can just say “Research found that...”.

39
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,650
Now, it’s really important for us all to be rigorous editors of our own work.

40
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,010
The first draft we write won’t be the draft we submit.

41
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,300
It’s common for researchers to write 12 - 20 drafts of a manuscript before it’s

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
published.

43
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,110
So, we shouldn’t be too precious about our writing.

44
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,189
We should write, go back, rewrite it, and get rid of all unnecessary words and awkward

45
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:20,189
sentences.

46
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:26,930
Then, we should go back again, and edit, and go back, and edit, and so on.

47
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,209
The editing process is where we can transform an okay piece of writing to something that

48
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,230
just sings.

49
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,089
That’s what we all should aim for.
