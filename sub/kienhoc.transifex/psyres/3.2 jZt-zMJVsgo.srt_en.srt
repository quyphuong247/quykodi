Now, don&#39;t worry if all this seems confusing at this stage.

1
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,890
We&#39;re going to be spending quite a bit of time stepping you through the process of writing

00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,580
and formatting an Introduction and Discussion section.

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,970
We will also give you a lot of help with how to critically analyse research papers and

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,380
use them in your Introduction to build an argument.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,730
You can always come back to any of these topics to refresh your memory for what we are doing

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,630

The most important thing when writing is that you know what you are writing about and why you are writing it.
