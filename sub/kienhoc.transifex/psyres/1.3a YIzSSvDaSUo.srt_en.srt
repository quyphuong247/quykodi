00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,510
My mum once got selected for jury service.

1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,180
She really wanted to be chosen to be a juror so that she could see what it was like.

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,869
The first day she went in wearing one outfit thinking it was a winner.

3
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:19,270
But it didn’t get her chosen.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,529
So she looked at what the people who got selected were wearing.

5
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,710
The next day, for a totally different case with different lawyers and a different pool

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,980
of jurors, she wore something different, more like what the people who had been selected

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,619
the day before.

8
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:32,960
This time she got chosen.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,900
Is this a good way to tell how jurors get selected?

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,840
Is it just what they wear?

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,649
There’s probably a whole lot of different things that are going on, including what type of case

12
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,860
it was, what the lawyers’ stereotypes about people are, and so on.

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,899
We can’t tell from her little experiment why she wasn’t selected the first day and

14
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,480
why she was selected the second day.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,660
Too many things changed across the days.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,000
I tell you this story because now we need to look at the next step in the scientific

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,839
method - where we develop the design of the study.

18
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:06,500
You can see from this story that designing how you’ll answer your research question

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,680
is very important.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,920
There&#39;s no single best research design to answer every research question.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,799
There&#39;s a whole range of research designs, and it’s important that we choose the one

22
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,990
that helps us to answer our research question.

23
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,950
We can think about the different research designs as existing on a continuum like this,

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,310
from the context of discovery all the way to the context of justification.

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,229
At this end of the spectrum, what we&#39;re trying to do is observe behaviours and figure out

26
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,979
what&#39;s going on, and develop our theory.

27
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,790
At this end, we&#39;re trying to actually test our theories and look for causation.

28
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,899
In the following videos, we’ll talk about the different research designs that researchers

29
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:48,120
use, and see where these designs sit on the spectrum.

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,409
To start with we’ll talk about observational research.

31
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,369
In observational research, the researcher just observes the behavior without interfering.

32
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,380
If we’re interested in the eating behaviour of undergraduate students, we could just go

33
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,430
to the cafeteria, sit in the corner, and just take lots of notes on the different eating

34
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,979
behaviours of the undergraduate students dining in the cafeteria.

35
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,620
That&#39;s a pretty simplistic example, but it gives you the idea.

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,950
A particular form of observational research is known as participant observation.

37
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,410
This is where the observer is participating in the context that they are observing.

38
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,370
Let me give you an example of participant observation that might give you a better idea

39
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,819
about what is involved.

40
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:34,269
If you’ve already done PSYC1030.1x Introduction to Social Psychology, you would have heard

41
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:39,709
about Leon Festinger and his theory of cognitive dissonance in the attitudes topic.

42
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,670
The way he got his ideas and developed that theory was through some initial research.

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,640
He infiltrated a cult.

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,459
He found out there was a group of people who believed the world was going to end.

45
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,810
They thought that there was going to be a massive flood, and they believed that they

46
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,569
were going to be rescued by space aliens in a UFO.

47
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,950
He realised that there wasn&#39;t going to be a flood, but he knew that the cult members

48
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,370
had given up a lot to join the cult.

49
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,350
So he thought it would be interesting to see what happened when they realised they wouldn’t

50
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:15,780
be rescued, and wouldn’t need to be rescued, despite having made a large personal sacrifice.

51
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,720
He wondered what they would do?

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,049
He infiltrated the cult with a couple of his co-researchers.

53
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,430
They became cult members and did cult member-y things, and they got to see what happened

54
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,530
at the time when the flood was supposed to occur but didn’t.

55
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,459
To be in this cult, you had to give up all your money, give up your job, cut yourself

56
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,799
off from your friends and family if they didn&#39;t want to become cult members, too, and then

57
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,049
spend your time meditating and praying so that the space aliens would realize you were

58
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,370
worth saving.

59
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,230
The appointed time for the world&#39;s destruction came and went, and there was no flood, and

60
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,110
there was no UFO, quite clearly because we&#39;re all here today.

61
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,450
What happened is the cult leader actually came out, after some period of trying to figure

62
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,650
out what had happened, and said that they&#39;d received further communication from the aliens

63
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,940
and that all of their dedicated meditation and praying had saved the entire planet.

64
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,709
Therefore, there wasn&#39;t going to be a flood because they had defended the planet from

65
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,160
the catastrophic flood.

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,720
The space aliens didn&#39;t need to come with the UFO to save people.

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,550
Now that&#39;s a pretty cool reorganisation of thoughts for people who&#39;ve given up a lot

68
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,600
and the world didn&#39;t work out the way they thought it was, right?

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,920
A lot of mental effort goes into that, and Festinger was fascinated by how people reconcile

70
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,470
such inconsistent thought.

71
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,030
That&#39;s how he generated his theory of cognitive dissonance.

72
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,910
And it was only by observing behaviour in its natural setting that it was possible to

73
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,930
study the behaviour of cult members.

74
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,050
You can’t get students to come into the lab and pretend to be a cult.

75
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,760
This is the major strength of observational research, observing behaviour in its natural

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,790
setting.

77
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,580
The interesting thing here is that one of the flaws of participant observation is that it’s

78
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,910
really hard to remain unobtrusive.

79
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,570
One of Festinger&#39;s fellow researchers actually became second-in-command of the cult.

80
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,190
It&#39;s clear that the researchers were having an effect on the phenomena that they were

81
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,190
observing.

82
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,980
It&#39;s also difficult to tease apart what is causing things to happen, and what is an effect

83
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,610
in observational studies because everything is happening all at once.
