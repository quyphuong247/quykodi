00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,540
Next I will describe some commonly used words that we should be deleting in our writing.

1
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,100
Number one: some people call it the “OF THE” issue.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,400
For example, the sentence “The leader OF THE research team”, can be simplified to

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,050
“The research team leader”.

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,289
Another example, “One OF THE researchers at the university”, can be simplified to

5
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:31,740
“A researcher at the university”.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,120
So, avoid writing “of the” when constructing a sentence is a good way to simplify its structure.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,799
Number two: the “OTHERS” issue.

8
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:47,800
For example, in this sentence “These findings are consistent with a study conducted in 2011,

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,440
but inconsistent with two OTHERS conducted earlier.”, the word “others” is not

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,120
needed, because we know that two studies were conducted earlier.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,940
Rewriting the same sentence as “These findings are consistent with a study conducted in 2011,

12
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,860
but inconsistent with two conducted earlier”, does not change the meaning of it, but it

13
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,750
sounds so much better.

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,840
Number three: the “BOTH” issue.

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,970
Let’s look at this sentence.

16
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,921
“Both Smith 1991 and Jones 1996 concluded that there was support for this theory”.

17
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:28,070
Here, the word “both” is not needed.

18
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:35,050
Rewriting the same sentence as “Smith 1991 and Jones 1996 concluded that there was support

19
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,440
for this theory” doesn’t change the meaning of it, but it shortens the sentence––making

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,050
it more concise and clear.

21
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,110
Number four: “THAT” issue

22
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,580
Writing “That” in a sentence often slows down the pace, so we can sometimes leave it

23
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,690
out.

24
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:58,020
For example, the sentence “Jones 1996 argued that his findings supported the first theory”

25
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,830
can be written as Slide “Jones 1996 argued his findings supported the first theory”

26
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,240
without changing the meaning of the sentence.

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,660
However, the sentence becomes shorter and more to the point.

28
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,660
So, the words “OF THE”, “OTHERS”, “BOTH”, and “THAT” are the commonly

29
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:10,670
used words that we should avoid using in our writing.
