So, what are the different types of words we can use in our report?

1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,400
Nouns are naming words.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
Nouns can be either be common or proper.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,250
A common noun is a non-specific item such as house, book or violin, but a proper noun

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:31,400
names a specific thing such as a person, a location, a building, or an event.

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,500
Proper nouns always take a capital letter.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,460
Nouns can be concrete or abstract.

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,120
Concrete nouns can be seen, touched, smelt, or tasted because they refer to tangible items

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,280
such as books, chairs, or food.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,239
Abstract nouns cannot be detected by the senses because they name ideas, concepts, generalities,

10
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,809
qualities, notions and trends, like pleasure, beauty, wisdom, or justice.

11
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,290
Collective nouns are count nouns that denote a group of individuals.

12
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,460
Things like family or team.

13
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,340
A pronoun stands in place of a noun, a noun phrase, or a name.

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:20,940
So, a pronoun is a noun substitute, like, he, she, it, or they.

15
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,119
Adjectives are describing words, like systematic, quiet, or soft.

16
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,280
Adverbs modify the meaning of an adjective for example.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,550
They’re often formed by adding &#39;-ly&#39; to certain adjectives, like analysed systematically,

18
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,000
where systematically is the adverb.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,430
Verbs are action or doing words, like examine, analyse, investigate.

20
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,869
These are the basic building blocks to what we’ll be talking about in the following

00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:50,369
