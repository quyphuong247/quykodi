1
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,339
two lists of traits.

2
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:17,119
Now, when we look at the generosity ratings, you should notice something curious.

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,900
Most people who saw the first list tended to think that Mike was not very generous.

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,620
Those who saw the second list, generally thought that Mike was generous this is what Asch (1946)

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,390
found when he presented the same lists to research participants.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,170
So, what’s going on?

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,050
Well if you take a close look at the two lists of traits, you will see that there is only

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,280
one difference between them.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,309
In the first list, Mike is described as being cold, while in the second list he is described

10
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,990
as being warm.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,460
Surely if we are forming our impressions algebraically, the two lists should have produce pretty similar

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,789
impressions - they only differ by one word after all.

13
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,520
However, that is not what happened.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,000
The reason why warm and cold make such a difference, is because according to Asch, they are central

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,140
traits.

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,140
This means that they give meaning to the other traits that are presented - these other traits

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,070
are the peripheral traits.

18
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,450
So someone who is described as being warm, intelligent, determined and industrious sounds

19
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,540
like a pretty good person - you probably want them helping you with your assignment or working

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,500
in your team at work.

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,250
Someone described as being cold, intelligent, determined and industrious sounds a bit scarier

22
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,240
- more like a serial killer.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,820
They probably have a coiled rope, shovel, and some plastic sheeting in the back of their

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,650
car &quot;just in case&quot; the opportunity arises.

25
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,570
Now, you might be thinking that the warm/cold pairing produces the different impressions

26
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,040
because &quot;warm&quot; is a positive word and &quot;cold&quot; is a negative word.

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,320
Asch thought about that too.

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,380
He also showed his participants another pair of positive and negative words.

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,500
Namely &quot;polite&quot; and &quot;blunt&quot;.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,250
As you can see from Asch’s results, there was a systematic difference in the impressions

31
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:01,070
when people were shown warm versus cold – the person was seen as being more generous, wiser,

32
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,360
happier and better natured.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,179
For those shown polite versus blunt, there was no such systematically more positive impression.

34
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,959
There were no differences in how generous the person was seen as, and the person was

35
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,060
actually seen as wiser when “blunt” was presented - so if you want to appear smart,

36
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,379
just be a bit rude perhaps?

37
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,670
Polite people were seen as being better natured though.

38
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,420
So Asch thought that this meant to impressions were not formed algebraically, but rather

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,959
that an impression is based on an emergent pattern that depends on the total context

40
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,899
of the information that you have access to.
