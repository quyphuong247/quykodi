An Infinitive is the basic form of a verb.

1
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,310
The base form of a verb is what you see in a dictionary.

2
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,680
It will have the marker ‘to’ in front of it, for example, ‘to write’ or ‘to

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
study’.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,960
Sometimes, people split the infinitive when they put an adverb between the “to” and

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,000
the “verb”.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,320
A popular example is the opening of the Star Trek television series “to boldly go where

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,870
no man has gone before”.

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,659
The adverb BOLDLY is splitting the infinitive TO GO.

9
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:47,290
Writing this sentence as “To go boldly where no man has gone before”, or “To go where

10
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,280
no man has gone before boldly” sounds a little awkward.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,790
If we dropped “boldly” and just said “To go where no man has gone before” it just

12
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,770
doesn’t sound the same.

13
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,980
So sometimes, the adverb sounds better in between “to” and the verb.

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,210
However, it’s a good idea not to split the infinitives.

15
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,820
Generally, sentences are clearer when we avoid splitting infinitives.

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,750
If you really have to split the infinitive, make sure you do it on purpose and for a reason.
