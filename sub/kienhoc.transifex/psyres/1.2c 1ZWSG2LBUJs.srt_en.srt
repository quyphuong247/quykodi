00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:13,030
When we&#39;re operationalising our variables, we need to keep in mind reliability and validity.

1
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,869
As the process of operationalisation requires us to define how the abstract concept we’re

2
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:23,640
investigating is measured, it’s important that the measure we use is both reliable and

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,640
valid.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,760
Reliability is sometimes confusingly also called internal validity.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,150
It&#39;s the extent to which a measure produces consistent results.

6
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,050
Validity, also called external validity, is the extent to which a measure measures the

7
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,630
thing it&#39;s supposed to measure.

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,640
It’s whether we&#39;re actually measuring what we think we&#39;re measuring.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,670
As an example of reliability, imagine we want to measure how tall a particular person is,

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,690
and we get out our tape measure.

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,460
Now if we have a look, we can see that our person according to this tape measure is about

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,290
170 cm tall.

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,930
I’m not very confident in my measurement, so I think I should double check it and take

14
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,300
a second measurement.

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,900
This time, because the tape measure is kind of difficult to use, it flops all over the

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,740
place, I get a different measurement, 180 cm.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,750
My measurement is different each time I try to measure this person’s height.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,390
That would tell us that this measure is not very reliable.

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,480
When I’m measuring this person, you can see how unreliable my measure is, because

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,439
you can see the tape measure flopping about.

21
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,310
When we use psychological measures, it&#39;s not so easy to see how stretchy they are, how

22
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,320
unreliable they are, so we have particular methods that we use to assess their reliability.

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,759
There are different techniques we could use to evaluate the reliability of tests.

24
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:48,490
These include: Alternate forms reliability, split half reliability, and test retest reliability.

25
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,600
Alternate forms reliability involves the evaluation of two different versions of the same measure.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,670
The scores from the two tests are then compared to see if the measure is actually reliable.

27
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,179
As you can see here, as the scores on one go up, they go up on the other.

28
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:06,719
You notice that they&#39;re quite closely clustered together on that diagonal.

29
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,190
There&#39;s not a lot of error or variation in where the scores fall.

30
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,450
They generally increase on both at the same rate.

31
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,830
That would tell us our measure is reliable, because the two versions of the measure are

32
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,230
effectively producing the same result.

33
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,549
Split half reliability also involves the evaluation of two measures.

34
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:29,760
However sometimes, maybe due to money or time constraints, it might not be possible

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,099
for researchers to develop two versions of the measure.

36
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:38,099
So when this happens, what we can do is split the one measure into two measures.

37
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,609
From here, we can do what we did before, which was compare performance on the first half

38
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:45,760
of the measure and their performance on the second half.

39
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,120
We can graph it, and it looks exactly the same.

40
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,190
It&#39;s the same data because conceptually it&#39;s exactly the same idea.

41
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,209
Test retest reliability involves getting the same group of people to complete the same

42
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,370
measure twice with a break in between.

43
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,709
We then compare their performance on the two occasions.

44
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,870
We could plot the results on a graph, I think you know where I’m going with this!

45
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,540
This is the exact same graph as before and the same idea conceptually.

46
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,030
We’re looking for people who scored low on time one to also score low on time two,

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,810
and people who score high at time one who also score high at time two.

48
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,400
The scores are roughly the same between the two testing times.

49
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,180
This would indicate that our test reliability is high.

50
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,980
We need to be careful to choose measures that don&#39;t stretch and move around too much because

51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,480
we want consistent measurement across time.

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,349
What about validity?

53
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,799
Now imagine I&#39;m trying to measure this person’s height, and they stand on some bathroom scales.

54
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,780
Is that a sensible idea?

55
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,280
Body mass is correlated with height.

56
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,829
So maybe we can measure their height by measuring their weight.

57
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,330
But measuring somebody’s weight in kilograms is not really a valid measure of height.

58
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,010
It&#39;s true that on average, taller people tend to be heavier than shorter people, but it&#39;s

59
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,230
an imperfect relationship.

60
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,170
We could take all of your heights and weights and graph them, and that would be all over

61
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,220
the place.

62
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,200
Some tall people don&#39;t weigh much.

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,280
Some short people weigh quite a bit, and then everything in between.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,269
So, using bathroom scales to measure height is a bad idea.

65
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,470
It&#39;s not measuring what we think we&#39;re measuring, so the measures we get from bathroom scales

66
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,700
as a representation of someone’s height are not that helpful.

67
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,610
Instead, we should use a ruler or a tape measure.

68
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,330
So when choosing measures, it’s important that we choose those that are both reliable

69
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:34,930
and valid.
