0
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,120
So, if there’s a positive correlation between the number of ice creams people eat at the

1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,419
beach and the number of people who drown, what could be a possible explanation for this

2
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,580
relationship?

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,260
Well, one possibility could be that eating ice cream causes people to drown at the beach.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,700
Maybe our parents were right afterall that we should wait for half an hour after eating before

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,350
going for a swim?

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,430
The problem with a correlational design though, is that we can’t tell which variable causes

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,090
changes in the other variable.

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,700
In this example, we can rule out the possibility that drowning causes people to eat ice cream.

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,390
That’s a pretty unlikely possibility.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,600
So, can we confidently say, then, that eating ice cream causes people to drown?

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,151
There’s only two possible directions for this relationship, and we’ve ruled out one

12
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:54,930
of them, right?

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,170
Well the issue is that there might be other variables involved in the ice cream - drowning

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,860
relationship, apart from those captured by the correlation, namely the number of ice

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,940
creams eaten and the number of drownings.

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,710
So, what might be these other variables, and how can we explain that correlation?

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,750
Well, the obvious one is temperature.

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,960
The hotter it gets, the more people go to the beach, the more people each ice cream

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,530
at the beach, and the more people there are to drown at the beach.

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,070
So it’s temperature, or number of people if you want to think of it that way, that explains

21
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,220
the correlation between ice creams and drownings.

22
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,930
Temperature is the variable that causes the changes in the number of ice creams people

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,450
eat and the number of people who drown, not just eating ice cream per se.

24
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,490
If we wanted to find out whether eating ice cream causes people to drown or not, we would

25
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,780
have to run an experiment.

26
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,159
In order for us to establish causation, we must manipulate one variable.

27
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,700
That&#39;s our independent variable.

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,790
We would take a large group of people, and divide them in half.

29
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,630
For half of the people, we would feed them ice cream.

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,700
Lots and lots of ice cream!

31
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,510
For the other half of people, we wouldn’t feed them any ice cream.

32
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,420
Our independent variable is whether people are fed ice cream or not.

33
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,090
We manipulate the independent variable to see its effect on the dependent variable.

34
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,980
The dependent variable is the rate of drowning.

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,069
We take the two groups of people down to the beach, and we just push all of them into the water.

36
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,840
Then, we get our binoculars out, observe the number of people who drown, and calculate

37
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,209
the relative rate of drowning for the people who were fed ice cream and for those who were

38
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,300
not fed ice cream to see if there’s a statistical difference between the two groups.

39
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:43,540
We would need a large sample size to be able to reliably detect an effect if there is one.

40
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,050
That would be an experiment to investigate if eating ice cream causes drowning.

41
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,060
This experiment is obviously highly unethical, and clearly we would never actually do it.

42
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,819
Seriously, don’t try to do this experiment.

43
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,250
Experimental designs give us a lot of control over the variables that we’re investigating,

44
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,650
so they are the best way to try and disentangle cause from effect.

45
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,510
However, depending on the variables we’re investigating, it is not always ethical or

46
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,110
legal to manipulate them.

47
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,240
For example, we can&#39;t examine whether imprisonment helps to rehabilitate people who are serial

48
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,420
killers through manipulating the variables of interest.

49
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,600
We can’t bring together 50 serial killers and put them in a jail, and bring together

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,060
another 50 serial killers, put them out into the community, and see what happens.

51
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,750
We can&#39;t do that.

52
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,200
Because experiments are typically conducted under very controlled circumstances, they

53
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,230
often lack the reality of everyday life.

54
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,489
We can&#39;t study cult behaviour by getting people in the lab and saying, &quot;All right, you guys,

55
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,250
thanks for coming to this research session.

56
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,849
It&#39;s going to take about an hour.

57
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,050
Now, you know, you&#39;re in a cult now.

58
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,150
Just do cult things, and I&#39;m going to just watch what happens.

59
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,019
The end of the world is going to happen in about 45 minutes.

60
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,840
Knock yourselves out.&quot;

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,690
It just won’t work.

62
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,360
We often have to come up with artificial scenarios, but use them for a very specific purpose.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,470
It’s because we&#39;re interested in the cause and effect.

64
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,860
If designed correctly, experimental designs are the only research method where we can

65
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,569
gather unambiguous information about causes and effects.

66
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,430
Let&#39;s have a look at this possible study.

67
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,620
Let&#39;s say I&#39;m interested in whether people’s heart rate and blood pressure will be higher after

68
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,610
viewing a violent film compared to a non-violent film.

69
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,930
So maybe for the violent film we show them &quot;Commando&quot;.

70
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,509
At the time it was released, it depicted the most amount of killings in any Hollywood movie.

71
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,539
For the non-violent film, we show something from “The Wiggles.”

72
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:40,650
The Wiggles is a children’s musical television show.

73
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,889
If you&#39;re not a parent, it should not be violent and won’t cause anxiety or rage or anything.

74
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,330
If you are, well, it might.

75
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,960
Imagine we run a study where for those people who turn up to the morning session, we show

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,369
them the “Commando” film, and for those who turn up to the afternoon testing session,

77
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:57,210
we show them “The Wiggles.”

78
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,340
We then measure their heart rate and blood pressure.

79
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,319
What do you think is the independent variable?

80
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,939
And what’s the dependent variable?
