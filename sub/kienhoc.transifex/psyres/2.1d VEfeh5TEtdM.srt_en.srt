0
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,040
The Method section is where we break down the specific methods of how we went about

1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,050
investigating our research question.

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:19,020
It includes information relating to the participants, such as their age, how they were recruited,

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,400
and where they were from.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,090
In the Method section, we also highlight the variables of interest, and how these variables

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,310
were measured.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:34,160
So, the Method section is typically separated into subsections that describe: the participants,

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,230
the study design, and the materials and procedures.

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,050
This is where we describe how we manipulated the independent variables and measured the

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,050
results.

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,010
If we used scales in our study, we will need to provide information about the reliability

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,070
of these scales, and where we got them from if they’re existing scales.

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,750
The main aim of the Method section is to outline the exact procedures of our research study,

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,790
so that other researchers can understand exactly what we did in our study, and how they can

14
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,490
replicate it.

15
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,150
The Results section is where we reveal our findings.

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,450
It reports all of the statistics from our findings.

17
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,790
This is where we report the analytic strategies we’ve used for analysing the results, report

18
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,409
our findings, and relate our findings to our predictions.

19
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:28,270
The results section is where we report and summarise all the statistics from our findings.
