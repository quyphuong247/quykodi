00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,860
Let’s talk about the use of the word “which” and the word “that”.

1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,950
Generally, the word WHICH, with a comma before it, is used when the content following the

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,480
word “which” isn&#39;t necessary for the understanding of the sentence.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,380
The word THAT, without a comma before it, is used to show the significance of that description.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,380
For example:

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,960
“The bucket of water, WHICH has a thermometer, is temperature controlled.”

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,930
versus “The bucket of water THAT has a thermometer is temperature controlled.”

7
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,460
In the second sentence, it’s important to know that the presence of the thermometer

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,190
tells us which bucket is temperature controlled.

9
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:52,400
The first sentence does not suggest that having a thermometer is a UNIQUE aspect of that bucket.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,280
Now, it&#39;s important to note that the word THAT isn&#39;t needed in the sentence in some

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
cases.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,400
For example:

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,979
The sentence: “The research THAT was conducted in 2004 provided support for the idea.”

14
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:12,270
versus “The research conducted in 2004 provided support for the idea.”

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,499
Leaving the word THAT out in the second sentence makes the sentence less wordy and more concise.

16
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:25,220
Apart from knowing when to use and not to use the word WHICH and the word THAT, it’s

17
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,890
also important that we pay attention to how we use our pronouns.

18
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,890
Now remember?

19
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:38,510
A pronoun is any word that stands in place of a noun, like, he, she, it, or they.

20
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,319
When we misuse pronouns, we could create confusion for the reader.

21
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,329
For example, if we wrote, “The students left their notes in the lecture theatre.

22
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,319
They were too busy chatting.”

23
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,520
Does this mean the notes were too busy chatting or the students were too busy chatting?

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,670
Because, the word “They” could be linked to the noun “notes” or to the noun “students”.

25
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,319
Rewriting these sentences as “The students left their notes in the lecture theatre.

26
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,760
The students were too busy chatting” makes it very clear who the noun is that we’re

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,000
referring to.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,900
Now sometimes, people like to begin a sentence with the word “there”, like “there were”,

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,980
“there are”, or “there was”.

30
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,400
Generally speaking, we should avoid starting a sentence with the word “there”, as in

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,540
most cases, words like “there were”, “there are”, or “there was” are not needed

32
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,280
at the beginning of a sentence.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,739
For example, people sometimes write: “There was good evidence to support these predictions”.

34
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,069
This sentence can simply be rewritten as “Good evidence supported these predictions”.

35
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,659
The last issue I would like to talk about is the apostrophe.

36
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,640
People are often confused with how they should be using it.

37
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,060
The apostrophe with the letter “s” is a type of punctuation used to indicate the

38
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,010
possession of nouns and pronouns.

39
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,860
It indicates ownership or that one thing belongs to another.

40
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,299
For singular possessive nouns, like RESEARCHER, we simply add the apostrophe and “s” at

41
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:19,630
the end of the word, like “The researcher’s data”, when we’re describing the data

42
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,719
that belongs to a single researcher.

43
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,469
For plural nouns, on the other hand, they already end with the letter “s”, like

44
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:28,590
RESEARCHERS.

45
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,870
So, in order to indicate the data belongs to more than one researcher, we add the apostrophe

46
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,689
AFTER the “s”.

47
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:39,720
For example, “The researchers’ data”.

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,280
However, when we write the word “it’s”, “it’s” written this way is a CONTRACTION

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,000
of “it is”.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,989
When we write “it’s”, we are not communicating the possession of “it”.

51
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,780
The possessive form of “it” is written as “its”.

52
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,519
For example, “Its findings”.

53
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,629
So, these are the common mistakes people make when writing.

54
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:09,249
Be mindful of YOUR writing, and try to avoid making these mistakes.
