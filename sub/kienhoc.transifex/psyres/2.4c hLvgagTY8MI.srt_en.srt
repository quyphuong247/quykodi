00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,280
The title page should contain the title of the paper, the author&#39;s name, and the institution

1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,480
that the author is affiliated with.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,810
The title page should include the page header and the page number at the top right corner

3
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,890
of the page.

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,230
Type the title of your report in upper and lowercase letters centered in the upper half

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,660
of the page.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,710
Generally speaking, your title should not be more than 12 words long, contain abbreviations,

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,250
or words that serve no purpose.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,600
Your title may take up two lines on the page.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,969
Beneath your title, type your name: first name, middle initials, and then last name.

10
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:53,960
And beneath your name, type the institution that you are affiliated with, for example,

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,420
The University of Queensland.

12
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,239
This normally indicates the location where the authors conducted the research.

13
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,589
The Abstract section starts on a new page.

14
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,430
Your Abstract page should already include the page header.

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,450
On the first line of your Abstract page, center the word “Abstract” in the same font and

16
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,170
font size as the rest of the text, but bolded.

17
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,030
Without any indent, beginning on the next line, and write a concise summary of your

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:30,320
research including your research topic, research question, participants, method, results, data

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,910
analysis, and conclusions.

20
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,579
You can also include possible implications of your research and any future directions

21
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,290
from your findings.

22
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,250
Your Abstract should only be a single paragraph and double-spaced, and between approximately

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,810
150 and 250 words.
