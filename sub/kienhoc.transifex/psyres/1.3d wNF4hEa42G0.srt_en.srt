With correlational research we&#39;re looking for relationships between variables.

1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,080
Correlational research is great when we can&#39;t

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,060
manipulate the variables that we’re interested in.

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,930
If I&#39;m interested in the relationship between age and test performance in this course, I

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,380
can&#39;t experimentally make some people older and some people younger.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,000
It&#39;s not possible because I don’t have a time machine.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,410
So instead, I can use a correlational design to investigate this relationship.

7
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,050
We can measure the variables of interest, and then we can look how much the variance

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,050
of one variable is related to the variance of the other.

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,230
We can represent that relationship with a correlation coefficient, which is a number

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,840
that ranges from negative one to positive one.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,930
A correlation coefficient of negative one is a perfect negative relationship.

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,010
With a negative correlation, as one variable goes down, the other variable goes up.

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,540
A correlation coefficient of zero means there&#39;s no relationship between the two variables.

14
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,640
And a correlation coefficient of positive one is a perfect positive relationship.

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,680
With a positive correlation however, as one variable increases, the other variable also

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,920
increases.

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,620
The closer the value of the correlation coefficient to either negative or positive one, the

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,330
more one variable accounts for variation in the other.

19
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,780
The closer to zero, the less that one variable shares variation with the other.

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,460
The major issue with correlational designs is that you can’t really demonstrate causality.

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,350
Let me give you some examples that will hopefully highlight this point.

22
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,710
These are purely fictional.

23
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,360
There&#39;s no hidden message here at all.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,540
Imagine, I follow all the students here on campus, measure how long they spend in the

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,370
library, and compare the amount of time they spend in the library to their grades.

26
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,520
I can plot each of those variables against each other like this.

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,700
So each point on this plot would represent a student’s time in the library and also

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,950
their grade.

29
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,780
What a correlation coefficient does is it allows me to summarise those dots with a single

30
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,849
line, and that line minimises the variability of scores around that line.

31
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:17,590
Not every dot is on the line, but that line represents the relationship that has the least

32
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,700
amount of error variance.

33
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,180
That correlation is not perfect, but it&#39;s about .6, and it&#39;s positive.

34
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,940
As the number of hours spent in the library goes up, grades go up to some extent, as well.

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,139
Remember this is pure fiction and just an example, I’m not hinting at anything.

36
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:41,870
Imagine, I also track you when you&#39;re going to your local pub or bar, write down how long

37
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,900
you spend at the bar, and plot that against your grades.

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,560
And then, I calculate the correlation coefficient based on this information.

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,799
Lo and behold, there&#39;s a negative correlation of about .6.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,600
As students spend more hours in the bar, their grades go down.

41
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,400
Does that mean that going to the library improves your grades and going to the pub or bar decreases

42
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:05,409
your grades?

43
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:08,430
No, it just means they are associated.

44
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,140
It&#39;s possible that when you find out your grades are okay, you go to the library to

45
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,400
maximise your chance of doing better because you feel like you are good at studying.

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,959
You feel that you have self-efficacy.

47
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,199
The grades could produce the study behaviour.

48
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,060
It’s also possible that if you get bad grades, you go to the bar for longer because that&#39;s

49
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,859
how you&#39;re going to drown out the memory of a bad result on the test.

50
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:32,700
The causation could go the other way.

51
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,599
Here&#39;s an example of zero correlation.

52
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,169
Eating more ice cream is not correlated with students’ grades in Psychology.

53
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,309
Unfortunately, some variables are just not correlated.

54
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:47,650
While we&#39;re talking about ice cream, let me give you another example.

55
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,989
What if I told you that there’s a strong positive correlation between the amount of

56
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,720
ice cream people eat at the beach and the number of drownings?

57
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,529
So, the more ice cream people ate at the beach, the larger the number of drownings.

58
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:02,449
Does that mean eating ice cream causes people to drown?
