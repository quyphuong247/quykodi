0
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,620
Now, it’s a good idea to structure our writing in a way that the reader will be hooked into

1
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:13,879
our story from the very beginning.

2
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:17,859
Every paragraph we write should lead to something that’s interesting enough for the reader

3
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,230
to want to read on.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,920
So, we need to start out with an interesting title.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,779
Something that’s easy for the reader to understand.

6
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,400
An interesting title is our first opportunity to engage the reader in the topic we’re

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
writing about.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,830
Now, our lab report can’t start out with a title that doesn’t actually relate to

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:41,230
the content of our report, just because we want to have a catchy and interesting title.

10
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,660
The best titles convey the main idea of the research paper in a way that’s interesting

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,250
and easy to read.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,550
Sometimes, the title can be difficult to write.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,600
So, it’s ok to write it after we have written the rest of the report.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,250
Because by then, we will be more familiar with the content of our report, and will find

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,300
it easier to think of an interesting title that summarises the main point of our report.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,730
Next, is the Abstract.

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:13,120
The Abstract introduces the topic, and a short summary of our entire lab report.

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,120
It describes the frame of our report, including what our research question was, what we tested––including

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,850
the variables of interest, what we found, and what our conclusions were from our results.

20
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,550
The Abstract can also be difficult to write.

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,560
Just like the title, it’s ok to write the Abstract last.
