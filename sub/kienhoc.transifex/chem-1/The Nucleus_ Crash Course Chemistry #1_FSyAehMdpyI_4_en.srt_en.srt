00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,980
Hello, I'm Hank Green and I want to teach
you chemistry.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,009
But please, do not run away screaming.

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,320
If you give me five minutes to try to convince
you that chemistry is not torture,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,159
but instead the amazing and beautiful science
of stuff,

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,980
and if you give it a chance it will not only blow your mind but also give you a deeper understanding of your world.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,539
This is just my opinion here,

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,070
but I think that understanding the world leads
to greater ability to enjoy the world

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,070
and there's nothing that helps you understand
the world better than chemistry.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,359
Chemistry holds the secrets to how life first
formed, how cancers are cured,

10
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,579
how iPhones have bigger hard drives than 5
year old laptops,

11
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:43,879
and how life on this planet might just be able to continue thriving, even ours, if we play our cards right.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,960
Chemistry is the science of how three tiny particles, the proton, the neutron, and the electron,

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,179
came together in trillions of combinations
to form, get this, everything.

14
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,000
Now chemistry is a peculiar science,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,219
sometimes talked about as a bridge between
the ultra abstract world of particle physics

16
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,919
and the more visible sciences like biology.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,420
But calling chemistry a bridge is like calling
Eurasia an island.

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,320
Chemistry has it all, mad scientists, world
changing revelations, the practical, the impractical,

19
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,739
medicine, bombs, food, beauty, destruction, life and death, answers to questions you never knew you had.

20
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:25,459
I love chemistry, and I hope I can give you
a glimpse into why.

21
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:31,209
So today, let's start out with maybe the biggest
idea of all time, and move on from there:

22
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:34,659
stuff is made from atoms.

23
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:44,140
[Theme Music]

24
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,500
I know, you aren't shocked, you aren't awed,
you might not even be paying attention any more,

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,680
but when atomic theory was first proposed,
it sounded pretty crazy.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,320
And yes, we call it 'Atomic Theory', using
the scientific definition of theory,

27
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,559
which is "a well-tested set of ideas that
explains many disparate observations",

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,659
not the colloquial definition of theory, which
is "a guess."

29
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,539
But luckily there's no-one running around
any more saying "atoms are just a theory."

30
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,340
But it wasn't that long ago that people were
running around saying that.

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,860
You wanna know who settled it for good?
Einstein!

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,099
Atoms had been postulated for a long time
by the 20th century,

33
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:25,098
but it wasn't until Einstein mathematically proved the existence of atoms and molecules in 1905

34
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:26,840
that the matter was truly settled.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,420
And you thought Einstein was all about relativity
and E=mc2, he also proved atoms exist!

36
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,859
Here's how it happened:

37
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,160
In 1827, a botanist named Robert Brown was looking at pollen grains in water through a microscope

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,960
and he noticed that they jiggled randomly even when there was no movement to cause the jiggling.

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,520
It was a mystery for a long time.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,659
Until 1905 when Einstein theorized that this
phenomenon was caused by

41
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,889
as-yet-unproven atomic particles actually
smacking into the grains of pollen.

42
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:02,189
He wrote up some fancy math, showing that
his theory predicted this motion almost perfectly,

43
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:08,900
and everyone had to concede that yes, tiny discrete bits of matter were indeed smacking into the pollen,

44
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,920
and thus molecules, and by extension atoms,
must exist.

45
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:18,859
Today, we remember this botanist and his discovery by calling the motion he observed Brownian motion.

46
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:25,420
It's kinda crazy that every physical thing you've ever interacted with is made up of little ball thingies.

47
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,199
It started with people wondering what would happen if you just kept slicing something in half forever.

48
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,479
Eventually, and of course it turns out that
there's no knife sharp enough to do this,

49
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,009
you end up with one, pure, unbreakable bit
of that substance.

50
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,278
The word "atom", indeed, is from the Greek
for "indivisible",

51
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:45,378
though, of course, as we learned in World
War II, atoms can be broken as well.

52
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:50,798
So all the stuff that we think of as stuff is made of atoms, tiny discrete particles that have specific properties,

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,820
depending on the arrangement of three simple
subatomic particles.

54
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:01,219
There's the proton, heavy and positively charged, the neutron, about the same size as the proton but neutral,

55
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:05,800
and the electron, which has the same amount
of charge as the proton, just opposite,

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,160
and very nearly has no mass at all, about 1800 times less massive than the proton or neutron.

57
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,019
Protons and neutrons hang out in the nucleus,
and thus are the nuclear components or nucleons;

58
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,759
electrons hang out around the nucleus and are the parts of the atom that do all the interesting chemical stuff.

59
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,560
But before we get to the chemistry of the electrons, we first have got to understand the properties of the nucleus.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,819
Okay, this is pretty important, so pay attention
here.

61
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:33,050
The number of protons in an atom determines
what element it is.

62
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,780
79 protons: always gold.
59 protons: always praseodymium.

63
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,659
The number of protons in an element is its
atomic number.

64
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,939
It sits right on top of the box in the periodic table because that is the element's defining trait.

65
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:51,000
So an atom of silver with 47 protons in its
nucleus is always an atom of silver.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,779
Depending on what its electrons are doing
and what it's bonded to,

67
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:59,799
it might be part of a chemical that's silver-colored or black or blue or shiny or poisonous or a cure for disease,

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,040
but whatever it is, that atom is still silver and will remain an atom of silver probably forever,

69
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,200
because that core number is very, very difficult
to change.

70
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,719
Now you might have noticed something weird
about silver here:

71
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,210
it's chemical symbol, the one- or two-letter
short code that tells you what it is, is Ag,

72
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:26,159
not Si, which is silicon, or Sv which is perfectly
available, but Ag. Why? To torture you? No.

73
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,180
Silver, of course, because we've known about it for a long time, was one of the first elements added to the periodic table,

74
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:35,810
and back then it was called "argentum", Latin
for "shiny gray stuff."

75
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,490
Also, the root of the word "Argentina",

76
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,790
where Spanish explorers heard rumors of mountains
made of silver, which of course did not exist.

77
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,129
The name "Argentina", just like the chemical
symbol "Ag", stuck,

78
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:53,350
despite neither of them being particularly
representative of reality. Now, back to science.

79
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,370
Nuclei, which is the plural of nucleus, are
boring.

80
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,939
They're thousands of times smaller than the
atom as a whole,

81
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:03,259
and they mostly just sit around being exactly
the same as they were when they were first

82
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,120
created billions of years ago,

83
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,959
held together by the strongest of the four fundamental forces of physics, the strong nuclear force.

84
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,439
The fact that nuclei are so boring is the very reason they're the defining characteristic of elements.

85
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,560
While electrons can jump from atom to atom
whenever it's convenient,

86
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,959
the number of protons is almost always extremely
stable.

87
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,519
So that core of the atom, the nucleus, always
comes out of chemical reactions unscathed.

88
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,500
It's the bit that we can bump around from
reaction to reaction,

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,319
but always remains pure and behaves the same way as any other atom with that number of protons.

90
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,599
The atomic number is the soul of the atom.
It's what makes it it.

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,939
Neutrons are important too, of course, in their own way, but they don't change what element an atom is.

92
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:48,040
One of the two keys to all things chemical
is charge, we'll discuss that in another episode,

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,980
and since neutrons don't have any charge, they mostly don't change the properties of an atom.

94
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,900
But they are, nonetheless, vital.

95
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:59,219
We all know that like charges repel each other.
Neutrons serve as a kind of buffer between the protons.

96
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,460
You couldn't pack silver's 47 protons together
in the nucleus by themselves.

97
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:06,009
They couldn't handle it; they'd rip themselves
apart.

98
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:11,129
So nuclei only clump together permanently when the right number of protons and neutrons get together.

99
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:17,170
Silver needs about 60 neutrons to space out the 47 protons correctly. But it doesn't have to be 60.

100
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,610
In fact, silver nuclei are also very stable
with 62 neutrons.

101
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,040
61 though, that doesn't work, and the reasons for that, I don't know, you would have to talk to a nuclear physicist.

102
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,819
The atomic number of silver doesn't change
as the number of neutrons changes

103
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:33,359
because the number of protons stays the same.

104
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,060
But the relative atomic mass does change.

105
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,780
Relative atomic mass, which used to be called
atomic weight back when I was in school,

106
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,000
is basically the number of protons plus the number of neutrons averaged across all the silver on Earth.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,519
Because silver has two different stable isotopes,
each with a different number of neutrons,

108
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,579
its relative atomic mass ends up not being
a whole number.

109
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:57,519
About 52% of silver has 60 neutrons and about
48% has 62.

110
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:04,500
The relative atomic mass, then, ends up being
about halfway between 107 and 109, 107.8682.

111
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,040
You'll note that I said these two different
sorts of silver are called isotopes,

112
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,960
they have different masses but the same chemical
properties,

113
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,129
and are the same element and so belong in
the same place on the periodic table.

114
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:18,360
In fact, the word "isotope" means "same place".

115
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,060
And different isotopes have different mass
numbers.

116
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,660
The mass number is just the total number of nucleons in the nucleus, which is different from atomic mass.

117
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:33,340
It's simple addition for a single atom, rather than an average of all the relative atomic masses of all the silver atoms on Earth.

118
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:39,240
So silver has two stable isotopes, one with
a mass number of 107, which we'd call silver-107,

119
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,539
and one with a mass number of 109, silver-109.

120
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,719
There's an easy way to write all this out,
of course, to keep your information straight.

121
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,249
The chemical symbol, with the atomic number
or number of protons here,

122
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:52,629
the mass number, or number of protons and
neutrons here,

123
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:57,940
and the charge out here, which tells you by simple addition or subtraction how many electrons there are.

124
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,720
Finally, before we conclude this first episode
of Crash Course Chemistry,

125
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,279
and thus, our discussion of the atomic nucleus,
a note on the pronunciation of "nucleus".

126
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,220
You are welcome to say "nuculus", it is an
accepted pronunciation of that word,

127
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,220
but if you can find it in you, it's probably best to switch over to "nucleus", which is, after all, how it's spelled.

128
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,560
And that is all for today's episode of Crash Course Chemistry, if you were paying attention, you now know:

129
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,019
More about atoms than anyone did in 1900,

130
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,079
like that they were finally confirmed when
Einstein mathematically defined Brownian motion;

131
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,560
That elements are chemically pure substances,

132
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:38,139
and the type of element an atom is is defined by how many protons it has in its nucleus, or its atomic number;

133
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:41,519
That neutrons stabilize nuclei for their proton
friends;

134
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,579
That different isotopes of the same element are the reason relative atomic masses are never whole numbers;

135
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,820
and you know that nuclei are the uninteresting,
boring bits of the atom,

136
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,660
and the electrons are where all the interesting
chemical-ly stuff happens.

137
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:57,879
