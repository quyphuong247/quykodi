1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,870
It falls from the sky, makes up about 60%
of our bodies,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,960
and just about every chemical process related to life takes place with it, or in it: dihydrogen monoxide.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,380
Without it, none of the chemical reactions
that keep you alive would happen.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,620
None of the reactions that sustain any life
form on earth would happen.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,800
Not even the majority of inorganic chemical reactions that shaped the surface of the earth would happen.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,380
Water is the key to nearly everything.

7
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:30,500
And one of the reasons it's the key, is because
it's really good at dissolving stuff.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,539
We need it so bad, that we dump over 180 gallons
of it into our bodies every year,

9
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:41,908
and we do that to maintain an aqueous or water
based solution inside our cells,

10
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:46,289
because aqueous environments are pretty much
the best for cool chemistry.

11
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,649
Each and every one of us uses water for all
kinds of chemistry every single day.

12
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:59,149
Our body chemistry, our food chemistry and yes, our laundry chemistry, all take place in water. Ew.

13
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:08,719
[Theme Music]

14
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,579
This used to be a white sock. It is now a little bit of gray sock, and in places a little bit of a yellow sock.

15
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,298
But anyway, I want it to be white again, and
to do that I'm gonna need some chemistry.

16
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,899
To whiten whites, you might use a solution
of sodium hypo-chlorate, better known as bleach.

17
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,829
What makes bleach so good at it's job is that
it's a really strong oxidizer,

18
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:32,379
meaning that the oxygen atom is really good at pulling electrons away from other compounds, making them break apart.

19
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:36,140
This is really handy for getting rid of stains
but as you can tell by the formula,

20
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,659
sodium hypo-chlorate also contains chlorine, which happens to be really good at killing things.

21
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:43,429
That's why we use it in swimming pools and
as a disinfectant.

22
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:50,240
But there are lots of other good oxidizing agents, and one that doesn't contain chlorine is hydrogen peroxide.

23
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,819
And it can be used as a bleach too, but it's only components are hydrogen and oxygen, just like water.

24
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,139
We'll talk about oxidation and other kinds
of reactions in a couple weeks,

25
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,280
but before we get to that you have to understand
solutions,

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,349
and before we do that I'm just gonna get rid
of the laundry because it's kinda stinky.

27
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:10,280
This bottle of hydrogen peroxide contains
a solution and not just the solution to my

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,909
problem of stained laundry.

29
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:17,689
By solution, I mean a solution of liquid with
another substance dissolved in it.

30
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:23,500
Here water is the liquid, or solvent, and hydrogen peroxide is the solute, or dissolved material.

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,159
And water is an amazing solvent, possibly,
arguably, the best solvent on earth.

32
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,719
Why? A lot of reasons. There's a lot of it on the surface of the earth, that helps. Just abundance is good.

33
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,659
It's liquid at a very wide range of temperatures and being liquid is what you need to be able to be a solvent.

34
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,120
But also because it's polar; it's a very polar
molecule

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,819
Remember how I said that oxygen is very good
at pulling electrons toward it?

36
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,919
Well, oxygen atoms are more electronegative
than hydrogen.

37
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,179
The oxygen atom pulls harder on the molecule's
electrons than the hydrogen does.

38
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,760
As a result, the electrons in a water molecule tend to spend most of their time near the oxygen,

39
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,679
giving the oxygen end a partial negative charge,
and the hydrogens, a somewhat positive charge.

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,280
This polarity makes water extremely effective at dissolving things, especially other polar things.

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,520
The sugar we mixed into our tea last week,
for example, was polar.

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,490
When you mix a polar solid, like sugar, into
a polar liquid, like water,

43
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,450
the molecules of the water surround the sugar
molecules

44
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,780
The negative side of the water molecules is attracted to the positive side of the sugar molecule and vice versa.

45
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,360
In interacting with the sugar molecules, the
water inserts itself between all of the individual

46
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,259
molecules of the sugar that were once clumped
together in the sugar crystals.

47
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:41,599
A liter of water can dissolve as much as 1800
grams of sucrose.

48
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,460
Water based solutions, earlier I called them
aqueous solutions.

49
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,099
And I'm calling it an aqueous solution again so that you remember it's called an aqueoussolution. Aqueous.

50
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,680
You can create all sorts of aqueous solutions
using salts or minerals, even acids.

51
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,000
Ethanol, which composes 95% of this grain alcohol, is polar. So it dissolves easily in water.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,819
But water does not dissolve non-ionic, nonpolar
substances.

53
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:11,719
Oil, for instance, doesn't have any polarity.
So it has no interest in interacting with water.

54
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,560
So when you mix them, they separate.

55
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:16,779
Water's polarity also gives it lots of other
super useful properties.

56
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,899
For example, water can decrease the attraction
between ions of different charges.

57
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,899
We call this it's dielectric property.

58
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,639
Take table salt, for example.

59
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:30,549
It's made of positively charged sodium ions
and negatively charged chlorine ions.

60
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,430
When it's mixed with water, the water dissolves
the salt into it's component ions.

61
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,670
The water molecules then surround the individual ions and shield them from each other's electric charges.

62
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,120
These ions in water are called electrolytes;
literally, loosened electricity,

63
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,439
because separating through dissolution frees them to act independently and carry their electrical charge around.

64
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,579
You've probably heard about electrolytes in
biology class,

65
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:59,560
but you've definitely heard about electrolytes
in Gatorade commercials.

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,280
Your body needs electrolytes to carry electrical
signals that help your muscles twitch,

67
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,730
and your brain cells fire, and get all the
business of living done.

68
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,790
In addition to helping you live, electrolytes
are one of the most important ways chemists

69
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,069
have of classifying solutions.

70
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:18,509
Pure water, on it's own, does not conduct
electricity, which seems a little weird to us --

71
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:22,240
the whole hairdryer in the bathtub thing still
being a terrible idea.

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,300
But if you put a bit of salt or any other ionic solid in the water, they dissolve into those component electrolytes.

73
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,020
It's the electrolytes that are conducting
the electricity.

74
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:37,639
It's not what you might expect, but we have Swedish physicist Svante Arrhenius to thank for figuring this out.

75
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,719
While doing his doctoral research in the 1880s,
he first developed the idea that a solution's

76
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,780
electrical conductivity could be linked to
the concentration of ions in the solution.

77
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,609
It was one of his predecessors, British super-genius
Michael Faraday,

78
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,980
who discovered that substances dissolved in
water conduct electric currents.

79
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:01,879
Faraday was terrible at naming stuff, so he wrote to a guy who was known for coining terms, William Whewell.

80
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,519
You may have heard of his most famous creation,
the word "scientist."

81
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,459
Whewell wrote back to Faraday saying,

82
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,450
"I would propose for the two elements resulting
from electrolysis the terms 'anion' and 'cation.'

83
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,180
And for the two together, you might use the
term 'ions.'"

84
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,379
And there's something interesting here, and
I didn't pick up on it at first, but Whewell said,

85
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,959
"The things resulting from electrolysis."

86
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,159
Faraday, thought that the electric current
is what produced the ions.

87
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,300
What Arrhenius discovered, was that water
simply dissolves certain substances, like salts,

88
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,759
into their constituent ions, which themselves
carry the charge.

89
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,469
And since electrolytes carry electric charge,
the higher the concentration of electrolytes

90
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,639
in a solution the higher it's electrical conductivity.

91
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,610
Arrhenius found that you can even reverse
engineer your study of a solution

92
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,970
and by measuring it's electrical conductivity,
figure out how concentrated it is.

93
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,840
Despite the importance of his work, Arrhenius'
chemistry professors didn't think much of it

94
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:57,079
and he got a mediocre grade, which is why
it must have been particularly sweet

95
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,539
when he won the Nobel prize in 1903 for that
very same research.

96
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,120
Today, we know a little bit more about how
electrolytes work,

97
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,019
and we've learned that the relationship between their concentration and their conductivity is not always straightforward,

98
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,139
because not all electrolytes dissolve equally
well in water.

99
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,430
A strong electrolyte, for example, is one
that dissociates, or breaks apart completely

100
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,970
when dissolved in water and conducts electricity
very well.

101
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,180
Salts do this. So do strong acids like hydrochloric,
and sulfuric, and nitric acid.

102
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,480
As well as strong bases, like sodium and potassium
hydroxide.

103
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,240
Weak electrolytes only dissociate partially when dissolved in water, so they're only somewhat conductive.

104
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,660
Most of the solute's molecules stay stuck
together, remaining neutral.

105
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,980
Acetic acid, the active ingredient in vinegar,
and ammonium hydroxide are examples of this.

106
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,100
And of course, some things dissolve in water
but don't conduct electricity at all,

107
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,360
because they don't dissociate into ions.

108
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,740
Alcohol and sugar, for example, are nonelectrolytes.

109
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,560
Now, what does any of this have to do with
my laundry?

110
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,829
Well, hydrogen peroxide is a polar molecule
so it dissolves really well in water.

111
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,990
But it's a very weak electrolyte.

112
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,720
When it dissolves, it tends to dissociate into a water molecule and a lone oxygen ion.

113
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,900
Since the dissolved peroxide creates even more water, the concentration of ions is quite low.

114
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,020
But that lone oxygen ion is not happy by itself.

115
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:22,289
It goes on an oxidizing rampage, swiping electrons
from anything it can find.

116
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,340
It's especially good at tearing up the tricky double bonds that tend to give laundry stains their color.

117
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,239
When that rampaging ion destroys the double
bond, the stain disappears.

118
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,668
We're used to thinking of hydrogen peroxide
as a fairly mild chemical,

119
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,899
but that's because the over the counter stuff
is pretty dilute.

120
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:41,168
Too much peroxide could actually dissolve
my clothes,

121
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:46,659
and some of my favorite shirts are in here, so we need to dilute this stuff to make the solution the right strength.

122
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,778
And as you might expect, if you joined me
on my recent foray into stoichiometry,

123
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:55,259
when chemists think about the strength of
a solution, they think about moles.

124
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,220
So before we can dilute this formula,

125
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,300
first we have to figure out how many moles of solute, of hydrogen peroxide, we're working with here.

126
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:08,519
You'll remember, I hope, that one mole of
a compound equals 6.022 x 1023 molecules.

127
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,360
That is a big number.

128
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,600
So to make it easier on ourselves, we usually figure out how much a mole of a particular substance weighs.

129
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,100
In our case, a mole of hydrogen peroxide weighs
34.014 grams.

130
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,139
The number of moles of solute that are in
a solution is known as it's molar concentration,

131
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:28,139
that's also known as a solution's molarity.

132
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,120
As a rule, molarity equals the number of moles
of solute divided by liters of solution.

133
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,740
So a one molar solution, contains one mole
of solute per one liter of solution.

134
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,039
Do not confuse this with another way of measuring
concentrations based on mass,

135
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,839
instead of based on volume.

136
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,980
This is known as molality and it's expressed
as the number of moles of a solute in a kilogram

137
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,350
of a solution, rather than in a liter.

138
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,329
Molality refers to moles per unit mass and
molarity refers to moles per unit volume.

139
00:09:56,328 --> 00:10:00,958
Sorry, scientists are bad at naming things sometimes. You just have to remember this stuff.

140
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,820
So now that we know what molarity is, let's figure out the molarity of this hydrogen peroxide solution.

141
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,600
The label on the bottle says a 3% solution,
weight per volume.

142
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,259
Technically that's terrible chemistry because it's expressing a percentage in terms of two different sorts of units,

143
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:22,919
but it does let us know how much solute went into the solution: 30 grams of H2O2 per one liter of water.

144
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:29,278
I mean, just to be clear, it makes no sense
to have a percentage with two different units

145
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,818
and maybe these folks need to watch some Crash
Course Chemistry.

146
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:36,299
So to calculate the molarity of this solution
we first need to figure out how many moles

147
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,000
of hydrogen peroxide are in 30 grams of hydrogen
peroxide.

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,419
If we divide the 30 grams in the solution
by it's molar mass of 34.014 grams per mole,

149
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:50,698
we find that we have 0.88 moles of hydrogen
peroxide per liter of solution.

150
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:57,229
Or, so you get used to the lingo, a 0.88 molar
solution of H2O2 in this little brown bottle.

151
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,159
Now that we know the molarity of the original formula we can start thinking about how to dilute it.

152
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,600
To dilute a solution you either have to add
more solvent or reduce the amount of solute.

153
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,188
Since I'm already starting with a solution,
I need to add even more solvent, water,

154
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:15,269
probably in this tub right here, so let's
just get that out of there.

155
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:18,269
And there's a handy chemical rule for understanding
dilutions:

156
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:23,269
the moles of solute before dilution is equal
to the moles of solute after dilution.

157
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,828
Think about it, the total amount of hydrogen
peroxide is going to stay the same,

158
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:28,708
no matter how much water it's diluted with.

159
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:34,779
But as you dilute a solution, it's volume grows, the moles stay the same, and it's molarity thus shrinks.

160
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:40,600
To calculate precisely how much one affects the other, we use a standard, and super simple, dilution equation.

161
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,100
Here M1 & V1 are the molarity and volume of the original concentration, sometimes called the stock solution.

162
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,439
In this case, it's what's in the bottle.

163
00:11:49,438 --> 00:11:53,188
M2 and V2 are the molarity and volume of the
dilute solution.

164
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:59,198
So in our case, M1 equals 0.88, that's the molarity of the hydrogen peroxide solutionthat we've got.

165
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,259
And to bleach the stains out of laundry we need a 0.1 molar solution, that's M2, the molarity we want to get to.

166
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:11,698
And the tub that I'll be soaking my whites
in, holds 38 liters of liquid, so that's our V2.

167
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:15,889
All that's missing is the volume of the peroxide
solution that we must add to 38 liters of

168
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,239
water to get to our target molarity.

169
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:24,429
Do the math and you get V2 equalling 0.24
liters of hydrogen peroxide or 250 milliliters.

170
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:32,948
And we just fill this right on up here, hopefully
we have enough. Annnddd, that's what we need.

171
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:35,439
And while I wait a few hours for the peroxide
to do it's work,

172
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,720
I'm going to enjoy another of my favorite
aqueous solutions: tea.

173
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,160
Today here at Crash Course Chemistry we learned about some of the properties of water that make it so special:

174
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,729
it's polarity and it's dielectric property.

175
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,239
We learned how electrolytes can be used to
classify solutions.

176
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,100
And we discovered how to calculate a solution's molarity, as well as how to dilute a solution using the dilution equation.

177
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,879
