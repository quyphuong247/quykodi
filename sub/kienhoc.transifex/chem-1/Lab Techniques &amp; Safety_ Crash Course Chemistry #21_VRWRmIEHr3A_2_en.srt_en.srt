1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,330
Some of the best moments of my life have happened
in labs. Also some of the worst.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,269
Like the time that I took a week to prepare
a sample for NMR analysis,

3
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:13,498
and then a classmate washed out the vials
while I was sleeping for the first time in 3 days.

4
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:16,740
Because he "couldn't find anything else" to
use for his experiment.

5
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,019
Interestingly, that resulted in my personal
most significant laboratory injury.

6
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:26,259
We all have one; I cut my hand while punching
a paper towel dispenser in frustration.

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,720
No one ever brought it up again.

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,559
Today, we're going to talk about how to avoid
injury in the lab,

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,659
and some good techniques for using laboratory
equipment correctly.

10
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,199
First two lessons already learned:

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,580
never wash out a vial you aren't familiar
with and don't punch paper towel dispensers.

12
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:50,839
[Theme Music]

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,079
Let's start with some very basic safety stuff;
your hair.

14
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,759
If your hair is long, it shall always be up
in the lab.

15
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,129
If it is not, it will catch on fire.
I've seen it happen.

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,370
It can also knock stuff over, and occlude
your vision, and droop into your flasks.

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,880
Same thing goes for anything that might hang
off your body in the lab.

18
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,959
Droopy clothing, especially sleeves, are a
total disaster.

19
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,199
Clothes should cover your body as much as
possible; I like to go long-sleeve even.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,100
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever wear sandals
in a lab.

21
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:24,089
Long pants, closed-toed shoes, and socks;
clothing that covers your entire torso. Always.

22
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,680
I'm sure you look hunky in your muscle shirts,

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,960
and I have nothing against exposed midriffs
as a principle, but not in the lab.

24
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,839
Of course your eyes are your most vulnerable
organ.

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,390
Always wear eye protection, and no, just glasses
do not count.

26
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,759
And if you feel like your eyes are starting
to tingle, or hurt,

27
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,650
or even if you don't know how something might
have gotten in there, use the eye wash.

28
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,920
Because it never hurts to be careful, and,
you know, we've all wondered what it feels like.

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,670
I've actually never done this, so this will
be a new experience for me. Aaagh.

30
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:05,159
Gah! It does not feel particularly pleasant,
but it's better than having your eyes burned out.

31
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,509
Do not eat or drink in the lab.

32
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,250
Despite our best efforts, stuff does sometimes
get where we don't want it to be,

33
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,449
and if it gets in your food, or you accidentally
pick up the wrong cup,

34
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,250
that's just a really embarrassing story for
your obituary.

35
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,139
Also I would generally suggest avoiding working
alone in a lab,

36
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,479
especially if you're working with any machinery
or hazardous substances.

37
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,119
But it will be up to you and your advisers
to make that decision when the time comes.

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,450
You may have seen this little symbol before,
here.

39
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:33,039
It's the Hazardous Material or HazMat diamond,
and it's got some useful information in it.

40
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:40,179
Each little box is rated 0 to 4. Zero being "no big deal," and four being HOLY MONKEY BE CAREFUL.

41
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,230
Blue is for health, the red is for flammability,
and yellow is for chemical reactivity.

42
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:48,878
A 4 in health means certain kinds of exposure
will kill you.

43
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,318
A 4 in fire is both very flammable and gaseous, so impossible to control outside of a closed container.

44
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,119
And a 4 in reactivity means that it is capable
of exploding at room temperature.

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,340
The little area underneath is for any extra
information like if it's radioactive,

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,140
or reacts violently with water or something.

47
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,339
If you ever need to know more about a chemical
and what it might do to you or to the world,

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,250
there is the good 'ole MSDS, the material
safety data sheet.

49
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,039
Every chemical has one, and it'll tell you
all the terrible things that it might do to you.

50
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,549
If you ever need to find one really fast,
you don't need to go to the cabinet anymore;

51
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,820
you can just Google 'MSDS HCl' or whatever chemical you think is in the process of killing your friend.

52
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,340
There will be information on how best to treat
the person who got exposed.

53
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:32,588
Of course, you should have always read the
MSDS before you even touch a chemical.

54
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:37,560
Also, you should probably assume that every
liquid in a lab that is not water is flammable.

55
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,628
This baby here is a fume hood.

56
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:44,828
It sucks all the air in there out, so you don't have to breathe whatever is going on in there.

57
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,950
It's also why it's impossible to keep chemistry
labs at the proper temperature,

58
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:52,238
because the A/C units and heating units are
constantly pumping in controlled air,

59
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,500
and these are constantly sucking it out.

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,620
So if you're doing some chemistry that might
contain some noxious fumes, that goes on in here.

61
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:01,318
And if you want it to work properly, first
you gotta turn it in.

62
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:04,669
That's the vent and that's the blower.
Now it is sucking air.

63
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:08,780
The second thing you want to do is make sure
the sash is at the right level.

64
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,239
This has a little thing that tells you where
the sash is supposed to go.

65
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,370
If you go above that, on this model,
[machine buzzes] it'll buzz at you.

66
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,970
If the sash is higher than that, it's not
gonna properly vent all the stuff to the outside;

67
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,319
some of it might get into your face and that
would be bad.

68
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,939
As a side note here, if something happens
to you in the lab and if you don't know whether it was serious or minor;

69
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:28,900
you're not sure, just tell your instructor.

70
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:34,838
I once inhaled a bit of nitric oxide which, though initially extremely unpleasant, seemed to subside after a while.

71
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:41,939
But it can have longer term effects: headache, nausea, disorientation, dizziness, pulmonary edema, death.

72
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,019
So I'm glad I fessed up, so that I could get
taken care of.

73
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:49,538
Speaking of, if you want to know what something
smells like, do not stick your face in it.

74
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:51,568
Waft, waft it toward your face.

75
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,550
Also never test something by tasting it, obviously.
And never pipette by mouth.

76
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,908
I hear people say that and like who would,

77
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:02,199
but then I just found out that Heiko, the
chemistry consultant for Crash Course,

78
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,860
has twice gotten HCl in his mouth by-from pipetting by mouth, which I will never forgive you for.

79
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,740
That is what these things are for.

80
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:13,800
You put that on the end there, and then you
go one; you draw the liquid up with this thing.

81
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,819
That's what that's for! Also, these days, most pipetting is done by these guys, which are way cooler anyway.

82
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,500
Pipetting is one way to move a substance from one container to another, and it's a pretty good one.

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,600
But if you want to pour, you can pour, but
let me just give you a tip: commit.

84
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,620
We tend to get all nervous when pouring stuff in the chemistry lab and go all slow with it, but that's terrible;

85
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,340
you won't overcome the surface tension and it'll dribble down the side of the container, so just commit!

86
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,838
At the beginning and at the end.
Destroy that surface tension!

87
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:40,999
OK, back to safety.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,740
The most common lab injuries are cuts and
punctures,

89
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,519
and the most common source of those is cleaning up broken glass, which you should not do with your hands,

90
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,240
but with a broom and a dustpan, and then deposit
the results into a bin specifically for sharp stuff.

91
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:59,020
But the worst thing, and it has happened so
many times and it's so terrible,

92
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,308
is forcing a glass rod, or thermometer, or
a piece of tubing through a stopper

93
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:08,179
and then it breaks and then right into and
through your hand.

94
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:12,668
And it's -- you're in the hospital and you're
in pain for the rest of your life, probably.

95
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:15,178
So when you're doing this, and it is sometimes
necessary,

96
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:20,338
you can use a bit of water or lubricant or some kind of Vaseline to make it easier to go through,

97
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,718
and then you hold it close and make sure your
hand is not on the other side.

98
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:30,990
So very close to make it go through like that;
not like this, 'cause that's...no.

99
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,379
When you're done with an experiment, do not
just dump the results into the sink,

100
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:38,999
unless this has been explicitly approved by
the person in charge of chemical safety.

101
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:44,240
For some chemicals, like common acids or bases,
dilution is the solution to pollution.

102
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,399
When they get diluted, all that's left is
common ions like chloride ions from HCl or

103
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,718
sodium ions from sodium hydroxide,

104
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:54,649
in addition to some protons or hydroxide ions
that are neutralized by buffer ions that are

105
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,559
present in your sewage system anyway.

106
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:59,270
Bottom line is they can be flushed with lots
of water.

107
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:01,848
For other chemicals, flushing is not a good
idea.

108
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:04,598
It probably won't hurt you, but it might hurt
the environment.

109
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:09,490
Do put the products into an appropriate waste
container, but not just any waste container.

110
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,819
Different solvents and reagents have to be
disposed of differently,

111
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:14,899
and if you dump some stuff into the wrong
container,

112
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:20,079
it can totally end up reacting with the other things that have been dumped in there. Not good.

113
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,479
Rule of thumb: always know the right way to dispose of something before you even start to use it.

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,599
This is an apron.

115
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:27,618
It protects you and your clothes just a bit
extra

116
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,830
in case you're working with something hazardous
like concentrated acids.

117
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:35,079
Aprons are nice because they're easy to get
off if you spill something on them,

118
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,968
while if you're wearing pants, you might hesitate
a bit too long before you ditch 'em.

119
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:44,269
Which reminds me: if you spill more than just
a bit of anything super bad on your pants,

120
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:48,028
modesty goes out the window; just take them
off.

121
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:51,528
Also, while you're taking them off, you might
want to run over to this guy here.

122
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:55,610
His job is to dump a gigantic amount of water
on you really fast.

123
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,770
Now usually you don't get to see these things
in action unless there is an actual emergency,

124
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:04,848
but to thank you for sticking with us through this somewhat disjointed lecture on safety in the lab...

125
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:15,079
I'm gonna take this off.
That's a lot of water! Aah!

126
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,379
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

127
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,908
If you were listening, you learned what to
wear in the lab, how to dispose of chemicals,

128
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:25,800
how to avoid the most common accidents in
the laboratory,

129
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,209
how to pour properly,
what the HazMat diamond is,

130
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,949
what an MSDS is,
and how to use a fume hood.

131
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,389
This episode was written by me, our editor
is Blake de Pastino.

132
