1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,639
As I said before chemistry is, like many aspects
of your own life, all about a search for stability.

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,039
Last week we talked about radioactive decay

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,000
and how atomic nuclei get rid of various particles
in order to become more stable.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
But what is this illusive stability that all
things seem to be striving for exactly?

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,820
In nuclear chemistry it simply has to do with
keeping the nucleus together.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,199
If the nucleus is going to break apart, then that's not going to be something that lasts very long.

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,460
Stability really, is kind of just a way of
saying, it can exist.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,200
And the amount of energy, that holds each
proton or neutron in an atom's nucleus,

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,060
is the same amount that's released when it's
removed.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,260
This is known as binding energy and it's one
of the fundamental principles of nuclear chemistry.

11
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,699
It's actually what we mean when we talk about
nuclear energy.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,509
Now I'm not going to lie to you, nuclear chemistry
is terribly complicated,

13
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:51,979
but we have a way of understanding it that, while not exactly simple, is one I'm sure you've heard of.

14
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:56,559
The binding energy of an atom is calculated
with the formula E = mc2.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,679
Probably the most famous equation in the world,

16
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,780
and since it was first hit upon by a young patent clerk in 1905 it has become synonymous with scientific genius.

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,599
Part of why it's so famous, I like to think, is because the logic behind it is so elegantly simple,

18
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,280
and yet totally counter intuitive, but it's
probably also famous because it's important.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,640
It explains one of the most powerful sources
of energy known to humanity.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:28,299
[Theme Music]

21
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:32,478
E = mc2 is formally known as the mass-energy
equivalence formula

22
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,298
and it states that mass is interchangeable
with energy.

23
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,040
OK, there is a lot there, in what I just said.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,770
To tease it apart consider the nucleus of
an atom of oxygen: 8 protons and 8 neutrons.

25
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:46,530
Collectively, by the way, these particles
are known as nucleons.

26
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,140
If you were to add up all the individual masses
of all 16 nucleons separately

27
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,090
and then compare that to the total mass of
an actual oxygen nucleus,

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,689
you'd find that there's a difference between
the two.

29
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:00,810
Specifically the mass of the nucleus,
exactly 15.99 atomic mass units,

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,189
is lower than the mass of its individual nucleons
put together, in this case 16.13 amu's.

31
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,550
That mass went somewhere.

32
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,000
That "missing mass" in the nucleus, known as its mass defect, is actually present in the form of energy.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,799
It's the energy that holds the nucleons together,

34
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:23,109
so for example the mass defect for an oxygen
atom is negative 2.269 x 10^-28 kilograms.

35
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:30,569
To find out how much binding energy that missing mass amounts to, you can use it as the 'm' in Einstein's formula.

36
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:34,780
This ingenious little equation relates mass
and energy by a simple proportionality constant,

37
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:39,929
and thanks to Einstein we know that constant
is the square of the speed of light, or c2.

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,280
Solve for 'E' and you find that the binding energy in that oxygen nucleus is 2.04 x 10^-11 joules,

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,560
with the negative sign indicating that the
energy is being released.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,439
Now of course 2.04 x 10^-11 is a very small
number.

41
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:57,510
That might surprise you, but hold the phone,
that is just for one single nucleus.

42
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:02,859
If we multiply that by Avogadro's number to find the energy change for a whole mole of oxygen nuclei,

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:10,659
a mere 16 grams of oxygen, we get an amazing
1.23 x 10^13 joules of energy.

44
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:19,019
To produce that energy with coal, you would have to burn 420,000 kilograms, 420 metric tons of coal.

45
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,219
That energy is what we mean when we talk about
nuclear energy,

46
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:26,188
the binding energy that's released when a
nucleon is removed from its nucleus.

47
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:30,528
Now, to dislodge one of those nucleons and
unleash that energy there are two general

48
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:33,919
types of nuclear reactions:
fission and fusion.

49
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:37,868
Fission occurs when a large nucleus splits
into two lighter ones.

50
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:42,558
Fusion is the opposite when two light nuclei
join together to form a heavier one.

51
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:45,900
In both cases the products of the reactions
are more stable than the starting materials,

52
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,209
and this is, as always,
what drives the reaction.

53
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,878
This is a graph of the binding energies of
various elements compared to their mass numbers.

54
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:58,099
Elements with very high binding energies such as iron-56 are very stable and rarely undergo nuclear reactions.

55
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,620
But elements with lower binding energies can
react much more readily.

56
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,939
If the nucleus is heavier than iron-56 it will tend to break into two or more smaller nuclei; a fission reaction.

57
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:12,219
If it's lighter than iron-56 it will more
likely participate in a fusion reaction,

58
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,620
joining two nuclei together to form a heavier
one.

59
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,199
But the most important thing to notice here
is that

60
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,658
with both fission and fusion stability increases
as a result of the reaction.

61
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:22,490
Fission is the type of reaction that we use
more often

62
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,970
because it's the one that we're better at
initiating and controlling, at least so far.

63
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,260
And whether it's used in power plants or bombs,
the most common fuel for fission is uranium-235.

64
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,219
There are several ways that it can react,

65
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,840
but the reaction is almost always triggered by hitting uranium with neutrons from another source.

66
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,799
When that happens the uranium splits into
smaller atoms.

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
One such reaction produces krypton-92, yes
krypton is a real thing,

68
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,359
along with barium-141, three free neutrons
and lots of energy.

69
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,370
This energy is released mainly as the kinetic
energy of the escaping particles,

70
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,288
which is immediately transferred to the surroundings
as heat.

71
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:59,430
Some energy is also released in the form of
electro-magnetic radiation such as

72
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,910
visible light, X-rays,
and gamma radiation.

73
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,420
Nuclear power plants use the energy released
by these reactions to convert water to steam,

74
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,300
which then is passed through turbines spinning
a generator, powering cities and stuff.

75
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,860
Because of the enormous amounts of energy
these reactions can release,

76
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,189
nuclear power plants can potentially produce
lots of electricity,

77
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,930
but there's also, I think you may have heard,
some serious draw backs.

78
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,930
For one thing, as you know, atoms rarely exist
in isolation.

79
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,120
We write the equation of a fission reaction
as it fits just one atom,

80
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,370
but in reality that one atom is surrounded
by many, many more.

81
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,480
And if one little neutron can trigger the reaction and that reaction liberates three more neutrons,

82
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,478
well I think you can see where this is going.

83
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,269
If the reaction isn't controlled each reaction
trigger three more,

84
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:44,038
and every reaction releases the same amount
of energy, which adds up fast.

85
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,110
This is pretty much the definition of a chain
reaction

86
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,169
and it is the basis of the remarkable power
of the nuclear weapon.

87
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,250
The same type of reaction occurs in nuclear
power plants,

88
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,288
but those reactions are controlled in several
ways to keep them from getting out of hand.

89
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:01,528
The fact is these chain reactions have the potential to produce far more heat than the plant can use,

90
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:06,219
so much more that the temperature can easily rise to dangerous levels, enough to melt the uranium.

91
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:08,120
This is the meltdown that you hear about

92
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,340
and most reactor cores are immersed in water to disperse the heat and prevent this from happening.

93
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,939
But that, that's not enough on its own to
control this thing.

94
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,680
If the chain reaction is allowed to run freely,

95
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:19,999
no amount of water can remove the heat fast
enough to prevent a meltdown.

96
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,050
A real way we control nuclear reactions is
with control rods.

97
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,310
They're made of materials that readily absorb
neutrons

98
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,560
and they're inserted between the fuel rods of uranium to slow the neutrons down and therefore slow the reaction.

99
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,220
They can be put in more to slow the reaction more, and lifted out more if you need more heat.

100
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,598
Now the other sticky wicket of fission reactions
is the stuff that's left behind.

101
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:42,498
These reactions not only produce products
that are still radioactive,

102
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:45,780
they produce tons of them, lots of different
troublesome kinds.

103
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,378
Like we saw last week, uranium undergoes many
different types of nuclear decay,

104
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,599
so not only does each uranium atom produce
isotopes of krypton and bromine,

105
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:56,019
but that process also produces many other
isotopes of other elements.

106
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:58,930
And as these various nuclei break down they
release more neutrons

107
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,499
and more unstable products and the process
continues for a long time.

108
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,550
All of these reactions eventually yield stable
products

109
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,550
but they have half-lives ranging from a few
years to tens of millions of years.

110
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,968
The products with shorter half-lives stabilize
pretty quickly

111
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:16,259
but they release particles and energy like
crazy during that time so they're extra dangerous.

112
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,840
The ones with longer half-lives decay more
slowly, release less energy

113
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,968
but that means it takes a very, very long
time for them to stabilize.

114
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:27,658
So long in fact, that for human purposes,
it may as well be forever.

115
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,211
That means they'll always be an issue in our
environment which is why we're always looking

116
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,720
for ways to store them,
and keep them out of our way.

117
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,860
Fusion reactions, as you'd expect, are very
different from fission.

118
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,060
For one thing, the energy released in many fusion reactions dwarfs even the huge amount released by fission.

119
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,660
You might be familiar, for example, with the
wonderful work done by our sun.

120
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:49,799
The reactions that power the sun are like
most fusion reactions,

121
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,740
in that they involve very small nuclei like
isotopes of hydrogen and helium.

122
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,840
This reaction begins when two atoms of hydrogen,

123
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,508
accelerated by the sun's fantastically high
temperatures and contained by its high pressures,

124
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:04,580
join to form an atom of deuterium,
an isotope of hydrogen.

125
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:08,639
This fusion of particles releases a positron
and some heat energy in the process.

126
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,689
Then another atom of hydrogen is joined to
the deuterium to form helium-3.

127
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:16,240
This step also releases a lot of energy in
the form of gamma radiation.

128
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,400
When two atoms of helium-3 are available they
join together to form an atom of helium-4,

129
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,379
as well as two atoms of regular hydrogen which then can be used to begin the process all over again.

130
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:32,320
This final step also, as you might imagine, releases a large amount of energy in the form of mostly gamma radiation.

131
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:36,879
So this is a chain reaction too, but it's
not a self-perpetuating one like we saw before.

132
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,168
This reaction requires a total input of 6
atoms of hydrogen but it only produces two,

133
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:44,309
in the end the remaining mass being released
in the form of helium.

134
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:46,169
For this reason more fuel is always needed,

135
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:51,708
which is why our sun is going to run out of
hydrogen in about 5 and a half billion years.

136
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,939
We can produce fusion reactions here on Earth
too,

137
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,750
but they're not very useful for us because
we haven't figured out how to control them.

138
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,620
They're super useful if you just want to blow
up a big city though,

139
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,649
just to be clear, depending on your definition
of use.

140
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,549
One reason is, as you can see on the mass-energy
graph,

141
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:12,990
light nuclei that fuse together undergo a much larger energy change than heavy nuclei that break apart.

142
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,879
That means their reactions release far more
energy than fission reactions do,

143
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,379
so much more that it's nearly impossible to
contain and therefore use.

144
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,439
Also, because fusion involves joining nuclei,

145
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,940
the reaction has to overcome the really strong repulsion that naturally exists between their positive charges.

146
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,500
For this reason, fusion reactions can only occur when particles collide at very high speeds,

147
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,860
or under very high pressures.

148
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,850
At these mind-blowing speeds, the kinetic
energy of the particles produces insane temperatures,

149
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,480
like in the 100 million kelvin range,

150
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,579
at which point, the material being accelerated
actually exists in the form of plasma.

151
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,080
So not only are those speeds really hard to reach but material at that temperature, how do you control that?

152
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,980
Which is why we can't use fusion for things like generating electricity which would be super nice.

153
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,340
We've only found applications for it when we don't need to control it at all like in nuclear weapons.

154
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,670
So as you can tell, there is plenty of room
for new ideas in nuclear chemistry.

155
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:09,759
Fusion would be really great because it would
produce a lot of energy

156
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,949
and you'd just get helium out of the process
and helium is awesome!

157
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:17,069
How can we use radioactive materials more
efficiently?

158
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,509
Is there a way to achieve the speeds and manage
temperatures that come with fusion?

159
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:25,009
And how can we do this stuff without blowing
our faces off?

160
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:27,089
You've already taken the first step by learning
the basics.

161
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:29,290
It's up to you how far you want to go from
here.

162
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:35,009
Maybe you'll write the next totally crazy ingenious and counter intuitive equation that takes us to the next level.

163
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,209
For now though, thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

164
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:42,208
If you paid attention, you learned how Einstein's
famous formula helps us calculate

165
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,239
the binding energy of a nucleus from its mass
defect.

166
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,610
You also learned the difference between fission
and fusion.

167
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,240
You saw an example of each one.

168
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,759
and you learned about their applications in
the real world.

169
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:56,819
