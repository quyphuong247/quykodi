1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
How do you picture an atom in your mind – like
this, or like this, or maybe one of these?

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,199
If you understand enough about atoms to visualize
any of those things,

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,248
then you know more about atomic theory than
scientists did just 100 years ago.

4
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:15,729
And, like, WAY more than they thought they
knew 2500 years ago.

5
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:19,280
That's when Greek philosopher Leucippus and
his pupil Democritus

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,480
first came up with the idea that matter is
composed of tiny particles.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,240
No one knows how they developed this concept, but they didn't think the particles were particularly special –

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,920
they just thought that if you cut something
in half enough times,

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,599
eventually you'll reach a particle that can't
be cut anymore.

10
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:37,218
They gave these particles the name "atomos,"
which means uncuttable or indivisible.

11
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,179
So basically, they thought that iron was made
up of iron particles

12
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:43,600
and clay was made up of clay particles and
cheese was made up of cheese particles.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,300
And they attributed properties of each substance
to the forms of the atoms.

14
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:50,939
So, they thought that iron atoms were hard
and stuck together with hooks,

15
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,500
clay atoms were softer and attached by ball
and socket joints that made them flexible,

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,509
and cheese atoms were squishy and delicious.

17
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:01,509
Now this makes a certain amount of sense if you don't happen to have access to electron microscopes

18
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:05,308
or cathode-ray tubes or the work of generations
of previous scientists.

19
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,539
Because the fact is atomic theory as we know
it today is the product of hundreds,

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,840
if not thousands,
of different insights.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,159
Some models, like that of Leucippus, were
just blind guesses.

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,320
As time went on, many more were the result
of rigorous experimentation.

23
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,259
But, as has been the case in all science, each scientist built on what had been learned before.

24
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,700
We've been talking a lot about the fine details
of chemistry in recent weeks,

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,700
and we're gonna keep doing that as we move on to nuclear chemistry and then to the basics of organic chemistry,

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,500
but we do, I wanted to set aside some time to explain how we know what we know about the atom today,

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,599
and how we know that we're not quite done
figuring it out.

28
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:50,979
[Theme Music]

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,180
Now you might think that once Leucippus and Democritus came up with the general idea of atoms,

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,920
it'd be pretty easy for someone else to take
that little, indivisible ball and run with it.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
But you'd be wrong.

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,060
The next major developments in atomic theory
didn't come along for nearly 2300 YEARS.

33
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,269
I've already told you,
for instance,

34
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:11,340
about the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier,
who proposed the law of conservation of mass,

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,090
which states that even if matter changes shape
or form, its mass stays the same.

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,370
And you should remember the English teacher
James Dalton

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,930
who determined that elements exist as discreet
packets of matter.

38
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,219
Thanks to these, and other great minds, by the 1800s we had a better grip on the general behavior of atoms.

39
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:31,349
The next logical question was "Why? Why do
they behave the way they do?"

40
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,389
This led to the investigation of atomic structure.

41
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,489
In the 1870s, scientists began probing what
stuff was made of using discharge tubes,

42
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,659
basically gas-filled tubes with electrodes
in each end,

43
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,199
which emit light when an electrical current passes through them – basically, what a neon light is.

44
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,359
Because this light was originally produced
by a negative electrode, or cathode,

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,270
it was called a cathode ray,
and it had a negative charge.

46
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:59,520
But in 1886, German physicist Eugen Goldstein found that the tubes also emitted light from the positive electrode,

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,180
basically, a ray headed in the opposite direction, which meant that there must also be a positive charge in matter.

48
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,520
Goldstein didn't fully understand what he'd
discovered here –

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,800
I mean, scientists still hadn't figured out what was responsible for the negative charge in the rays either.

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,380
Then, English physicist J.J. Thompson took
the discharge tube research further:

51
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:20,179
by measuring how much heat the cathode rays
generated,

52
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,459
how much they could be bent by magnets and
other things,

53
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,560
he was able to estimate the mass of the rays.

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,640
And the mass was about 1000 times lighter than a hydrogen, the smallest bit of matter known at the time.

55
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,839
He concluded that the cathode "rays" weren't
rays or waves at all, but were, in fact,

56
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,539
very light, very small
negatively-charged particles.

57
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:45,239
He called them "corpuscles;" we call them
"electrons."

58
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,620
So even though we didn't understand what shapes
they took,

59
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:51,149
we knew that there were both negative and
positive components to matter.

60
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,789
The next question was "How were they arranged
in the atom?"

61
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,500
Thompson knew that the atom overall had a
neutral charge,

62
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,900
so he imagined that the negatively charged electrons must be distributed randomly in a positively charged matrix.

63
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:07,408
And the very English Thompson visualized this
model as a familiar English dessert:

64
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:13,560
plum pudding, the positive matrix being the cake, and the electrons the random, floating bits of fruit within it.

65
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:17,740
Even today, Thompson's model of the atom continues
to be called the "plum pudding model."

66
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:21,639
And while a single electron's motion is random,
the overall distribution of them is not.

67
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,990
The next big step was taken by New Zealander
Ernest Rutherford in 1909.

68
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,079
He designed an experiment using an extremely thin sheet of gold foil and a screen coated with zinc sulfide.

69
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,959
He bombarded the sheet with alpha particles,
which he didn't really know what they were,

70
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:41,259
just that they were produced by the decay of radium, they were positive charged, and they were really, really small.

71
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,360
He expected them to just fly right through the foil, with no deflection, and many of them did just that.

72
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,199
But as it turned out, some of the particles were deflected at large angles and sometimes almost straight backward.

73
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,979
The only explanation for this was that the
entire positive charge of an atom,

74
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,249
the charge that would repel an alpha particle,

75
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:03,729
must be concentrated in a very small area,
an area that he called "the nucleus."

76
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:06,418
Because most of the alpha particles passed
right through the atoms undeterred,

77
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,758
Rutherford concluded that most of the atom
is empty space, and he was correct.

78
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,180
Rutherford would later discover that if he
bombarded nitrogen with alpha particles,

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,399
it created a bunch of hydrogen ions.

80
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:23,079
Now he correctly surmised that these tiny positively charged ions were themselves fundamental particles:

81
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,550
Protons.
Now we're getting close to reality.

82
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,749
So these chemists had a fairly good idea of
the structure of the atom,

83
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:31,789
they just needed to figure out what exactly
the electrons were doing.

84
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:33,378
Enter Niels Bohr.

85
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:37,330
In 1911, the same year the results of Rutherford's
gold foil experiment were published,

86
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:40,240
Bohr traveled to England to study with Rutherford.

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,639
And as a physicist, he was also interested
in the mathematical model set forth by

88
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,519
German physicists Max Planck and Albert Einstein to explain the behavior of electromagnetic energy.

89
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,359
Over time, Bohr came to realize these mathematical principles could be applied to Rutherford's atomic model.

90
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:55,580
His analysis of the gold foil experiment and
calculations

91
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,968
based on the proportion of the alpha particles
that went straight through,

92
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:02,218
those that were slightly deflected, and those
that bounced almost completely backward,

93
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:06,689
allowed him to predict the most likely positions
of electrons within the atom.

94
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:12,480
Bohr's resulting model, sometimes called the planetary model, is still familiar to most people, probably including you.

95
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,000
It represents the electrons in orbits around
a small central nucleus.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,660
Each orbit can have a specific number of electrons,

97
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:23,718
which correlates to the energy levels and
orbitals in the modern model of an atom.

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,660
And while it's definitely flawed, Bohr's model is very close to reality in some important ways.

99
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:35,059
But like everyone I've mentioned in the past couple of minutes, Bohr was at once fantastically right and way off.

100
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,439
The problem was those pesky electrons.

101
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,449
It was the German theoretical physicist Werner
Heisenberg

102
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,199
who got everyone to understand just how huge
and mind-blowing this electron problem was.

103
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,420
But he was also the one who helped tie the
whole mess up into a neat little bundle.

104
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,400
Using his wicked math chops, Heisenberg discovered
that it is impossible to know with certainty

105
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,500
both the momentum of an electron or any subatomic
particle and its exact position.

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,480
And the more you know about one of those two variables, the harder it gets to measure the other one.

107
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,278
So if you can't measure the position or momentum
of an electron,

108
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,379
you obviously can't say with certainty that the electrons in an atom are all neatly aligned in circular orbits.

109
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,959
So he and a new wave of physicists and chemists
proposed a new theory: a quantum theory,

110
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:22,120
which proposes that electrons weren't particles or waves, instead, they had properties of both and neither.

111
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,860
By this thinking, the arrangement of electrons around a nucleus could only be described in terms of probability.

112
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,060
In other words, there are certain regions where an electron is much more likely to be found.

113
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,980
We call these regions "orbitals."

114
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,819
You know, the very same orbital that you and
I have been talking about –

115
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,688
the ones that go by the names "s and d and
p and f" and that form sigma and pi bonds –

116
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:44,189
those are the things that Heisenberg's theory
predicts.

117
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,260
And that's the modern understanding of atoms.

118
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:49,528
Because it's based on probability, quantum
atoms are often drawn as

119
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:52,949
clouds with the intensity of color representing
not individual electrons

120
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,389
but the probability of finding an electron
in any particular position.

121
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,389
For this reason, the quantum model is often
called the cloud model of the atom.

122
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,109
And now ya know!

123
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:06,508
All the people I've mentioned and many others put their heads together over time to build this current and

124
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:09,479
– I might say – quite elegant understanding
of atomic theory.

125
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,379
Now, after 2500 years, even though we can't see them, we can know what they're like and how they work,

126
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,689
because a long succession of scientists contributed
bits and pieces to the whole fantastic picture.

127
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:25,429
But it's also important to recognize that
we still may not be quite all the way right.

128
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:28,759
Thompson's contemporaries were sure that the
plum pudding model was right;

129
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,139
scientists in Bohr's day fully believed that
the planetary model was right,

130
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:36,239
and today we're extremely confident that the
quantum model is correct.

131
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,600
But it may not be all the way correct, and
that's where you come in:

132
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,800
the only way we can go on being sure is to
keep asking questions and conducting experiments.

133
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,039
And that's why you're taking chemistry
and physics. Pay attention!

134
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,500
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

135
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,879
If you paid attention, you learned that Leucippus
and Democritus

136
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,509
originated the idea of atoms nearly 2500 years
ago,

137
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,889
but that the real work didn't really begin
until

138
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:04,690
both protons and electrons were discovered
by experimenting with discharge tubes,

139
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,850
and how Ernest Rutherford figured out what
and where the nucleus is.

140
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,839
You also learned that chemistry can sometimes
be done with just math,

141
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,480
like how Bohr figured out his model

142
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,629
or the way that Heisenberg used math to usher
in the quantum theory of the atom.
