00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello, I'm Hank Green; welcome to Crash Course
Chemistry.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,890
Today, we're talking about the most important
table ever.

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,638
Not the table where they signed the Declaration
of Independence,

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:16,678
nor any table of contents, nor this table
right here, nor the stone table of Aslan,

5
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:17,198
NAY!

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,550
It is the periodic table of elements, a concise,

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,649
information-dense catalog of all of the different
sorts of atoms in the universe.

8
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,399
Today I want to talk a little bit about the
creation of this table,

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,429
which is, to be clear, one of the crowning
achievements of human thought.

10
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:38,500
To start out, though, let's close our eyes
and pretend.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,619
[Theme Music]

12
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:49,570
Imagine you're in Siberia. And you're a thirteen-year-old
boy.

13
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,299
And your father, who was a professor but had
gone blind,

14
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:58,078
leaving your family of more than ten brothers and sisters destitute, has just died. I know, downer.

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,439
Your mom, to support the family, has re-opened an abandoned glassmaking factory in the small town where you live,

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,520
largely because she wants to make enough money
to send you to school someday.

17
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,039
A year passes - the factory burns down.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,410
But your mom, she sees your potential;

19
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,219
she knows that you have a keen scientific
mind and will not see that squandered.

20
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:25,039
So, with your siblings out of the house and on their own, she packs up your belongings, straps them to a horse,

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,280
and with you in tow, rides 1200 miles through the Ural Mountains on horseback to a university in Moscow.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,840
There, on your behalf, she pleads earnestly
and effectively, and they reject you.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,060
So together, you ride another 400 miles to
St. Petersburg,

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,859
to the school where your father had graduated
as a scientist,

25
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:52,019
and as luck, or extreme, insane, undeniably Russian persistence, would have it, they accept you,

26
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:58,280
and your saddle-worn butt, as a pupil. Your mother, having completed her mission, promptly dies.

27
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,920
If you're doing your imagining as I told you,
you might feel a tremendous debt to your mother,

28
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,699
and a very deep desire to ensure that you achieve something on par with the sacrifices she made for you.

29
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,459
And maybe that's one reason why Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev became the crown jewel of Russian science,

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,540
and a theorist who revolutionized how we see
the world.

31
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,719
Mendeleev spent a great deal of time in laboratories as a student, studying the burgeoning new field of chemistry.

32
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,378
He worked with all the elements that you could
work with at the time,

33
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:30,889
and his knowledge gave him unique insights
into their properties.

34
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:32,919
Those insights would come in handy.

35
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,339
Let's all imagine we're Mendeleev again - I like doing that - and that we know a bunch of stuff about chemistry -

36
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,829
which, you know, we don't, yet - but we're
imagining.

37
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,140
So it's the 1860s, and about 60 elements are
known to mankind,

38
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,908
and their atomic weights are mostly known
as well.

39
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:50,639
So the simplest thing was just to sort them
in order of their atomic weights.

40
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,559
But interestingly, you, because you're a cleverpants,

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,539
realized that the most significant relationships
seem to have nothing to do with the atomic weight.

42
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:03,120
Lithium, sodium, potassium, and rubidium were
all extremely prone to reacting with chlorine,

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,569
fluorine, iodine, and bromine;

44
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:09,149
beryllium, magnesium, calcium, and strontium
were all similar, but less reactive.

45
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,450
But with a quick inspection, you, and to be
fair, a number of other chemists,

46
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:17,459
realize that there was a relationship between
atomic weights, but it's periodic.

47
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,128
At the beginning of the list of elements,
characteristics repeat every seven elements.

48
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:23,498
On the side here, we now know that it's every
eight elements,

49
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:26,888
but in the 1860s, elements were studies based
on their reactivity,

50
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:32,400
so the non-reactive noble gases had not yet
been discovered, so the period occurred every

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
As the mass of the elements increases, the
repetition starts to get a little less periodic,

52
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,949
although it's certainly still there; it just
isn't perfect.

53
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:42,098
Some of your colleagues, they're saying: "Well,
such is life."

54
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:46,188
It was perfect repetition early on, but later
in the list it gets a little fuzzier.

55
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:52,078
But not you; you become obsessed. Obsessed
with the perfection of the periodicity.

56
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,169
You write out the names and weights and properties
of elements on cards;

57
00:03:55,169 --> 00:04:02,289
you lay them across your desk, shuffle them, tear them to pieces in frustration, until one day, you realize:

58
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:04,229
that you're simply missing cards.

59
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:07,608
The numbers aren't working, not because there's
something wrong with your ideas,

60
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:10,810
but because some elements simply haven't been
discovered yet.

61
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,220
Armed with this insight, you insert gaps into the table, and things suddenly fall perfectly into place.

62
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,720
Seven-element periods for the first two rows,
with hydrogen in its own category,

63
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,360
eighteen-element periods for the next two
rows.

64
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,960
You're so certain that you predict the properties
of these missing elements.

65
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,419
And when a French scientist comes along and says that he has, in fact, discovered one of them,

66
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,259
you argue with him, saying that you discovered
it first in your mind.

67
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,170
And when you see his data, and it doesn't
match yours,

68
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,410
you publish a paper saying his data for the
new element he discovered is wrong.

69
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,420
That's how certain you are of yourself of this beautiful new theoretical framework you've created.

70
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,890
And you know what the really crazy thing is?
You're right! That French guy's data was wrong!

71
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,240
You, never having examined the element he
discovered, knew more about it than he did,

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,069
because you are Mendeleev, Master of the Elements.

73
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,849
Okay, we're done imagining for the episode;
that was fun though.

74
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,750
Different groups Mendeleev had identified are a lot of the same groups that we study today.

75
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,819
Starting at the left, we have the soft, shiny,
extremely reactive alkali metals,

76
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,219
so reactive, in fact, that they have to be
stored in inert gases or oil, to prevent them

77
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,110
from reacting with the atmosphere.

78
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,480
Alkali metals want nothing more than to dump off an electron and form a positive ion, or cation.

79
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,259
And they're always jonesing to hook up with
a hottie from the other side of the table.

80
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:34,699
So of course, seeing as they're so reactive, you don't find hunks of them lying around in nature;

81
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:38,019
instead, chemists must extract them from compounds
containing them.

82
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:43,579
Next, you have the alkaline earth metals - reactive metals, but not as reactive as the alkali metals,

83
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:47,279
forming cations with two positive charges
instead of just one.

84
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,500
Calcium, shown here, undergoes a very similar
reaction to sodium with water,

85
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,519
just a little more slowly, producing a little
less heat.

86
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:59,419
The middle body area of the table is made up of a nice, solid rectangle of transition metals,

87
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,120
these are the metals you think of as metal,
with iron, and nickel, and gold, and platinum.

88
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,670
The majority of elements are metals - they're
fairly unreactive, great conductors of heat,

89
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,980
but more importantly for us, good conductors
of electricity.

90
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,819
They're malleable, and can be bent and formed
and hammered into sheets,

91
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,050
and they're extremely important in chemistry
but overall surprisingly similar to each other.

92
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,170
On the far right, just over from the noble
gases,

93
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,680
the halogens make up a set of extremely reactive
gases that form negative ions, or anions,

94
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,759
with one negative charge, and love to react
with the alkali and alkaline earth metals.

95
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,789
The rectangle between the halogens and the
transition metals contain a peculiar scatter

96
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,460
shot of metals, metalloids, gases, and nonmetals;

97
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:44,539
these guys don't end up as ions unless you take extreme action and start shooting other ions at them,

98
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,350
so generally a bit boring over here, though
lots of interesting covalent organic chemistry

99
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,520
(we'll get to that).

100
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,129
Down below, in their own little island, are
the lanthanides and actinides,

101
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:57,540
metals that were largely undiscovered in Mendeleev's
day

102
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,590
because they're so similar that it's next
to impossible to separate them from each other.

103
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:06,789
And finally, on the far, far right, also undiscovered
when Mendeleev built his chart,

104
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,650
the completely unreactive noble gases.

105
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:14,219
Like a lot of other obsessive scientists, Mendeleev never thought he was done with his table,

106
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,660
so he held it back for quite a while, only
publishing it as part of a new chemistry textbook

107
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,980
he was working on as a way to make some quick
cash that he needed.

108
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,200
And, as with many other scientific revelations, there were a number of other people hot on this discovery's trail.

109
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,219
As many as six people published on the periodicity
of elements at roughly the same time as Mendeleev,

110
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,160
but a few things set him apart.

111
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,120
1. He was obsessive.

112
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,240
He knew the data better than anyone else,

113
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,240
and had spent a ton of time working on a theory that many people thought was just an interesting little quirk.

114
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,819
And 2. he realized in a way no one else did that the idea of periodicity had far-reaching consequences.

115
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,399
It seems as if he had a deep belief in the
cosmic importance of what he was doing,

116
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,420
almost of religious fascination.

117
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,970
Mendeleev believed in God

118
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,220
but also he believed that organized religions were false paths to the unknowable nature of God.

119
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,710
I like to believe that he thought he saw some
divine pattern in his tables,

120
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:12,659
and Mendeleev felt as if he was coming to
know God in a way that no other man had.

121
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,040
To be clear, this is pure conjecture.

122
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,850
And as we now know, the periodicity of elements
is a physical phenomenon.

123
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:24,520
It's a function of electrons, which are in some ways pretty dang peculiar, but certainly not at all mystical.

124
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,819
But we'll get to that peculiar physical reality
in the next episode.

125
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:34,088
The periodic table that we know and love - I
love it anyway - if a representation of reality;

126
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,990
a way of understanding and sorting the universe
as it exists.

127
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,168
But that form of the table is not by any means
set in stone;

128
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:46,338
indeed, a contemporary of Mendeleev envisioned
the table set onto a screw, or cylinder,

129
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,879
with the elements wrapping around from one
side to another.

130
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,209
While Mendeleev's table looks more like a
map up on a wall,

131
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,299
de Chancourtois, a geologist, envisioned more
of a globe.

132
00:08:55,299 --> 00:09:01,159
Unfortunately for de Chancourtois, no publisher could figure out how to print his cylindrical 3D table,

133
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:06,679
and so he published his paper without a graphical representation of his Periodic Cylinder of the Elements,

134
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,138
and it was largely ignored.

135
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,259
I guess they didn't have paper craft back
then.

136
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:14,970
I am a huge fan of this cut-and-tape model
of the periodic table;

137
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,120
you can make your own - there's a link in
the description -

138
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,028
and there are also a ton of other designs
for periodic tables

139
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:23,259
that have various advantages over the one
that we're all familiar with.

140
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:27,060
Our periodic table, as it stands, it really
a little bit unhappy with itself, frankly;

141
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,679
the lanthanides and actinides really should
be part of the table, but we separate them out,

142
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,739
because it's hard to fit that on a piece of paper;
really, this is what it should look like.

143
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:38,350
And really, it would be best if it wrapped
around into a circle,

144
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:44,060
so that fluorine, and neon, and sodium were all next to each other, instead of being on opposite sides of the map,

145
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:45,869
because they're just one proton away!

146
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,740
Mendeleev's contribution, nonetheless, is
more powerful than at first it seemed.

147
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,639
He ended up forming a guide to help future
chemists understand things that wouldn't be

148
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,579
discovered for 25, 50, even 100 years.

149
00:09:56,578 --> 00:10:00,318
Indeed, after Mendeleev's theories were published
and accepted,

150
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:06,769
the overwhelming cry form the scientific community
was "Why? Why? Why?"

151
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:09,188
And although Mendeleev was not himself concerned
with this stuff,

152
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:14,419
he actually denied the existence of atoms, or indeed anything he couldn't see with his own eyes.

153
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:18,579
It turned out that the answer to the first
"Why", was the electron.

154
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:25,320
That sneaky little electron; Mendeleev, if he'd been around to see their discovery, he would have hated them.

155
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:28,628
But you, you will have a healthy respect for
them,

156
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,680
after you learn all about them on the next
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

157
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,759
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash Course Chemistry. If you were paying attention, you now know:

158
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,339
The terrible, beautiful, and wonderful story
of Dmitri Mendeleev;

159
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,870
How he organized the elements into the periodic
table;

160
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,860
Some of the basics of the relationships in
that table;

161
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,370
Why Mendeleev stood out from his colleagues;

162
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,539
and how the table as we know it today could
stand some improvement.

163
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,519
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by myself,
