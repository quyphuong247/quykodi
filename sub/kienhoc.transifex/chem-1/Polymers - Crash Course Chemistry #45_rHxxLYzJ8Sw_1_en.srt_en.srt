00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
Charles Darwin was a big fan of billiards.
He loved his billiard table.

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,879
It was one of his prized possessions and one
of the most valuable things he owned.

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:13,548
Well - not the actual table itself. In fact,
it was the balls that were so valuable.

4
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:19,239
Pure ivory carved from the tusks of elephants;
only the wealthiest could afford a full set.

5
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,500
Luckily he was married to an heiress.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,839
A full set of 16 billiard balls would require at least one, possibly two, full elephants worth of ivory.

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,539
The idea that any bar in the world might contain
a billiard table available for anyone to play,

8
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:38,259
and not like run out of the bar with your pockets full of valuable ivory would have sounded insane in 1850.

9
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:40,679
And the billiard industry was well aware of
this problem.

10
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:44,369
Billiard balls were getting more expensive,
elephants were getting more rare.

11
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:49,829
It was thus not with an environmental motive, that in 1867 the Phelan and Collender Pool Supply Company

12
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,379
offered $10,000 to anyone who could come up with a substitute material that worked as well as ivory,

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,940
but could be produced more quickly and sustainably
then dead elephants.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,969
An inventor named John Wesley Hyatt took on
that challenge.

15
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,700
He used nitrocellulose, a flammable solid,

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,799
created by mixing cotton with nitric acid
to create a hard, shiny, white sphere.

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,850
The properties were extremely similar to ivory
billiard balls.

18
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,750
The company never gave him the prize.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,500
But he did patent the technique, using it
to create billiard balls,

20
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,910
piano keys and even teeth, becoming pretty
dang wealthy in the process.

21
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:28,789
Also he pretty much created the industry that made all of the polymer materials that surround you right now,

22
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,490
and that we'll be discussing today in Crash
Course Chemistry.

23
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:35,929
Also elephants didn't go extinct, so that's
a plus.

24
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:45,650
[Theme Music]

25
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,719
The polymer that John Hyatt worked on was,
somewhat unsurprisingly, kinda crummy.

26
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,760
It worked well once it was created, but the
manufacturing process was dangerous

27
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:57,549
because nitrated cellulose can explode in
a warm breeze.

28
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,978
So luckily, some replacements started creeping
in.

29
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:05,058
Replacements with some names you probably
recognize, like polyvinyl chloride or PVC,

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,960
bakelite, polystyrene, polyester, and nylon.

31
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:14,560
These are all polymers; huge chains or sometimes 3D networks of repeating organic units called monomers.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,819
Each polymer has a monomer, but they're all
relatively simple at that basic one unit level.

33
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,760
The trick is that they bond to each other
on each side potentially forever,

34
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,299
though in reality the chains are sometimes
hundreds, sometimes thousands,

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,719
sometimes hundreds of thousands of units long.

36
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:36,159
In order to make a polymer all you need is a molecule that can easily bond to another identical molecule at 2 points.

37
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,439
And the simplest of those is ethene, also
known as ethylene.

38
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,120
It's polymer, you'll be unsurprised to hear is polyethylene, which you've probably heard about.

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,998
We'll talk more about the specifics in a second,

40
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:50,769
but basically because pi bounds in the double
bond are weaker than sigma bonds

41
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,560
they can be broken and new monomers can be
added.

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,699
Just to note to avoid confusion: polyethylene
has that "-ene" sound in it, right,

43
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:02,179
but it's not an alkene because all those double
bonds get broken to form new sigma bonds.

44
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,540
It's a polymerized alkene, but the molecule
itself is an alkane.

45
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,799
It's confusing so I thought it's worth pointing
out.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,859
Now chemists might want a bunch of different
things out of their polymers;

47
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,959
maybe they want it to be stretchy, maybe strong,
maybe transparent, maybe recyclable.

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,140
Polyethylene is transparent and thermoplastic, meaning it can be melted and reformed. Making it recyclable.

49
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,798
Some other polymers like polyurethane or Bakelite
are thermoset.

50
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,049
Which means that they change chemically during
some kind of curing process

51
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:31,329
and cannot be melted down and reformed.

52
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,669
Polyethylene can actually be converted into
a thermoset polymer by introducing cross-links,

53
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,500
basically molecular bridges between those
polymer chains.

54
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,719
Any plumbers out there probably have heard of cross-linked ethylene or PEX pipe. Which is what this is.

55
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,069
It's extra, super strong because of those
cross-links.

56
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:50,989
Polyethylene is also nice because it's strength can be varied by changing the size of the molecules.

57
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,949
If they are allowed to polymerize until they
are tens of thousands of monomers long,

58
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,629
the plastic they will form will be all knotted up in these ultra long chains and it will be extremely strong.

59
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:03,048
That's why this HDPE, high density polyethylene,
is a strong bottle.

60
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,650
Whereas this is much squishier, this is low
density polyethylene.

61
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,659
However those ultra long chains also make it much more viscous when heated and thus more difficult to process.

62
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:15,099
It also loses some of its opacity, and becomes
more of that milky white color.

63
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,519
Now polyethylene is great.
It's really great.

64
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,139
So great that it's the most common plastic in the world.

65
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:23,329
We produce over 80 million tons of it per
year.

66
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:28,569
But we want a lot out of our plastics - strength,
color, elasticity, resilience, recyclability -

67
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,920
we need everything from saran wrap to car
tires.

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,879
All of these are traits that chemists work tirelessly to create in the early to middle 20th century

69
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,800
and continue to work on even today.

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,819
One of the earliest techniques they used to
try and bring out new properties

71
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,338
was to change the substituents on the ethylene
monomer.

72
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,758
Just, see what would happen.

73
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,229
Like, what if we swapped out one of the hydrogens
for chlorine?

74
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:51,728
Well you get polychloroethene, kinda, that's
not what we call it.

75
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:54,939
OK, so remember how benzene when attached
to a chain is a phenyl group,

76
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,860
and how those two words have nothing to do
with each other?

77
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,939
Well the same thing goes for the ethene functional
group, which is called a vinyl group.

78
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,620
It's an old word, super old, it comes from
the Greek word for wine.

79
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,408
And that is why chloroethene is more commonly
called vinyl chloride.

80
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:14,180
And polychloroethene is more commonly called
polyvinyl chloride, or PVC.

81
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,158
Which is what this little ducky is made out
of and also what records are made out of,

82
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:19,620
which is why we call them vinyl.

83
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,709
Now what happens when we change out a hydrogen
for a methyl group?

84
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:27,609
Well then suddenly this molecule is a propene
or, if you are using ye old ways, a propylene.

85
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,720
And, yes, if you polymerize it, it becomes
polypropylene.

86
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,900
If one of the hydrogens is replaced with a
phenyl group,

87
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:38,199
well that chemical was first derived from trees in the Styrax family, so it's called styrene.

88
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,420
Polymerize it, polystyrene.
Make a foam out of it, Styrofoam.

89
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,000
Now if you change all four of the hydrogens on the base ethylene with fluorine it becomes tetrafluoroethylene.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,220
Polymerize that and instead of hydrogens that
polymer is bound entirely to fluorines.

91
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:01,000
Fluorine as we could guess from its spot on the periodic table, love electrons. It is extremely electronegative.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,100
But because it holds onto it's electrons so tightly, and is so satisfied in this polymerized chain,

93
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,240
the electrons are unavailable for even minimal
interactions with any other molecules.

94
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,598
I'm not just saying this stuff is super difficult to difficult to react with, or it's really stable.

95
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,199
It's more than that the electrons aren't even
available for the sort of interactions that

96
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,538
make things stick to each other, or cause
friction.

97
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:25,769
Which is why you have heard of polymerized
tetrafluoroethylene,

98
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:32,139
because it's super useful, either by its abbreviation,
PTFE, or by its brand name Teflon.

99
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,879
So how do we actually make these things?

100
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,279
Well, ethene based polymers form through a
process called addition polymerization.

101
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,049
The monomers are simply added together and
no by products are formed.

102
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,098
In order to get the process kicked off you
have to introduce a free radical.

103
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:50,579
To me, that always sounded like some crazy
freedom-fighter diving into battle

104
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,620
without much thought for what would come after
he was consumed in the firefight.

105
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,720
And, that's kinda what they are. Free radicals are atoms or ions that have a single unpaired electron.

106
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,460
This is crazy unstable. It's basically like having half of covalent bond dangling off the atom.

107
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,819
Anywhere this can form a bond, it's going
to form a bond.

108
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,540
And, in the case of addition polymerization it attacks the double bond and joins one of the carbons,

109
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,110
while the other carbon is itself left with
an unpaired electron.

110
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,218
The molecule itself is now a newly formed
free radical,

111
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,600
and it attack another nearby pi bond, joining with another molecule of ethene, forming another radical.

112
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,960
This process continues until two radicals
meet each other

113
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,459
consuming both free radicals without producing
any more, thus, ending polymerization.

114
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:36,339
There are, of course, other sorts of polymerization,
as well.

115
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:41,599
Sometimes a hydroxyl group from one molecule is happy to join up with a hydrogen from another, forming water.

116
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,419
The water will break away as a byproduct,
leaving the two molecules bound together.

117
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:48,498
This often occurs when an amine group, with
its loosely held hydrogen,

118
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:51,120
meets a carboxylic acid, with its loosely
held -OH group.

119
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,079
This is just what happens when hexamethylenediamine meets adipic acid forming another branded polymer, nylon.

120
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:04,060
By dissolving hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid into two different immiscible, or un-mixable, solvents,

121
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,259
we actually create nylon right here.

122
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,978
The nylon forms at the interface between the
two immiscible liquids.

123
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:16,519
And, we can literally grab it and pull it
out of the vial, twisting and spooling it

124
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,479
until we get a nice glob of nylon.

125
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,680
This works because hexamethylenediamine has
an amine group on each end

126
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,519
and adipic acid has a carboxylic acid on both
ends.

127
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,478
Thus when the two monomer unit, called a dimer,
is formed,

128
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,200
there is still a carboxylic acid on one end and an amine group on the other, allowing for further polymerization.

129
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,540
These amine acid condensation polymerizations
also allow for the creation of

130
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,439
possibly the most important polymers on the
planet;

131
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,680
natural polymers being created inside of youvright now out of monomers that we call amino acids.

132
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,179
Did you see that one coming?

133
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,620
Amino acids polymerize through condensation
reactions guide by the code in your DNA and

134
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:57,279
some very complicated enzymes to form basically
you.

135
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,549
Other important polymers in your body include:
polysaccharides, which we use to store energy;

136
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:06,159
and yeah DNA and RNA, which we use to encode
information for the formation of proteins.

137
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,579
But that would be back to biology, which is
a whole other Crash Course.

138
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,850
Which to be clear is available if you'd like
to watch it.

139
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,279
And thank you for watching this episode of
Crash Course Chemistry, in it you learned:

140
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,480
That the first commercial polymer ever saved
the lives of a lot of elephants.

141
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,779
That ethene is sometimes called ethylene.

142
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:30,220
And, that a huge variety of polymers is based on the addition reaction of ethene based monomers, including Teflon.

143
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,320
Which so friction-less because of fluorine's
extreme electronegativity.

144
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,070
You also learned how addition polymerization
reactions work.

145
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,690
And, that other polymers are formed by condensation
reactions.

146
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:46,340
Including the polymerization of amino acids monomers, which along with other polymers like DNA and RNA,

147
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,860
and glycogen, make up a lot of the stuff that
is you.

148
