1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
The electron is to chemistry what money is
to capitalism.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:07,528
It's all about who has it, who wants it, and
what they're willing to do to get it.

3
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:12,138
Electrons are what make it possible for an
atom to bond with other atoms to form molecules.

4
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:16,689
And when that happens, a tremendous amount
of energy can be exchanged in the process.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,760
But not all chemical reactions involve electrons
changing hands.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,790
Acid base reactions, you recall, are more
about swapping protons.

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,009
But because electrons are the real coin in
the realm of chemistry,

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,160
the most important reactions to take place
on Earth involve the transfer of one or more

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,379
electrons from one atom to another.

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:38,320
These are redox reactions. Redox, which is
a portmanteau of 'reduction', 'oxidation'.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:47,659
[Theme Music]

12
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:51,959
But what's up with those words? You know what
reduction is, making less of something.

13
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:57,280
And then oxidation maybe has something to
do with oxygen. Well, sometimes, not always.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,149
These are actually super terrible choices
for what is actually happening in redox reactions,

15
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,899
but we are stuck with them.

16
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,159
Reduction is when a substance gains electrons.

17
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,819
Yes, it gains, which is the opposite of what
the word 'reduce' means, fantastic.

18
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:16,239
And yes, sometimes I want to punish the people
who name these things so inaccurately

19
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,640
but they didn't know any better and they're
all dead, so we can't do anything about it.

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,140
Proto chemists would make pure metals by heating
or smelting their ores.

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,950
And they notice, during the smelting, that
these substances would become lighter.

22
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,350
So I guess it's not crazy that they decided
to say these substances were being reduced.

23
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:35,500
Our old French friend, Antoine Lavoisier,
figured out that this was

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,090
because oxygen gas was actually leaving the
compound, making it lighter.

25
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,810
What he didn't know, was the actual chemistry
involved.

26
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,439
Oxygen is, unsurprisingly, the quintessential
oxidizer.

27
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,150
It pulls electrons off of one molecule to
make itself more stable.

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,500
But if you heat it up enough, it gets all
energetic.

29
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,328
Today, we understand that oxidation and reduction
are all about electron transfers.

30
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:58,449
So you might think that we'd rename them.

31
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,409
And some chemists have tried, using terms
like electronation and de-electronation.

32
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:09,420
But once a set of terms is decided upon and used for a while, it's pretty difficult to uncreate it, so we're stuck.

33
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,699
To keep these seemingly nonsensical names
straight, I rely on the phrase 'OILRIG':

34
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:19,419
"Oxidation is loss of electrons, reduction
is gain of electrons."

35
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:22,019
We just gotta know these stuff, because it's
everywhere.

36
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,380
When your cells convert sugar into energy so you can move and breathe and think? That's redox.

37
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:31,639
When plants photosynthesize sunlight into
food? That's redox.

38
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,069
The battery powering your laptop? Redox. Fire?
Also redox!

39
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:39,560
Since electron swapping is the name of the
game here, when you study redox reactions,

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,348
it's important, critical, absolutely essential,
to keep track of the electrons.

41
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,359
Think of them as dollars or pesos or pounds
or euros.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,110
In any transaction, one person is going to
gain them and the other is going to lose them.

43
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,710
And to stay on top of things, you have to
keep tabs on who's ahead and who's behind.

44
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,680
Atoms are fond of sharing electrons though,
forming covalent bonds,

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,640
so sometimes keeping track of where they are and where they're gonna end up isn't quite so simple.

46
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:10,598
Let's think of every covalent compound like
a marriage.

47
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,838
Though it's gonna be weird marriage, because
like, there might be like six people in it.

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,099
Sometimes the same person several times.

49
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,930
Without commitment, no commitment and also
no emotions. Don't think too much about it.

50
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,080
Like in a marriage, where money gets shared,
covalent compounds share electrons.

51
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,259
The trick, is figuring out who get the cash
when the vows break.

52
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:34,739
So we've created a useful little system assigning
electrons 100% to atoms that are, actually

53
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,390
at the moment, sharing them.

54
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,329
The number that we assign is the atoms' 'oxidation
state' or oxidation number.

55
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,540
Even though we are of course aware of covalent
bonds and the sharing of electrons,

56
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:48,620
the processes are easier to follow if we imagine the atoms are already splitting up the bank account,

57
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,280
as if they were in an ionic or non-sharing
bond.

58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,098
So an atom's oxidation number is basically
what its charge would be,

59
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:00,479
if it actually owned all its electrons exclusively like the newly-minted bachelors that they may become.

60
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,819
So to figure out those oxidation states, or oxidation numbers, we have some simple rules for some atoms:

61
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:12,158
First, the oxidation number for any element by itself, whether it's monatomic, diatomic, or polyatomic,

62
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:19,480
like an atom of calcium or molecule of H2 or even bigger molecule of sulfur (S8), the oxidation number is 0.

63
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,549
Atoms, by definition, do not have a charge.
If they had a charge they would be ions.

64
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,329
And if they're sharing with themselves, they
share it equally.

65
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,819
Second, for a monatomic ion, basically a charged atom, it's simply the size or number of its charge.

66
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:38,019
So the iron (II) in Fe2+ has an oxidation state of plus two, while the chloride ion is minus one.

67
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:41,799
Third, oxygen, which is unsurprisingly all
over redox chemistry,

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,538
almost always has an oxidation of negative
two,

69
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:48,128
unless it happens to be in a peroxide molecule
like hydrogen peroxide.

70
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:53,069
Fourth, hydrogen, is plus one.
And fifth, fluorine, is negative one.

71
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,020
As are all the other halogens most of the
time.

72
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,258
Pretty much, unless they're bonded to fluorine
or oxygen,

73
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,259
cause fluorine or oxygen are so bad that they
could make anybody's oxidation number a positive,

74
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:03,598
if you know what I mean?

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,140
And those are the rules!
That's all you need to know.

76
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:12,419
Now, the total of all the oxidation numbers of all the atoms in a neutral compound will add up to zero.

77
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,778
Like water: with one oxygen, with a negative two oxidation state; two hydrogens of plus one;

78
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:21,629
and voila, a neutral compound has an oxidation
number of zero.

79
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:26,920
A polyatomic ion, on the other hand, has to work out to have an oxidation state that matches its charge.

80
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,038
So SO42-, the sulfate ion, has four oxygens
for a total of negative eight,

81
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,118
but we don't have a rule for sulfur so I guess
we just give up and walk away, who cares anymore?

82
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,500
No!
We use like, third-grade algebra.

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,920
Because we have to end up with an oxidation
number of negative two for the whole compound,

84
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,519
we know that sulfur, in this particular compound,
has an oxidation state of plus six.

85
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,528
But, sulfur's oxidation state isn't always
plus six,

86
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:55,769
and that's why we don't have a rule for sulfur
or a lot of other elements for that matter,

87
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:59,688
because oxidation states of most elements
change depending on what they're bonded with.

88
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,289
Now we can use the same logic to figure out
what happens

89
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:05,608
when these compounds interact in redox reactions.

90
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:10,778
Molecular divorce courts of electrons: changing
hands, being haggled over, and traded,

91
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:15,619
with some players taking big profits while others lose nearly everything. Them's the breaks.

92
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,300
Let's start out with a simple example:

93
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,160
a chemical reaction that I believe has saved more lives than any other in the history of chemistry,

94
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,980
created by a war criminal to blow people up
during WWI: the Haber process.

95
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,240
The Haber process removes the ultra-stable
elemental nitrogen from the air

96
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:39,159
and combines it hydrogen to form NH3, ammonia
for use in bombs and also in fertilizer,

97
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:42,569
increasing the carrying capacity of the Earth
by billions.

98
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,920
Nitrogen in the air exists as elemental diatomic nitrogen, and hydrogen, likewise, is also diatomic H2.

99
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,580
So we know that starting out all of the atoms
have an oxidation state of zero.

100
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:57,689
Product of the reaction, ammonia, is a neutral
compound with one nitrogen and three hydrogens.

101
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:01,528
The hydrogens, each have an oxidation state
of plus one -- remember the rules --

102
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:04,740
so nitrogen must have an oxidation state of
minus three.

103
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,788
Nitrogen thus gained electron, its oxidation
state went down and so it was reduced.

104
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:14,099
So at least when talking about what oxidation states are doing, the word 'reduced' make sense.

105
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,080
Hydrogen lost electrons, the oxidation state
went up and it was oxidized.

106
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,740
Now this is pretty simple equation to balance, but redox equations can be a huge headache sometimes

107
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:29,249
because the number of individual atoms involved,
so we often have to balance them in half-reactions.

108
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,439
So even though we don't really need to do the half-reactions, because this is a pretty simple equation,

109
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,879
we're going to do them anyway, just because
it's an example that's simple to start with.

110
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,169
So we start out with nitrogen getting reduced.

111
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:44,658
We have N2 with an oxidation state of zero becoming NH3 with an oxidation state of negative three.

112
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,639
First we balance the number of nitrogens,

113
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,120
then add the number of electrons that we need to have to have there be the same number of electrons on each side.

114
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,239
Do the same with the oxidation half of the
reaction

115
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:56,798
and then combine them to get your whole reaction
with the electrons cancelling out.

116
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,120
Now yes, maybe that seems like an unnecessary
step,

117
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,600
but allow me to show you a more complicated
example that will prove how necessary it may be.

118
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,340
In this flask, is silver diamine.

119
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:11,699
We're going to use some redox chemistry to get the elemental silver out of it nice and clean and shiny,

120
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,369
and it's not gonna be no simple Haber process.

121
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:19,351
The silver diamine is going to react with an organic
aldehyde. Any aldehyde actually.

122
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,809
The business end of the aldehyde is the CHO

123
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,869
and the R in organic chemistry is a symbol
for some organic group of atoms

124
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:28,240
and in this reaction those atoms don't matter.

125
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,639
Silver diamine reacts with the aldehyde and hydroxide to create a carboxylic acid, ammonia, and water.

126
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,278
First, let's assign ourselves some oxidation
states.

127
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:42,240
The silver is in a complex with two neutral ammonias that are going to remain unreacted throughout the equation,

128
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,419
so we can treat them like a single species
with an oxidation state of zero.

129
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:50,759
Since the silver diamine has a charge of plus
one and the ammonias don't affect that,

130
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,740
silver's oxidation state must also be plus
one.

131
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,139
The aldehyde has one hydrogen at plus one
and one oxygen at minus two

132
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,349
but is neutral overall so the carbon must
be plus one as well.

133
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:04,259
The hydroxide ion is simple:

134
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,960
minus two for the oxygen plus one for the hydrogen and an overall charge and oxidation state of minus one.

135
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,399
On the reactant side, the silver is now atomic,
so its oxidation state is zero.

136
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,659
The carboxylic acid has two oxygens and one hydrogen so the carbon now has an oxidation state of plus three.

137
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:25,980
NH3 remains at zero and the hydrogen and oxygen
of water also haven't changed oxidation states.

138
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,399
So silver's oxidation state decreased, or
was reduced, from plus one to zero,

139
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,379
while carbon was oxidized from plus one to
plus three.

140
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,899
Half-reaction time!

141
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,939
Silver was reduced, gaining one electron, forming elemental silver and ammonia from silver diamine.

142
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,360
The aldehyde was oxidized, forming carboxylic
acids and requiring two electrons.

143
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,919
With the help of those electrons,

144
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,120
we know that at the very least we have to double the reduction half of the equation entirely

145
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,929
in order to get the right number of electrons
on both sides.

146
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:55,969
We do that and oh god, that's Good Stuff!

147
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,720
Then we combine them together, for a perfectly
balanced redox equation.

148
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,790
And now, watch me take those electrons and
turn them into money.

149
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:08,208
And there you have it folks. That is pure
silver coating the inside of a flask.

150
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,609
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

151
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,990
If you were paying attention, you'd learn
that:

152
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,149
any reaction where electrons move around from
atom to atom is a redox reaction,

153
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,568
that oxidation is the loss of electron and
reduction is the gain of electrons,

154
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:25,719
and that oxidation numbers are assigned to
atoms to take part in reactions

155
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,250
in order to keep track of what their electrons
are up to.

156
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,500
You'd also learn a few simple tricks to help figure out what an atom's oxidation state is

157
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,340
and got a little practice figuring out how to assign oxidation states and balance oxidation reactions,

158
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,740
with two examples: one pretty simple and another
a little less so.

159
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,139
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Kim Krieger and myself,

160
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:48,938
our script editor was Blake de Pastino, our
chemistry consultant is Dr. Heiko Langner,

161
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,780
and a troop of chemistry teachers also advised and edited this one, so thanks very much to all of them.

162
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,100
This episode was filmed, edited and directed
by Nicholas Jenkins,

163
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,860
our sound designer and script supervisor is
Michael Aranda,

164
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,980
and our graphics team is Thought Cafe.
