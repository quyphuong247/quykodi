00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
We've talked up carbon quite a bit here on
Crash Course Chemistry,

2
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:05,519
but we really haven't justified the lofty
position I put it in.

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:12,039
Just chains so far and while chains are good, they're not enough reason on their own for this high level of esteem.

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,939
But carbon atoms, they do more than just form
chains.

5
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,579
Sometimes, they form rings, or as chemists
call them: cyclic structures,

6
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:24,199
and if the rings have the right number and placement of double bonds they start acting weird and wonderful.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,900
The compounds made from them are called aromatic,

8
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,659
literally because they have aromas, they can
smell amazing.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,479
Basil, vanilla, cloves, tarragon, lemon, cinnamon.

10
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,218
When we smell these things, it's because aromatic
compounds, compounds with carbon rings,

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,439
are binding to receptors in our noses that
tell our brains "OMG tasty stuff nearby".

12
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,679
Of course, moth-balls and modelling glue and lots of other stuff are also aromatic and don't smell so good...

13
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,719
But if you've ever smelled an herb, taken
medicine, worn clothes or enjoyed a meal,

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,640
you probably owe that experience, at least
in part, to aromatic hydrocarbons.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,960
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,379
But before we talk about aromatics, let's talk about the most basic cyclic structures, the cycloalkanes.

17
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,000
You recognize the -alkane ending there, so
there must be no double bonds, right?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,420
And you can't make a ring with one or two carbons, so the simplest cyclic hydrocarbon must be cyclopropane.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,960
But those tight bond angles of that triangular
cyclopropane make it very fragile.

20
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,439
This instability makes it highly reactive and it would much rather just be a straight chain.

21
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,640
But as more carbons join into the ring cyclic
structures get more stable.

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,459
Cyclobutane with its four carbon atoms is
still fairly unstable and reactive,

23
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,468
while in cyclopentane the bonds are even more
stable

24
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:42,739
because they form something close to those
tetrahedral bond angles,

25
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:47,859
while the angles in cyclohexane are basically perfect for the tetrahedral orbitals to overlap without strain.

26
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,719
Cycloalkenes also start at three carbons and
get increasingly stable as more are added,

27
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:55,998
though their double bonds make their molecules
plainer instead of tetrahedral.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Finally, cycloalkynes do exist, but they are crazy hard to form because the triple bond is linear,

29
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:07,449
so it hates bending into rings, and that is
why the simplest cycloalkyne has eight carbons.

30
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,629
Of course these rings can have all sorts of
things stringing off of them

31
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:14,349
and their names work almost exactly the same
way as straight chains do.

32
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:19,579
Example: This ring has five carbon atoms and
a double bond, so it's a cyclopentene.

33
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,190
It has two branches, an ethyl group and a
methyl group.

34
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:24,419
We list these in alphabetical order in the
name.

35
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:29,599
And we number the carbons in the ring so we get the lowest possible numbers on the branches and on the double bond.

36
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,019
If we number counterclockwise from the beginning of the double bond, we get the branches at the 2 and 5 positions,

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,159
but if we number clockwise from the double
bond the branches are at the 1 and 3 positions.

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,799
So, this must be 1-Ethyl-3-methylcyclopent-1-ene.

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,460
But since it's only one double bond and it's
in the first position,

40
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,229
the second one is often left out as being
understood.

41
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:52,149
So we simply call it 1-Ethyl-3-methylcyclopentene.

42
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,099
Incidentally all of the identifying parts
of an organic molecule,

43
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,489
the double and triple bonds, the carbon chains
that branch off the main chain,

44
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,330
those are called substituents because they
substitute for hydrogen atoms.

45
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,080
So far we've just been looking at the cyclic
hydrocarbons, so what's up with the aromatics?

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,800
How are they different?

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,020
Well this is one of the times when carbon
starts doing some of its spectacular dances.

48
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,360
Cyclic hydrocarbons that contain resonant
structures.

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,020
Things are getting interesting, and by interesting,
I mean--what?

50
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,159
Resonance occurs when electrons are distributed
around the molecule

51
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:25,189
in a way that makes it impossible to draw
with a single Lewis structure.

52
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:29,629
It's a limitation of our tools to represent
this beauty and complexity of reality.

53
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,949
In a resonance structure, the real world structure
of a molecule is essentially

54
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,659
an average of all the possible structures
that we can draw.

55
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,879
The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon (and one
of the most common) is benzene (C6H6).

56
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,519
It's the pungent compound that gives gasoline
its strong sweet smell.

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,350
It contains 3 double bonds, so that each carbon
has a total of 4 bonds.

58
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:53,460
We normally write this and other organic structures without the hydrogens in order to simplify things,

59
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,960
and we often don't even write the c's for
the carbons.

60
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,820
Every corner is assumed to be a carbon atom,
and since we know carbon needs four bonds,

61
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,539
it's easy to figure out where the hydrogens
belong even when they are not written.

62
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:03,620
Here's the thing though.

63
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:10,500
Those double bonds could just as easily be in these positions and they are in those positions -- sort of.

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,659
Remember there are two types of bonds in double
bonds.

65
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,959
There's those sigma bonds that happen linearly,

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,740
and then there's those p-orbitals that stick
up above and below the plane of the molecule.

67
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,079
Those p-orbitals in an aromatic compound all
merge together in a ring

68
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,139
that stretches above and below the whole molecule.

69
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,759
It's a distribution of electrons that's like a donut on top of and below a molecule-it's extremely stable.

70
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,099
Overall, the bonds are in both places so the
actual structure is essentially an average

71
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,280
of the two draw-able Lewis structures.

72
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,339
That's resonance, it's reality poking us in
the nose and saying,

73
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:44,099
"oh you thought you were so clever with your Lewis structures, but in this situation, they are useless."

74
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,439
To show that the double bonds aren't in any specific place, we often just show the structure with a circle in the middle

75
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,600
signifying that the double bonds are averaged
in a ring throughout the benzene group.

76
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,170
Technically the number of bonds between each
pair of carbons is defined as 1.5.

77
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,569
It's not a double bond, it's a one-and-a-half
bond.

78
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,000
Now aromatics can have all sorts of substituents
as well,

79
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:05,789
and the naming system is pretty much the same
as with other cyclics.

80
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,629
Another example: So this is a benzene with
two methyl groups on it.

81
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:12,040
As always, we number the rings so that the
branches have the smallest possible numbers.

82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,410
In this case, if one of the methyl is in the
1 position, the other is in position 2.

83
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,010
Note that the numbering can also be done like
this,

84
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,980
but it doesn't matter as long as the branches
are at the lowest possible numbers.

85
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,800
That makes this molecule 1, 2-dimethylbenzene.

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,840
Now if you swap the methyls out for a couple
of other slightly more complicated groups,

87
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,519
then you get acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin.

88
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,500
Aromatic rings can be used the other way around
too, as substituents on dihydrocarbons.

89
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:39,789
Consider this molecule, a hexane with a benzene
ring attached to carbon number 2.

90
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:45,430
When benzene is used as an attachment, we
call it a phenyl group, so this is 2-phenylhexane.

91
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,490
Or 2-phenylhexane. [Different pronunciation]
It doesn't matter.

92
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,069
What's important is that it is not a benzyl
group. Why?

93
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:57,019
Well, it was English genius Michael Faraday who first isolated benzene in 1825 from the gas used in lamps.

94
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:03,699
In honor of this, his French contemporary chemist Auguste Laurent started calling the derivatives of benzene "phene,"

95
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,659
from the Greek "I illiminate." It's a lovely
gesture, very sweet, but, like, seriously?

96
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,540
But just to make sure you're, like, good and
solidly confused, benzyl groups do exist.

97
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,120
They're a phenyl group joined by a methyl
group instead of just directly.

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,009
So now that we know where the word "phenyl"
comes from,

99
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,469
I bet you're just salivating with curiosity, wanting to know where "benzene" comes from, because,

100
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,580
like, your desire to know things is stronger
than any of your other desires, right?

101
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,379
Yeah, I thought so.
So here's how it happened.

102
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:33,620
Back in the 1400s when the spice trade drove
the majority of the global economy,

103
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,230
Arabic traders sold European traders a resin
used in perfumes and medicine that they called

104
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,340
"luban jawi" or "incense of Java."

105
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,359
Of course, it didn't come from Java, it came
from Sumatra,

106
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,060
but the world was a big and complicated place so we can't really blame them for being a little bit confused.

107
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,300
The "lu" was mistaken by the Italians for the definite article "la", and so it was dropped, making it "banjawa,"

108
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,040
and then the French called it "banjoin," and eventually the German and English made it "benzoin."

109
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,790
This is also, by the way, the same root as
the name Bon Jovi (it's not...).

110
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,720
When we started doing some chemistry, we found
that most of benzoin was composed of an acid,

111
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,370
which chemists named benzoic acid, or acid
of benzoin.

112
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,560
Then, a little chemistry knocked the acid off, creating what was clearly an alkene, so they named it benzene,

113
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,899
because it was an alkene that was from the
benzoin resin.

114
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,109
History is hiding everywhere!
And so is chemistry.

115
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,199
Now benzoic acid is one of literally infinite
possible benzene-based compounds.

116
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,389
There's naphthalene, the main ingredient in
mothballs.

117
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,490
It's basically two benzene rings stuck together.

118
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,180
And there's anthracene, with three benzenes, which is probably the dye that's making your blue jeans blue.

119
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,040
And it can get crazy complicated all the way
up to humic acid, a component of soil.

120
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,420
Now you might be wondering how something so complicated as that could ever even come into being.

121
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,860
Like any organic compound, aromatics can undergo tons of reactions that produce all sorts of molecules.

122
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,439
By far the simplest and most common are substitution reactions in which one substituent is substituted for another.

123
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,420
Like one of the hydrogen atoms on a benzene
might be changed to a propyl group,

124
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,740
or that a halogen might come in and replace
that propyl group with a bromine.

125
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,579
These changes alter the compound, of course, but it may not be that major a change, like changing your shoes.

126
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,579
(Unless you put on some really weird shoes.)

127
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:16,039
Another fairly common reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons is coupling, the joining of two aromatic structures,

128
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,110
and it basically works the same as a substitution
reaction.

129
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,449
The only difference is that the new substituent
is a another aromatic structure

130
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,490
and it typically requires some kind of catalyst.

131
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,668
A final common reaction of aromatics is hydrogenation,
which we talked about a little last week,

132
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:30,990
the addition of hydrogen atoms to remove double
bonds.

133
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,278
Now of course getting rid of even a single double bond in a phenyl group always destroys the resonance,

134
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,729
and thus it is no longer an aromatic compound
after hydrogenation.

135
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,459
Now obviously we haven't covered all the possibilities
here,

136
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,540
but you can already see that organic molecules have the potential to become extremely large and complex,

137
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:51,579
integrating straight chains, cyclic structures,
and aromatic groups in the same molecule.

138
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,040
This literally infinite variety is what makes organic compounds the basis for the infinite variety of life on Earth.

139
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:03,819
So we'll leave you to jeans and basil pesto and aspirin now to appreciate them on a whole new level

140
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,460
that simply was not possible just ten minutes ago.

141
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,920
Meanwhile, thank you for watching this episode
of Crash Course Chemistry.

142
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,539
If you paid attention, you learned about the
structure of cyclic organic compounds

143
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,740
and how to name them and their substituents.

144
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,799
You also learned what an aromatic compound
is, what resonance is,

145
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,508
and how to name aromatics and their substituents.

146
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:25,818
And finally, you learned a few common reactions
and uses for aromatic compounds.

147
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,899
