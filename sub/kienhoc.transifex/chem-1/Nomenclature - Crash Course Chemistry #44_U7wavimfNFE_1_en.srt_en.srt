1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
There are some of you out there, taking chemistry,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:07,839
and feeling a little bit like there's an international body whose job is simply to make your life more difficult,

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,019
to force you to cram tons of information into
your head,

4
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:14,849
to suck all the wonder and excitement out
of learning about how the world works

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,429
at this beautiful, fundamental level of chemicals.

6
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,929
You are not actually imagining this.
That organization actually exists.

7
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:25,618
It's called the International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemists or IUPAC,

8
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:28,050
and really, they’re looking out for your
best interests,

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,560
in just the same way that my mom was looking
out for my best interests

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,390
when she said that I couldn’t go to the
“Violent Femmes” concert with Megan Cross.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,679
And yeah, I hated my mom for, like, a full year after that but she was right, that girl was trouble.

12
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,100
So yes, you are allowed to hate IUPAC for
changing the name of ‘cinnamaldehyde’,

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,560
the aldehyde that makes cinnamon smell like
cinnamon to ‘trans-3-phenylprop-2-enal’.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,480
Yes, they’re sucking all the fun out of the world, but trust me when I say, they’re doing it for your own good.

15
00:00:53,479 --> 00:01:03,119
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,179
‘Cinnamaldehyde’ is a lovely name for
a lovely aldehyde,

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,640
just like ‘cadaverine’ is a creative name
for a rancid-smelling amine.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,780
‘Citronellol’, ‘angelic acid’, ‘vanillin’,
they’re beautiful names,

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,900
but there are tens of thousands of regularly
used organic compounds,

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,859
and we can’t come up with pretty names for
all of them.

21
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,730
More important than that, though, there’s
no way to

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,070
translate those names into chemical formulas
and IUPAC hates that.

23
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,729
They’re like, “Cinnamaldehyde, yeah, sure,
gives cinnamon its lovely smell,

24
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,380
but we think ‘trans-3-phenylprop-2-enal’
is way better of a name!”

25
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:38,989
And it actually is, because if I say ’trans-3-phenylprop-2-enal’
to somebody properly educated,

26
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:41,789
they can just write down the chemical structure
without even thinking about it.

27
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,400
And that’s, like, almost a kind of magic, where words go from relating to reality as we experience it

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,210
(this chemical comes from cinnamon so name
it after cinnamon)

29
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:54,579
to relating to the actual physical reality of the universe, and that’s a magic worth knowing.

30
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:58,879
IUPAC created a language that could be understood
by everyone with minimal,

31
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,000
even zero misinterpretation and that’s no
easy feat.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,260
That’s why, as we’ve discussed organic
chemistry,

33
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:07,979
when we start counting carbons, we make sure
that the first thing named on the molecule

34
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,920
is the lowest possible carbon,

35
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,099
not because there’s something special about lower numbers but because they had to make a rule,

36
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,579
otherwise one chemical could be named two
different ways.

37
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,830
Let’s go through the process of naming a
chemical, it’s a multi-step process.

38
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,820
Step 1: how long is the carbon chain?

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,160
Five carbons will have ‘pent-’, seven
‘sept-’, three ‘prop-’, one ‘meth-’

40
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,689
Don’t feel weird if you have to look these
up.

41
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:34,009
I, for example, had no idea that a twenty-three
carbon atom chain had the prefix ‘tricosa-’,

42
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:35,479
until I looked it up just now.

43
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,859
The only tricky thing here is to make sure
you find the longest carbon chain.

44
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,920
Sometimes, a hexane can look like a pentane
with an ethane sticking off of it.

45
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,780
So now that you know your longest carbon chain, you’ve got your prefix, time to figure out the suffix.

46
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,879
If there’s nothing but hydrogen and carbon,

47
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,599
your suffix just depends on whether you have
any double bonds or triple bonds;

48
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,259
you know these, propane, propene, propyne.

49
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,319
Then there are a ton of other groups that
can change the suffix.

50
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,759
Like last week we talked about alcohols and
aldehydes and ketones,

51
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,500
but we didn’t talk about how they affect
nomenclature and boy do they.

52
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,240
When working with functional groups, each one adds a particular suffix to the end of the name of a compound.

53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,840
Usually, these are pretty easy to remember because they come straight off the name of the functional group.

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,560
Alcohols add an ‘-ol’, so for methane
you drop the ‘e’ and you get methanol;

55
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,840
ethane, you get ethanol.

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,860
Aldehydes, instead of ‘-ol’ you add ‘-al’,
so from ethane you get ethanal.

57
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,260
Ketones, add '-one', so a ketone of a hexane
would be hexanone,

58
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,349
and amines, you just add '-amine' to the end
so methenamine or propanamine. Super easy.

59
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:36,568
For caboxylic acids, you have to identify
it's an acid, so you end in acid, that's obvious,

60
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:38,419
but instead of adding '-ylic' you add '-oic'.

61
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:42,879
As far as I can tell, this is just because ethanoic acid is much more fun to say than ethanylic acid.

62
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,709
Going over that again: alcohol, on an ethane,
is ethanol, aldehydes add '-al' giving ethanal,

63
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,800
ketones add '-one' pronounced 'eth/an/own',
amines, add amine for ethanamine,

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,450
and carboxylic acid, on an ethane, is ethanoic
acid.

65
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:01,929
And of course, there are literally dozens of other named functional groups that will change the suffix.

66
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,650
It's terrible, that's why they're on Wikipedia.

67
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,520
So if you got a functional group, there's
a name that defines the suffix of the molecule,

68
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,129
and that is called the parent functional group.

69
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,879
Now it is perfectly possible that a molecule
will have two different functional groups,

70
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,399
so how do we know which one is the parent?
Which one defines the suffix?

71
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,750
Well, different groups have different precedence.

72
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,870
The most weighted of all is the carboxylic
acid functional group,

73
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,639
so no matter what else is on a six carbon chain, if there's a carboxylic acid, then it's a hexanoic acid.

74
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,860
That precedence is decided by a list that
was, you guessed it,

75
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,960
created by IUPAC to minimize confusion by
creating yet more rules.

76
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,638
The list is linked in the description.

77
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,079
OK, so now we have created our base name for
the molecule;

78
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,680
it's time to start looking at what else is
attached to it.

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,699
Any side chains or functional groups sticking
off the side have to be identified and named.

80
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,599
If it's a six carbon chain with a carboxylic acid on it and an alcohol on one of the other carbons,

81
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,080
our name has to do two things: identify that the hydroxyl group is there and identify where it is.

82
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,479
If it's got a double bond, we likewise have to identify that it is there and where it is, all with our words.

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,020
Use your words! Also, use your numbers.

84
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,219
Counting out carbons can be a little confusing
but try it both ways, in both directions,

85
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,300
to make sure that you get the lowest possible
number on the group that defines your suffix.

86
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,220
All right, enough of the talking, let's try
to do some actual examples here.

87
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,920
I mentioned earlier angelic acid.

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,340
It's not actually particularly angelic, it was just named after a flower it was derived from.

89
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,279
But it's actually found all over the place
in nature,

90
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,230
so 'angelic acid' tells us pretty much nothing
about the molecule, except that it's acidic.

91
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,330
So in order to figure out the structure I
have to look it up.

92
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:38,060
That's no fun, but here it is.
Let's figure out a better name for it.

93
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,720
Count up the carbons, 1-2-3 if you count that chain, 1-2-3-4 if you count this one so it's a butane derivative.

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,080
Actually it's a butene derivative because
it has that double bond.

95
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,319
It's also got the carboxylic acid though,
so let's go ahead and call it butenoic acid.

96
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,579
Except that there's a methyl group sticking
off so it's methylbutanoic acid.

97
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,779
Of course, with that name, without any numbers, no one has any idea where anything is on the chain,

98
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,319
so, time to number.

99
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:10,870
From this direction, 1-2-3-4
we get 3-methylbut-2-en-4-oic acid,
which is obviously wrong.

100
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,980
Mostly because that parent functional group, the one that defines the suffix, is supposed to be as low as possible

101
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,240
and in fact it is as high as possible, so
that can't be right.

102
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,780
Also it just sounds terrible.

103
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,439
Numbering the other way, 1-2-3-4, the carboxylic
acid is on carbon 1 (that's pretty ideal).

104
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,029
The double bond and the methyl group are both
on the second carbon, much better,

105
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,089
and thus it is named 2-methylbut-2-enoic acid.

106
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:35,359
Two important notes here, if the parent functional group is on carbon one we just leave the number off.

107
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,480
And two, there's a double bond in this molecule and we haven't identified whether it's cis or trans,

108
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,590
and we can't do that so we haven't actually
completely named it.

109
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:46,609
We should stick a cis in front of the name because the carbon chain continues on the same side,

110
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,439
not the opposite side as it would be in the
trans form.

111
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,550
Of course, it works both ways, that's the
beauty of it,

112
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,569
you can build a name from a molecule and a
molecule from a name.

113
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:59,370
Earlier, I told you that cinnamaldehyde was
trans 3-phenylprop-2-enal.

114
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,360
Can you build it? Well, start with the three carbon chain, because of that prop, and count out the carbons, 1-2-3.

115
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,780
We know, because it's prop-2-enal with that
'e'

116
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:11,899
there's a double bond from the second to third
carbon and we know it's trans.

117
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,049
We also know that there's a phenyl group on
the third carbon.

118
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,310
The word ends in a non-numbered '-al', so finally we can stick an aldehyde on carbon number one,

119
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,280
and yeah, that was actually pretty easy!

120
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,069
Now look, IUPAC does it's best but past a
certain point of complexity,

121
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:32,099
no one expects anyone to know all this by heart unless you work for them and name compounds for a living.

122
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,220
That's why we have the internet and textbooks
and libraries to go look things up.

123
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,020
Because I'm a dork, I actually find these things to be kinda delightful puzzles and they're often super fun for me,

124
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:44,659
but taken one or two steps beyond the level
of complexity we have here,

125
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,320
my personal viewpoint is that you're better off looking it up than memorizing the novel-sized list of

126
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,379
functional groups, names, precedence lists,
prefixes and suffixes.

127
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:59,779
As long as you can recognize why trans 3-phenylprop-2-enal
is in fact a superior name to cinnamaldehyde,

128
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,459
and no, I am not going to do the cinnamon
challenge. Ever.

129
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,719
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry,

130
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,490
if you were paying attention you learned that
IUPAC is

131
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,030
the international organization responsible
for your unhappiness,

132
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,879
and that their goal is to create a system
where

133
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,409
every organic compound has one and only one
name to prevent confusion.

134
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,250
They do this by giving prefixes to compounds
for the number of carbons in a chain,

135
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,629
suffixes based on parent functional groups, and ranking functional groups somewhat arbitrarily for precedence.

136
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:28,889
You also learned that you have to number your
carbon chains,

137
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,788
so that your parent functional group has the
lowest possible number,

138
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:35,549
and that double bonds require you to label
the molecule as either cis or trans,

139
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,549
and hopefully, you learned that this is a
kind of word magic worth learning.
