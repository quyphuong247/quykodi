1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
We spend a lot of time thinking about atoms
as looking like this.

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:07,640
There's a ball and there's a stick, and there's
another ball and another stick.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,018
It's just a bunch of balls stuck together
by these little wooden bonds. Simple.

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,899
Pretty easy to understand, and thus — as you have probably come to expect — it is entirely incorrect.

5
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,619
Nuclei really can be understood as little
balls, and that's more or less correct,

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,539
though when you get to some of the bigger, less stable ones they start looking more oblong and weird like a rugby ball.

7
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,320
Atoms are basically ball-like as well, with electrons and a spherical cloud around the nucleus.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,820
But molecules, as we discussed last time,
do not look like balls on sticks.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,980
Bonds don't form into neat little lines.

10
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:45,339
They form from overlapping electron clouds or shells, flowing around the nuclei of bonded atoms.

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,300
If you really get down there and
understand what they look like,

12
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:52,140
they're like lumpy, clumpy globs of probable
electron locations.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,380
And these lumpy, clumps of probable electron locations do not behave the way you might initially expect them to behave.

14
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,059
Oh no. That would be far too simple.

15
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:05,179
They behave based on quantum mechanical, 3-dimensional
wave functions,

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,860
probabilistic distributions of electrons in
space.

17
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,719
And yeah, by the end of this episode, you're going to understand what I just said and it's gonna be awesome!

18
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:23,459
[Theme Music]

19
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,639
Let's start with water, because all the interesting
things on our planet start with water.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,120
It's also universally common, not just on
our planet but in our galaxy and our universe.

21
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:36,399
Case in point: In 2011, astronomers discovered
a cloud of water-ice surrounding a black hole

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,340
that contains 140 trillion times more water
than we have here on Earth.

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,939
And while we don't have any confirmed worlds
covered in water outside of our solar system,

24
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:49,219
we do have some right here in our solar system.

25
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:54,769
Europa contains so much water, probably salt
water, that its entire surface is just ice.

26
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,719
What did any of that have to do with atomic
orbitals? Nothing.

27
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,060
I just felt like maybe I scared you with all
that quantum mechanics talk before the intro

28
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,269
and I wanted to chill you out for a second.

29
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:06,219
Okay, so water. We did its Lewis structure
last week, remember?

30
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,080
Each hydrogen bonding to the oxygen atom,
and voilà!

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,450
But that drawing is linear, just a straight
line through all the nuclei,

32
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:18,280
and we know, just instinctually at this point,
that water is a bent molecule.

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,800
But why?
Why is water crooked?

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,700
Unbonded atoms within a molecule generally like to be as far away from each other as possible,

35
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:31,439
especially if they have the same partial charge
as the 2 hydrogens do with their partial positives.

36
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,280
But something is keeping those hydrogens closer
together than they would like to be.

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,759
So why on earth are they not stretched out
as far away from each other as possible?

38
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,098
I ask this because if they were, the water
molecule wouldn't be polar,

39
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:50,079
and if water was suddenly non-polar we would
all instantly die, as would all life on Earth.

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,120
And suddenly, we realize that this seemingly normal thing that we knew about the world is really weird.

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,759
And weird stuff is my favorite stuff because
it means interesting questions.

42
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,000
Interesting questions I want to know the answer
to.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,280
It's an even more compelling question than,

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,780
"What the heck is a quantum mechanical 3-dimensional
wave function?"

45
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,039
Well, of course, the answer to this question
has a great deal to do with

46
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,639
quantum mechanical 3-dimensional wave functions,
so let's start there.

47
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,619
Oh, look!
I've got a telephone cord!

48
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,128
This is what old people used to use to get
their voices into wires

49
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:21,159
so they could be transmitted across the world
before cell phones,

50
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,318
but today it's pretty much only useful for
demonstrating electron fields.

51
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,488
Electrons are both particles and waves, which
is not an easy thing to imagine.

52
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,099
Very basically, you can think of them as an excitation of the electron field, which exists everywhere.

53
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,079
When energy is dumped into the electron field,
electrons exist inside a wave function.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,719
What's a wave function?

55
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:46,819
It's a mathematical function that describes the probability that an electron is in a certain place at any given moment.

56
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,939
So, this telephone cord is an electron field.

57
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:53,060
I dump some energy into it and we create what's
called a standing wave.

58
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,979
The wave function is the mathematical function
that describes it.

59
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,159
Electrons function the same way.

60
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:03,089
They exist as excitations in the electron
field around the nucleus in a standing wave.

61
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,259
The simplest of these wave functions is the
s orbital,

62
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:11,548
which can contain 2 electrons and is a spherical
pattern of standing waves around the nucleus.

63
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,200
This standing wave can have different numbers
of nodes,

64
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,079
allowing patterns to repeat themselves when
there are more electrons around the nucleus.

65
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,879
Every orbital can contain, and indeed is at
its lowest energy when it contains, 2 electrons.

66
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,009
Hydrogen has one electron in its s orbital.

67
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:31,139
Helium, an ultra-stable, very low-energy noble
gas, has 2.

68
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,168
It's happy cause it has its shell filled.

69
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:35,948
But, of course, there are other sorts of orbitals
as well.

70
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,489
After we fill the first and second s orbitals,
we move on to filling the p orbital.

71
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:45,579
Or rather, I should say p orbitals, because
we're talking about 3 dimensional space here,

72
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:49,188
so there can be one on the x axis, and one
on the y axis, and one on the z axis.

73
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,080
Each of those can contain 2 electrons for
a total of 8

74
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,248
with 2 in the s orbital and 6 in the 3 p orbitals.

75
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:58,619
And yes, those 8 electrons are the reason
for whole the octet rule thing.

76
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:02,469
Remember now, the periodic table is a map
of the orbitals as they fill.

77
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,618
Elements in the s block are filling their
s orbitals.

78
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:06,659
Elements in the p block are filling their
p's.

79
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,320
Same with the d's and the f's.

80
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,399
So, s orbitals, very simple, spherical, p orbitals a little bit weirder, d and f orbitals, so crazy.

81
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,918
Some of the f orbitals in particular have
just ridiculously cool geometries.

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,139
Lots of fancy math is involved in writing out these wave functions and understanding them.

83
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,680
So, with hydrogen, we've just got the one
s orbital.

84
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,019
It's a sphere.
Marvelously uncomplicated.

85
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:31,019
But, in the second shell, we have an s orbital
and 3 p orbitals.

86
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,938
The p orbitals, if they were all by themselves,
look like this.

87
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:39,040
But, when you actually stick them around an atom, the s and p orbitals start to interact with each other,

88
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,399
doing their best not to overlap and changing
each other.

89
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,278
The s and the p orbitals can merge into hybrid
sp orbitals.

90
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:52,179
Instead of being 2 different kinds of orbitals, they become 4 identical orbitals trying their best not to overlap.

91
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,759
This is called orbital hybridization.

92
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:59,569
When the s orbital hybridizes with all 3 p
orbitals it's called sp3 hybridization and

93
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,478
it forms a tetrahedral shape.

94
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:03,918
And this is that tetrahedral shape.

95
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,598
It's the easiest way for all the orbitals to form something like a sphere around the atom, but not interact too much.

96
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,329
I didn't do anything fancy to make these balloons
take this shape.

97
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,428
I just tied them together at the base.

98
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:18,418
They naturally formed this shape because they
can't overlap with each other.

99
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,420
And yes, this is exactly what's going on with
water.

100
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,800
In water, oxygen's 8 electrons are arranged
with 2 in each sp3 hybridized orbital.

101
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:29,050
2 of those electrons are from hydrogen.

102
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,429
6 are from oxygen, including 2 lone pairs.

103
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:36,468
Those lone pairs, even though they're not participating in any bonds, still have their orbitals.

104
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:39,618
And so water is locked into that tetrahedral
structure.

105
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,699
No matter which orbital you stick the hydrogen atoms to, you're stuck with an asymmetrical molecule.

106
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,699
That, along with the difference in electronegativities
of oxygen and hydrogen,

107
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,538
leads to the polarity of water and the existence
of life.

108
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,579
But s and p orbitals can hybridize in other
ways as well.

109
00:06:55,579 --> 00:07:00,628
How, for example, could you imagine sp3 orbitals
forming a double bond?

110
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,929
You can't have 2 orbitals mashing together
in the same space,

111
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:06,838
and sp3 orbitals are pretty much stuck in
their tetrahedral structure.

112
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:10,059
Well, if a molecule is going to be at its
lowest energy state by forming a double bond,

113
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,550
it has a nice simple solution.

114
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,619
It only hybridizes 2 p orbitals with the s
orbital, forming 3 sp2 hybridized orbitals

115
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:21,059
with an unhybridized p orbital sticking up
from the center.

116
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:24,619
Tie balloons together like that, and you get
what we call a trigonal plane.

117
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:30,629
Each sp2 orbital is 120° away from the other,
drawing a line straight through their centers,

118
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:32,679
and you get an equilateral triangle.

119
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,759
One of the 2 bonds in the double bond has sp2 orbitals merging together nicely in line with the nuclei.

120
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,058
This straightforward sort of bond is called
a sigma bond.

121
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,309
A second and weirder bond forms,

122
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:47,699
this one from the unhybridized p orbital sticking
out above and below the nucleus.

123
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,598
These atoms merge to form a pi bond.

124
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,399
That's your nice symmetrical double bond that
you see in molecules like ethylene.

125
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,560
And, yes, sp orbitals, where the s only hybridizes with one p orbital, are also all over the place.

126
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
These occur when an atom is either triple bonded to another atom or is double bonded to 2 atoms.

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,020
The sp orbital, the one that forms the sigma
bonds here, is linear.

128
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:13,579
There are just 2 of them, balloons, easy,
see? Straight line.

129
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:18,778
The trick is to have those 2 unhybridized
p orbitals that can engage in 2 pi bonds,

130
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:23,348
either to form a single triple bond or to
form 2 double bonds like in carbon dioxide.

131
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:27,759
Carbon dioxide's orbital structure is actually really cool, so let's take a look at it as an example.

132
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,738
The carbon is going to have 2 double bonds,

133
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:34,538
so it has to have 2 un-hybridized p orbitals
and one sp hybridized orbital.

134
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:36,299
The oxygens are going to have one double bond,

135
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,459
so they need to set up as sp2 hybridized with one un-hybridized p orbital, for the double bonding.

136
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,200
As they come together for the bond, the sigma
bonds will occur between the hybridized orbitals.

137
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,360
Very simple.

138
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,300
One oxygen will line up to form a pi bond with the vertically oriented p orbital from the carbon

139
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:53,629
and the other will line up with the horizontally
oriented one.

140
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:56,299
There you have it.
Bond, bond, bond, bond.

141
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:02,839
But, of course, as will always be the case in your unrelenting search for more knowledge, there is yet more to learn.

142
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,639
d and f orbitals can hybridize with sp hybridized
orbitals

143
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,159
and with each other, forming some gorgeously
peculiar geometries,

144
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:15,509
and when 2 d orbitals hybridize with sp3 orbitals,
you get d2sp3, an octahedral structure,

145
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:19,389
which those of you who play role playing games
will recognize as an 8-sided die.

146
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:21,899
These orbital configurations determine the
shape of molecules,

147
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:27,620
and the shape of molecules determines how they behave, what forms they take, what properties they have.

148
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:34,740
It's pretty dang amazing, really, that wave functions determining the probable locations of electrons keep water bent,

149
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,860
and thus polar, and thus able to dissolve
nutrients and form a stable home for ourselves

150
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,860
so that we can walk around as weird bags of
mostly water thinking about stuff,

151
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:50,039
making YouTube videos, trying to learn more about the world, or maybe just trying to pass a test.

152
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,360
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

153
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,240
If you were paying attention today, you learned that molecules are clumpy globs of probable electron locations

154
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,159
determined by wave functions that are a bit more complicated than waves on a telephone cord,

155
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,698
that water is an asymmetrical molecule because
of oxygen's sp3 hybridized orbitals forcing

156
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:10,120
the electrons into a tetrahedral structure,

157
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,060
and that s and p orbitals can also hybridize
other ways as sp2 or sp

158
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:20,799
and how those hybridizations allow for double and triple bonds using both sigma and pi bond types.

159
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,620
Finally, you learned that d orbitals can get
involved too,

160
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:27,438
allowing for hybridizations that form even
cooler 3-dimensional shapes.

161
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:31,500
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by me and edited by Blake de Pastino,

162
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,149
and our chemistry consultants are Dr. Heiko
Langner and Edi Gonzales.

163
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,679
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

164
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,239
Our sound designer is Michael Aranda, and
our graphics team is Thought Café.
