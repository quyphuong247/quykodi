1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,740
Aaah, the controlled flow of electrons, making
possible laptops and phones and cars and pacemakers.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,480
Batteries, just like everything else in life,
is just chemistry raised to the power of awesome.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,019
The kind of chemistry that happens inside
of a battery is called electrochemistry

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,130
because it involves reactions that produce
or consume free electrons.

5
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:25,839
Specifically, they are oxidation or redox
reactions, the ones where electrons are exchanged.

6
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,460
I've told you about redox reactions before
and if you haven't seen that episode yet,

7
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:32,000
you should probably go watch that before you
watch this.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,420
Don't worry, I will still be here when you
get back.

9
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:37,789
Now, when the flow of electrons in these kinds
of reactions are sent through a conductor,

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,000
like a piece of metal,
it can be used to do all sorts of work.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,890
Like, for example, this kind of work.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:51,640
The amount of work that can be done depends on how strong the push or pull on electrons is between the two reactants.

13
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:57,570
This is the reaction's electrical potential,
but to its friends, it's known simply as voltage.

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,320
Basically, if the voltage is high, each electron can do a lot more work than if the voltage is low.

15
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,260
Many of the wonderful things in our modern
lives are based on one simple premise:

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,280
putting a device between the two halves of
just such a reaction;

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,439
the half that donates electrons,
and the half that accepts them.

18
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,340
By harnessing that energy, a lot of the coolest
things you've done today,

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,600
up to and including watching this episode
of Crash Course Chemistry, has been made possible.

20
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:30,019
[Theme Music]

21
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:35,519
Part of what makes redox reactions so powerful,
and powerfully excellent, is that they are complicated.

22
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,579
Because in each reaction, there's at least
two things going on:

23
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,030
there's the part of the reaction where the
electrons are being released

24
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,239
and another part where they're being eagerly
demanded.

25
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,500
So when we deal with electrochemistry, we
usually think of reactions in terms of half reactions.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,719
Let's start with a typical redox reaction that happens in this alkaline battery as an example.

27
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,539
In here elemental zinc is going to react with
manganese dioxide, also known as manganese

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,220
four oxide, to produce manganese three oxide
and zinc oxide.

29
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,900
When you break this down in to half reactions,

30
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,750
first you have elemental zinc with an oxidation
number of 0 being oxidized to zinc 2 ion.

31
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,538
At the same time manganese 4 is being reduced
to manganese 3.

32
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,149
When we balance the half reactions,

33
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,010
we see that two electrons are released during
the oxidation of each zinc atom,

34
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,090
and one electron is consumed by each manganese
4 atom.

35
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,789
The water and hydroxide ions, by the way,
come from a solution of potassium hydroxide.

36
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:25,810
Which is a basic, or alkaline compound.

37
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,900
Which is why we call these things alkaline
batteries.

38
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,879
Now if each of these half reactions occurred
in contact with the other one,

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,318
they'd just spontaneously go to equilibrium releasing energy as a bunch of heat which wouldn't be very helpful.

40
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,620
So batteries are designed to harness that energy by isolating the half reactions from each other.

41
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,780
This allows excess electrons to build up in
the negative terminal, called the cathode,

42
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,620
while an electron vacuum of sorts occurs in
the positive terminal, the anode.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,739
Electrons can then cross from one half reaction
to the other,

44
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,739
only when we connect the cathode and the anode
of the battery via conductors.

45
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:02,899
So the current can be used to do work.
Which I can do by licking this 9 volt battery.

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,840
Ahhh!
[laughs]

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,879
In these batteries, the zinc is in the center surrounded by a layer of cellulose that allows ions to pass through.

48
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,649
The manganese oxide is in the outer layer
that surrounds the zinc core,

49
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,250
but the cellulose barrier doesn't allow the
zinc and the manganese to mix.

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,319
Alkaline batteries are a type of galvanic
cell.

51
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,560
Which is generally defined as an apparatus that generates electrical energy from a redox reaction.

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,539
Here's another example of a galvanic cell,

53
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,870
one where the interesting part is the flow
of whole ions instead of the flow of electrons.

54
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,849
In this case, wires connect metal rods that
are suspended in the solution.

55
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,750
They're are the anode and cathode here.

56
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,210
What's noteworthy, is that the metal atoms
are actually consumed.

57
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:46,439
They're used up from the anode rod as they're
oxidized, and the metal slowly wears away.

58
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,280
Meanwhile, the opposite happens at the cathode rod, where metal ions from the solution gain electrons

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,900
and precipitate on to the cathode as pure
metal, gradually growing larger.

60
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,539
The circuit is completed by the wire, but
also by a salt bridge,

61
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,000
which is also a U-shaped tube that contains
a salt solution

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,489
that allows the metal ions to go from the
anode to the cathode.

63
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,799
So, now you know how batteries work: developing
and transferring a charge using electrochemistry.

64
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,548
But before any redox reaction can be used
to text your boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever,

65
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,218
we need to know how much voltage it can generate.

66
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,979
Fortunately all of those amazing chemists who have come before us have done a lot of the work once again.

67
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,560
The voltage generated by many half reactions is already known and can be found in most textbooks or online.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,280
And as I mentioned earlier, voltage is really just a way of expressing the electrical potential of each half reaction.

69
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,359
The difference between the chemical demand
for the electrons in one half,

70
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:41,629
versus the tendency to lose them in the other.

71
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:45,651
These measurements are done at standard conditions, which we discussed in the enthalpy and entropy episodes.

72
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,159
And by convention they are written as if the
substance is being reduced, not oxidized.

73
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:54,598
For this reason the value is known as the
standard reduction potential of a substance.

74
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,360
To see how reduction potentials work in half
reactions and combine in an overall reaction,

75
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:03,930
let's consider a galvanic cell where zinc
is oxidized and copper ions are reduced.

76
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,908
Keep in mind that potentials are determined
at standard state:

77
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:11,158
25 degrees Celsius and 1 molar solutions of
the copper and zinc ions.

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,700
Our cell needs to be set up under the same conditions or the voltage will be a bit different than expected.

79
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,019
The half reactions show more clearly what
the electrons are doing.

80
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,299
We can see that the zinc is oxidized and the
copper is reduced.

81
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,160
Now all standard reduction potentials are measured relative to the reduction of hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas,

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,800
which is set at zero, just as a baseline.

83
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,360
When copper is reduced, for example, it generates
0.34 volts more than hydrogen does,

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,199
so we say its standard reduction potential
is +0.34 volts.

85
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,778
The standard reduction potential for zinc
is -0.76 volts,

86
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:48,439
but because zinc is oxidized in this reaction,
we can't use the reduction potential directly.

87
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,360
Instead, as a general rule, when you convert
a reduction half reaction to oxidation,

88
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,669
the sign of the voltage is simply reversed.

89
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:58,368
So, the -0.76 volts for the reduction potential
of zinc

90
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:02,999
becomes +0.76 volts for the oxidation potential
of zinc ions.

91
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:07,289
And the electrical potential for the whole
reaction, called the standard cell potential,

92
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:10,818
is just the sum of the standard potentials
of both half reactions.

93
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,098
In this case, that would be 1.1 volts.

94
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,099
Now I gotta point out here that the electrical potential of a redox reaction is related to its equilibrium constant.

95
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,600
There's actually a way to determine the equilibrium constant from a measured voltage, and vice versa.

96
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Both of these constants have a lot to do with the energy the reaction can release, or its Gibbs free energy.

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,218
But in brief, the higher the voltage, the
more electrical energy can be produced.

98
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:39,340
So if the voltage is positive, it means that under standard state conditions, the reaction will spontaneously go forward.

99
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:42,339
If the sign is negative, the reaction will
proceed backward.

100
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:47,459
And it totally makes sense, when you think about it, that reactions like this are used to make battery cells.

101
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,348
The reactions in batteries need to be spontaneous

102
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:53,928
because their whole purpose is to release
energy, not consume it.

103
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:57,438
So what if we don't want to power a phone
or a laptop or a toy shuttle.

104
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,959
What if instead we want to plate an iron car
bumper with chrome?

105
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,959
This cannot be done with a spontaneous reaction.

106
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,318
Instead, a different electrochemical process is needed, one that you've probably heard of: electroplating.

107
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,498
This is done by immersing an object in a solution that contains an excess of ions of the coating metal.

108
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:20,050
A bar of the coating metal, in this case chromium,
is used as the anode,

109
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,939
and the item to be plated, the iron bumper,
acts as the cathode

110
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,679
When an electric current is applied, a redox
reaction occurs in the solution

111
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:30,918
and atoms of the coating metal are deposited
on the cathode.

112
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,649
This is essentially the opposite of a galvanic
cell, known as an electrolytic cell,

113
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:42,338
and it performs electrolysis, which uses electricity,
electro-, to do the breaking apart, -lysis.

114
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:47,759
In this case molecules in the solution are being broken down so that the metal atoms can be deposited on the surface.

115
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,778
Electrolysis is used for lots of other things too, like coating jewelry or flatware with gold or silver,

116
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:55,918
refining metals or separating mixtures of
metal ions.

117
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,859
Also, converting water into hydrogen gas and
oxygen.

118
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,968
So if you didn't already understand how much
impact chemistry has in our daily lives,

119
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:05,098
you certainly should be able to see it now.

120
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,338
Not only are all the materials around you
made of chemicals,

121
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:12,488
but even the electrical devices that power
our lives depend on the reactions of electrochemistry.

122
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:15,088
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

123
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:19,399
If you were listening, you learned that electrochemical
reactions are redox reactions

124
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,189
that we describe in terms of half reactions.

125
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:25,389
You learned how an alkaline battery works
and what's inside of it,

126
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,379
what a galvanic cell is and how it can be
set up

127
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,259
and how to calculate the voltage that can be generated by a half reaction, the standard reduction potential,

128
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:37,899
and by the overall reaction, the standard
cell potential.

129
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:41,240
You also learned how electrolysis and electroplating
work.
