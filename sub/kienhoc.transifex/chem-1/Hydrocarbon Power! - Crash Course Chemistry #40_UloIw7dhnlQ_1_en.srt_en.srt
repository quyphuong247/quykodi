1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,519
You've heard this before, but it bears repeating.
Carbon is the element of life.

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:08,499
So much so that when we explore other planets the first thing we look for is compounds that contain carbon.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,759
In fact, there was a time when we thought carbon compounds could only be produced by living things.

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,059
So early chemists called them, as we still
do today organic compounds.

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,919
Scientists back then considered biological
molecules to be almost mystical in origin.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,640
Until, 1828 when German chemist Friedrich WÃ¶hler discovered that urea, a component of urine,

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,280
could be synthesized simply by heating ammonium
cyanate, an inorganic compound.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,700
That proved biological molecules were just chemicals that could be created and manipulated in the lab.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,929
Suddenly a new branch of chemistry was born,
organic chemistry. It's like my favorite chemistry.

10
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:49,010
So what is it about carbon though, that makes
it so special? Well, a lot of things.

11
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:54,509
Like silicon, which we talked about a few weeks ago, carbon is in group 14 on the periodic table,

12
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,460
and like all of the elements in that group,
it has 4 valence electrons.

13
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:04,558
In carbon those 4 electrons can bond to other
atoms in a really promiscuous number of configurations

14
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,179
to form all kinds of structures.

15
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,930
Which is why carbon is to biology, which silicon
is to geology.

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,990
Just as silicon forms the basis, not only
for sand,

17
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:19,919
but also most of the rocks on earth, carbon
is the foundation of most biological molecules.

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,260
Really all biological molecules...right? Yup.

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:29,859
The simplest organic molecules are pure hydrocarbons
containing only carbon and hydrogen. Hydro-carbon.

20
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:33,688
They are where we're going to start our six
week exploration of organic chemistry.

21
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,588
And they're a good place to start, partly because they play by the most straight forward rules.

22
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:42,948
When all carbons in a pure hydrocarbon are bound to the maximum number of atoms, 4 atoms each,

23
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:48,500
so that there are no double or triple bonds anywhere; these compounds are considered to be full or saturated.

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,959
That means that all the carbons have 4 bonds, either with other carbon atoms or with hydrogen atoms,

25
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,459
in which case the hydrogens are bound to one
carbon.

26
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,188
No questions,
no exceptions.

27
00:01:57,188 --> 00:02:01,879
These are the simple rules that govern some of the world's most useful, or at least, used compounds.

28
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,879
The hydrocarbons that we use as diesel fuel,
gasoline, methane, propane.

29
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,299
You're gonna learn what these and other compounds
look like, what they're names mean,

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,200
and how they take part in the reactions that
fuel our lives.

31
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,619
Welcome to organic chemistry!

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:24,480
[Theme Music]

33
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,919
The fully saturated hydrocarbons I just described are usually called by the much simpler name, alkanes.

34
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,799
The simplest of the alkanes is one you've heard of before, methane, or CH4, the main compound in natural gas.

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,380
The next simplest alkane contains 2 carbons side by side, each one of them in bonded to 3 hydrogen atoms.

36
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:47,240
This is ethane, C2H6. Another gas, and it's
mostly used in the production of plastics.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,400
If we add another carbon and enough hydrogens
to fill all those spaces we get our next alkane:

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
propane, C3H8.

39
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,699
Also a gas at room temperature and normal
atmospheric pressure,

40
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:01,869
propane is a common fuel for cooking, heating,
and vehicles,

41
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,980
as well as a propellant for everything from
aerosol cans to paintball guns.

42
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:10,189
And we could do this all day, adding carbons
to the chain and giving each compound a name,

43
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,259
but that would be pretty boring.

44
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,759
Things get more interesting, though, with
the next alkane, butane, C4H10,

45
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,169
because there are two different forms of it.

46
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,789
The first is what you'd expect:

47
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:26,500
just a chain of carbons with hydrogens stuck wherever they're needed to make each carbon have 4 bonds.

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,180
This is called normal butane or n-butane.

49
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,700
But you can also arrange the 4 carbons differently
by making a chain of 3

50
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,299
and then branching the fourth one off the
center of the chain.

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,110
This is called isobutane or i-butane.

52
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,320
And even though it has the same chemical formula as n-butane, its structure gives it different properties.

53
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,780
For example, n-butane boils at -0.5 degrees Celsius while isobutane boils at -11.7 degrees Celsius.

54
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,979
These different structures for compounds that have the same molecular formula are called isomers.

55
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:58,799
As you add more and more carbon atoms to the molecule, there are more and more ways that you can arrange them.

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,939
So the number of atoms is butane only allows
for 2 isomers, n-butane and isobutane.

57
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:09,819
But pentane, C5H12, has 3 possible isomers
and C6H14, known as hexane, has 5.

58
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,729
Again, I could do this all day.

59
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:16,629
But looking at this table of the number of possible isomers you could see that that escalated quickly.

60
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:22,219
The take away here is that molecules that have the same mass and number of atoms can form different structures.

61
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,370
And as their structure changes, their properties
also change.

62
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,470
As a general rule, the larger and more complex alkanes are, the more densely their molecules can pack together,

63
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,380
which means that they tend to be liquid or
solid instead of gaseous at room temperature.

64
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:40,279
So alkanes with 5 to 18 chains of carbon atoms like octane and gasoline are liquids at room temperature

65
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,670
and those with more than 18 carbon atoms like
paraffin or other waxes are solids.

66
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,230
Now you're probably picking up on a lot of words that you've heard before, even outside of chemistry class:

67
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,379
octane, propane, methane, paraffin, and so
on.

68
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,810
You can chalk that up to the enormous popularity
of these compounds in our daily lives.

69
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,959
Like I said, hydrocarbons are super useful because of the types of reactions they can take part in,

70
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,739
which I will explain more in a bit.

71
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,730
But first, I think it's high time you know
what these names actually mean.

72
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,310
Much like the general language of chemistry
that we talked about months ago,

73
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,759
organic nomenclature has its own system of
prefixes, suffixes, and numbers

74
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,569
that tell you what's in the compound being
named.

75
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:21,120
Now you gotta know the prefixes because they
indicate how many carbon atoms are present.

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,519
Here's one that I know you've heard before:
meth.

77
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,339
Meth- in a name always indicates a molecule
or branch containing one carbon atom.

78
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,060
So the difference between amphetamines doctors
prescribe

79
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,339
and methamphetamines that are sold on the
streets is that

80
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,939
methamphetamine has a methyl group, CH3 with
one carbon,

81
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,180
where amphetamine just has a single hydrogen
atom.

82
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,800
Hopefully, that's helpful to you.
Don't do drugs.

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Eth- in a name means 2carbon atoms.

84
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,840
Prop- means 3.
But- means 4.

85
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,138
From there, most of the prefixes will be familiar
from geometry class

86
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,009
and you can review them in tables and learn
them.

87
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,849
I'm not gonna go through them all. There are
a few naming rules that are specific to alkanes.

88
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,840
First, alkanes are always named based on the longest possible continuous chain in their structure.

89
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,779
For example, even though this looks like a 5 carbon chain intersecting with a 6 carbon chain,

90
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:12,579
it actually contains an 8 carbon chain if
you look at it close enough.

91
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:16,879
So this is considered an octane with two carbon
chain attached to one of its carbon atoms.

92
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,300
When shorter carbon chains are attached to longer ones like this, they're still named using the same prefixes,

93
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,800
but we stuff a little -yl onto the end to
show that they're just attachments.

94
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,009
Since this attachment has two carbons, we
call it an ethyl group.

95
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,920
And the attachment with just one carbon that turns amphetamine into methamphetamine, that's the methyl group.

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,480
Attachments are also given a number to show
you where along the chain they're attached.

97
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,069
The long chain is always numbered carbon by
carbon

98
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,399
in the direction that gives the attachments
the lowest numbers possible.

99
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,729
So, if we number the chain the right way,
the ethyl group will end up at position 4.

100
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,550
But if you do it the wrong way, it's in position
5.

101
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,340
Low numbers win so it's numbered from left
to right in this case.

102
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:59,198
So when we put it all together, this compound
is called 4 ethyl octane.

103
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,980
Congratulations! You just named an organic
compound.

104
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,810
Now particularly astute and studious students
would have noticed something here.

105
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,250
Earlier, I introduced you to isobutane, a compound with four carbons that are not all in a chain.

106
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,899
They call that isobutane and it is an isomer
of butane,

107
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:19,060
but according to these all important rules of nomenclature, it's not actually any sort of butane at all.

108
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,439
The longest carbon chain is just 3 carbons long, so it's propane with one methyl group sticking off of it.

109
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,180
If we wanted to give a technical name for
it, isobutane would be 2-methylpropane.

110
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,100
Though, since the second carbon is the only place where the methyl group can go without the molecule,

111
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:39,140
once again becoming butane, properly proper
chemists just drop the two and call it methylpropane.

112
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,879
Now suppose you have more than one of the
same size group attached to the same chain,

113
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,060
like two methyl groups on the same alkane.

114
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,660
In this case, you put a number for both of
them

115
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,650
and then prefixes like di- and tri- are used
to indicate multiple attachments.

116
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:57,299
So for instance, if an octane chain has methyl
groups attached with second and fifth carbons,

117
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,400
it's called 2,5-dimethyloctane.

118
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,000
On the other hand, if you have attachments
of different lengths,

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,439
you just name and number each one separately,
being sure to list them in alphabetical order.

120
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,129
The structure we just used had a methyl group
on it and an ethyl group on its fifth,

121
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,699
it would be 5-ethyl-2-methyloctane.

122
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,060
This is super useful for several reasons.

123
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,199
One, because there are trillions of ways that
organic compounds can come together.

124
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,300
But also because you can work backwards from
a name and build a structural formula from it.

125
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,840
Let's try that out.
We're gonna build 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylnonane.

126
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,799
Start with the main chain, nonane. The prefix
non- indicates 9 carbons.

127
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:43,479
Then, add an ethyl group, a 2 carbon chain on number 4 and then methyl groups, just 1 carbon on carbons 3 & 5.

128
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,519
Our final step is to add enough hydrogen atoms
to give every carbon atom 4 bonds.

129
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,929
And now, the molecule is complete.
It's like a puzzle that we got to make.

130
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:55,929
Of course these compounds don't exist in isolation.

131
00:08:55,929 --> 00:09:00,008
Like any other compound, they can undergo
a whole variety of reactions.

132
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:04,860
But there are 3 types of alkane reactions that are important enough for us to cover right now right here.

133
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,899
The first is the kind that made alkane the
most common fuel for combustion or burning.

134
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,980
You'll note here that I'm saying burning, a common misperception, even among chemistry students,

135
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,778
is that combustion somehow equals explosion.

136
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:20,629
While that would definitely make things more
interesting, also more dangerous,

137
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,629
those two things are not synonymous.

138
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,240
Combustion is the type of reaction that powers
your car and your propane grill,

139
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:29,649
even candles among many other alkane fuels.

140
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:35,220
The general reaction for combustion requires a hydrocarbon, oxygen, and a source of heat energy.

141
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,460
In this example, we're using methane, but
it works the same for any pure hydrocarbon.

142
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,839
The only thing that changes is the coefficients.

143
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,600
The products of a complete combustion
of a pure hydrocarbon are always

144
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,990
carbon dioxide and water vapor,
just those two things.

145
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,339
The next major reaction that alkanes experience
is halogenation,

146
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,940
when halogen atoms like fluorine or chlorine are substituted for one or more hydrogen atoms in the alkane.

147
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:03,639
For example, the rather well-known compound
chloroform is more correctly called trichloromethane.

148
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,579
It's a molecule of methane that is reacted
with a chlorine gas,

149
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:10,118
resulting in three of the hydrogen atoms being
replaced with chlorine atoms.

150
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:14,290
The final reaction type is dehydrogenation,
and it, somewhat obviously,

151
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,419
is the removal of hydrogen atoms from alkanes.

152
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:21,049
For example, ethane can be dehydrogenated
by this reaction,

153
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:26,259
and as you can see, the result is that the carbon atoms are no longer saturated with hydrogen, thus,

154
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:31,340
requiring the formation of double or triple bonds to give the atoms the 4 bonds that they need.

155
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,440
Hydrocarbons that contain double or triple
bonds have

156
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,420
their own specific groups with different rules,
reactions, and properties than alkanes.

157
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:41,078
And those are the topic of next week's episode.

158
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:44,159
For now though, thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

159
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,000
If you were listening, you learned about some of the different classifications of organic compounds,

160
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,480
the structure and properties of the simplest
alkanes.

161
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,460
You also learned about isomers and why they're important, how to name an alkane based on its structure,

162
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,178
and how to build an alkane structure from
its name.

163
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:03,428
And finally, you learned a few important types
of chemical reactions that alkanes experience:

164
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:06,249
combustion, halogenation, and dehyrdogenation.

165
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,999
This episode was written by Edi Gonzalez,
it was edited by Blake de Pastino,

166
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,579
and our chemistry consultant is Dr. Heiko
Langner.

167
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,040
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas Jenkins. The script supervisor was Caitlin Hofmeister.

168
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,699
