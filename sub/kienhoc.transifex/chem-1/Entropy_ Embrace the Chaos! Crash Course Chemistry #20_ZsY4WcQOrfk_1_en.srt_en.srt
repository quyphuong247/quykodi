1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
Life is chaos.
The whole universe is chaos.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,718
Whether it's the terrible state of my office
or the slow degradation of my body into dust,

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,649
the universe tends toward disorder.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,219
But why, why is the universe structured in
this terrible and callous way?

5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:19,739
Well, it turns out that it's not really the
universe's fault.

6
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:25,839
If you think about it there's only one way, or at best, maybe a few ways for things to be arranged in an organized way.

7
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,219
But there are nearly infinite other ways for
those same things to be arranged.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,109
The simple rules of probability dictate that
it's much more likely for stuff,

9
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,469
whether it's the stuff on my desk or the particles
and energy that make up my concept of self,

10
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:43,229
to be in one of the many disorganized states
than in one of the few organized states.

11
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,409
It's simple math and it's unavoidable.

12
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:50,309
So unavoidable that it is in fact our Second
Law of Thermodynamics, which says that:

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:56,100
"Any spontaneous process increases the disorder
or randomness of the universe."

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,719
Processes that don't increase the disorder of the universe require work to be done in opposition to the disorder,

15
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,359
and are in fact often impossible to achieve.

16
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:09,670
The very act of putting one system in order
requires that other systems become disordered.

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,340
Think of it this way: Your lunch was composed
of an extremely ordered set of molecules.

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,478
And it gave you the energy to clean up your
house, maybe.

19
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:21,438
And it had to be broken down into less ordered
nutrient molecule for you to do that.

20
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,498
Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, and those
molecules were broken down even further as

21
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:28,408
they were converted to energy in your cells,

22
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,189
and your body used some of that energy to
power your muscles as you cleaned your house.

23
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:37,568
But a bunch of that energy was used to do things like keep your heart beating, and breathe, and make sweat,

24
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:42,439
and some of that was lost to the surroundings in the form of random movement, and most importantly, heat.

25
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,019
By the time you've finished your house may be orderly but the remains of your lunch molecules are all over the place.

26
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:52,429
And that's only one of the many systems that
became less orderly while you worked.

27
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:57,560
So yes, cleaning your house in fact increased
the overall disorder of the universe.

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,100
Next time someone gives you a hard time about the state of your house you can tell them that.

29
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:06,179
Obviously disorder is a pretty big deal in the universe, and that makes it a pretty big deal in chemistry.

30
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,200
So scientists have a special name for it:
entropy.

31
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,550
Entropy is a measure of molecular randomness,
or disorder.

32
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,060
And even though people complain about
the disorder in their lives, it's not all bad news.

33
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,500
Entropy helps make chemical reactions possible,

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,039
and it helps us predict how much useful work
can be extracted from a reaction.

35
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,109
We all have to live with disorder so you might
as well understand it.

36
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,310
For the next ten minutes I want you to embrace
the chaos.

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:39,330
[Theme Muusic]

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,840
So what does the Second Law of Thermodynamics
mean when it says:

39
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:46,669
"Any spontaneous process increases the disorder
of the universe."

40
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:51,139
"Spontaneous" simply means a process that
doesn't need outside energy to keep it going.

41
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:55,399
And it goes the other way too, anything that increases the disorder of the universe happens spontaneously.

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,200
That doesn't mean disorderly things will always
happen though, other factors may interfere.

43
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,730
The reaction to change a diamond into graphite,
for example, would be thermodynamically spontaneous.

44
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,299
It wouldn't have to be forced along by outside
energy,

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,100
but the bonds in the diamond are so stable
that essentially it never gets started.

46
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,519
Lots of other chemical reactions are like
this too.

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,700
So even though we think of "spontaneous" meaning sudden and impulsive, like the majority of mall lip piercings,

48
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,939
in chemistry "spontaneous" doesn't tell you
how quickly something happens,

49
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:27,800
it only means a reaction is thermodynamically capable of happening without outside energy to move it along.

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,420
Though come to think of it, I imagine that spontaneous lip piercings cause a fair amount of disorder as well,

51
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,189
especially upon arriving home.

52
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:35,680
Entropy is another state function.

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
It doesn't depend on the pathway the system
took to reach its current state.

54
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,559
So even though we can't measure the entropy of reactants or products directly, we can calculate them.

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,640
We can also calculate the change in entropy during a reaction exactly like we can for the change in enthalpy,

56
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,259
by subtracting the sum of the reactant values
from the sum of the product values.

57
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:56,340
In other words, the formulas look exactly
the same, just substituting "S"

58
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,219
(which for some reason is used to denote entropy)
for "Delta H F".

59
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,180
Notice we dropped the "Delta"s on the right
side of the formula

60
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,040
because we know absolute values for entropy
of individual reactants and products.

61
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,370
We keep the "Delta" on the left

62
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,490
because we're calculating the change in entropy that occurs when the reactants rearrange into products.

63
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,840
What the heck is this good for?

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,358
Well, we can explain a mysterious thing, which
is how reactions occur spontaneously in nature

65
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,990
even though there's no energy given off, or
even they suck energy out of the environment,

66
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,990
and seem to go up the energy ladder instead
of down.

67
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,060
Let's try it out with a real reaction here
on my desk -- this is one of my favorites.

68
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,949
This is barium hydroxide octahydrate and this
is ammonium chloride.

69
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:43,149
Usually we do chemical reactions in aqueous solution because most solids don't interact easily,

70
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,739
but this pair is exception to that rule; they
react readily in solid form.

71
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,978
This reaction absorbs a lot of heat from the surroundings, making everything around it feel cold.

72
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:55,740
Now to show you how cold it gets, I'm going
to do something here.

73
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,189
And you're just going to have to assume you
understand what I'm doing.

74
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:03,180
"What am I doing? What is happening? Why am
I doing this? That's weird Hank.

75
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,218
Why are you doing that?" And then I put that
on there.

76
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,800
So now I've dumped barium hydroxide in this beaker, I'm gonna dump the ammonium chloride in.

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,699
And now one of the by-products of this reaction is ammonia so I'm gonna have to smell that, but you don't.

78
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,188
Oooh ye-eah, look at that slush.

79
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:28,960
I think we've reacted pretty much completely here and so we should, if all things have gone properly --

80
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:37,379
yep, that's pretty cool --- sucked enough heat out of the block of wood to actually freeze it to the beaker.

81
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:44,180
Normally in chemistry a reaction that proceeds spontaneously and yet absorbs heat is really weird.

82
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,400
Basically I have a hard time believing what
I just did.

83
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:51,209
So what does entropy have to do with this
little freak show?

84
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:55,079
You might think it has something to do with taking the heat from the surroundings to make the system colder,

85
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,688
but while that's counter-intuitive and cool,
that's not all of it.

86
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:03,429
You might also think that it has to do with two solids combining to form a whole bunch more liquids and gases,

87
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,579
and that IS a big part, but still not all.

88
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,800
To understand what we just saw a little better,
we need to put it all together.

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,978
Let's start by finding out exactly how much heat it did absorb and what happened to the entropy as well.

90
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:20,490
First, we'll find the enthalpy change using
Hess's Law and standard enthalpies of formation.

91
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,300
We can use the coefficients from the balanced chemical equation to fill in the number of moles for each substance.

92
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,220
Then we have to look up a whole bunch of numbers

93
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,939
(remember, you can find tables like this online and probably in the back of your chemistry textbook too).

94
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:35,069
When we plug the standard enthalpies of formation
into the formula and do the math,

95
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:39,819
we find that the change in standard enthalpy
is plus 166 kilojoules.

96
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:43,620
It's positive, which makes sense because the
reaction absorbed the thermal energy,

97
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,360
enough to create about a half a kilogram of ice if it had been surrounded by water instead of air and fingers.

98
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,490
Next, we'll find the entropy change: remember,
the basic equation is the same.

99
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,718
We put in the number of moles from the balanced
chemical equation

100
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:56,819
and the standard entropies from the table

101
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:02,680
and a quick calculation tells us that the change in standard entropy is 590 joules per Kelvin.

102
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,889
A positive result means the entropy of the
reaction increased,

103
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,329
meaning the products were more disordered
than the reactants.

104
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:14,579
Note that the standard enthalpy is in kilojoules while the standard entropy is in joules per Kelvin.

105
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:19,779
The energy units should match, so let's call
the standard entropy 0.594 kilojoules per Kelvin.

106
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:23,179
It doesn't look like much right now, but wait,
there's more.

107
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,079
Those numbers don't explain why the reaction
proceeds spontaneously,

108
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,279
even though it scavenges all that heat from
the environment.

109
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,519
But Josiah Willard Gibbs, he found a way to
explain it, and he didn't even mean to.

110
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Gibbs was interested in the amount of energy in a system that was available or free to do useful work.

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,060
Today, we call this Gibbs free energy or sometimes the standard free energy or simply free energy of the system.

112
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,800
Like enthalpy or entropy, Gibbs free energy is a state function, so it can be calculated the same way.

113
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,900
We simply substitute "Delta G," which stands
for Gibbs free energy, for "Delta H" or "S."

114
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,288
The standard free energy of formation, written
like this,

115
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:05,539
is the change of free energy that occurs when a substance is formed from its elements at a standard state.

116
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,660
It's analogous to the standard enthalpy of formation that we use to calculate change in enthalpy.

117
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,960
Like enthalpy and entropy, we can't directly
the free energy change of the whole reaction.

118
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:18,288
So scientists created a baseline by setting
the standard free energy change of formation

119
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:23,300
for an element in its most stable form at
standard state to zero.

120
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,449
The standard free energy change of formation
for a compound, then,

121
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,819
is just the difference between its standard
free energy and that baseline.

122
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,419
But what if you don't know the standard free energies of formation for the products and reactants?

123
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,199
Well, they're often listed in tables, but
sometimes the ones you need aren't available.

124
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,700
Never fear, Willard Gibbs has an app for that.
It's actually a formula, but he figured it out.

125
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,479
In 1873, Gibbs calculated that at constant
pressure and temperature,

126
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,800
the change in standard Gibbs free energy for
a reaction equal the change in standard enthalpy

127
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,008
minus the product of the temperature and the
change in standard entropy.

128
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,668
In other words, the amount of free energy a reaction makes available to do work depends on two

129
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:06,448
and only two things: the enthalpy change,
the amount of heat the reaction transfers,

130
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:11,278
and the entropy change, the amount of disorder
it creates at a given temperature.

131
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,360
So which is more important, the heat transfer
or the disorder? Well, it depends.

132
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,389
A large change in enthalpy can determine the
direction of a free energy change,

133
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:22,528
even if the entropy changes in the opposite
direction, and vice versa.

134
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:28,059
If the absolute value of the change in enthalpy is greater than the absolute value of the product of the temperature

135
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:33,819
and the change in entropy (or "T Delta S"),
then we say that the reaction is enthalpy-driven.

136
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,360
this means that the flow of thermal energy
provides most of the free energy in the reaction.

137
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,759
On the other hand, if the absolute value of "T Delta S" is greater than the absolute value of the enthalpy change,

138
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,580
we call the reaction entropy-driven, meaning increasing disorder provides most of the reaction's free energy.

139
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,000
Which type was the barium hydroxide reaction?

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,220
Well, I'm gonna say that the temperature in here is about 25 degrees Celsius, or 298.15 Kelvin,

141
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,600
because I'm awesome like that -- I can just
tell.

142
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,110
When we multiply that by the change in entropy
that we calculated,

143
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,500
0.594 kilojoules per kelvin,
we get a value of 177 kilojoules.

144
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,690
If we compare that to the change in enthalpy
we calculated, 166 kilojoules,

145
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:19,240
it is clear that the "T Delta S" is higher than the "Delta H", so the reaction is entropy-driven -- no surprise there.

146
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,720
Even though the reaction absorbed a lot of thermal energy, this phenomenon was dwarfed by the increase in entropy.

147
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,540
And this makes sense, because the balanced
equation goes from three total moles of solids,

148
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:38,059
with their molecules locked in place, to one mole of solid, ten moles of liquid, and two moles of gas.

149
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:40,619
This is a massive increase in disorder,

150
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,200
because in addition to the fact that there are now 13 moles of particles to move around instead of just 3,

151
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
the liquid and gas are particularly good at
moving around,

152
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,009
so most of those particles are in random motion,
no longer stuck in one spot,

153
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,889
causing a large increase in disorder, or entropy.

154
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,120
But here's the coolest part, Gibbs formula also tells us whether the reaction is spontaneous or not.

155
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,519
We know all systems tend toward the lowest possible energy state, whether its a ball rolling down a hill,

156
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,019
elastic springing back into shape, or positive
and negative ions forming a bond.

157
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:16,019
"Delta G" is a type of energy, obviously, so it spontaneously approaches the minimum possible level.

158
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:22,199
So if the value for "Delta G" is negative, that is if the free energy decreases, the reaction is spontaneous.

159
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,278
Reactions that are able to release free energy
don't need external energy to make them proceed,

160
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,659
and that's the very definition of a spontaneous
reaction.

161
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:35,919
So if "Delta G" is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous, but the reverse reaction is spontaneous.

162
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:41,500
If "Delta G" is zero, the reaction is in an equilibrium state and no discernible occurs in either direction.

163
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,320
So what about the reaction I just did?

164
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,240
Is it spontaneous at room temperature? Can
it occur without energy driving it along?

165
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,379
Well, yes because we just watched it happen,
but let's do the math!

166
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:53,559
Using Gibbs Formula and plugging in the numbers
we've calculated so far,

167
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:58,008
we see that the Gibbs free energy for this
reaction is negative 11 kilojoules.

168
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:03,509
It is indeed spontaneous, because it releases energy instead of requiring it in order to get started.

169
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,879
The energy that was produced was used to rearrange
the bonds in the reactants,

170
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,539
to make smaller product molecules, to break
attractions between molecules,

171
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:14,799
and to push some of the particles apart from
solid form into liquid and gas form,

172
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,919
which increased the entropy of the system.

173
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,299
So even though the reaction absorbed a lot of thermal energy, it didn't NEED that energy to make it proceed,

174
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:26,758
because the large change in entropy alone
was enough to keep things moving along.

175
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:32,279
So Gibbs formula confirms our earlier results with just one little subtraction -- pretty smart guy.

176
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,500
And now, some of his smartness has been transferred
into you,

177
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,080
now that you've watched this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

178
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:41,529
If you paid any attention, you learned:

179
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:46,470
that it's hard to stay organized because there
are so many ways to be disorganized,

180
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,649
that the second law of thermodynamics says
disorder, or entropy, happens everywhere,

181
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,948
and that the change in entropy ultimately depends on how much room molecules have to move around in,

182
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:59,368
how much heat heat energy they have to give off in reactions, and the temperature around them.

183
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:04,319
You learned about Josiah Willard Gibbs and his formula to calculate the Gibbs free energy for a reaction,

184
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:07,828
that both entropy and Gibbs free energy are
state functions,

185
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:12,469
and that the sign of the Gibbs free energy
tell us whether or not a reaction is spontaneous.

186
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,920
