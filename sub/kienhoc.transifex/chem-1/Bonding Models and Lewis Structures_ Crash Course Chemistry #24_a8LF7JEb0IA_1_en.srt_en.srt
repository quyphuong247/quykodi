1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,689
So models are cool. Not...those models.

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:06,290
I actually find that particular cultural institution
pretty peculiar.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,809
I'm talking about the kind of model that lets you experience things you otherwise couldn't experience.

4
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:15,908
Maybe it's something that's too big to see all at once, like our solar system, or too small, like a cell,

5
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:23,189
or something that unfortunately doesn't exist,
like the Millennium Falcon.

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,100
Or something that would just be way too dangerous
to have in your office, like a trebuchet.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,359
Sometimes it is difficult, maybe even impossible, to really understand things fully without making a model.

8
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,890
But models don't have to be three-dimensional
objects.

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,600
In scientific terms, a model is anything that represents something else, whether it's physical or conceptual.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,380
In the same way that musical notes on a page
are a model for music, the same goes for chemistry.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,989
Chemists use many models, or simplified versions
of reality,

12
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:52,159
to help them understand atoms and their interactions.

13
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,889
Because the universe is weird.

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,609
This ball-and-stick model is one idea of a
molecule —

15
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:01,859
perfectly spherical atoms connected by clearly
defined bonds.

16
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,629
This version of a molecule is a great way
to begin understanding chemical bonds.

17
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:11,239
But I gotta take you beyond beginners' stuff to understand some models that explain bonds with more delightful complexity.

18
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,679
Digging into the details requires models that are more complicated, but also more fascinatingly awesome.

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,140
So while this episode of Crash Course Chemistry
won't involve any Brazilians in swimsuits,

20
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,719
I promise you will not be disappointed.

21
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:32,280
[Theme Music]

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,280
It turns out that chemical bonds are not like
little sticks at all.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,689
Bonded atoms — molecules — are more like
groups of atoms hanging out just,

24
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:43,419
like, close to each other because that's where
their energy is minimized.

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,659
So if I tossed all these models of atoms into
the air and let them fly apart from each other,

26
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,310
it's cool and fun for me,

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,299
but those little balls would also have a lot more energy, and that's not the ideal situation for an atom, now is it?

28
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,438
In reality, the only thing connecting two atoms together in a chemical bond is a bunch of electrons,

29
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,578
and they don't sit still between the atoms
gluing everything together.

30
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:10,079
Instead, they're in constant motion zooming all around the nuclei in a somewhat predictable pattern.

31
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,129
In a covalent bond, the bonding electrons
spend most of their time between the nuclei,

32
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,120
and the nuclei stay close together because
they're attracted to the electrons.

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,780
And honestly, this concept of electrons holding everything together is itself just another model,

34
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,840
an idea that represents molecules in a way
that can be visualized.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,430
And it's a more accurate representation of
reality than the ball-and-stick model.

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,459
But the ball-and-stick model isn't useless.

37
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,560
It helps us visualize and understand many important things about molecules. It also looks pretty cool.

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,080
Imagine if, instead of making generalizations about how chemicals behave, like "water dissolves salt",

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,940
you had to memorize every single behavior
of every single substance.

40
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,489
No one would ever get anything else done in
their lives.

41
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,530
We generalize so that we can free our minds
to do bigger and better things.

42
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,520
So make no mistake, some models are great
even though they're oversimplified to the

43
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,379
point of being outright lies.

44
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:03,669
It's important, in fact, to realize that all
models are imperfect to some extent.

45
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:06,189
I mean, think of the human models that people
compare themselves to.

46
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:10,348
Do you think that women in underwear catalogs and the guys in those black-and-white cologne ads look like that

47
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:14,530
on Saturday morning after a long night of
doing whatever models do on Friday nights?

48
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,780
In fact, if a scientific model were a perfect representation of reality, it would cease being a model and become reality.

49
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,099
So, in addition to understanding how a model
represents reality,

50
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,780
you also have to recognize the ways that it
doesn't represent reality

51
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,330
so that you don't base a bunch of incorrect
assumptions on it.

52
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,740
Unfortunately, sometimes models aren't merely oversimplified, sometimes they are just downright wrong.

53
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,080
And the chemical bonding model is no exception.

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
Over centuries, it's been updated as experimental results have provided information about how the universe actually works.

55
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,379
Early scientists, including Isaac Newton, thought that atoms combined because they were literally sticky,

56
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:50,359
or because they had tiny little hooks on them
like a kind of Velcro that held them together.

57
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,159
That was their bonding model.

58
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,439
In the 19th century, chemists like Berzelius
discovered positive and negative charges associated

59
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,239
with chemicals in certain situations.

60
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,920
He and his contemporaries theorized that this
was the force holding molecules together.

61
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:06,719
That's a much better model than the first
one, but still not entirely accurate,

62
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,019
because they thought that atoms more or less
attracted each other like magnets.

63
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,319
Only after the discovery of electrons in the 1890s could chemists begin to understand the true nature of chemical bonds.

64
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,699
Then, in 1916, American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis described a covalent bond as 2 atoms sharing electrons.

65
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,740
Modern chemists still use this model as a simple way to represent chemical bonds on paper.

66
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,379
A Lewis structure is a two-dimensional model that represents covalent bonds as straight lines

67
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:37,699
and un-bonded, valence electrons, those in the outermost energy level of an atom, as dots.

68
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,278
Inner electrons aren't shown at all, and although
it was developed to explain covalent bonds,

69
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:43,968
it also works for ionic bonds.

70
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:48,129
In Lewis structures, bonds are formed by pairs
of valence electrons, called bonding pairs,

71
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,979
in the space between the two atoms.

72
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,389
Pairs of electrons that are attached to only
one atom are known as lone pairs.

73
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:58,050
As you probably remember, atoms are most stable
when their outermost electron shells are filled.

74
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,228
For many atoms, that takes eight electrons,
so it's called the octet rule.

75
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:06,498
And if you're bracing yourselves for some
exceptions to this rule, well, you are correct.

76
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,639
Tiny little hydrogen can only hold two electrons
total, not eight

77
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,079
— that'll make more sense when you watch
our upcoming episode about atomic orbitals —

78
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,158
but also elements in the third row of the periodic table and below often have more than 8 valence electrons.

79
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:22,688
Beryllium and boron are notorious for having
weird numbers like 6 or 12 electrons.

80
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:27,449
So yeah, the whole octet thing is really more
of a gentle nudge than a rule.

81
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,588
Let's stick to rows 1 and 2 of the table to
keep it simple.

82
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:33,139
Let's say I want to draw the Lewis structure
for sodium chloride.

83
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,278
Sodium has one valence electron and chlorine has 7.

84
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:41,779
Since sodium is a metal, this must mean that it's going to be an ionic bond, meaning that electrons are transferred.

85
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,899
Sodium transfers its one valence electron
to chlorine,

86
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:48,028
creating a +1 charge on the sodium and a -1
charge on the chlorine.

87
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:51,240
The two ions are attracted to each other due
to their opposite charges.

88
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,499
They're written slightly separated because
the electrons aren't shared,

89
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,079
but they're not too far apart because the ions stay close enough together to neutralize their charges.

90
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,098
Lewis structures use a line to note covalent
bonds,

91
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:04,538
but we're not doing that here because there
are no covalent bonds.

92
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:07,860
It's an ionic bond, and there's no physical
contact been the ions.

93
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,020
So that is what salt looks like from a Lewis
dot structure point of view.

94
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,839
Covalent bonds: a little more complicated, and it works best if you follow some specific steps.

95
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,218
Let's try it out with water.

96
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:19,338
First, figure out how many total valence electrons
are available.

97
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:23,389
It doesn't matter which atoms they come from
or how they're arranged before you start.

98
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:28,728
Each hydrogen atom has one valence electron,
and oxygen has six, for a total of eight electrons.

99
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:32,359
Neither hydrogen nor oxygen has enough valence
electrons to be stable,

100
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,199
so they share electrons to make up the lack.

101
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,539
And, just like how sharing a snack can make a new friend, the sharing creates a bond between the atoms.

102
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,710
Lay out the molecules and create the bonds.

103
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:45,558
Both hydrogens are bound to oxygen, so the
oxygen goes in the middle.

104
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:49,740
Remember, in Lewis's model each bond requires
a pair of electrons.

105
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,100
So we used four of the eight available electrons to form the bonds. Now fill in the outermost energy levels.

106
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,919
Hydrogen atoms only need two electrons total,
so they're already full.

107
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,318
Oxygen, on the other hand, needs an octet
— eight electrons.

108
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,050
So place the remaining electrons around it
in pairs to complete the structure.

109
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,028
Finally, again, Lewis structures use lines
to represent covalent bonds,

110
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,009
so put those in the place of the bonding electrons,
and you have it.

111
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,360
Water contains two covalent bonds and two
lone pairs. Simple enough.

112
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,479
Well, it can get a little trickier.

113
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,269
Let's do carbon dioxide, another tremendously
important molecule on our planet.

114
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:26,668
Carbon has four valence electrons, and each
oxygen has six, for a total of 16 electrons.

115
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:32,459
Both oxygens bond to the carbon, so put the carbon in the middle and make the bonds using 4 of the 16 electrons.

116
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,399
All three of these atoms, they need a full
octet, so fill that in next.

117
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:39,978
So yay! Now all the atoms have a full octet,
but take a closer look;

118
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:45,829
20 electrons are needed to fill the octet,
but only 16 are available. So, what to do?

119
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:51,259
When there aren't enough electrons to fill all the octets with normal sharing, atoms have to share more of them.

120
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:57,579
In this case, they form a double bond by putting 2 pairs of electrons, for a total of 4, between each pair of atoms.

121
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:04,399
All 4 bonding electrons count toward both atoms' octets, so we need fewer lone pairs to fill all the octets.

122
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:07,748
The double bonds allow us to use only 16 electrons.

123
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:11,559
Replace the bonds with double lines, and the
Lewis structure is complete,

124
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:14,229
with 2 double bonds and 2 lone pairs on each
oxygen.

125
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,838
That was a little weird, so surely we can
do something simple like molecular nitrogen.

126
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:21,528
Just 2 atoms of nitrogen bonded together,
right?

127
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:26,418
Well, nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and
there are 2 atoms, so that's a total of 10 electrons.

128
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:30,799
Let's put in the bond and complete the octets,
and we've used 14 electrons.

129
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,979
That — we don't have that many.

130
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,459
We can try a double bond, but that still uses
12 electrons, 2 more than we got,

131
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,109
so we still don't have enough electrons to
go around.

132
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,038
Let's kick it up one more notch and make it
a triple bond.

133
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,198
That's when atoms share three pairs of electrons.And
that does it.

134
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:48,929
Just 10 electrons, and all the atoms have
a full octet.

135
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,799
Switch the lines to bonds, and it's done.

136
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,539
A triple bond, and a lone pair on each atom.

137
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:59,000
And this is why molecular nitrogen is really
hard to break up to form, like, fertilizer and stuff.

138
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,610
In case you're wondering, three is the maximum
number of bonds.

139
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,528
There is no such thing as a quadruple covalent
bond.

140
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:08,309
So that's the Lewis model — separate, discrete
bonds formed by sharing specific electrons.

141
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:11,849
It's a good model, and pretty close to the
modern definition of a covalent bond,

142
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,519
but it is still grossly oversimplified and
unfortunately not 100% accurate.

143
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,490
But here's the thing about models: even when
they're partially wrong,

144
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,500
you can build on the good parts to create even better models, and that is what Linus Pauling did.

145
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,879
While he was in college, Pauling read Gilbert Lewis's chemical bond research, published just 3 years earlier.

146
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,679
Lewis's model inspired Pauling to spend the rest of his life studying the relationships between

147
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,649
the properties of substances and their molecular
structures.

148
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:39,480
After getting his PhD in physical chemistry,

149
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,500
he traveled to Europe to study the new field
of quantum mechanics

150
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,028
with great physicists like Arnold Sommerfeld,
Niels Bohr, and Erwin Schrödinger.

151
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:51,549
Quantum mechanics basically involves the idea
that some things, like light and electrons,

152
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,939
are both particles and waves of energy.

153
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,190
So Pauling applied the quantum mechanics model
to chemical bonds,

154
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,430
and this was the birth of the bonding model
that we know today,

155
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:05,739
which conceives of chemical bonds as a sort
of overlap of atoms' individual electron clouds,

156
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,240
rather than the simple sharing of specific
electrons.

157
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,750
We'll explore that in more detail when we
talk about orbitals,

158
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,528
but this is the electrons-holding-everything-together model that I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,

159
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:17,650
and that we pretty much take for granted today.

160
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,838
Pauling's contributions to the model of chemical
bonding made such an impact on how we understand

161
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,279
the universe that he won a Nobel Prize for
it in 1954.

162
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:26,809
It may not sound totally mind-blowing today,

163
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:31,919
but imagine figuring this out when your only concept of atoms was little bits of stuff like Newton.

164
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,938
Or even just a vague idea of charges in an
atom like Berzelius. It's mind-boggling.

165
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:40,809
Our ability to understand chemistry at all
is a direct result of the models that scientists

166
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:45,109
like Lewis and Pauling have provided, so to
them I say thank you.

167
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,139
And thanks to you for watching this episode
of Crash Course Chemistry.

168
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:52,038
I think you're all...
model students.

169
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,919
If you paid attention today you learned that

170
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:57,519
a scientific model is anything that represents
something else in a different way,

171
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,639
that we often learn the most when we try to understand why things don't work the way that we expect,

172
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,439
and that you can build new models on the foundation
of old ones.

173
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:08,909
You also learned that the chemical bonding
model developed by the great Linus Pauling

174
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:13,980
is crucial to our understanding of chemistry, and also the universe, and you learned how to draw Lewis structures.

175
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,139
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was written by Edi González and edited by Blake de Pastino.
