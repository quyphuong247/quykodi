00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
A few months ago, when we first talked about
acid base reactions,

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,400
we saw how acid rain could melt the face off
a statue.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,550
Which is better than melting your face off,
which some acids can do.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,940
So consider yourself lucky.

5
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,279
Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide emitted
from burning fossil fuels

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,800
reacts with water in the air to form sulfuric
acid.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,320
And back when acid rain was at it's worse,
in the 80s and 90s,

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,539
it was the scourge of pristine waterways all
over Europe and North America.

9
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,039
Some rivers and streams were left completely
devoid of algae and fish.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,949
In Montana, where I live, we saw quite a bit
of acid rain too, as that statue can attest,

11
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:35,340
but oddly enough rivers and streams here did not suffer the same horrible effects as other places.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,420
This, that I'm standing in right now, is the
Clark Fork River.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,210
It remains relatively unharmed by acid rain.

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,799
In fact, when the water that fed it had a
pH of 4.5, the river remained basic.

15
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,530
This is a dropper full of dilute sulfuric
acid, think of it as a model for acid rain.

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,739
And this is just distilled water with a pH indicator in it that makes it blue when it's neutral or basic

17
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:00,899
and it'll turn pink if it's at least a little
bit acidic.

18
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,799
Let's see how much acid it takes to turn our
distilled water a little bit acidic.

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,959
Let's do one drop. Oh wow! It's already pink
guys, it's already pink. One drop.

20
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,099
Let's try the same thing with the river water.

21
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:16,419
Let's see how many drops it takes before it turns - I'm just - it's just - I'm just dumping it in there.

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,359
We gettin it? It's starting to happen now?
There, it's sort of half and half.

23
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,039
We've got a half and half transition.
After, after like five, or six, or seven drops.

24
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,730
That was a lot more.
And we're not even all the way there.

25
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,130
Get, get a little bit more, a little bit more,
a little bit more, c'mon.

26
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,259
There we go! There, there now it's acidic.

27
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:38,579
Why does this happen? It's because this river
is protected by limestone.

28
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,959
Which is calcium carbonate that is present
throughout the entire river system.

29
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,779
Acid rain dissolves the calcium carbonate
in the limestone,

30
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,629
that carbonate washes in to the river and
acts as a natural buffer.

31
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:51,959
A buffer solution resists changes to it's pH when a strong acid or base is added to it.

32
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,139
So the Clark Fork geochemistry explains why acid rain isn't as devastating here as it is in,

33
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,459
say, the Adirondack Mountains of New York
where there is no limestone.

34
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,059
Buffering is a big deal in chemistry.

35
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,519
We buffer swimming pools to prevent the chemicals
from damaging our skin,

36
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,139
and we buffered soda pop to prevent the acidic
flavorings from damaging our teeth and tissues.

37
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,809
We even have buffers in our blood to keep
our internal pH constant and ourselves healthy.

38
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,990
I think it's important to learn about something
that powerful. How about you?

39
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:26,370
[Theme Music]

40
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,110
A buffer solution is a mixture of a weak acid plus its conjugate base, or a weak base plus it's conjugate acid.

41
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,090
These are called acid-base pairs.

42
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,870
Weak in reference to acids and bases means
that they only partial dissociate.

43
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,920
It's actual their weakness that makes them
great buffers.

44
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:49,219
Since they don't fully dissociate in water, the undissociated buffer can act as either a source or a sink for protons.

45
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:54,120
Which helps neutralize a strong acid, or base, that's added to the solution. It's really all about equilibrium.

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,620
For example, when weak acid like acetic acid
is added to water,

47
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,819
a tiny fraction of it dissociates in to its constituent ions: acetate and hydrogen ions, or protons.

48
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,430
I was recently pouring a bunch of a solution
like this all over my fish and chips.

49
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,360
Vinegar is just a 5% solution of acetic acid.

50
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,590
But the reaction is reversible as well, and
that's where equilibrium comes in.

51
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,360
Say we have a 1 molar solution of acetic acid.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,560
To make the solution a buffer we need to increase
the concentration of acetic acids conjugate base,

53
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,699
acetate, by adding sodium acetate to it.
That would be a good way.

54
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:29,459
Sodium acetate dissociates completely, thereby
providing a ton of acetate ion.

55
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,219
To see how this works in practice, let's add
enough of that salt to make a 1 molar solution.

56
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:38,189
We know how much acid and how acetate we put
in, but the important thing is the pH.

57
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:41,039
And to determine that, we have to know how
many protons there are.

58
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,709
A Rice table will help us keep track of everything!

59
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,650
The reaction, R, we're interested in here
of course, is the dissociation of acetic acid.

60
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,140
We can ignore the sodium from the sodium acetate,

61
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,299
although it will stick around, it's just a spectator ion that won't take part of any reactions.

62
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,939
Our solution contains initial concentrations
I of 1 molar acid and 1 molar acetate.

63
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:03,469
We haven't formed any hydrogen ions yet, so
that stays at zero for now.

64
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:07,530
We don't know how much the concentrations
will change, C, so we call it 'x'.

65
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,500
The acid loses 'x' and both ions gain 'x'.

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,459
So our concentration's at equilibrium, E, then are 1 minus x, 1 plus x, and simply x - in that order.

67
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,988
Now just put the numbers in to the equilibrium
formula, 1.76 x 10^-5.

68
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,839
But when chemists work with dissociation equations,
for acids and bases,

69
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,668
they give the Keq a special name:
the acid (or base) dissociation constant.

70
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:35,649
The symbol for this kind of equilibrium constant
is Ka, for an acid, or Kb for a base.

71
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:39,209
So use the equilibrium expression for acetic
acid, and put in the Ka,

72
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:41,378
and the equilibrium concentrations from the
RICE table.

73
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:46,120
With a little simple algebra, it simplifies - simplifies?
That doesn't, that doesn't look simplified.

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,899
I guess you could call that simplifying, but
ugh...that's like quadratic, I don't want to do that.

75
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:54,620
So here's a little trick to make this a lot
easier.

76
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,028
See acetic acid is a really weak acid.

77
00:04:57,028 --> 00:05:01,629
So only a tiny fraction of it dissociates.
Which means that 'x' is super small.

78
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:05,400
If it's so small that after rounding for significant
digits it doesn't change our answers at all,

79
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,620
then why not just drop it?

80
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,519
Then that first x for the hydrogen ion has more effect because it's multiplied, but the other two?

81
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,318
Let's just forget they're there and see what
happens.

82
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,099
If we go back to where we plug in all the numbers and simply drop the two 'x's that are being added and subtracted,

83
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,650
the rest of the problem cancels out leaving
x to equal 1.76 x 10^-5.

84
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:27,628
The rest is a breeze with a couple taps of
the calculator we find that the pH is 4.754.

85
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:31,879
But here's the big question, what if we tried
to push the pH out of whack?

86
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,908
The whole point of a buffer is to resist that,
right?

87
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:41,538
If I add a strong acid, like say hydrochloric acid, at a concentration of like 0.1 mole per liter to distilled water.

88
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:47,318
The pH will change, very quickly.
To like, very fast, dropping, yes.

89
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,319
Now we're at like a 3. pH of 3.
Not a healthy environment for most organisms.

90
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:55,168
So let's think about what would happen to
the pH with a buffer in place.

91
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:59,128
Even though HCl dissociates completely in
water, releasing tons of hydrogen ions,

92
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,528
when it's added to a solution that's buffered
with acetate,

93
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:05,418
the excess hydrogen ions join with the acetate
ions to form acetic acid.

94
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:10,128
Thus that strong acid can't effect the pH
much because the hydrogen ions are used up.

95
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:20,088
To neutralize .01 molar HCl, or more specifically .01 molar H+, the acetate concentration much decrease by 0.01 moles per liter.

96
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:25,420
Simultaneously increasing the acetic acid
concentration by 0.01 moles per liter.

97
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,769
That leaves us with .99 molar acetate and
1.01 molar acetic acid.

98
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,990
Well pH is determined from the concentration
of protons,

99
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,288
which is in our equilibrium equation so let's
just solve for that.

100
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:40,240
When you plug in the new acetic acid and acetate
concentrations and the Ka,

101
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,408
you get 1.80 x 10^-5 moles per liter for the
proton concentration.

102
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:52,038
Which translates to a pH of 4.746.
This is obviously not a big change from 4.754.

103
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:56,068
In fact I had to go out to the fourth digit
to see the pH change.

104
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:59,649
Which isn't even justified if you watch Crash
Course Chemistry on significant figures.

105
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:03,218
But I have to confess vinegar and hydrochloric
acid they may make things easier to understand,

106
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:06,528
but they're not exactly super relevant in
terms of practical chemistry.

107
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:09,649
Instead I want you to see how this works in
the 'real' real world.

108
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,838
So, let's consider the buffering system of
the Clark Fork river.

109
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:16,968
There the reaction between dissolved limestone
and acid rain really happens in three steps.

110
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:22,808
First, the solid calcium carbonate reacts with the protons from acidic rain to form calcium and bicarbonate ions.

111
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,619
The bicarbonate ions each have one hydrogen.

112
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,459
As long as protons are available, the bicarbonate ions can grab a second proton to become uncharged carbonic acid.

113
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:36,959
As you can see this chain reaction uses up
two protons per molecule of calcium carbonate.

114
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:39,278
That makes this process doubly powerful.

115
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:43,598
And that explains why the Clark Fork river
is so resistant to acidification.

116
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,569
But of course buffers are not invincible.

117
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,129
Add enough acid or base and even the best
buffered solution will get overwhelmed.

118
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,349
We call that threshold the buffering capacity
of the solution.

119
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:56,428
And we determine it in the lab using pH indicators
through a process called titration.

120
00:07:56,428 --> 00:08:00,438
Earlier I used a pH indicator that showed
an acidic pH by turning pink.

121
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:06,519
But there are lots of other indicators, each with different colors and a different pH where it changes.

122
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,779
This is called the indicators end point.

123
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:14,709
Here we have 100 mL of water from the river
to which I've added some pH indicator.

124
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:20,178
It's actually a mix of two different pH indicators:
bromocresol green and methyl red.

125
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:22,149
That work together well for this reaction.

126
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:27,379
It'll stay blueish in color for as long as the bicarbonate ions are around to keep the pH buffered

127
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:30,249
above the indicators end point of pH 4.

128
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,800
This long glass thing here is a burette.

129
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,419
It's for dispensing liquids in a very controlled way, while also keeping track of how much you've dispensed.

130
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,379
At the moment it contains exactly 25 mL of
a 0.10 molar sulfuric acid solution.

131
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:47,559
The thing to do is to add the acid very slowly,
stirring as I go,

132
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,099
which is being done for me by this automatic
stirry thing which is quite nice.

133
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,629
And - and - you can do it a few ways.

134
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:58,720
If you have a guess at how much you can put in, you can just sorta turn it on and let it go,

135
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
but I don't know so I'm just gonna let it
drip.

136
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,439
Very slowly.

137
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,660
You can turn it very slightly and you can
actually get it to do sorta drippy drips.

138
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:16,870
So then you're like, waiting to see if there's
some changing happening.

139
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:22,980
And there's a little bit of changing happening,
but now it's going back. So, we're getting closer.

140
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,940
And what I'm doing right now, is I'm actually
adding less than a drop at a time

141
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,040
by going quickly past the opening in this
little burette thing.

142
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:37,099
I can actually see the reaction happening, right before my eyes. It's beautiful, and then it goes back.

143
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,620
It's right now a paler blue than it was before
which is exciting.

144
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,669
It means we're getting close! This is the
stuff I get excited about. I know I'm a nerd.

145
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:55,559
Ohhh, it's almost white right now, it's like a pinkish, purpley. Ohhh, beautiful! That was perfect!

146
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,828
The solution is now staying pink which means
that I've exhausted it's buffering capacity,

147
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:02,989
and the pH has dropped below the indicators
end point.

148
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:12,680
The volume in the pipette is now 22.4 mL, meaning that I used 2.6 mL or 0.0026 liter of the acid solution.

149
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,120
The acid solution is 0.1 molar.

150
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:21,989
So multiplying these numbers together tells
me that I used 0.00026 mole of H2SO4.

151
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,759
Sulfuric acid reacts at a one to one ratio
with calcium carbonate,

152
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,068
so assuming the calcium carbonate is the only
buffer in the water,

153
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:35,559
the 100 mL of river water here must also contain
0.00026 moles of calcium carbonate.

154
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,809
Making it a 0.0026 molar or 2.6 mM solution.

155
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:46,568
I'm a big fan of protecting the environment, but sometimes it is amazing to see what nature can do to protect itself.

156
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:50,860
We live in an amazing world and I wouldn't
trade it for anything. Not even Mars.

157
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,068
Thanks for watching this course of Crash Course
Chemistry.

158
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:57,068
If you were listening, you learned that some
bodies of water, like the Clark Ford river,

159
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:01,088
have natural protection from acid rain in
the form of a buffering system.

160
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:04,680
You learned that a buffer is a solution that
resists changes in pH.

161
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,859
You learned how to make a buffer solution.

162
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,079
And you learned how to calculate the pH of such a solution by various methods, including titration.

163
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,818
And lastly, you learned the importance of
the carbonate buffering solution in nature.

164
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:20,309
