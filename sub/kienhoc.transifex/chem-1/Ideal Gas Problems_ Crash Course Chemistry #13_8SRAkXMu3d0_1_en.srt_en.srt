1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,299
What does your perfect world look like?

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,439
An end to genocide, corn dogs for dinner everyday,
David Tennant at my house for board games

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,719
and Carl Sagan would be there too, he'd be
immortal...and not dead.

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:14,738
We could cure cancer with puppies and vomit
wouldn't exist.

5
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:19,200
Unfortunately, sometimes we need to vomit
to survive, David Tennant doesn't know I exist,

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,299
and while scientists are experimenting with
dogs that can diagnose cancer through scent,

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,600
puppies are not helping to cure the disease.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,320
Gases, likewise, don't live in a perfect world
either.

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,149
It'd be great if their particles always fulfilled
the assumptions of the ideal gas law,

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,730
and we could use PV=nRT to get the right answer
every time.

11
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,058
But the ideal gas law, much like our culture,

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,170
has really unrealistic expectations when it
comes to size and attraction.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,929
Namely, it assumes that particles do not have size at all, and that particles never attract each other.

14
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,069
Well I don't know about you, but it's hard
for me to take up no space,

15
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:57,039
no matter how much I want to disappear and
attraction, so far, that's never gone away.

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:04,579
So the ideal gas "law" often becomes little more than the ideal gas estimate when it comes to what gases do naturally.

17
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:14,219
[Theme Music]

18
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:15,959
You remember the ideal gas law,

19
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,519
it's a combination of three related laws that
were discovered by a variety of scientists.

20
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,839
Let's review real quick.

21
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,829
Boyle's law was first published by Robert
Boyle in 1660,

22
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:29,840
but it was actually discovered by two of his contemporaries, Richard Towneley and Henry Power.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,659
It says that the product of the pressure and
the volume of a gas is

24
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,670
always constant as long as the temperature
remains the same.

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,049
Boyle's law requires a closed system where the amount of gas is constant (like in my balloon).

26
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:46,049
Next is Charles' law, which was discovered
by Jacques Charles and actually named for him,

27
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,109
though it was first published by Joseph Louis
Gay-Lussac, who wasn't a scoundrel.

28
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,269
Yes, I'm looking at you Robert Boyle.

29
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:55,239
Charles' law, which also requires a closed
system, states that

30
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:01,119
the volume of a gas divided by its temperature gives a constant as long as the pressure is held steady.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,160
And then there's Avogadro law, discovered
by resident house elf, Amedeo Avogadro,

32
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,469
and this one does not require a closed system.

33
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:16,270
In fact, it's all about changing the amount
of gas (like - like I just did there).

34
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,300
It says that the volume if the gas divided
by the amount, results in a constant

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,520
as long as the temperature and pressure are
held steady.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,540
The more gas you have at a given temperature and pressure, the more space it takes up, and vice versa.

37
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,159
That's pretty intuitive, right?

38
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,000
The trouble is that it's kind of inconvenient
to use three different laws to figure out

39
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:35,919
what one sample of gas is doing.

40
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:43,139
So eventually the three laws combined into
one by, surprise, our old friend Dmitri Mendeleev.

41
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:46,979
He pulled all the elements together into the
periodic table and it turns out he pulled

42
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:49,079
all the gas laws together too.

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,040
Smart guy! The main thing Mendeleev did was
to calculate just one constant, R,

44
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,818
also called the universal gas constant, which incorporates the various constants from all the gas laws.

45
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,019
With a little rearranging, we now have the
ideal gas law that we know and love.

46
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,620
R equals 8.3145 liter kilo-Pascals per Kelvin
mole.

47
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,960
But don't let the crazy units scare you.

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,379
It looks complicated but it's really just
a measurement label like meters or Newtons

49
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:18,969
and it helps us out a lot in our calculations,
which is mostly what we'll be doing today.

50
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:23,389
This is all pretty cool, but remember that
it's called the ideal gas law for a reason:

51
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:26,809
it only works perfectly when gases behave
ideally,

52
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,159
with the particles not taking up too much
space and not being attracted to each other.

53
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,068
It's a bit of an impressive regime,

54
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:36,899
but under normal conditions most gases come close enough to ideal behavior that we get very little error.

55
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,260
It only breaks down badly in conditions like
high pressure or low temperature or high density

56
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:46,620
that shove the particles so close together that they take up a large proportion of the available space.

57
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,719
This also causes any attraction between them
to be magnified,

58
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,959
just like how I didn't think that Alison Cayne was that attractive until she became my lab partner,

59
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,848
and then she was right there next to me all
the time, and I couldn't handle it.

60
00:03:56,848 --> 00:04:01,598
Johannes van der Waals came up with a way
to correct the equation for real gas behavior,

61
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,719
and we're going to explore that soon, but it's important that we know first how to use the base equation.

62
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,020
And besides, it's close enough most of the
time without the correction factor,

63
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,989
so why make it harder than it needs to be?

64
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:18,189
One last thing: remember that STP, or Standard Temperature and Pressure, is 0 degrees Celsius and 100 kilo-Pascals,

65
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:26,209
but gas law equations are done in Kelvins, not degrees Celsius, so we'll call it 273.15 K and 100 kilo-Pascals.

66
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:32,759
STP is sort of a baseline level that we use so scientists everywhere can compare gas behaviors under the same conditions,

67
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,360
and as we'll see, it's useful in calculations
too.

68
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,879
So, we've got this fancy-shmancy new law just
lying around doing nothing.

69
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,159
Let's figure out some stuff! I wonder how much space 1.00 mole of an ideal gas takes up at STP.

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,300
That would be its volume, and we can
calculate it like this:

71
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,720
We know that PV=nRT.
We know that we want 1.00 mole.

72
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,080
We know what R is, since it's constant, and since we're at STP, we know the temperature and pressure too.

73
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,560
Plug in all the numbers, leaving the volume as a variable (since that's what we're trying to find out).

74
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,220
By doing the math (I'm doing it in my imaginary calculator here) we find that the volume equals 22.71105675.

75
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,260
And because of the big, scary unit on R, the
kilo-Pascals, moles, and Kelvins all cancel out,

76
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:19,819
leaving us with liters, which is exactly what
you'd expect for a volume unit.

77
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,199
This confirms that the problem was set up
correctly, so that's nice.

78
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,660
Rounding our answer to the correct number
of significant digits

79
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:32,160
and adding the unit gives a final answer of
22.7 liters per 1.00 mole of gas.

80
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,880
'But wait!' you cry. 'Didn't we learn last time that 1.00 mole of any gas is a volume of 22.4 liters?'

81
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,279
Yes! I am astounded that you remembered that
so well.

82
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:48,500
In fact, 1.00 mole of a gas will take up slightly different amounts of space depending on what the pressure is.

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,509
I said, just now, that it was at STP, which
is a pressure of 100 kilo-Pascals.

84
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,509
The 22.4 liter number is for a gas at 1 atmosphere.

85
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,919
While one hundred kilo-Pascals and one atmosphere
are similar, they are not the same.

86
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:05,539
In fact, 1 atmosphere is 101.325 kilo-Pascals,

87
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:12,819
and I assure you that if you did the calculation using 101.324 kilo-Pascals of pressure, you'd get 22.4 liters.

88
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:15,779
But you don't have to trust me, you can do
the calculation yourself.

89
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,519
So instead of doing that, which would be boring,
let's make things a little more interesting.

90
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:24,819
Like bigger! You know, like super big, like
way... bigger. Let's make it Hindenburg big.

91
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:30,339
The Hindenburg was a zeppelin, a flying machine
that's held aloft by a lighter-than-air gas,

92
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:34,819
but, unlike a hot air balloon or a blimp,
has a rigid metal frame to support its shape.

93
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,819
It was nearly as big as a cruise ship and
many times larger than the Airbus A380,

94
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,439
today's largest flying passenger vehicle.

95
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,660
It was built in Germany in 1936 and made 10 trips to the US and 7 to Brazil in its first year of service.

96
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,009
The Hindenburg annoyed Hitler and the Nazis.

97
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:56,319
For one thing, it was named for Paul von Hindenburg,
the president of Germany before Hitler took over.

98
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,480
Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels tried
to make the Germans name it "the Hitler",

99
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,288
but they refused, thankfully.

100
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:08,579
And second, the Hindenburg was fancy new technology that the Nazis wanted to use both militarily and as propaganda.

101
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,099
The makers did not want that to happen.

102
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,150
They did allow it to be used for one huge
propaganda mission,

103
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:17,989
called the Die Deutschlandfahrt, or Tour of
Germany (no giggling!),

104
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,030
but after that, it was used only for passenger
and freight service.

105
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,948
But none of that is the reason that we still
talk about the Hindenburg today.

106
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:28,500
Sadly, it's most famous for catching on fire
and crashing while it was trying to land in

107
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,779
Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6th, 1937.

108
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,859
That's bad enough under any circumstances,

109
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,699
but it also happened to be filled with hydrogen
gas, H2, which is highly flammable.

110
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,680
The original plan was to fill it with non-flammable helium, but helium was extremely expensive at that time.

111
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,879
And because hydrogen gas has a molar mass roughly half that of helium, it provides more lift too,

112
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:56,639
so the zeppelin company felt that using hydrogen was an acceptable risk, but the result was the loss of 36 lives.

113
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,819
No one knows how the fire started, but it's
clear that it ended in tragedy.

114
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,978
So let's do some calculations to build our understanding of what the Hindenburg was all about.

115
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:10,579
First, let's figure out how many moles of
H2 were aboard the ship when it left Germany.

116
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:17,978
We know that the hydrogen bags had a total
volume of 211,890,000 L, so we can start there.

117
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:20,029
We don't know what the atmospheric pressure
was that day,

118
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:24,829
but we can assume that it was close to average
atmospheric pressure, about 100 kPa,

119
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:27,099
and the internal pressure would be about the
same.

120
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:33,279
So the volume is 2.1189 X 108 L,
n is what we are trying to find out,

121
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,399
R is always the same (8.3145 liter kilo-Pascals
per Kelvin mole)

122
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:44,950
and average early May temperatures rage around
10° Celsius which is 283.15 Kelvin.

123
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,820
With this information we can now solve for
the amount of hydrogen gas.

124
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,660
Doing the math and rounding properly we find
that n equals 9.00 x 10^6.

125
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,360
All the units cancel except for moles which
we add to the end.

126
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:05,120
So the Hindenburg started out with 9.00 x
10^6, that's 9 million moles of hydrogen gas.

127
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,539
That is a lot.

128
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:11,500
So how much extra could the Hindenburg carry
because it was using hydrogen instead of helium?

129
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,289
9 million moles of H2 times its molar mass,
2.016 grams per mole,

130
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,659
calculates to a little over 18 000 kilograms,
or 18 metric tons of gas.

131
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:25,139
On the other hand helium's molar mass it 4.003
grams per mole.

132
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:31,279
So if they'd used 9 million moles of that, the gas would have had a total mass of over 36 000 kilograms.

133
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:36,338
So with hydrogen instead of helium the Hindenburg
could carry 18 metric tons more.

134
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,459
Here's another interesting question: It's
warmer in New Jersey than in Germany.

135
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:47,060
On an average day in May the outdoor temperature there would be around 18° Celsius or 291.15 Kelvin.

136
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:51,239
If we assume that the volume and amount of
gas in the Hindenburg were constant,

137
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,629
how much did the internal pressure increase?

138
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:56,389
We're looking for P, so we leave that as variable.

139
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:59,350
The amount and the volume have to stay the
same as before.

140
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,840
R is always the same and our new temperature
is 291.15.

141
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,790
Using those numbers we find that the new pressure
is 102.822.

142
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:13,139
Given the right number of significant digits and the right unit, the final answer becomes 103 kPa.

143
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,279
So looks like we've gotten pretty good at these calculations, time for some fun! This is a fire piston.

144
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:24,419
Like everything around us it contains air and it has a plunger that allows you to compress that air very quickly.

145
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:29,419
The sudden but extreme increase in pressure
will cause the temperature of the air inside

146
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,199
to rise equally suddenly and extremely.

147
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,970
Of course hot air looks just like cool air,
so that's kind of boring on its own.

148
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,420
But if I put a small piece of cotton inside
to provide fuel, watch closely.

149
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:42,479
And... boom! Did you see that?

150
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,259
The inside of the piston actually got so hot
that it ignited the cotton.

151
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:51,399
Solid prove that increased pressure does indeed
lead to increased temperature. Pretty cool!

152
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,319
Thank you for watching Crash Course Chemistry!

153
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,000
If you were paying attention,
you learned that

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,399
taking up space and attraction to others cause just as much trouble for gases as it does for us.

155
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,519
That Mendeleev came to the rescue once again

156
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:06,519
by combining three separate gas laws into
one simple equation and how to use that equation.

157
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,169
You also learned a lot about the amazing Hindenburg
and its tragic end,

158
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,860
why the stuff that makes party balloons cool
might have made the Hindenburg cooler too,

159
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,180
and how to make fire with cotton and your
fist.

160
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:19,919
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi González.

161
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,269
The script was edited by myself and Blake
de Pastino.

162
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,980
Our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko Langner.

163
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,519
It was filmed, edited and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

164
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,379
Our script supervisor is Caitlin Hofmeister.

165
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:34,240
Our sound designer is Michael Aranda and our
graphics team is Thought Café.
