00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,359
Hello, I'm Hank Green!
Welcome to Crash Course Chemistry.

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:08,919
Last time we left off with Mendeleev believing he had discovered a cosmic, mystic reality about the world,

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:14,989
but in fact he had discovered the effects
of his worst enemy: tiny invisible particles.

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:22,019
Electrons, which are so marvelous and peculiar that it wasn't until 80 years after Mendeleev's 1st periodic table

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,980
that they were really understood by anyone and to this day still very, very few people understand them.

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,159
But in like 10 minutes from now, if all goes according to plan, you will be one of those people. So let's do this.

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:43,739
[Theme Music]

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,179
In 1865, before Mendeleev published his first
periodic table,

9
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:54,659
a young chemist, and activist, John Newlands
published a paper on the periodicity of elements,

10
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,978
comparing their repetition, at least the first
two rows of it, to a musical scale.

11
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:01,698
All do re me fa so la ti do and stuff.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,799
Maybe, he theorized, lithium was just sodium
but an octave higher.

13
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,480
Maybe they were, in a sense, the same note.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,920
He delivered this idea to the Royal Academy, the most prestigious group of scientists in the world,

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,040
and they basically laughed him off the stage.

16
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,379
"Music is art and chemistry is science.

17
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:21,979
Now describing science in an artistic way
might be a fine parlor trick for helping little

18
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,750
babies or women understand the work you do
but they have no place in the Royal Academy."

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,109
That's my impression.

20
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,799
But there was no way of course of knowing
that it turns out John Newlands,

21
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,549
when it came to the actual, functional, physical
reality behind the periodicity of elements,

22
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:40,689
was more right than any of the scientists
who laughed him off the stage that day.

23
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,879
And he never got to find out how right he
was.

24
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,759
We didn't discover that his analogies were
barely analogies until long after his death,

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,859
but it turns out that reality is like a kind
of music.

26
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,519
And maybe you want to laugh me off the stage
right now but bear with me.

27
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,259
Before quantum mechanics, scientists envisioned the atomic world as just a miniature macroscopic world.

28
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,480
Electrons seemed to just be particles orbiting
around a nucleus.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,159
In fact, there was a great Dane...no Nick...other
kind of Dane... Niels Bohr, yes.

30
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,859
Like certain other people I might name,

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,420
he sometimes felt like he was in the shadow of his older, more successful brother, an Olympic soccer player,

32
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:24,988
while Niels' handwriting was so poor that
he had to dictate his PhD thesis to his mom

33
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:27,730
Nevertheless, he was an ingenious physicist.

34
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,679
Now, you might remember a couple
of episodes back,

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,739
when John Dalton determined that elements
only exist in discrete packets of matter.

36
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:38,139
Well, by Bohr's time the same thing was known
for the energy given off by electrons.

37
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:44,019
That energy only came off in what ended up
being called "quanta" which is the root of the term
"quantum mechanics."

38
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:47,658
In 1913, Niels Bohr came up with a simple
model for describing these energy levels

39
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:52,048
for a single electron in hydrogen merely assuming
circular orbits.

40
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:55,859
So there is some truth to the framework of
thinking of electrons as particles.

41
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,900
However, when he or anyone else tried to apply this to more complicated atoms, they failed miserably.

42
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,819
Long story short, electrons don't really behave like particles; they're better described as waves.

43
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:14,259
So we've known for, like, fifty years that this is a an entirely inaccurate way of visualizing an atom.

44
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:20,239
Nuclei, yeah, you can think of them as solid particles but not electrons. Electrons are wave-particle dualities.

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,800
I think of them like resonance in the universe.

46
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,550
And just like a single string producing multiple
notes on a guitar,

47
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,570
an electron can exist in a number of different
harmonics.

48
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:35,009
This isn't an analogy either, quantum physicists
actually talk about the harmonics of electrons.

49
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:37,018
After a few years of trying to figure this
stuff out,

50
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,778
a couple of very smart physicists started
to look at electrons as waves, standing waves.

51
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,900
This makes a lot of sense, even to us lay
guys.

52
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,669
When you swing a telephone chord in a straight
line there are a discrete numbers of nodes,

53
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:55,400
depending on the tension and the frequency, or in better physics terms, "energy", you put into the system.

54
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,980
The same thing happens to an electron
around a nucleus;

55
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,199
a standing wave is produced only at certain energy levels.

56
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,639
Anything in between is not allowed.

57
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,430
An Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrodinger,
who you may have heard of because of his cat,

58
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,058
is the first guy who developed a mathematical model where the electron was assumed to be a standing wave.

59
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:17,879
Now, it is time to move a little bit into
the realm of metaphor here

60
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,699
because I'm gonna tell you how I think, how I think of electron shells and orbitals, not really how they are.

61
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,879
The music of electrons is not simple music.
It's no three chord song;

62
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:33,060
it's like Beethoven but with more rules, hard
fast rules that can't be broken.

63
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,439
In that way, at least, it's more science than
art.

64
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,160
Electrons exist in orbitals a bit like the
individual notes on a keyboard.

65
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,640
But the orbital's tone isn't complete until it has two electrons in it, and orbitals exist in shells.

66
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:51,219
The first shell just has a single orbital,
an s-orbital, which can only fit two electrons.

67
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,130
That's why the row of our periodic table only
has two elements.

68
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,379
They play simple song those two and a song
that every other element will build upon.

69
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:04,120
The second electron shell is physically larger
and thus can include more than just the s-orbital.

70
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,980
A second sort of orbital with three different
configurations is added, the p-orbital.

71
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,540
Instead of just being a single tone, the p-orbital
is more like a 3 part harmony with 2 electrons

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,829
in each part for a total of 6.

73
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:22,240
Those 6 electrons of the p-orbital plus the 2 s-electrons are the eight electrons referred to in the octet rule:

74
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,620
the desire for most of the lighter elements to have 8 electrons in their outer shell, just like a musical scale.

75
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,780
This is often described in terms of fullness or satiation, as if the atoms are devouring electrons.

76
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:37,199
But I prefer to think of an incomplete electron
configuration as a cacophonous symphony

77
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,239
playing in different keys and at different
tempos.

78
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,560
And the closer you are to harmony the worse it is, until one final note chimes in, that eighth note

79
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:49,009
and everything crisps into full resolution
a deep, complex tone emerges,

80
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,339
and the atom settles into complete harmony,
the harmony of the noble gases.

81
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,049
That's just how I think of it.

82
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,710
And just like with music, there's a bit of
notation to learn as well.

83
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:02,129
It's important to know how to write out what
we call "electron configurations,"

84
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:06,300
a condensed way of showing exactly where all
of an atoms electrons are.

85
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,620
First, we write the number of the shell, then the letter of the orbital, then the number of electrons in that orbital,

86
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,060
and repeat until we run out of electrons.

87
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,959
So for hydrogen, with just one electron it's
1s1. For fluorine it's 1s2 2s2 2p5.

88
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,939
Now as we move to the third row, an interesting
thing happens;

89
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:28,360
the third shell adds a third kind of orbital: the five part harmony, with ten electrons, of the d-orbital.

90
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,699
But you might be saying, "There's still only
eight elements in the third row.

91
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:34,319
What's up with that, Hank?
It's all lies, I'm leaving!"

92
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,920
OK calm down, the atomic symphony composes
itself in peculiar ways.

93
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,340
Because building the 3d orbital requires a
lot of energy,

94
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:48,739
electrons actually go into the s-orbital of the fourth shell, 4s, before going into the third shell's d-orbital.

95
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,960
This is actually a trend that continues, and to remember it just write out the following on a piece of paper --

96
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,359
these are the orbitals we know and all the
shells that we've seen exist.

97
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,540
To figure out what order to fill them in,
you just draw a diagonal line from the top right
to the bottom left as you go.

98
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:13,860
So 1s first, then 2s, then 2p 3s, then 3p
4s, 3d 4p 5s, 4d 5p 6s, and so on.

99
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,840
Armed with this knowledge you could write out the electron configuration for pretty much any element on the table.

100
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:26,979
Iron, number twenty-six, would be 1s2 2s2
2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d6.

101
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,960
Now there are a couple of elements that have weird electron shells, but you can just look it up on Google.

102
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,219
An interesting thing about d-orbitals, and
the even bigger, more electron rich f-orbitals,

103
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,160
is they don't really need to be filled quite
as much as the s and p's,

104
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,100
because they're literally shielded beneath
the s-orbitals of the next shell.

105
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,160
The s and p-orbitals I think of kinda like the trumpets and violins: it's really terrible when they sound bad,

106
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,080
but the base notes, deep and rich, hide a
bit underneath the rest of the orchestra,

107
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,919
just like the d-orbitals literally hide underneath the
s-orbitals that have already filled above them.

108
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,400
Yes these incomplete orbitals affect them,

109
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,709
but because their shielded, these middle of
the chart elements are generally less reactive

110
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:14,069
and happier to bump electrons along from atom
to atom making them conductive,

111
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:18,259
or just hanging out together in big masses
of electron-sharing lumps of metal.

112
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:23,199
So why are orbitals useful when it comes to
understanding how an atom is likely to react?

113
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,969
Well first, it really matters how much energy
is required to remove an electron from an

114
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,380
atom to form a positively charged ion.

115
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,099
This energy is called "ionization energy."

116
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,500
If there are several electrons being removed
this is a step-wise process,

117
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,479
starting with the electron at the highest
energy level, or the outermost one.

118
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,680
Since the outermost electron has the highest energy, there's the least energy necessary to remove it.

119
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,100
More energy is needed to remove the second
furthest one out and so on.

120
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,250
And of course when all the electrons in the
outermost shell are removed

121
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:55,620
there is a really large energy jump necessary to remove an electron from the next shell down

122
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,360
because that shell will be isoelectrically
analogous to a noble gas.

123
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,700
Just like how atoms are isotopically the same when they have the same number of protons and neutrons,

124
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,259
atoms are isoelectrically the same when they
have the same number of electrons.

125
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,960
And just like there's energy associated with removing an electron to form cations, or positively charged ions,

126
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,639
there's energy associated with adding electrons,

127
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,340
usually to fill an orbital to achieve a stable
two or eight electron shell configuration.

128
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,759
Just like with the ionization energy there's a discrete energy jump involved with the adding of an electron.

129
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,840
That energy is called "electron affinity."

130
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,040
Now, you ready for the real mind melter? If
you're following along in your periodic table,

131
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,579
which of course you aren't,

132
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,860
you may have noticed a little something interesting.

133
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,500
On the left-hand side you have your s-orbitals
-- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven s.

134
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,840
In the middle, you got your d's: 3d, 4d, 5d,
6d.

135
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,519
And on the top right, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 6p.

136
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,840
And below of course, in the little island of the lanthanides and actinides, your f-orbitals: 4f and 5f.

137
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,040
And so, with just a glance at your periodic
table you can work out electron configurations

138
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:02,319
and elemental stability and the fundamental,
physical reality of the elements.

139
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,540
That's why this thing is so beautiful to me,

140
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:09,179
because when you get to know it, you see all
those flawed, competing harmonies,

141
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:12,659
and the actions and reactions that occur because
of them,

142
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:19,419
changing their song into something more stable and powerful and eternal together, making everything.

143
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:25,699
Now as I've gone through today's episode I've described electrons mostly in musical terms as vibrating waves,

144
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,920
harmonies in the fabric of the universe and
that's, indeed, how I like to think about them,

145
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,799
but of course, that isn't a complete story.

146
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:39,959
And I have gotten sick of people telling me
that the human brain is incapable of imagining
the reality of the subatomic.

147
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:46,160
So I'm actually just going to serve a big
heaping pile of reality on you right now no matter how odd it turns out to be.

148
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,399
There are, a number of everywhere-permeating
fields in our universe.

149
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,778
One of those, is the electron field.

150
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:57,460
In order for an electron to exist, there has
to be an excitation of the electron field

151
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,600
and we can describe those excitations as waves, just as a wave in the ocean is an excitation of the water.

152
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,740
At any given moment, the electron can be anywhere
within the function of the wave.

153
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,779
But waves are defined not by harsh boundaries, instead they're strong in some areas and weak in others.

154
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,519
The strength of the wave at one certain point
in space determines

155
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,720
how likely it is that you will find an electron
there at any given time if you measure.

156
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,940
And so if we're trying to understand reality,

157
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,920
we should not think of electrons as circling around the nucleus of an atom, like planets around a star,

158
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:33,299
but instead as an excitation around the nucleus,
and the shape of that excitation is the orbital.

159
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,079
Orbitals are precisely the reason that everything
exists.

160
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,400
They are the root, and the key, and the nexus,
and the crux, and the keystone,

161
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,240
and every other metaphor of not just chemistry
but existence.

162
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,279
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry. I hope it blew your mind.

163
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,059
If you were paying attention you now know
about a poor young man who was laughed out

164
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:58,939
of a meeting of snotty scientists because of being far more correct then anyone could ever have imagined.

165
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,600
About a great Dane whose incorrect model of
the atom was pretty amazing anyway.

166
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,649
About electrons as music, and electron shells
and the orbitals they contain.

167
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,259
How to write out electron configurations, what ionization energies and electron affinities are,

168
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,000
and how the periodic table ties all of these
realities together.

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,220
And with all that knowledge now in your head, you know more then 99.9% of the world about electrons.

170
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,050
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by myself,

171
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:30,179
filmed and directed by Michael Aranda, who is also our sound designer, and edited by Nick Jenkins.

172
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,759
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino
an Dr. Heiko Langner.

173
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,840
Katherine Green was our script supervisor
and our graphics team is Thought Cafe.
