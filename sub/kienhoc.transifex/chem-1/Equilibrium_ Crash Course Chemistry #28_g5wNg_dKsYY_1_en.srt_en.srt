1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,138
Life is all about balance.

2
00:00:02,138 --> 00:00:07,238
You want to have a balanced bank account,
balanced diet, balance between work and play,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,878
and a healthy inner ear to keep you from falling
down all the time.

4
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,538
And lots of things can mess up that balance.

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:19,759
One bad night at the cheesecake factory and you might wake up with your finances, social life, and health out of whack.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,280
In science, our word for balance is equilibrium.
You've heard of it.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,800
When the balance of some natural system gets
disrupted, we say that it's out of equilibrium,

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,140
but that's not always a bad thing, because
nature usually finds a way to restore the balance.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,439
Like if a population of deer in a forest suddenly
goes nuts

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,840
and there's too many of them, they'll run
out of food and space,

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,260
and predators will move in and the population will usually fall back to where the habitat can sustain it.

12
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,259
Likewise, there's no reason that I can't enjoy
the occasional hot pocket

13
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,808
without destroying my so-called balanced diet,

14
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,119
I just have to be sure to eat something that wasn't prepared in a salty lard factory to balance it out.

15
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:59,379
We tend to think of chemical reactions as
having a beginning and an end:

16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,460
you start with some reactants, some chemistry happens, and you end up with the products, and that's that.

17
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:09,739
But that's not that, because you don't usually
end up with pure products.

18
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:15,640
Many chemical reactions seek balance too,
and just like us, they have to work through
the stress in order to find it.

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:25,019
[Theme Music]

20
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,420
It's common, because it's usually helpful, to think of chemical reactions as simple straightforward processes,

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,120
but in reality, many reactions never finish.
Ever.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,719
When reactants react to form products, what we usually mean when we talk about chemical reactions,

23
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,560
it's technically called the forward reaction.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,719
But sometimes, there's an opposite reaction that occurs with the products changing back into the reactants.

25
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,920
We call this a reverse reaction.

26
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,329
Now, exactly what kind of reactions do this,
and why,

27
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,278
is hard to describe without busting out some
200 level chemistry kung fu,

28
00:01:58,278 --> 00:02:04,259
but it all goes back to our lesson about Gibb's
free energy and reactions that occur spontaneously.

29
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,680
Reactions are reversible when they can go forward or backward without any extra energy being used.

30
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:13,889
Remember, this isn't just one reaction happening
once, it's billions and trillions of reactions,

31
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:16,779
and some of them might be going one way while
others are going another way.

32
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,419
And when the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, that's called chemical equilibrium.

33
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:27,539
And even though we all like the idea of balance in our lives, in this case it's not always a desirable thing.

34
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:33,359
In fact, most chemists make their living using
tricks to prevent chemical equilibrium,

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,860
to knock it out of whack, maximizing the concentrations
of the chemicals they want to produce

36
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,550
at the expense of the balance that nature
usually seeks.

37
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,530
For example, consider the Haber process for
making ammonia from nitrogen in the air.

38
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,310
When we discussed it as a redox reaction a
few weeks ago,

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,860
we described it as a one way, complete reaction because that's all we needed to understand right then.

40
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,680
But I was lying to you.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,060
Sorry, I'd rather you hear it from me than
out on the streets.

42
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,740
Turns out, the reaction really exists as an
equilibrium.

43
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,600
As nitrogen and hydrogen react to form ammonia,
the concentration of those gases drops,

44
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,199
making them less likely to collide and keep reacting, so the rate of the forward reaction slows down.

45
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,040
At the same time, the concentration of ammonia
rises.

46
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,370
More ammonia molecules are available to break
up into the reactant gases.

47
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,520
And surprise, the rate of the reverse reaction
speeds up.

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,850
Eventually, those processes reach a point
where they happen at the same rate.

49
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,139
At that point, there's no discernible change
in the concentration of any gas.

50
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,309
Nitrogen and hydrogen keep combining to form
ammonia,

51
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,560
while ammonia keeps breaking down into nitrogen
and hydrogen at the same time.

52
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,390
Notice that I did not say that the reaction
stops.

53
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,429
The reaction basically never stops, it's just
that we don't notice any changes at that point,

54
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,439
because everything that happens in one direction is perfectly balanced out by what happens in the other direction.

55
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,840
That's why reactants like this are written with a double arrow, indicating that the process runs both directions.

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,060
Like if I stand on a balanced board, I never
stop moving.

57
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:05,789
I just shift my body back and forth to compensate
for the motion of the board.

58
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:10,979
When it moves left, I move right and vice versa, and by doing that, I'm able to stay upright, hopefully.

59
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,159
But sometimes there is, if you will, a disturbance
in the force,

60
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,689
and as any good Jedi knows, those things must
be put right.

61
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:23,629
Chemical equilibria can be disturbed by changes
in the concentration of one or more substances

62
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,810
or by changes in temperature or pressure.

63
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,149
We describe these changes based on which way
they force the equilibrium.

64
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:33,769
We say a change shifts the reaction to the
right if it tends to make more products form

65
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:36,788
and to the left if it tends to make more reactants
form.

66
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:42,800
This was all summarized nicely by a French chemist named Henry Louis Le Châtelier who was born in Paris in 1850.

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,860
Today, we call call his summary Le Châtelier's
Principle,

68
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,580
and it says that if stress is placed on a
system that is at equilibrium

69
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:53,219
the system will proceed in a direction that
minimizes the stress.

70
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,759
That can happen in several ways.

71
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,069
For starters, changing the concentration of
any substance in a reaction

72
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:01,718
causes it to proceed in whatever direction
restores the former balance.

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,000
For example, once the Haber reaction is at equilibrium if you were to add more nitrogen gas to the mix

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,699
the existing hydrogen would have more nitrogen
to react with.

75
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,120
Thus, it would begin forming more ammonia,

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,050
sending the reaction noticeably to the right
until the reaction balances itself again.

77
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,478
Removing some of the ammonia would have the
same effect.

78
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,109
There would be less ammonia available to break
down,

79
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,968
so the formation of the ammonia would temporarily
exceed the formation of nitrogen and hydrogen,

80
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:31,569
and the reaction would again shift to the
right until the balance is restored.

81
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:34,180
Now here's an ironic side of irony served
up for you.

82
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,900
In 1901, Le Châtelier tried to invent a process for fixing nitrogen to make ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.

83
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:47,120
But he gave up the effort after the experiment caused a huge explosion that killed one of his lab assistants.

84
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,769
8 years later, the German chemist, Fritz Haber,

85
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:55,459
probably the closest the world ever got to a literal evil genius, did just what Le Châtelier was trying to do.

86
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,758
And in contrast to Le Châtelier's despair
at the death of his assistant,

87
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,519
Haber had no problem at all with the fact that his procedure now known as the Haber Process

88
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,899
was used to make chemical explosives which killed hundreds of thousands of people in World Wars I & II.

89
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:11,799
But just to prove that there aren't clear
winners or losers in science,

90
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:15,240
the Haber Process also saved uncounted millions
of lives

91
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,360
because the ability to fix nitrogen has made
chemical fertilizers possible,

92
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,680
and basically revolutionized modern agriculture.

93
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,658
Haber was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize for
his discovery,

94
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:27,949
but 30 years later he was considered by many
to be a war criminal

95
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:33,150
and spent his last years as an object of shame
to his family and hatred for many others.

96
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:37,568
Le Châtelier, meanwhile despite his great
contributions to our understanding of equilibrium,

97
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:43,200
considered his failure to find an efficient method for making ammonia to be the greatest blunder of his scientific career.

98
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,158
One of the key achievements that Haber made
was

99
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:49,788
figuring out a way to continuously remove
ammonia as it was being produced.

100
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:54,118
This allowed the forward reaction to keep
going faster than the reverse reaction.

101
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:57,259
Basically preventing the process from reaching
a state of equilibrium.

102
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,369
But changing concentrations is only one part
or actually one third of the story.

103
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,059
There's also pressure to consider.

104
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,349
When you look at the equation for the Haber
Process, for example,

105
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:10,509
you can see that 4 moles of gas react to form
2 moles of gas.

106
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,169
So the forward reaction decreases the volume
while the reverse reaction increases it.

107
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,419
This is important.

108
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:22,020
Increasing the pressure will then put more stress on the high volume reactants than the low volume products,

109
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,899
so the reaction shifts to the right, producing
more ammonia than it does at low pressure.

110
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:31,500
And indeed, the industrial Haber Process is
done at two hundred atmospheres of pressure.

111
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,588
Decreasing the pressure, meanwhile, has the
opposite effect.

112
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:38,028
The reaction precedes in the direction that
raises the pressure back to where it was before.

113
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:39,749
In this case that's the break-down of ammonia.

114
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:41,789
Toward the left where there are 4 moles of
gas.

115
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:44,598
Solids and liquids aren't affected by pressure
as much,

116
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,439
so the more gasses that are present in the reaction, the greater effect any pressure change will have.

117
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,399
The third and final way to affect the position
of equilibrium is with temperature changes.

118
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,199
It gets a bit complicated up in here,

119
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,339
but basically the thing to keep in mind is that endothermic reactions, which consume heat,

120
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:05,699
are favored if heat is added so higher temperatures
tend to feed endothermic reactions.

121
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:10,758
And by the same token, exothermic reactions,
which release heat fair better at low temperatures.

122
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:17,000
And since exothermic reactions produce heat, that heat tends to favor the reverse endothermic reactions.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,740
So if heat is added to reaction, it forces
the reaction back to the left.

124
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,460
But if heat is removed by cooling the reaction mixture, the reaction will proceed to the right.

125
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:30,259
Now, you may be wondering since battling equilibrium
is what most chemists do for a living,

126
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,259
how they work out the specifics of it.

127
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,679
How do they determine how much of each substance
is present, or how much they need to add,

128
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,120
or what the temperature or pressure should
be when everything is constantly changing.

129
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,259
You probably won't be surprised to learn that
there is math we can do to answer those questions.

130
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:46,870
We'll get into the numbers in our next lesson.

131
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,649
But right now, let's have some fun.

132
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:53,209
I've been talking about the Haber Process because it's a simple reaction, it's an important reaction.

133
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,310
And because it's one of the main reactions
that Le Châtelier studied.

134
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,169
But it's not very interesting to watch.

135
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:03,839
A much more interesting reaction involves 2 different ions of cobalt that reach equilibrium in an endothermic reaction.

136
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,639
As you can see, one of the ions is pink in
aqueous solution and the other is blue.

137
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,830
One stress I can put on this system is the
addition of hydrochloric acid.

138
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,940
This increases the chloride ion concentration and pushes the reaction to the right, the blue side.

139
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,230
And if I add water, the reaction is pushed
right back to the left, pink. Cool, right?

140
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,060
I can also stress the reaction by changing
its temperature.

141
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,459
If I raise the temperature, it's like adding a reactant so the reaction will proceed to the right.

142
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,100
You use it up and turn blue again.

143
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,200
You can probably guess by now that if I lower
the temperature

144
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,720
it's like taking away some reactants so the
reaction proceeds to the left and turns pink.

145
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,330
We could make these colors go back and forth
all day by making changes to the reaction,

146
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,570
but I think you're getting the idea.

147
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,240
Equilibrium isn't about staying the same all
the time,

148
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,789
it's just about keeping your balance as your
circumstances change.

149
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,939
And now it is time for me to go get a nice
Greek salad to help balance out

150
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,700
the corn dogs that I may or may not have eaten
this weekend.

151
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,620
But first thank you for watching this episode
of Crash Course Chemistry.

152
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,870
If you paid attention, you learned that equilibrium
is just a fancy word for balance,

153
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,470
which is a thing that chemical reactions need
just as much as we do.

154
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,379
And that the way they achieve balance is to
compensate for change, not just to stop completely.

155
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,850
You also learned and saw that chemical equilibrium
can be affected by the concentration of substances

156
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,110
their temperatures, and if they're gasses,
their pressure.

157
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,629
Finally, you learned about Le Châtelier's
principle of chemical equilibrium

158
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:26,340
and about his failed attempt to do what Fritz
Haber eventually did.

159
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,870
Invent an efficient process to produce ammonia.

160
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,590
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi Gonzales.

161
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:36,840
This script was edited by Blake de Pastino. And our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko Langner.

162
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,639
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins. Our script supervisor, Katherine Green.

163
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,199
And our sound designer is Michael Aranda.
And of course, our graphic team is Thought Cafe.
