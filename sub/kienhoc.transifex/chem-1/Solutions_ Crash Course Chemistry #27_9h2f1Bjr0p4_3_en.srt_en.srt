1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,158
I want you to think, just for a second about
breathing.

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:05,369
But don't just think about the fact that you
are breathing.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,609
Think about all the variables that have to be just so in order to create the air -- and to make the air breathable.

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,798
So you need oxygen in the air but also if
the air was just oxygen, you would die.

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:18,379
The oxygen has to be mixed with nitrogen and
other gases,

6
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:22,359
and the whole concoction has to be at the right pressure and temperature in order to deliver

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,199
the amount of O2 that you need.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,810
The air that you are breathing is a solution.

9
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:31,379
Also, not to belabor the point, but you are also kind of a solution as well, albeit a sentient one.

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,460
A solution, you'll recall back when we were
doing my dirty laundry,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,890
is a mixture in which the particles of a solute
are dissolved in the particles of a solvent.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,869
So, what's the solvent in air?
Well, whatever there's more of.

13
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,519
So, nitrogen is the solvent and oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, and a bunch of other gases are dissolved in it.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,980
All solutions have the qualities that they
do because of the same 3 properties;

15
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,979
Molecular Structure, Pressure,
and Temperature

16
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:58,488
These are the factors that effect a substances
solubility,

17
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:01,608
the amount of solute that will dissolve per
volume of solvent.

18
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:04,600
Whether we're talking about the air that we
breathe, the water that fish breathe,

19
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:08,579
the bubbles in Coca-Cola, or the toxin in
the tissues of the Japanese puffer fish,

20
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,859
what usually matters most about a solution
is how much solute is in it.

21
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:22,579
[Theme Music]

22
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:28,319
Often, in the lab we use placeholders like 'dilute' and 'concentrated' when talking about solutions.

23
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,699
But those are vague terms, and we should generally
be as precise as possible.

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,519
Here are a few ways to do that.

25
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,479
We could describe a solution by its molarity -- the number of moles of solute per liter of solution;

26
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:45,719
its molality -- the number of moles of solute
per kilogram of solvent; or its mass percent.

27
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,719
The mass percent of a solution is the mass of the solute divided by the mass of the solution all multiplied by 100.

28
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:58,140
So, when a can of your average soft drink has about 33 grams of sugar and a total mass of 355 grams:

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,420
divide the mass of the solute by the mass
of the whole thing times 100

30
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,240
and the mass percent of sugar in the solution
is 9.2%.

31
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,979
Easy-peasy there, but the more interesting
question here is ‘why?’

32
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,579
Why can you even dissolve so much sugar in a can of soda and what about all that carbon dioxide gas?

33
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,079
What’s happening here?

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,820
How does the stuff go in the stuff and where does it go and what’s actually happening at the molecular level?

35
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:24,489
Well, the first thing to keep in mind is that
not every solvent can dissolve every solute.

36
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:28,489
Gas molecules don’t interact that strongly, so gases pretty much always dissolve in each other.

37
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,450
But, liquid solvents have a ton of molecular
interaction.

38
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:36,030
So the structure of the individual molecules
determines whether a substance will dissolve

39
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,610
and how well it will dissolve.

40
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,860
Polarity is, of course, the biggest bit of
this.

41
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,239
For a substance to dissolve, it needs to interact
favorably with the solvent.

42
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,820
This only happens if they have similar polarities which allows them to form cool, in-solution structures,

43
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,090
spacing the solute particles out evenly.

44
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,629
Topic change! Say you’re on a first date,
at a sushi restaurant,

45
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:59,299
and you wanna be all cool and nonchalant and
“I’ll tangle if death if death wants me to.”

46
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,939
So you order the puffer fish, otherwise known
as Fugu.

47
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:06,199
Fugu contains a poison called tetrodotoxin,

48
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,438
and even in the hands of chefs who know what they’re doing, it makes your lips go numb just to taste a bit.

49
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:13,759
If the chef makes a mistake and you eat the
wrong part of the fish,

50
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,099
the tetrodotoxin will mess with your nervous system and cause paralysis, suffocation, maybe some death.

51
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,120
Why? Well, in part because of its polarity.
And yours.

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,640
Tetrodotoxin is covered on its surface with
polar alcohol and Amin groups.

53
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,639
So, it dissolves easily in polar solvents
like water.

54
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,269
And who’s made mostly of water?

55
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,870
So, if you watch Crash Course Biology, you
know all about sodium channels,

56
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,430
the tunnels on the outside of nerve cells
that allow them to communicate with each other.

57
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,689
Well, tetrodotoxin is really good at binding
to those channels,

58
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,409
messing up your nervous system, and killing
you.

59
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:49,629
Because it’s so polar, and your body’s
just one big aqueous solution,

60
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,329
tetrodotoxin has free reign to just jump on
every sodium pump you got.

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,620
Now, onto the next attribute that affects
solubility.

62
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,819
Let’s assume you’ve survived your first
course of your meal and you order a soda-pop.

63
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:05,119
To get all those bubbles that make carbonated
beverages so refreshing and tingly,

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,780
carbon dioxide must be dissolved in the water.

65
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,039
But how do you shove a gas into a liquid?

66
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:15,579
A gas gets dissolved into a solution the same
way David Bowie and Freddy Mercury collaborate.

67
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:17,478
[sings] Under pressure.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,640
What? As previously noted, I am old!

69
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,979
It’s not just the pressure outside of the solvent, it’s the partial pressure of the solute.

70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,220
Quick review: partial pressure is the portion of pressure caused by the gas we’re interested in.

71
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,200
In this case, carbon dioxide.

72
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,009
Gas molecules, as long as they have kinetic
energy, are going to want to escape the solution,

73
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,500
so they will be creating an upward pressure
on the surrounding gas.

74
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,360
In order to keep the CO2 dissolved,

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,560
the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and
the gas outside the solution has to be equal to,

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,240
or higher than the pressure of the carbon dioxide molecules pushing their way out of the solution.

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,449
That’s why soda bottles are nice and taut
when you squeeze them.

78
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,599
That little bit of gas up there is pressurized
carbon dioxide.

79
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,260
And, also why, when you open the can a huge rush of carbon dioxide molecules bubble out of the soda.

80
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:04,399
Because the normal partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere isn’t enough to keep it from escaping.

81
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,250
So, to get the carbon dioxide in there,

82
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,149
all you need to do is dramatically increase
the pressure of CO2 outside the liquid.

83
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:12,899
And this is what’s done in soda manufacturing
plants.

84
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,759
In fact, if you have a SodaStream, you can
do it right in your own home.

85
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,430
Now it’s easy to calculate this change in
pressure thanks to William Henry,

86
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,639
a friend of John Dalton of Dalton’s Law
of Partial Pressures.

87
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,919
According to Henry’s Law, the concentration of a dissolved gas equals the partial pressure above the solution

88
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,370
multiplied by a constant that expresses the
solubility of the gas in that solution.

89
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,439
And we can use Henry’s Law to figure out how much carbon dioxide is dissolved in our can of soda.

90
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:45,699
The pressure of CO2 in a can is 5.0 atmospheres and you can look up the solubility of CO2 in an aqueous solution.

91
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,219
3.4 times 10 to the negative 2 moles per liter
atmosphere.

92
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,680
So the concentration of dissolved CO2 in 0.17
moles per liter.

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,829
Now, there are 355 milliliters or 0.355 liters
of cola in a can.

94
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:02,169
How much volume would that CO2 take up at
normal atmospheric conditions?

95
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:08,580
Whip out your trusty ideal gas law and we
find that atmospheric pressure and 298 kelvins,
or room temperature,

96
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,620
0.060 moles of carbon dioxide will expand
to about 1 and a half liters.

97
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,540
That’s a lot of burps, something else to
keep in mind on date night.

98
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,580
Finally, in addition to polarity an pressure, it’s temperature that affects solubility in the most complicated,

99
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,279
and therefore interesting ways.

100
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,520
When we’re dealing with solid solutes and
liquid solvents,

101
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,000
their total solubility generally goes up as
temperature increases.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,160
This is a fact that you already know if you’ve tried to put a bunch of sugar into your iced coffee.

103
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,790
The solubility of gases, on the other hand,
is the exact opposite

104
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,170
because colder molecules have less kinetic energy and are less likely to escape the surface of the liquid.

105
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,870
So, the upward pressure they exert is lower
than it would be in a hot liquid.

106
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,480
That’s why it’s safer and cleaner to open a can of soda-pop when it’s cold rather than when it’s hot.

107
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,120
While this phenomenon might result in a bit
of mess in your house,

108
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:00,019
it’s a much bigger deal for fish, who need
oxygen dissolved in water to, like, breathe.

109
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:06,039
At 4 degrees Celsius the solubility of oxygen in water is about double that of what it is at 25 degrees Celsius.

110
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,139
Trout, here in Montana, are highly evolved
to that nice, oxygen rich water.

111
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,410
But summer heat waves can cause the amount
of oxygen in the water to drop dramatically,

112
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,630
and cold-water fish can get pretty unhappy.
Also, a little dead.

113
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:23,889
Fortunately for Fugu, it’s a tropical fish,
so it’s perfectly evolved for 25 degree water.

114
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,668
And unfortunately for all of us, that brings us the end of this episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

115
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:30,839
If you’ve been paying attention today you
learned:

116
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,410
that solutions can be described in terms of
molarity, molality, or mass percent;

117
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:41,040
that polar solvents tend to dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents tend to dissolve nonpolar solutes;

118
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,080
you also learned about Henry’s Law which
states that the concentration of dissolved gas

119
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,269
equals the partial pressure of that gas above
the solution multiplied by a constant;

120
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,969
and that there are a lot of burps in every
single can of coke.

121
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,620
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
