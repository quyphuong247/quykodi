1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,719
By now, you're probably starting to see how
chemistry can change your view of the world.

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:10,218
Chemistry explains everything you can see, how it looks, the way it feels, why it behaves the way it does,

3
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,548
by describing everything that you can't see.

4
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:17,308
It helps us understand the biggest stuff in the universe by helping us understand the tiniest.

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,669
And that's why chemistry can be kind of hard
to understand sometimes.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,130
Because we are, on a chemical scale, huge.

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:29,829
Chemistry traffics in infinitesimal particles,
but we are made of quadrillions of those things.

8
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:34,929
They are the building blocks of mass; we are
literally massive.

9
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:39,390
So mass is how we massive beings tend to understand
the world.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,600
In our day-to-day dealings with substances,

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,500
we need to have some sense of how much of it there is before we can use it or predict how it's going to act.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,340
For example, chemistry will be happy to tell me that the atomic structure of the sugar in this packet is

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,700
12 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen atoms, and 11
oxygen atoms in every molecule.

14
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,960
But I don't have any idea how many molecules
of sugar I want to put in my tea!

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,099
Or how that one molecule will react with other
chemicals in my body.

16
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:12,079
To understand that kind of stuff, I need to know the mass of the sugar that I'm dealing with.

17
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,319
In other words, I need to measure it.

18
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,029
And that, is why there's stoichiometry,

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,710
the science of measuring chemicals that go
into and come out of any given reaction.

20
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,728
In Greek, it literally means measuring elements,

21
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:30,289
and, in essence, it allows us to count up
atoms and molecules by weighing them.

22
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:35,948
Stoichiometry, yes, contains a fair bit of math, but it's one of the most important decoders that we have as chemists.

23
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:40,298
It's what we use to translate from the very
small to the very big,

24
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:44,340
to parley the stuff that we can't see into
the stuff that we can.

25
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,460
And because of that, chemists use it all the
time.

26
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:55,879
Including, yes, for sweetening your tea.
Ow... hot. It's... it's quite hot.

27
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:05,579
[Theme Music]

28
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,060
Now if you've been with me for a couple of weeks, and I do hope you have, you're probably thinking to yourself,

29
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,439
"Wait, wait, now, don't... don't we already
have a way of measuring elements?"

30
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,879
And you're right.
We do.

31
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,639
The real coin of the realm when it comes to measuring stuff in chemistry is relative atomic mass.

32
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,419
The average atomic mass of all of the naturally
occurring isotopes of a given element.

33
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:30,210
So for example, all of the natural carbon
on earth occurs as one of 3 and only 3 isotopes:

34
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,730
C-12, C-13, and C-14.

35
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:35,750
They all have six protons, but the number
of neutrons vary.

36
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,300
And these isotopes show up on our planet in
totally different proportions.

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,080
So the relative atomic mass of carbon is a weighted average of these three masses, which comes out to 12.01.

38
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,569
But 12.01 what?

39
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:53,628
Well, remember when we're talking about units of measurement, we're talking about arbitrary talk.

40
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:58,489
Most, units, except for the ones that we use to measure time, aren't based on any real, objective value.

41
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:04,088
We just pick a unit, like the kilogram, and we agree for a standard on what a kilogram is, and then we run with it.

42
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,620
The same goes for atomic mass. We measure
atomic mass in atomic mass units.

43
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,879
We made them up, and the value for a
single amu is -- bear with me now --

44
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,280
1/12th of the mass of an atom of carbon-12.

45
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,240
Why?
Funny story.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,900
Until the mid-1800s, chemists in different parts of the world used different yardsticks for measuring elements.

47
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,800
One of the most intuitive and therefore most common was to use the smallest, simplest element, hydrogen, as a base line.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,320
But in the 1850s, some chemists, led by German
Wilhelm Ostwald, proposed using oxygen instead.

49
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,139
They preferred oxygen mainly because it combined
readily with so many other elements,

50
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,459
so they figured it would be easier to determine
the weights of lots of compounds.

51
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,659
So a bunch of guys stroked their beards, agonized
over this for years,

52
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:52,359
until in 1903, they decided that atomic weight, as it was called, should be measured in 1/16ths of an oxygen atom.

53
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Until in 1912, isotopes were discovered and
chemists realized that you can't talk about

54
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,620
an element like it's all the same thing!

55
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,620
It turned out there was an oxygen-16, and
an oxygen-17, and an oxygen-18!

56
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,319
And suddenly, everyone was walking around like, "I don't know how much this such weighs anymore!"

57
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,019
This was so crazily disruptive that it took
another 50 years of strokey-beard meetings

58
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,830
for everyone to decide to use another standard
-- carbon-12.

59
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,669
Like oxygen, carbon is common, and kind of promiscuous, when it comes to what it bonds with.

60
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,548
And since it has 12 protons and neutrons,

61
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:26,228
the mass of other, similar elements would
be expressed as some fraction of it.

62
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:32,519
So, since 1961, science has pegged one amu
as 1/12th of an atom of carbon-12.

63
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,560
Which means that carbon has a relative atomic
mass of 12.01 amu.

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,338
Oxygen, 16 amu, and hydrogen, 1.008 amu.
So that's how we way atoms.

65
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:46,118
But, none of this solves my tea sweetening
problem.

66
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,660
Like, I don't know how many amus of these molecules together are going to make this taste good to me,

67
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,819
or how many other molecules of sugar I can consume while maintaining my slim yet robust physique.

68
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,400
This doesn't happen by itself, you know.

69
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,968
And in order to make these calculations and
predict reactions,

70
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:07,360
I first need to be able to convert the atomic mass of this sugar, into a standard amount of substance.

71
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,658
Not weight, not volume, just purely, objective
amount of stuff. You heard me, stuff.

72
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,840
That, my friends, is what moles are for. Not
those moles, though those are nice-looking moles.

73
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:23,058
A mole is arguably the most important unit
in all of chemistry,

74
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:26,999
because it allows us to express a chemical's
atomic mass in terms of grams.

75
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:32,539
And to define what a mole is, no matter what
it's a mole of, we use our old standby, carbon-12.

76
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:38,088
There are 6.022 x 1023 atoms in 12 grams of
carbon-12,

77
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,548
and by definition, that number of anything
is a mole of that thing.

78
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:48,528
That's a lot, and it is known as Avogadro's number, one of the most important constants in chemistry,

79
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:51,769
and although Avogadro isn't the one that arrived
at this number,

80
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:56,889
it's named in his honor because he used this
basic principle of comparing amounts of substances

81
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,509
to first weigh atoms and molecules.

82
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:01,300
So there are this many carbon atoms in a mole
of carbon-12

83
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,189
and there are the same number of anything
in a mole of anything else.

84
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:11,189
Like a dozen roses is twelve roses, but a
mole of roses is 6.022 x 1023 roses,

85
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,659
which would be enough roses to cover the surface
of the earth quite deep.

86
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:20,838
A mole of sand would be 6.022 x 1023 grains of sand and if they were each one millimeter long,

87
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:25,158
a mole of them would stretch 100 quadrillion kilometers.

88
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,820
So you get the picture, it's a big number,
but in chemistry the thing to remember is this:

89
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:37,759
a mole of any element contains 6.022 x 1023
atoms of that element no matter what.

90
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:43,098
This is what lets us translate number of atoms
into grams. It lets us weigh the elements.

91
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,619
All right, follow me here.

92
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:49,849
One mole of carbon-12 contains 6.022 x 1023
atoms and weighs 12 grams, right?

93
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:55,368
So one mole of oxygen also contains 6.022
x 1023 atoms but because oxygen atoms are

94
00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:02,320
more massive it weighs 16 grams and you'll recall that oxygen's relative atomic mass is 16 amus.

95
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,079
The number of atoms per mole remains the same,

96
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:08,978
but the mass of a mole depends on the average
mass of the element.

97
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:13,498
This simply means that one mole of any element
equals its relative atomic mass in grams.

98
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:19,919
So now you've got it, 1 mole of hydrogen weighs
1.008 g, a mole of iron is 55.85 g,

99
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,379
and a mole of natural carbon is 12.01 grams.

100
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,699
This is known as an element's molar mass.

101
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:30,499
And now that we know the molar mass of elements
we can calculate the molar mass of any compound.

102
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:34,719
All we have to do is add up the molar masses
of its component elements.

103
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:39,759
So for instance, the formula for this sugar
or sucrose is C12H22O11.

104
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,778
One mole of sucrose, by definition contains
6.022 x 1023 molecules,

105
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:50,659
and since each molecule contains 12 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms and 11 oxygen atoms,

106
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:57,580
then one mole of sucrose contains 12 moles of carbon, 22 moles of hydrogen, and 11 moles of oxygen.

107
00:07:57,588 --> 00:08:01,488
Multiply the number of moles of each element
by its molar mass and add them all up,

108
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:03,439
that's the molar mass of the whole compound.

109
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,139
See, the mole is like our chemical Rosetta
Stone;

110
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:11,639
with it, we can translate anything from the level of atoms and molecules to the level of grams and kilograms.

111
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,939
And we can use it to describe not only elements
and compounds, but reactions.

112
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:20,199
And you don't need a lab full of samples to
do it, just a pencil and a calculator.

113
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,620
To get back to my tea problem, let's say, y'know, hypothetically, that I'm watching my weight,

114
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,120
so I want to know what it'll take for me to
burn a certain amount of sugar that I consume.

115
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,479
That's a reaction!
And it's a pretty simple one.

116
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,120
My body uses sucrose by combining it with oxygen to create energy plus CO2 and H20 as waste.

117
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,778
You can write this out as an equation,

118
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:41,860
in which the reactants combine on the left
to yield the products on the right.

119
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,818
But there's a problem here: this equation
doesn't reflect chemical reality.

120
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:49,278
During a reaction, bonds are broken and new
ones are formed but the number of atoms of

121
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,818
each element remains the same.

122
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:53,929
The sugar and oxygen molecules may be busted
apart and mixed up,

123
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:59,259
but the number of each kind of atom that you start with ends up being exactly the same after the reaction.

124
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:00,879
Conservation of mass, yo.

125
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,629
So when writing a reaction out as an equation,

126
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:06,519
the number of atoms of each element has to
be exactly the same on both sides.

127
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,060
Reconciling the reactants with the products
is called equation balancing,

128
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,599
and it's a good bit of what stoichiometry
is all about.

129
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,290
Because from a chemical perspective an unbalanced
equation is pretty useless.

130
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,149
It doesn't tell you how much is going in and
how much is coming out.

131
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,850
Without balancing the equation it's like saying,

132
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,460
"When a mommy and a daddy love each other very much, a baby appears and that's all you need to know."

133
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,980
But that's not all you need to know!

134
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,669
So how do you do it? Not make a baby, balance
an equation. I did biology last year.

135
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:37,708
Well the best way is to start with the most
complicated molecule, which in this case is,

136
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,138
of course, the sucrose.

137
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:43,778
For every molecule of sucrose that goes into the reaction, you know that you're gonna have 12 carbon atoms,

138
00:09:43,778 --> 00:09:49,259
so right off the bat you know that you're gonna have to end up with at least 12 molecules of CO2 as a product,

139
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,319
because that's the only molecule where those
carbon atoms end up.

140
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:53,929
Now let's deal with the hydrogen,

141
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:58,378
because that also shows up in only one molecule
on both sides of the equation so that's easier.

142
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,659
You know that at least 22 atoms of hydrogen
go into the reaction

143
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:07,159
and the product contains some multiple of 2 hydrogen atoms (that's the H2 in the water molecule).

144
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:09,750
So if there were 11 water molecules produced,

145
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,929
that would balance the hydrogen with 22 hydrogen
atoms on each side.

146
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,609
Finally, the oxygen.

147
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,480
Since we know we have 12 CO2 molecules and
11 water molecules as products so far,

148
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,430
we also know that we're gonna end up with
thirty-five oxygen atoms.

149
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:25,888
If you look at your reactants, on the left,
you see that you have 11 oxygen atoms in the

150
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,568
sucrose molecule and 2 in the molecular oxygen,
O2.

151
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:34,419
The carbon and hydrogen are balancing nicely with only one molecule of sucrose, so let's leave that alone.

152
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:36,828
But there could be any number of paired oxygen
atoms involved.

153
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:40,269
Since you need 35 and you know you have 11
to start with in the sucrose,

154
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:45,120
you just need 24 more, which would equal 12
molecules of O2.

155
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,909
And now, the equation is balanced! You know
exactly what my body is producing.

156
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:55,250
For every molecule of sucrose I'm metabolizing I have to inhale 12 molecules of oxygen and in return,

157
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,350
in addition to a little sugar buzz, I'll produce 12 molecules of carbon dioxide and 11 molecules of water.

158
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:07,200
This is incredibly useful in helping us to understand the proportions of chemicals as they react at the molecular level.

159
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,639
But in a lab, or in life, you have to work
with measurable amounts of stuff,

160
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,899
so the last stoichiometric trick you need
up your sleeve is to calculate specific masses

161
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,519
of the reactants and products.

162
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,299
So for instance, how much oxygen will I need
to inhale in order to burn 5 grams of sugar?

163
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:25,189
To figure that out, we just need to focus
on the left part of the equation,

164
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,279
because we only need to quantify the reactants.

165
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,028
First, convert your balanced equation into
molar masses;

166
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:33,879
in order to get from molecules to grams, you
need to go through moles first.

167
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,379
When you figure out the molar masses, you see that the ratio of sucrose to oxygen is actually pretty close:

168
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:42,519
384 grams of oxygen for every 342.3 grams
of sucrose.

169
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,490
Then you simply compare this ratio to the
masses of reactants in your experiment,

170
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:52,198
5 grams of sugar to X grams of oxygen, and
hopefully you know how to solve for X.

171
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:57,088
For every 5 grams of sugar I ingest I'll need
to inhale 5.6 grams of oxygen,

172
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,160
which I happen to know is about 35 breaths'
worth.

173
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,278
So as long as I manage to stay alive for the
next minute and a half or so,

174
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,538
I'll manage to burn off this five grams of
sugar. Down the hatch!

175
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:12,539
Today, we learned about two of the most important units of measure in chemistry, atomic mass units and moles.

176
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:16,779
We also learned how to calculate molar mass and how to balance a chemical equation and finally,

177
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:22,039
we talked about how to use molar ratios to calculate the amount of stuff that goes in and out of a reaction.

178
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,588
