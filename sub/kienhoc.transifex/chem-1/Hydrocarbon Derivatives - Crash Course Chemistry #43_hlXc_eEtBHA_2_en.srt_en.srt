1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
The smell of cinnamon and rotting cadavers...

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,919
Compounds that can remove nail polish, power a car, knock you unconscious, or make your headache go away.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,240
All of these things can be accomplished by simple organic compounds with different functional groups sticking off of them!

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,980
Yes, I said functional groups! We will be
talking about them a lot today.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,339
Now, when chemists started studying this stuff,

6
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:22,820
they didn't always know what really made one
chemical different from another.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,640
Only that certain compounds, though different,
often behave similarly.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,760
Some smelled like fish, some had relatively
high boiling points,

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,460
some reacted in similar ways with the same
compounds.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,740
Now, however, we know better!

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,929
We know what they are, where they come from,
and why they act the way they do.

12
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,820
We are DEEP in the knowledge of organic chemistry's
most powerful tools!

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,399
It feels good in here!

14
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,920
So dive in, join me in this solution of ethers
and esters and aldehydes and amines and alcohols,

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,060
but, like, not literally because that would
be super gross and you would probably die.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:02,420
[Theme Music]

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,340
Thus far, we have only discussed organic compounds involving carbon and hydrogen and nothing else.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,540
And yes, carbon and hydrogen are the backbone
of organic chemistry.

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:16,480
In fact, 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional combinations of carbon atoms are the backbone of most organic compounds.

20
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,908
But today we're going to throw a couple of
newcomers into the mix,

21
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:22,169
two of my very favorites:
oxygen and nitrogen.

22
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:27,348
Using these two extra elements, we're going to talk about seven exciting and different functional groups.

23
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:32,299
But first, what is a functional group?
Sounds super boring.

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,350
Well organic chemistry is the architecture
of chemistry.

25
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,949
With it, we don't just study chemicals, we
build them.

26
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,829
And we know that certain groups of bonded
atoms function in very specific ways.

27
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,978
Since we know how these functional groups
function, we (and by we I mean the human race)

28
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,158
can add to or modify or remove and join them
together in predictable ways.

29
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,239
And thus, we can build the compounds we need, whether it be the simple stuff, like acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin,

30
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,399
or something more complicated, like alpha-(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolyl)cobamidcyanide,

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,660
better known as vitamin B12.
Neat, right?

32
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,439
When we talk about functional groups, we get
so focused on those small areas of the molecule,

33
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,479
that the rest of the molecule doesn't actually
matter that much.

34
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,519
So we use "R" to represent the rest.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,240
R just represents any fragment of organic molecule that we're not super concerned with at the moment.

36
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,580
We also sometimes call the area of unconcern
the "R group"

37
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,670
as opposed to the "functional group" where
the business is getting done.

38
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:28,109
So now that I've been talking at you for like,
three minutes,

39
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,790
let's actually look at what kind of trouble nitrogen and oxygen can get up to in an organic compound.

40
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:38,849
The first and most familiar oxygen-based functional
group is the alcohol, a terminal "-OH".

41
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,719
Not terminal in that it will kill you, though
ethanol can kill you,

42
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:47,259
and other alcohols like methanol absolutely WILL kill you, but terminal in that it ends a carbon chain.

43
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:51,019
Now, what happens when you dehydrogenate an
alcohol?

44
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,320
Not when an alcohol dehydrates you -- that would be a hangover -- but we dehydrogenate it.

45
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,139
In a chemical reaction, removing the hydrogen from the oxygen and creating a double bond to the carbon.

46
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,779
That dehydrogenated alcohol is an aldehyde,
literally from "alcohol dehydrogenated."

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,840
Alcohols and aldehydes have a lot of similar properties because of the electronegativity of the oxygen.

48
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,120
Hydrocarbons on their own are actually pretty
dang boring.

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,800
Checking out our electronegativity chart,

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,080
you can see that the difference in electronegativity
between C and H is only 0.35,

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,100
so there's no real regions of negative or
positive charges in the molecules.

52
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,859
Therefore, these simple hydrocarbons are pretty
nonpolar

53
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,789
and their electrons are distributed evenly
over the molecule, which is why, you know,

54
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,139
oil and water don't mix.

55
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,359
Adding those oxygens mixes stuff up.

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
Electrons start clumping, the oxygen-hydrogen
bond of an alcohol is fairly polar,

57
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,149
with a difference in electronegativity between
"O" and "H" of 1.22,

58
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,760
so the oxygen gets a delta minus (δ-) and
the hydrogen gets a delta plus (δ+).

59
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,849
Not only does this make alcohols and aldehydes
more likely to be soluble in water,

60
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,829
but it completely changes the kind of chemistry
you can do with them.

61
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,710
Impending confusion alert!

62
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,620
There can be functional groups inside of functional
groups.

63
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,000
We've already seen two of them.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,120
If an OH is part of a larger functional group,
we'll refer to it as a Hydroxyl,

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,140
and if a carbon double bonded to an oxygen it's part of a larger group, we call that a carbonyl.

66
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:13,439
For example if we have a carbonyl bonded to a Hydroxyl, that, my friends, is a Carboxylic Acid.

67
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
Hopefully you're getting the hang of the lingo.

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,040
Just looking at this Carboxylic Acid thing, if you think about the electronegativity of those two oxygens,

69
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,150
you can imagine that that hydrogen there is
gonna be pretty weakly held.

70
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:25,269
And so it can dissociate in solution, making
it an acid.

71
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:29,389
Carboxylic Acids are the acid part of amino
acids, which make up proteins,

72
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,719
which make up, you, so they're pretty important.

73
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,240
The simplest carboxylic acid, commonly known as Formic acid, is what makes fire ant bites burn,

74
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,560
and just one more carbon and you get Acetic
acid, or vinegar,

75
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,600
which, even in a diluted solution you have in your cupboard, is not something you want to get in your eyes.

76
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,120
Now, Acetic acid is also interesting because
once upon a time,

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,120
a clever chemist called Leopold Gmelin did
some chemistry

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,970
and knocked off the OH group and joined the
carbonyl with another carbon.

79
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,270
The result was a non-terminal, or internal,
carbonyl.

80
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:00,709
He named that stuff 'acetone', meaning basically
'derived from Acetic acid'.

81
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:04,099
Now, acetone is just a name of that one chemical,
not the functional group itself.

82
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,960
To get that, we knock the 'A' off and harden
that 'C' into a 'K' and get a 'Ketone'.

83
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,719
So yeah, when we have a carbonyl in the middle of a carbon chain, that is a ketone functional group.

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,900
Acetone has a ketone group and it's called 'acetone' because it was derived from acetic acid,

85
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,839
which is vinegar, the most common carboxylic
acid in your kitchen.

86
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,830
I swear, if you watch this episode twice,
you will understand.

87
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:30,039
Acetone, with that big hunk and double bond is nice and polar, so it's water soluble; great for cleaning stuff.

88
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,939
The hydrogen bonds between that oxygen and
those outer hydrogens are enough

89
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:37,540
to keep the molecules bound together so it's
not gaseous at room temperature.

90
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,780
It's also stable enough that it isn't very
toxic.

91
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,009
In fact, there's a little bit of acetone in
your blood right now,

92
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,709
which is why it's safe enough to use as nail
polish remover.

93
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:49,370
It is, however, unstable enough that you don't
want to get it near any open flames.

94
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,240
Now we only have two more oxygen-based functional
groups that we're gonna talk about,

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,250
These are groups that have internal oxygens
bonded directly to carbons.

96
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,870
When you see it now in the middle of the chain
like this it's either an ether or an ester,

97
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,050
either ester or ether, ether or ester, either
one, one or the other, either ether or ester.

98
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,500
Ethers have just one oxygen all alone in the
middle of that carbon chain.

99
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,199
Esters, on the other hand, I focus on that
'S' noise, making me think it must be plural,

100
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,959
because they have two oxygens: one in the
middle of the chain and one as part of a carbonyl.

101
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,239
Esters are just like a ketone mixed with an
ether.

102
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,420
In fact, if you look at all these oxygen based functional groups you'll see that they're all very closely related.

103
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,480
Aldehydes are just dehydrogenated alcohols, ketones are just aldehydes bonded to R-groups on both sides

104
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,360
(instead of a hydrogen on one side).

105
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,350
While carboxylic acids are ketones bonded
to an OH group instead of an R group,

106
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,500
and ethers are just alcohols bonded to an
R-group instead of a hydrogen.

107
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,449
Now I did promise you some nitrogen at the
beginning,

108
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,169
and I apologize to all of you die-hard nitrogen
fans for having given you none so far.

109
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:48,839
Let's just say that the amine is ever so simple,
just a terminal NH2 group.

110
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,870
Remember, ammonia is NH3, so that "am" from
ammonia gets stuck onto that amine group.

111
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,319
Amines are super stinky: two of my favorites
are putrescine and cadaverine.

112
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:04,560
And yes, they are found in abundance in rotting carcasses of animals and yes, they smell super terrible.

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,220
And those are the seven functional groups
that we're going to talk about.

114
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,080
It was super fun, for me anyway, but I am,
I admit, kind of a huge dork.

115
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,859
Organic compounds that include these functional
groups have various wonderful names:

116
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,660
wood alcohol, cinnamaldehyde, and cadaverine.

117
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,540
It's lovely, right? Well chemists want more out of their names than wit and charm. They're too clever for that.

118
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,580
Which is why, next week we'll be talking about
how to figure out how to name these compounds,

119
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,139
and if we have the name, how to figure out
what the compounds are.

120
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,579
Thanks for watching this week's episode of
Crash Course Chemistry.

121
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,919
If you were paying attention, you learned that alcohols are organic compounds with hydroxyl groups,

122
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,240
if you dehydrogenate them, the hydroxyl converts
to a carbonyl

123
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,620
and they become dehydrogenated alcohols or
aldehydes.

124
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,600
If a carbonyl bonds to a hydroxyl, the functional group becomes acidic and it becomes a carboxylic acid,

125
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,540
the most common of which is acetic acid, which if you switch the hydroxyl out for a methyl group,

126
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:03,540
becomes acetone and if that 'C' were a 'K' noise, it'd be a ketone, which is what acetone is.

127
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,060
Finally, a carbon chain with an internal oxygen
is either an ether or an ester,

128
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,470
and it's only an ester if it's bonded to a
carbonyl.

129
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,300
And of course, anything with an NH2 group
is an amine.
