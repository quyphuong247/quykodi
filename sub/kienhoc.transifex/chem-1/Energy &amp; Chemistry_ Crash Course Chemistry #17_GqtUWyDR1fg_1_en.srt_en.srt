1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,840
I have a certain fondness for saying everything
is chemicals,

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,419
mostly this is because I'm tired of all the
people complaining about all the "chemicals"

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:12,379
that they are exposed to when literally everything
you have ever been exposed to,

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,580
including the most organically grown lettuce
is composed entirely of chemicals.

5
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:20,149
But when I say everything is chemicals, I
am in fact wrong.

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,259
There are quite a lot of things that aren't
chemicals:

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,800
sound, heat, laser beams, the existential
concept of selfness...rainbows.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,820
All of those things are things.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,299
And all of the things and also all other things
are, in fact

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,559
-- oh god this is weird but it's true --
they're all the same thing: energy.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,480
Everything is energy.

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:48,899
[Theme Music]

13
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,378
Let's talk about trebuchets.

14
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:52,149
The trebuchet was a weapon of war,

15
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:58,029
but it is also a feat of ancient engineering so I remember it for that instead of for all the people it killed.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,198
Well, I happen to have a very small one that
I built from a kit, because I'm a nerd.

17
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:05,420
This tiny trebuchet contains quite a lot of
energy.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,269
In fact, more than you might suspect.

19
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,618
And because we are humans and we like to understand
stuff,

20
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:13,030
we shall put the energy it contains into a
bunch of different boxes.

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,960
Let's start with the least obvious one: its mass, since, as Einstein told us, energy and mass are the same thing.

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,718
Now we're not gonna go into detail there,

23
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,078
instead we'll just say that the energy is well and locked up and extremely difficult to access

24
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:28,449
because the nuclear energy of the wood is
not easy to release.

25
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,450
Which is excellent, because the nuclear energy
of this trebuchet, if released,

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,609
could destroy the entire building that I'm
sitting in.

27
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:37,748
This little war machine also has thermal energy;

28
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:42,420
anything warmer than absolute zero has thermal
energy, even very very cold things.

29
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:47,009
This basically means that all of the individual
atoms and molecules are jiggling imperceptibly.

30
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,700
Only at absolute zero would they stop jiggling.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,620
If I were to touch it then my hand would instantly
freeze and then fall off of me.

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,240
Absolute zero is very cold.

33
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,709
It also has chemical energy, which is stored
in the bonds between the atoms.

34
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:04,459
All of the bonds in the molecules of cellulose
and lignin that make up the wood contain energy,

35
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,849
and some of them could be broken, releasing
that energy,

36
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,829
which is what would happen if I lit my trebuchet
on fire,

37
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,390
which I will not do because it took like four
hours to put together.

38
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:14,969
Now none of those forms of energy are the forms of energy that the ancient generals were interested in,

39
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:19,109
of course, but I wanted to illustrate how
much energy really is in there.

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,870
What the ancient generals were interested in was the system's gravitational potential energy,

41
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,259
because this heavy thing here which is full
of pennies

42
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:27,640
-- oh God, that's dangerous --

43
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,969
this thing is heavy, it's full of pennies,
and it has been lifted up, and the force of

44
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,158
gravity is trying to pull it back down.

45
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:36,169
This stored gravitational energy is a form
of potential energy;

46
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:39,839
that is, energy contained within a system
because of its position.

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,819
This does not mean that it has the potential
to become energy.

48
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:46,018
It is energy.
It's just stored.

49
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,370
If it wasn't there, and then it was, then
you would be creating energy.

50
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,120
And as we all know, you cannot create energy.

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,030
Like, we all do know that, right?

52
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,750
It's the first law of thermodynamics, also
known as the law of conservation of energy,

53
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,090
which is a real, hard and fast, not just unbreakable
but unbendable law of physics.

54
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,759
Energy cannot be created and it cannot be
destroyed.

55
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,250
The amount of energy in the universe is constant.

56
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,628
And since everything is energy, the amount of everything in the universe is constant, which is a little bit trippy.

57
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:21,109
Deep thoughts like that one are what formalized
the study of energy into what we call thermodynamics,

58
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,439
the branch of science studying heat, energy,
and the ability of that energy to do work.

59
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,919
Okay, now I just said three words that you think you know the definition of but you probably don't.

60
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,339
That's okay, you're gonna be wrong many times
in your life, this is just one of them.

61
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,229
So, what were those words?

62
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:40,649
Energy. I know that you don't know what energy
is, because, like, I don't either.

63
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,879
Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman
said:

64
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,658
"it is important to realize that in physics today we have no knowledge of what energy is."

65
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,959
But let's just give the same cop-out answer
that my textbook gives, which is:

66
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,579
"the capacity to do work or produce heat."

67
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,420
Work. In the common vernacular, that's anything
that you have to do but you don't want to.

68
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,980
But in physics and chemistry, work is when
a force acts on something, causing it to move.

69
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,179
If nothing moves, then no work is done.

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,079
There are a few different symbols that represent
work, we're going to use the lowercase "w."

71
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,879
Heat. Which is maybe the most misunderstood
word in chemistry after the word chemicals.

72
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:12,348
Heat is not something that objects contain.

73
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:15,929
Just like something can't have work, something
can't have heat.

74
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,480
Instead, heat, just like work, is an energy
transfer.

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,610
But instead of transferring energy by mechanical
movement,

76
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:25,280
heat is a transfer of energy by thermal interactions,
such as radiation or thermal conduction.

77
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,539
Now crazy as this might seem, those are the
only two things that energy can do.

78
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,129
It can either be work applying force and moving
things or it can be exchanged as heat.

79
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,449
Both process result in an energy transfer
between systems.

80
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,639
And just in case you weren't confused enough, the most common symbol for heat is lowercase "q."

81
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,459
Yup. Lowercase "q," deal with it.

82
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,339
Little-known fact: the word "heat" used to
start with a silent q,

83
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:51,169
but it was dropped in the seventeenth century
when -- I'm just making stuff up.

84
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,670
So we're just gonna have to move on, leave
that behind us,

85
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,780
and think about what happens when the amount
of energy in a system changes.

86
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:02,039
If you're currently freaking out, thinking, like, "but Hank, you just said that the amount of energy never changes!"

87
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,120
I will remind you that I said "in the universe."

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,079
See, when we're doing thermo, we get to divide
the universe into two parts,

89
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,930
which is actually a pretty cool thing to get
to do.

90
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,079
One part is the system, the thing that we're
studying, and everything else is the surroundings.

91
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,579
The surroundings allow the amount of energy
in the system to change.

92
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,039
That change just has to come from or go to
the surroundings.

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,970
And we get to decide where that line is.

94
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,630
We could say that the system is the rock that
the trebuchet propels, or the sling,

95
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:30,899
or the trebuchet itself, or the face of the
poor guy that the rock runs into.

96
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,879
Whether it's the Earth-trebuchet system, or the rock-face system, or the entire observable universe system,

97
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:38,789
we get to decide based on what we're interested
in studying.

98
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,720
Every system has an internal energy, the sum of all that system's kinetic and potential energy.

99
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
The internal energy of the system is represented
by a capital "E",

100
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,150
and usually we're interested in changes in
that system.

101
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,819
And the way we represent change in chemistry
and physics is with the Greek letter delta(Δ),

102
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,519
so we stick the delta in front of the "E" for "ΔE", the change in the energy of the system.

103
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:01,959
The change in the energy of the system is
equal to the heat plus the work.

104
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,299
The simplest equation you're ever gonna see
on Crash Course Chemistry.

105
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,879
There are two basic outcomes when you're looking
at this internal energy equation.

106
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,930
The first is that ΔE is positive.
It's gaining energy from the surroundings.

107
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,949
That's the case if work is done on the system
or heat is transferred to the system.

108
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,839
Like if I were to do some work to get the
trebuchet ready to fire, ΔE is positive.

109
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,719
The system is gaining energy from its surroundings,
which includes my arms and muscles.

110
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,670
If work is done by the system or heat is transferred
from the system to the surroundings,

111
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,020
those w and q get negative signs resulting
in a decrease in ΔE,

112
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,789
or a loss of energy from the system to the
surroundings.

113
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:43,650
Like when the trebuchet fires, the trebuchet's ΔE is negative from the transfer of energy to the ping pong ball.

114
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:47,739
So what in the name of Willard Gibbs does
any of this have to do with chemistry?

115
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,660
Well, the energy stored in molecular bonds,
chemical energy, is a kind of potential energy.

116
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,960
It exists because of the position of the particles
in the molecule.

117
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,819
Just like with the trebuchet, in chemistry
we can put energy into molecules, and take

118
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:02,349
it out, and even use it to do work,

119
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,780
creating war machines millions of times more powerful than the biggest siege engine ever constructed,

120
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,629
but also creating tools to feed and clothe
the world.

121
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,009
Some reactions release energy, like if I lit my trebuchet on fire -- which again I will not do!

122
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:15,579
Why do I keep bringing that up!?

123
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:18,120
Burning is the rapid oxidation of chemical
compounds,

124
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,639
and as it results in a heat flow out of the
system we call that an exothermic reaction.

125
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,279
But other reactions suck energy out of the
environment and into the system.

126
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,139
These endothermic reactions occur when heat
flows into the system.

127
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,050
Like in your car engine, at the high temperatures
of combusting fuel,

128
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,460
Nitrogen and Oxygen will suck some of that energy into chemical bonds forming nitric oxide,

129
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:43,739
a poisonous gas that I once inhaled a dangerous amount of, but I'll save that story for our lab safety episode.

130
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,500
Chemistry, it turns out, is largely a study
of energy.

131
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:54,180
The energy stored in bonds, transferred between atoms and molecules to find stable forms and released to the environment to do work.

132
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:55,879
It's just like the trebuchet:

133
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,579
put energy in, store it, and then take it back out to do something interesting, fun or useful.

134
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:06,060
That's basically everything that ever happens summed up in one little siege engine. Not bad.

135
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,259
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

136
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:11,909
If you were paying attention, you learned
that everything is energy;

137
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,870
that there are lots of different forms of
energy including potential energy,

138
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,360
which is energy contained within a system because of the position or arrangement of its components.

139
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,340
And you learned that chemical energy is a kind of potential energy, energy stored up in bonds between atoms.

140
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,639
Also you hopefully already knew that energy
can neither be created nor destroyed,

141
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:31,279
and that the amount of energy in the universe
is constant;

142
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,698
but when studying thermodynamics we divide
the universe into the system and its surroundings,

143
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:40,008
and a system could give energy to or take
energy out of those surroundings.

144
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:44,769
You learned that energy can be transferred in two ways: work, which is force applied over a distance,

145
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:48,159
and heat, which is the transfer of energy
by thermal interaction.

146
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,139
And finally, you learned that all of this is just as applicable to chemistry as it is to trebuchets.
