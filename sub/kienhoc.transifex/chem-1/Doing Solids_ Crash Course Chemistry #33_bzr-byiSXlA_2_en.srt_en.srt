1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:06,379
When you say the word "chemicals", most people
think "chemicals bad" or "chemicals dangerous,"

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:10,888
those people say things like, "I don't give
my kids food with chemicals in it" or

3
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:13,558
"that factory puts chemicals in the water."

4
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:17,320
Sometimes these people are thinking of liquid
chemicals that are, for example,

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,789
sprayed on crops, or gaseous chemicals that
come out of smokestacks, or exhaust pipes.

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,710
But those people probably don't think of chemicals
as solids.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,509
To them, solids like thr table, here, or my
computer, or aardvarks -- that's just stuff.

8
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:32,730
But it's vital to recognize that, as I've
said before,

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,799
almost everything you interact with on a daily
basis is chemicals, except for like, light.

10
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,679
And with the exception of air, the vast majority of the matter that you interact with is in the form of solids.

11
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,840
Like I'm interacting with my clothes right
now,

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,660
which is good, otherwise this would be...this
would be an inappropriate episode.

13
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:53,179
But solids are a lot more diverse than what
we might think of as just hard or strong or stuffy.

14
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:59,649
Stuff-like. Stuffish. Stuffable.
Stuff the Magic Dragon.

15
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:03,899
Many metals, for example, are almost infinitely
moldable under the right conditions.

16
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:06,039
Meanwhile, rocks aren't moldable at all,

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,729
their lack of flexibility causes them to shatter
or crumble under sufficient force.

18
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:14,459
Then there are solids that we think of as
being softer, like rubber and clay and Styrofoam,

19
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,739
all of which are soft for different reasons,
and behave in very different ways.

20
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,000
None of this is random.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,140
Like all matter, solids get their characteristics
from the arrangement of their electrons,

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,769
their chemical bonds,
and their intermolecular forces.

23
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:31,209
There are 2 main classes of solids, crystalline
and amorphous.

24
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:36,259
The atoms in molecules in crystalline solids
are arranged in an orderly, predictable way.

25
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,290
Amorphous literally means "without shape,"
and amorphous solids, unsurprisingly,

26
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,399
don't have a definite shape because their
atoms and molecules are arranged randomly.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,520
And just within these 2 classes, solids can exhibit a pretty amazing variety of characteristics and behaviors.

28
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,658
So you may just surprise yourself by learning something new about materials that you thought you knew inside and out.

29
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:01,179
And even better than that, you can explain it to some of those people who don't even know what chemicals really are.

30
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:11,159
[Theme Music]

31
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,240
The category of amorphous solids includes
things that you might expect,

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,840
like foams and gels and colloids, like mayonnaise, rubber, waxes, and some biological tissuessuch as fat.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,259
They also include some things that you might
not expect,

34
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,600
like coal, the things silicon panels use in
semiconductors, and even glass.

35
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,560
That's right, despite what you may have heard, glass is not a liquid, I don't know who made that up.

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,060
In chemistry, amorphous doesn't mean soft
or even flexible,

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,159
although many amorphous solids are both of
those things.

38
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,359
Instead, the classification is all about the fact that their atomic structure is disordered, or random.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,020
Amorphous solids do however have a couple
of macroscopic properties in common.

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,280
First, it is important to understand that because the particles in an amorphous solid are arranged randomly,

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,680
the strength of the bonds holding them together
are also random.

42
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:58,900
That's what causes amorphous solids to melt
gradually, like this glass tube.

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,870
As the material is heated, the weaker intermolecular
bonds break first,

44
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,360
then the stronger ones break as the energy
threshold is broken by heat.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,700
So amorphous solids don't have the sharp discrete melting points of things like ice, which melts exactly at 0,

46
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,510
instead, they melt over a range of temperatures,
as the heat energy increases.

47
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:19,759
Amorphous solids also respond to stress very
differently than crystalline solids.

48
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,109
Because the arrangement of crystalline solids
is so orderly,

49
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,690
they're often very easy to break along a plane
that falls between adjacent molecules,

50
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:29,699
and when they break, they tend to do it along
straight lines,

51
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,869
the way cutting a diamond creates perfectly
smooth facets.

52
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,939
But with many amorphous solids, it's hard
to find a plane like that.

53
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,650
No matter how you attack it, you'll usually
run into molecules that are sitting right

54
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,340
in the middle of that plane, resisting the
break.

55
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,000
And even hard amorphous solids that do break under pressure rarely do it along straight lines,

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,740
that's why broken glass ends up in crazy random
shapes.

57
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,639
And why coal looks like a random rock, not
like a nice orderly crystal.

58
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,169
We have a name for this, amorphous solids
are isotropic.

59
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,619
Meaning that they respond to stress in the
same way in every direction.

60
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:07,219
No matter which direction you poke a piece of clay, or hit a piece of glass, it's resistance to breakage will always be similar.

61
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:11,620
But crystalline solids are anisotropic, they break differently depending on which plane you hit.

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,800
Speaking of diamonds, you probably think of 'crystalline' as things that look sorta like that.

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,040
But there are actually 3 different types of
crystalline solids,

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,530
and they cover a huge array of materials,
some of them pretty surprising.

65
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:28,279
Those types are based on composition.
They can be molecular, ionic, or atomic.

66
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:33,659
Molecular solids are made up of covalent compounds that form an orderly crystalline structure as they solidify,

67
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,170
while their molecules remain unchanged.

68
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,330
Examples include things like water ice, dry
ice - which is just frozen CO2, and sugar.

69
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:46,120
Because the molecules are held together by weak Van de Waals forces, they break down pretty easily.

70
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,139
For that reason, these solids generally tend
to be soft with fairly low melting points.

71
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:56,360
Ionic solids are basically the solid forms of things we think of as ionic compounds like sodium chloride - or table salt,

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,120
calcium carbonate - which is chalk and limestone, and magnesium sulfate - otherwise known as Epsom salt.

73
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,600
Because they are made of ions, they are often
soluble in water and other polar solvents,

74
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,650
but they have very high melting points.

75
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,259
So table salt would be gone in no time if
I put it in water,

76
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:17,060
but if I applied heat directly to it, it wouldn't melt until the temperature reached 801 degree Celsius.

77
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,100
Atomic solids, as the name suggests, are made
up of individual atoms, not molecules at all.

78
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:28,980
Sounds simple, well there are actually 3 types of atomic solids too: network solids, group 18 solids, and metals.

79
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,740
Network solids are so interesting and important that we're going to cover them in a separate lesson.

80
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,490
I won't get in to it now except to say that
the atoms basically form a rigid crystal structure.

81
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,110
A diamond, for example, is just a big crystal
made of carbon atoms.

82
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,879
So you can think of diamonds, and other network
solids, as really giant molecules.

83
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:52,139
Group 18 solids meanwhile are the solid phase materials of the noble gases - Group 18 on the periodic table.

84
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:56,919
Since noble gases have little interest interacting,
even among themselves, it's very hard to cool

85
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,920
and pressurize them enough to make them form
a liquid and even more so to make them solidify.

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,759
So when they do crystallize, the atoms are
held together by weak little Van de Waals

87
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:10,649
forces, not stable at all to say the least,
so they don't tend to stick around for long.

88
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:14,799
Because of this, they're really rare, and
not something that you'll, like, ever encounter,

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,300
unless you go on to study them specifically.

90
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,020
But metals, you know metals they're everywhere.

91
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:22,680
You're probably looking at me on a device
made of metal.

92
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,579
You probably have metal in your pocket.
You might have metal in your teeth.

93
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,620
And yeah, you probably don't think of metals
as crystals,

94
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,560
but remember the key is that their atoms are
arranged in an orderly way.

95
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,089
The atoms, in fact, form several different
arrangements

96
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,679
in order to best take advantage of the space
and the structure.

97
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,480
These structures are called closest packing
arrangements.

98
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,650
To picture how it works, think of metal atoms
as spheres

99
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:44,949
and consider how they can pack together in
the most efficient ways possible.

100
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:48,120
Like imagine if you have to fill the box with
as many ping pong as you can,

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,810
the atoms stack just like the ping pong balls
would.

102
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,000
In spite of their orderly arrangement though,
most metals are quite malleable.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,740
Meaning that they can be pounded in to various
shapes,

104
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,579
and ductile, meaning that they can be stretched
out in to wires.

105
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:03,259
Both of these characteristics result from the nature of their atoms and the bonds between them.

106
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,659
The atoms in metals are large.

107
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,780
So large, that the valence electrons aren't
held very strongly by the nucleus.

108
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,918
This gives them much more freedom to move
around than the electrons on most elements.

109
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,060
So instead of belonging to a single atom, they form a kind of sea of electrons, wandering from 1 nucleus to another.

110
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,459
These freely moving electrons are in fact the main reason that metals can conduct heat and electricity so easily.

111
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:26,419
It's actually more accurate to say that the
electrons form large,

112
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,519
somewhat unstable, orbitals around collections
of atoms.

113
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,120
The nuclei are tightly bonded together by
the electrons that are all around them,

114
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,470
making the metal structure extremely strong.

115
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:41,170
But the bonds are uniquely flexible, allowing the kinds of deformations that we're accustomed to from metals.

116
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,360
Despite the crazy array of solids that classify as crystalline, they do all have certain things in common.

117
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,439
And as usual, most of their common characteristics
are related to their bonds.

118
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,399
Since all the bonds in a crystal are the same
length, their all equally strong.

119
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,918
Which means they can be broken by the same
amount of energy,

120
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,519
and their melting points are very specific
temperatures, not broad ranges.

121
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,759
Crystalline solids are also generally more
brittle than amorphous ones,

122
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:07,139
and as I mentioned, respond to force differently
in different directions.

123
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,360
It's kind of crazy to think that all of the
different things that we think of as solids

124
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,370
are actually so different from each other.

125
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,569
All of the Volvos, and reusable shopping bags,
and kid's bicycle helmets,

126
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:20,939
are all from a diverse array of chemicals
called solids.

127
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:23,199
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

128
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,180
If you've paid attention, you've learned the difference between amorphous and crystalline solids.

129
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,740
You've learned that crystalline solids can
be made up of molecules, ions, or atoms.

130
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,288
And that the ones made of atoms, can be networks,
noble gases, or metals.

131
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:39,199
You also learned some of the properties of
solids in each of those categories,

132
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,420
and you learned that in every case the properties
of the solid are

133
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,299
much more related to the bonds between the particles than to the identity of the particles themselves.

134
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,579
