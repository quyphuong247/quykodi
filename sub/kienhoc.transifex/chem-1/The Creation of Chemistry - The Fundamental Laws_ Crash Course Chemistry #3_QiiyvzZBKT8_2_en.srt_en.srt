1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,319
You got a pretty good idea of what chemistry
is, right?

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:08,330
It's atoms and molecules doing stuff and making
cars and food and life and everything.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,470
And of course it's the study of those things.
But like how did we get here?

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,600
There's certainly no everyday evidence for much of what we have discovered through the science of chemistry.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,220
Discoveries that were not derived or made
up,

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,778
but just laws of the Universe that exist simply because the Universe is the way the Universe is.

7
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:28,920
So in today's episode of Crash Course Chemistry
we're going to taking a bit of a historical

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,320
perspective on the creation of the science
of chemistry.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,070
A science that didn't really even exist until
a super-smart, super-wealthy French guy put

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,770
the puzzle pieces together into a coherent
theory for, quite literally, how everything works.

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,230
And if you've ever found yourself sitting
at your desk reading the same line in your

12
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,019
chemistry book for the 22nd time,

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,980
and you think to yourself "Gah, the guy who
invented chemistry should be put to death!"

14
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:57,028
Well you should feel bad, because he was.

15
00:00:57,029 --> 00:01:06,849
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:13,299
Antoine Lavoisier, was pretty fantastic. He was a geologist, a botanist, a biologist, and a physicist.

17
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,359
He helped define the metric system, creating
an international language of chemistry,

18
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,299
named hydrogen and oxygen, predicted the existence
of silicon, outlined what elements were,

19
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,719
figured out how animals extracted energy from
food,

20
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:32,260
determined that an element can take different forms on discovering that both ash and diamond contained pure carbon,

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,920
published the very first chemistry textbook
ever,

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,540
and there's a reason why the Law of Conservation
of Mass used to be called Lavoisier's Law.

23
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,880
Born into a wealthy family, Lavoisier inherited a massive amount of money when his mom died when he was five years old.

24
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:53,079
And though he did get licensed to practice law as his father expected him to follow in his lawyer-ly footsteps,

25
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,459
young Antoine chose science instead.

26
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:59,498
When the opportunity arose to marry a wealthy
girl whose father's massive income came from

27
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:04,698
collecting taxes for the French government,
he did it, even though she 13.

28
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,859
A questionable decision, though not uncommon
at the time,

29
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,879
it turned out that the family connections would be his undoing, though, not the age of the bride at her marriage.

30
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,840
Marie-Anne, as she grew older, would become
a colleague as well as a wife,

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,840
assisting Antoine in his experiments and his
analysis of the work of others.

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,159
Indeed it was Marie-Anne who translated Essay
on Phlogiston for Antoine,

33
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,520
which he ripped to pieces, changing everything
forever.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,099
Until Antoine Lavoisier started inspecting
everybody's work,

35
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:35,348
the prevailing theory of chemical change was
that some substances contained an elusive

36
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:37,619
element called "phlogiston."

37
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,080
By burning these phlogiston-containing elements, they would lose their phlogiston, and become new things.

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,760
Lavoisier took those theories and their research,
combined it with research being done elsewhere,

39
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:52,140
and added in his own genius experiments and
then tore the chemical world to pieces,

40
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,139
with a little thing called "combustion."

41
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:57,949
He determined that hydrogen wasn't "inflammable
air," it was an element.

42
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:02,219
Indeed he named it hydrogen because it was
generated from water, or hydro-generated.

43
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,259
And he determined that oxygen was a vital
ingredient for combustion

44
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:09,919
and also what would later be known as oxidation, something that we'll discuss quite a lot in this course.

45
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,339
By hooking people up to his bizarre contraptions,

46
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:15,848
he determined that burning wood consumed the
same amount of oxygen,

47
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:19,599
and produced the same amount of carbon dioxide,
as people consuming food and breathing.

48
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,379
Thus determining that people, and all animals,
are powered by some form of internal combustion.

49
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,680
Now experimenters of the day (I hesitate to
call them chemists),

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,379
noticed that when you burned something, its
massed decreased.

51
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,659
Like here's a fuse, and I put it on a scale
and I burn it, and its mass decreases.

52
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:38,799
But Lavoisier determined that if all the particles
in gas are collected,

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,880
like if I burn the fuse inside a closed bottle,
the mass stays the same.

54
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,859
Stuff remained stuff. You can't lose any,
you couldn't make more.

55
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,120
This realization, though it seems obvious to us now and its acceptance by the general scientific community,

56
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,109
as far as I'm concerned, was the precise moment
at which alchemy ended and chemistry began.

57
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,789
Lavoisier's chief contributions, and ultimately his discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass,

58
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:06,968
relied on careful measurement and careful
thinking.

59
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:11,269
And as you'll see, both of those things are
key to success in chemistry to this day.

60
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:13,929
Lavoisier the man was a bit of a dichotomy,

61
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:18,649
having worked as a tax collector and helping
to create a literal wall around Paris to assist

62
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,290
in the collection of taxes,

63
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,240
but also a supporter of the French Revolution
as it began.

64
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,949
But the enemies he had made with his wall,

65
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:29,030
and by denying certain powerful politicians
entry into the French Academy of Sciences,

66
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:35,759
eventually caught up with him as the revolution's lunacy increased, he was beheaded on May 8th, 1794.

67
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,399
Lavoisier was pardoned a year and a half after
his execution. So, that's good.

68
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,120
Marie-Anne was delivered all of his confiscated
belongings, and a note of apology, like

69
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,360
"Sorry we killed your husband, here's all
his stuff back."

70
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,080
The mathematician Joseph Lagrange said of
the event:

71
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:56,439
"It took them only an instant to cut off that head, but France may not produce another like it in a century."

72
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,800
It's worth noting, though this isn't really
science talk,

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,180
that Lavoisier couldn't have done any of his
magnificently careful measurements had it

74
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,300
not been for his enormous wealth.

75
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,560
He commissioned the creation of hundreds of
pieces of equipment, large and small.

76
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,209
Only the system of economic inequality that
the French were revolting against made it

77
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,668
possible for Lavoisier to do his work.

78
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:18,810
I'll leave you to think on the implications
of that, on your own.

79
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,790
Lavoisier's work was, for a full century,
the basis of all chemistry.

80
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,640
Proving that you don't have to be rich to get a law (at least temporarily) named after you,

81
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,740
French pharmacist Joseph Proust built on Lavoisier's
ideas of extremely careful measurement

82
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,569
showing that a chemical compound always contains
the same proportions of elements.

83
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,310
For a while we called this Proust's Law,

84
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,839
but to make it easier to remember for the world we just call it the Law of Definite Proportions now.

85
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,878
And then an English schoolteacher, John Dalton,
followed Proust

86
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,519
by examining what at first appeared to be
a problem with Proust's work.

87
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,279
Carbon and oxygen, when reacted together, would form two different proportions, not just one.

88
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,699
Of course what was happening is obvious to
us,

89
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:03,219
carbon and oxygen were reacting to form two different compounds: carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

90
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,080
As Dalton's work continued, he found something
truly mind-bendingly fascinating.

91
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,339
If you limited the amount of carbon reacting
to exactly 1 g,

92
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,459
the mass of oxygen consumed to produce one
compound was 1.33 g,

93
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,759
while the mass consumed to produce the other
compound was 2.66 g,

94
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,459
exactly double what was required for the other
compound.

95
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:26,459
This shook out for other reactions, too.

96
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,379
When reacting nitrogen and oxygen, and limiting to exactly one gram of nitrogen, three compounds formed.

97
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:38,159
One compound consumed 1.750 g of oxygen, another
consumed 0.8750 g of oxygen,

98
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:41,468
and another consumed 0.4374 g.

99
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:46,000
All of those numbers are relatable by small
whole number ratios.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,620
Oxygen wasn't reacting with some ephemeral
cloud of the idea of nitrogen,

101
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,500
it was reacting with individual, discrete
bits of nitrogen, that couldn't be divided.

102
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,360
It could react in a number of ways,

103
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,100
but it was always the same oxygen and the
same nitrogen with the same properties.

104
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,660
And so while in our first episode we showed you how Einstein actually proved that atoms exist with super fancy math,

105
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:12,659
Dalton had used multiplication to become the first person to actually have real data supporting the idea of atoms.

106
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:15,418
Dalton still, though, had it kind of wrong.

107
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:18,598
He thought that the products of his reactions
were elements as well.

108
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,038
Basically, he believed that atoms and molecules
were the same thing.

109
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,029
We often simplify this and don't note Dalton's
confusion on this particular point,

110
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,709
but that leaves a couple of other fantastic
chemists out of the story.

111
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:34,719
For example, Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac, who in 1804 became the highest scientist ever in history,

112
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,139
by taking a hot-air balloon to the dangerous
height of 7,000 m to take air samples.

113
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,860
But in addition to maybe being a little bit
crazy, Gay-Lussac published a paper

114
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:49,180
showing that a volume of oxygen gas is two times smaller than the volume of water vapor it creates,

115
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,759
indicating that somehow, oxygen was splitting
into two pieces.

116
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,579
Dalton, would not accept this, because it
meant that oxygen was not one, but two atoms,

117
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,218
and apparently that just messed with his whole
conception of the Universe,

118
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:05,930
and he never did accept it, even unto his
death.

119
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,900
It took an Italian house-elf -- I mean genius,

120
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:15,250
Lorenzo Romano Amadeo Carlo Avogadro di Quaregna
e di Cerreto. (I did it the first time.)

121
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,139
We'll just call him Amadeo Avogadro, but he
was a count,

122
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:22,098
so he had to have a super-fancy name, and
I'm me, so I had to try and say it.

123
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:26,178
Much like Lavoisier, Avogadro's political
alliances would get him into trouble.

124
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,360
After Napoleon's downfall in 1815, Avogadro
was active in the Italian Anti-Monarchy Revolution,

125
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,460
possibly even sponsoring some revolutionaries
with his personal fortune.

126
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:41,280
For this he lost his chair at the University
of Turin, but thankfully he did not lose his head.

127
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,379
Avogadro proposed, correctly, that any gas
in a container of the same size,

128
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:50,899
with the same temperature and pressure, would have roughly the same number of molecules in it,

129
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,779
no matter what the gas was.

130
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,589
So any difference in mass between two flasks
of the same size full of two different gases

131
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,950
would be because of a difference in the actual
physical mass of the molecules.

132
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:08,470
And thus, Avogadro basically figured out how to weigh atoms and molecules, as long as they were gaseous.

133
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,759
To support his hypothesis, which was certainly
good enough to support,

134
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,490
he suggested that, in forming water, oxygen
gas would actually split into two oxygen atoms,

135
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,649
what he called "elementary molecules" that
could not be broken down any further.

136
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,110
For some fifty years, Avogadro's idea of fundamental
molecules were ignored.

137
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,629
Maybe because of incorrect ideas of how atoms
stuck together,

138
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:32,559
maybe because Italy was a bit of a backwater
of science

139
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,829
and Avogadro wasn't considered an important
thinker at the time.

140
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,879
But the scientific community, as it usually does, came back around to Avogadro's ideas eventually.

141
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,399
Not only naming his proposal that equal volumes
at the same temperature

142
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,649
and pressure contained the same number of
molecules Avogadro's Law,

143
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:53,250
but also giving him his own number, maybe
the most important number in chemistry,

144
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,169
certainly one of my very favorite numbers,
but we'll get to that later.

145
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,639
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

146
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,600
If you were paying attention you now know
the story of how we went from alchemists,

147
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,090
who thought that the element of fire hid inside
of substances just clamoring to get out,

148
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:14,320
to chemists, who understood the Law of Conservation
of Mass, as proposed by a decapitated aristocrat.

149
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,550
Greater understanding of how chemical compounds
work, thanks to a pharmacist and a schoolteacher.

150
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:23,979
And eventually a complete understanding of
what atoms and molecules are,

151
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,519
thanks to a neglected Italian house-elf -- nobleman.

152
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,639
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry, it
