1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,059
Energy. The foundation of the universe,
we'd literally be nothing without it.

2
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:11,059
It does all our work, provides all our heat, can be stored to use later, and never, ever goes away.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,320
Sounds like the best-est best friend ever.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,120
And yet, most of the time we take it for granted, but here at Crash Course, we feel bad for our old friend Energy;

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,630
we want to understand it so that we can be
a better friend to it,

6
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:25,129
and also so that we can understand what it's
trying to tell us.

7
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:28,099
Like that any bond between two atoms contains
energy.

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,750
How much energy? Well, that is not the simplest
question to answer.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:38,090
And yet, today we shall answer it...kinda,
using a nifty little thing called enthalpy.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:47,670
[Theme Music]

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,649
Last time, we learned about internal energy,
and the two ways that it can be transferred:

12
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,198
by heat, or by work.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,478
And heat and work are useful concepts, but
they have limitations.

14
00:00:56,478 --> 00:01:02,259
Particularly, that it is extremely difficult to figure out how much of which one is being done.

15
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:05,280
Work is energy transferred to the motion of
objects,

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,710
while heat is energy transferred to the motion
of atoms and molecules.

17
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:14,399
But for any given change in energy, the split between work and heat could be pretty much anything,

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,180
as long as there's some going to each.

19
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:20,048
Say that my car is at the top of a hill, and
there's a frozen banana stand at the bottom.

20
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:24,799
If I roll down with my brakes on, lots of heat will be transferred into my brake pads and my brake discs,

21
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,679
and I'll kind of like very slightly knock into the frozen banana stand, doing a tiny amount of work on it.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,120
But if I am reckless and insane, very little
heat will be generated,

23
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:36,780
and my car'll do a huge amount of work on
the frozen banana stand.

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,900
Both paths transfer the same amount of energy, but one produces very little heat, and the other produces a ton.

25
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,180
So, we say that heat and work are "pathway
dependent."

26
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:49,699
The amount of heat or work done depends on
the pathway you take.

27
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,070
The change in energy, on the other hand, is
the same in either case.

28
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:55,478
Change in energy is independent of the pathway.

29
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:59,140
In chemistry and physics and math, we call
that a "state function,"

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,129
because the only thing that matters is the
starting state and the ending state,

31
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:05,068
not the stuff in between, not how you got
there.

32
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,140
State functions are pretty great, because
they make the math very simple;

33
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,609
it's just one amount minus another amount.

34
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,100
It would be pretty fascinating to know exactly
how much energy is tied up in a molecule.

35
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,500
Unfortunately, it's next to impossible to
know that number.

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,530
It's too big, and there are too many boxes
where all that energy could be hiding.

37
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,360
It's like trying to measure the total volume
of the ocean, like, good luck.

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,240
However, since energy, like volume, is a state function, we can very easily talk about the change in energy.

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,780
Just like if you dump a two liter Mountain
Dew into the ocean,

40
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,759
you can't tell me how many liters are in the ocean, but you can say that that number has changed.

41
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,659
It has just increased by two.

42
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:45,079
In the same way, we're interested in energy
being transferred in or out of the system

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,760
because of chemical reactions.

44
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,799
And in many cases, all we're interested in
is the heat part.

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,219
For example, if I burn a pile of wood, I care
about the heat being generated,

46
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,419
not the work being done by the volume increase,
or by the rising smoke.

47
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,619
So dealing with the whole internal energy
equation thing would kind of be overkill.

48
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,240
What we really need is a state function based
on the loss or gain of heat in chemical reactions.

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,960
Which yes, is what Enthalpy is for.

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,400
In addition to being a silly-sounding word, enthalpy, which is represented by an equally silly capital H,

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,980
is technically the internal energy of a system,

52
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,039
plus the energy that's required to sort of
shove the surroundings out of the way,

53
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,159
and make room for the system's pressure and
volume.

54
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,039
With enthalpy, we can make some assumptions
and do some fancy math

55
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,900
and make the simplest equation we've ever
seen in Crash Course Chemistry.

56
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,180
Let's get there real fast.

57
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,030
So first, we're not really interested in the
total enthalpy of the system,

58
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,479
which is good, because it's impossible to
measure.

59
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,280
We're really just interested in how much it's
going to change, as a state function.

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,789
So, the formula for enthalpy is usually written
as change in enthalpy.

61
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:47,669
Delta E or "change in energy" equals q plus
w, so we can replace that part,

62
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:50,189
and then we can make two big, huge assumptions.

63
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,629
First, that pressure is constant.

64
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:55,780
Fortunately, despite talk of high and low
pressure weather systems,

65
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,159
atmospheric pressure, it really, changes very little compared to the other terms in the equation.

66
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,740
Constant pressure is a pretty good assumption
here on the Earth's surface.

67
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,360
So that last Δ only applies to the volume.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,320
The second assumption is that the only work
done in the system

69
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,609
is the work that the pressure does to change
the volume, known as pressure volume work.

70
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,859
So W equals negative PΔV.

71
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,000
Now the signs are a little bit weird here:

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,189
an increase -- or positive change -- in volume,
results in an output of work by the system

73
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,149
-- a loss in internal energy --

74
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,179
which is defined as a negative amount.

75
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,439
So the signs for work and for PΔV will always
be opposite, and so, voila!

76
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,459
The PΔV parts cancel, ΔH equals the heat
of reaction.

77
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,219
Change in enthalpy is equal to the heat gained
or lost by the system.

78
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,770
So I guess in the capital H for enthalpy does
kinda make sense.

79
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:50,599
Thanks to this little trick for a lot of reactions that happen at constant pressure, like here on the surface of the earth,

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,310
working just with enthalpies instead of internal
energy makes a lot more sense.

81
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,889
I mean, it's hugely useful.

82
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,599
We can determine how much useful energy is
contained in pretty much any chemical compound.

83
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,280
This is done by simply measuring temperature
changes during chemical reactions.

84
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,479
So we know what it is, we know that state
functions are great, but really why?

85
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,090
Why have we done this, and can I just go look
at pictures of cats now?

86
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:14,079
Well no, because you don't even know why enthalpy
is so cool.

87
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,779
When a reaction takes place and enthalpy changes,

88
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:22,979
that heat is transferring into or out of actual
chemical bonds, these little guys.

89
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,200
Atoms and molecules reacting so that they
contain more or less energy,

90
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:31,180
and that energy is either released to or taken
from the environment as heat.

91
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,660
Those bonds are nothing but energy, and using enthalpy, we can measure how much energy they have.

92
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,520
And we measure enthalpy with a weird little
science called calorimetry.

93
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,079
In calorimetry, we have a reaction take place inside an insulated vessel, like a thermos, basically,

94
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,579
and measure how much the temperature changes,

95
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:50,810
which we can then link directly to heat and
thus enthalpy change.

96
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,399
Hopefully that sounds like fun because more
about the ins and outs of this are coming

97
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,509
in an episode on how to measure enthalpy.

98
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:59,329
Scientists have actually done on the calorimetry
footwork for us,

99
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:03,279
so we can actually predict how much heat a
chemical reaction will produce.

100
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,549
You might not understand what's so great about
that,

101
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,800
but just imagine because I live here in Montana,
where winters are pretty wintry,

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,400
I can invent a hand warmer just by doing some
calculations on paper,

103
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,019
without driving to Texas to buy the stuff
and do all kinds of expensive experiments.

104
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:22,329
For that, we have to thank good old Germain
Hess.

105
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:26,819
No, not Hermann Hesse, the gaunt, balding
Swiss author and poet.

106
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,629
Germain Hess, the gaunt, balding Swiss...
uh...author and chemist.

107
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,819
Yeah, even the history parts of chemistry
are confusing.

108
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:40,360
Hess was a chemist, geologist, professor, author, and doctor, and he also got a law named after him,

109
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,350
which is pretty much the higher honor you
can get as a chemist:

110
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,129
Hess's Law, which also kind of led directly
to the first law of thermodynamics.

111
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,409
Kind of a big deal.
Not bad.

112
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,660
Hess's law says that the total enthalpy change for a reaction doesn't depend on the pathway it takes,

113
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,040
but only on its initial and final states.

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,319
Sounds pretty familiar, right?

115
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:04,060
As long as you start with the same reactants and end with the same products, the enthalpy change is the same.

116
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,000
In order to study this stuff carefully,

117
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:10,418
he looked at the standard enthalpies of formation
of the reactants and the products of a reaction.

118
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,560
To define standard enthalpy of formation, I'm first going to define what a standard state is:

119
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,780
Basically it's just a set of criteria so that chemists can all be studying stuff under the same conditions.

120
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:24,399
Chemicals in their standard state are at 25
degrees Celsius and one atmosphere.

121
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,060
Standard enthalpy of formation is the amount
of heat lost or gained when one mole of a

122
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,430
compound is formed from its constituent elements.

123
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,329
And of course all of those elements have to
be at their standard states.

124
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,579
Since absolute enthalpy is unknowable though,
we have to be measuring from a baseline,

125
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:44,589
and that baseline is that individual elements'
most stable form at standard state.

126
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,009
That most stable form is defined as zero.

127
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,849
Values for compounds are measured from that
zero baseline,

128
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:57,229
and then standard state values can be used to calculate the enthalpy change for any reaction, even hypothetical ones.

129
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,879
Hess' Law is often stated in terms of standard
enthalpies of formation.

130
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,240
The enthalpy change for a reaction is equal to the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products,

131
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,720
minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of
formation of the reactants.

132
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,389
Thanks to many hardworking chemists,

133
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,978
the standard enthalpy of formation has been
measured for hundreds of compounds.

134
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:17,728
We can just look them up in charts and plug
them into Hess' Law.

135
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:21,139
Speaking of which, here is Hess' Law as a
mathematical formula.

136
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,259
Pretty fancy looking, but it says exactly
the same thing.

137
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:29,459
The enthalpy change for a reaction equals the sum of the stand enthalpies of formation of the products

138
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,828
minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of
formation of the reactants.

139
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:38,479
That pointy looking funny 'E' looking thing is the capital Greek letter Sigma(Σ) and it means, "the sum of."

140
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,039
np and nr are the moles of each product and
reactant respectively.

141
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,479
We have to factor that in because remember
the standard enthalpy of formation is measured

142
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,949
for just one mole of the substance.

143
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:49,998
If the chemical equation uses more than that,

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,759
we have to multiply the standard enthalpy of formation by the number of moles in the equation.

145
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,939
Again, I have just the thing for the calculating.

146
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:58,719
Exhibit A.
A hand warmer.

147
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,649
It gets warm because of an exothermic chemical
reaction.

148
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,558
And I'm very happy the inventors knew how
 to calculate the enthalpy change of chemical reactions.

149
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:13,379
They chose one that releases just enough heat, quite slowly, to heat up my hand nice and warm without burning them off.

150
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,110
The reaction combines an iron powder, which
is in here, and oxygen,

151
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,318
which diffuses through the membrane of the
little packaging.

152
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:23,628
It forms Iron(III) Oxide, the main ingredient
in rust.

153
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,240
To calculate the enthalpy change of the reaction,
or heat of reaction,

154
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,259
we simply find the ΔHf of all of the reactants
and products.

155
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:36,240
Either in the back of most textbooks or on
Google and plug them into Hess' Law.

156
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,259
ΔHf of formation of iron and oxygen are zero
by convention.

157
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,179
When in doubt, find them in the same table.

158
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:48,318
And ΔHf of formation of Iron(III) Oxide is
listed as -826 kilojoules per mole.

159
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:52,649
First we have to make sure we balance the
chemical equation, so do that number one.

160
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:58,279
Second, let's look at Hess' Law and figure out what our products are and what our reactants are and stick them in.

161
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,879
Then, plug in the number of moles for each
of our products and reactants.

162
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:07,249
Bang on your calculator and realize the ΔH
of the reaction is -1652 kilojoules.

163
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:13,928
So, the reaction of four moles of iron powder
which is about 223 grams of iron releases

164
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:16,788
1652 kilojoules of heat.

165
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:23,039
All that energy locked away in chemical bonds and then released as heat to make my aching frozen fingers.

166
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,779
Better living through chemistry.

167
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,579
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash Course Chemistry. If you were paying attention,

168
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,840
today you learned what the state function is and how it varies from a path dependent function.

169
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,700
Why enthalpy change is different from heat, even though they turn out to be pretty much the same anyway.

170
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,579
That bonds are energy and to form and break them they release and absorb heat to and from their environment.

171
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:47,118
We gave you the most cursory introduction
to calorimetry ever,

172
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:50,778
which we will remedy next time and discussed
the power of Hess' Law

173
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:54,049
and how to use his concept of the standard
enthalpy of formation

174
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:58,529
to calculate exactly how much heat is produced
by any reaction ever.

175
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,958
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
