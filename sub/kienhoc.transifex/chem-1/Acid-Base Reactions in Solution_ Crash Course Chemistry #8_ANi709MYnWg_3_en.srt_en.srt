1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
All right, so you're studying Chemistry, what's
the worst that could happen?

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,660
In most classes, the worst that can happen
is just abject, total failure.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,780
You're just like failing the test, failing
the class, having to rethink your life choices,

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,209
maybe even quit, drop out of school, get a
job at a diner, and start smoking Lucky Strikes.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,250
But in Chemistry, the worst thing that can
happen is death.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,269
And I don't want to make light of this; labs
are dangerous places.

7
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,280
Chemists die younger than the average person,

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,220
both because of workplace accidents and cancer
caused by exposure to chemicals.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,769
But chemists have also done more to increase
the average lifespan of humans on earth than,

10
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:31,758
in my opinion, any other profession.

11
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,789
So, it's a necessary hazard.

12
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:37,149
Last week we talked about stuff mixing together,
and that's important for sure.

13
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:42,009
But today and for the next few weeks, we're gonna talk about the actual reactions happening in those solutions.

14
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:47,140
Dangerous reactions: atoms reorganizing themselves
to create whole new substances.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,890
These are the processes that make our world
the world that we know and love.

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,149
Some of them are benign and beautiful, some
of them are face-meltingly terrifying.

17
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:59,829
And that's not hyperbole, I mean actual melted
faces.

18
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:09,250
[Theme Music]

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,239
Captain John Mullen, there,

20
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,280
he blazed the first wagon trail across the Rocky Mountains into the interior Pacific Northwest.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,760
The Captain's only been standing in this spot right here for about 75 years.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,670
And look what's happened to his face.

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,070
I know this maybe isn't the face melting you
were expecting,

24
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,419
but we're not so gruesome here at Crash Course
Chemistry.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,640
The sorry state of Mr. Mullen's face here
is the result of an acid-base reaction,

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,700
one of the three major types of reactions
that happen in solution,

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,060
that we'll be talking about here at Crash
Course Chemistry.

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,469
And the acid that did this, was mostly sulfuric
acid.

29
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:44,390
Now you may be wondering, who's been coming
by and throwing sulfuric acid on statues?

30
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,500
Well actually, what's been doing the throwing
is clouds, the sky,

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,769
though the actual source of the sulfuric acid,

32
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:54,019
that's 400 miles away at the Colstrip Power
Plant in Colstrip, Montana,

33
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,228
and also at coal fired power plants all over
the United States.

34
00:01:57,228 --> 00:02:01,310
The United States of America burns about a
billion tons of coal per year,

35
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,019
and most of that coal, is mined right here
in the U.S.

36
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:06,408
Montana, where I live, is home to the Powder
River Basin,

37
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,819
a geographical location responsible for 40%
of America's coal output.

38
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:14,719
Between fifty and seventy freight trains ship
out of the Powder River Basin every day.

39
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,889
Each train has at least 115 coal cars and
is more than a mile and a half long.

40
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:25,179
And all of this coal burning, it has effects,
significant effects, acidic effects.

41
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:34,580
But first, like, what exactly are acids and
bases. Well acids...uhh...sour.

42
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,120
So sour, that's the first thing that we learned
about acids,

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,560
actually, and that's why acid...uuhh...actually
means sour in Greek or Latin...Latin.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,080
Acids are excellent at dissolving stuff; they
kill things and melt your face.

45
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,219
What about bases?

46
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:57,180
You might have some idea about what a base is: bitter tasting, slippery like soap; soap is in fact a base.

47
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,670
And bases, like acids, are totally dangerous
and can melt off your face.

48
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:04,598
They're also like the anti-acid basically.
In fact, they're in antacids.

49
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:07,869
If you mix acids and bases together they neutralize
each other.

50
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,599
But as with most things in chemistry and in
life,

51
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:13,949
when it comes right down to trying to define
exactly what something is,

52
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,169
it gets weird and messy and confusing and
terrible.

53
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:24,750
So, forget everything you ever learned about acids, wipe the slate clean, the most common acid on earth is water.

54
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,759
Wuh? And water is the most common base, and
am I saying this purely to confuse you? Yes!

55
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,639
Well, mostly to convince you that the world is way more complicated than you thought it was.

56
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,379
In 1923, two guys simultaneously defined acids
and bases in the exact same way.

57
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,519
Bronsted and Lowry defined them; they didn't
classify them by how they acted

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,629
or what they tasted like or even what they
were made of, they defined them.

59
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,068
And this was an impressive feat because a
huge class of molecules,

60
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:55,030
to some extent or another, act as acids and
bases.

61
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,560
So to come up with a definition that fit all
of them, that was not so simple.

62
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,280
Bronsted and Lowry defined an acid as being
anything that donates a proton

63
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,009
and a base as being anything that accepts
a proton.

64
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:09,159
And when we say proton, what we're talking about here is a hydrogen atom without its electron.

65
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,989
Usually this is happening in water, acids
and bases can react in gas,

66
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,730
but almost always they're in an aqueous solution,

67
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,028
and when a proton gets donated in water, it
is accepted by water.

68
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:23,879
And H2O is converted into H3O+, the hydronium
ion.

69
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:30,779
So when an acid is added to water, it dissociates, like any other ionic compound, forming H3O+ and a negative ion.

70
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:34,488
The acid has donated a proton to the water.

71
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:36,519
Also a little chemistry terminology thing:

72
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:42,339
we usually just write H+ or say "protons in solution" when in fact we are referring to hydronium ions.

73
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:47,919
It's just a short hand. In reality, H+ in
aqueous solution is always H3O+.

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,620
Let's take a look at the dissociation of hydrochloric
acid for some more terminology bits here.

75
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:55,710
You see right off the bat that the HCl is
donating a proton.

76
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:58,209
But with many acids, particularly weaker acids,

77
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:02,558
the reaction can actually go back the other
way, with H3O+ donating it's proton.

78
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:05,619
So in this situation, every chemical in the
reaction,

79
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:09,589
also sometimes the major species, can be called
an acid or a base.

80
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:15,759
On the left hand side, the water is accepting the proton so it's the base, and HCl is donating it, so it's the acid.

81
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,539
And on the left hand side, the Cl- would be
accepting the proton,

82
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,338
so that would be the conjugate base, and the
hydronium ion is the conjugate acid.

83
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:25,778
The phrase conjugate acid always used to confuse me

84
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,218
because I thought it had something to do with
conjugating verbs.

85
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:30,748
But it's actually the older, original sense
of the word:

86
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:37,460
the one where conjugal, or marriage related visits for prisoners, come from, which means joined together.

87
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:42,560
For every acid, there is a conjugate base
and for every base there is a conjugate acid.

88
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,598
Previous definitions of acids and bases,

89
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:50,118
particularly the one proposed by our old friend
Arrhenius, relied on specific major species.

90
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,920
Most notably our friend the OH or hydroxide
ion.

91
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,249
And while hydroxide is in most bases, it's
not in all of them.

92
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:02,200
For example, ammonia acts as a base when it reacts with hydrochloric acid to form ammonium chloride.

93
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,399
There's no hydroxide but there is definitely
proton donation and acceptance going on.

94
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,778
Now acids and bases are not all created equal.

95
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:12,740
Certain acids really like to get rid of their
protons

96
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,348
and will only reluctantly convert back to
their conjugate base by accepting a proton.

97
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:21,728
We call them strong acids, and the conjugate
base is a weak base.

98
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:25,259
The same can be said for strong bases and
their weak conjugate acids.

99
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,680
The reason why all of the most interesting
acid-base chemistry happens in water

100
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,158
is that dihydrogen oxide is really great at being either a base, accepting a proton from an acid,

101
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:39,038
or an acid, donating a proton to a base.

102
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,618
Thus water is the world's most common acid
and also the most common base.

103
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,759
So, what does any of this have to do with
power plants and John Mullen's face?

104
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:54,849
When coal is burned the sulfur in it reacts
with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide.

105
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,220
That sulfur dioxide then reacts with water
and oxygen in the air to form sulfuric acid.

106
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:06,220
When that sulfuric acid rains down, a set of acid-base reactions take place that damages limestone and metal,

107
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,400
and acidifies the water supply, making life harder for fish, coral, salamanders, and pretty much everything else.

108
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,678
Limestone is mostly made of a chemical called
calcium carbonate.

109
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,559
The carbonate acts as the base, accepting sulfuric acid's protons and converting them to carbonic acid:

110
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:24,869
the conjugate acid, which breaks down into
CO2 and water.

111
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:29,089
Calcium and sulfate ions may precipitate as
a salt that's more commonly known as gypsum.

112
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:33,579
OK, so the average ton of coal in America
is about 3% sulfur.

113
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,180
Supposing a hundred percent of those 30 kilograms
of sulfur leaves the smoke stack

114
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,119
and converts to sulfuric acid, how much limestone
could that completely wash away?

115
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,969
As I've said before, just follow the units.

116
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:49,348
30 kilograms of sulfur multiplied by 1000
grams per kilogram,

117
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:58,079
multiply that by 1 mole over 32.1 grams of sulfur to get 935 moles of sulfur in every ton of coal burnt.

118
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,678
Now, if every mole of that sulfur is converted
to H2SO4

119
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,819
and every mole of that sulfuric acid reacts with a mole of limestone converting it to a mole of gypsum,

120
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,579
then that's 935 moles of limestone dissolved.

121
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:12,899
There are 100.1 grams of calcium carbonate
per mole.

122
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:19,749
If we multiply that by 935 moles we get 93,600
grams or 93.6 kilograms.

123
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:25,020
So each ton of coal burnt by a U.S. power
plant produces enough sulfuric acid

124
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,180
to dissolve about 94 kilograms of limestone.

125
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,038
And as we burn about a billion tons of coal
per year,

126
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,509
it's safe to say that no statue is safe, except
for ones built of materials immune to acids,

127
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:41,509
particularly oxidized copper, which will last
pretty much forever.

128
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:44,889
Hence, Lady Liberty's hand presiding over
the Planet of the Apes.

129
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:49,949
So, this is clearly a problem. I mean not
just for statues, but acid rain has killed

130
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,280
or harmed huge swaths of forests.

131
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,399
At the peak of acid rain problems in the U.S. the highest recorded acidity was around that of lemon juice,

132
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,909
which I can tell you, is pretty acidic: high
enough to irritate human skin.

133
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:06,480
This first became an issue for the power generation
when the British House of Lords, in 1929,

134
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,269
ruled that a power station was liable to damages
caused to nearby crops by acid rain.

135
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,129
So something had to be done, but what?

136
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:19,289
Well, we already know one very common chemical
that reacts easily with sulfuric acid:

137
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:24,000
good old limestone, and in England, there
is lots of limestone.

138
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,110
By passing the smoke stack gases through a
limestone slurry,

139
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:33,470
the SO2 converts to an acid and then reacts with the limestone forming CaSO3, calcium sulfate.

140
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,660
Now we're gonna do something a little different
for those of you who want to go the extra mile.

141
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:43,199
Assuming that one billion metric tons of 3%
sulfur coal was burnt in America every year,

142
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,320
and all of it is converted to SO2, how many tons of limestone would we need to scrub out 100% of that sulfur.

143
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,260
Answer us down below in the comments.

144
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,409
The limestone scrubber is a good system, but
it's not perfect.

145
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:58,889
Many other flue gas desulfurization systems
have been developed,

146
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,100
and now through a combination of good policy,
good science, and hard work,

147
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,220
about 95% of sulfur produced in coal fired
power plants in the U.S. is removed

148
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,920
before it leaves the smoke stack.

149
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,039
And through some even smarter chemistry, some of that SO2 is actually converted to industrially useful chemicals.

150
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,179
For example, pure sulfuric acid,

151
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:22,259
which is used in paper mills, iron and steel
making, industrial cleaner, and chemical synthesis.

152
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,399
Chemistry! Causing problems but also fixing
them.

153
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,620
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

154
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,929
If you were paying attention, you may have
learned that Chemistry can cause death,

155
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,679
that acids and bases are more complicated
than you thought they were,

156
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,019
and that acid donates protons while a base
accepts them.

157
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:42,419
You also should have learned that when an
acid donates a proton it forms a conjugate base

158
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,319
and when a base donates a proton it forms
a conjugate acid.

159
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,500
Also, we did a little bit of acid-base stoichiometry.

160
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,919
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Kim Krieger and myself.
