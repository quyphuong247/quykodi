00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,560
Propane, methane, butane, those single-bond
carbon chains we talked about last week,

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:06,189
they are important,
but they're kind of boring.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,410
Alkanes are just more of the same, add another
carbon to lengthen the chain.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,490
But toss a double bond in here or there, and
the situation gets a lot more complicated,

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,419
and interesting, and delicious.

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,740
Hydrocarbons can fuel cars and stoves and
stuff, but they can also fuel you:

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,739
dripping off your hamburger, melting into
your biscuit or frying up your tater tots.

8
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,639
Delicious, marvelous, complicated fats.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,380
Fats have a bunch of jargon associated with them, that the average person uses daily and with abandon,

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,980
despite having absolutely no idea what it
means.

11
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:42,359
But they still jabber on about saturated, or mono- polyunsaturated, omega-3, hydrogenated, or trans.

12
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,759
The differences between fats and what
makes them better or worse for you

13
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,259
is whether or not they have double and triple
bonds, and where and how those bonds occur.

14
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,140
Seemingly trivial changes in the structure
of a carbon chain

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,920
can completely change the chemistry of the
molecule,

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,679
including the chemistry of what happens when
you ingest it.

17
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,719
Yes, your body can tell the difference between them, and by the time we're done here today, you'll be able to as well.

18
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:14,379
[Theme Music]

19
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:18,000
Alkanes, as you'll recall, are saturated hydrocarbons.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,439
All of the carbons in a saturated hydrocarbon are bonded to the maximum number of atoms that carbon can accommodate: 4.

21
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,379
In unsaturated hydrocarbons, some of the carbon atoms are double or triple bonded with each other,

22
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,719
so they're only bonded with three or two atoms.

23
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,959
And when those double and triple bonds appear,
we've got whole new classes of hydrocarbons.

24
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,699
If they've got a double bond, we call them
alkenes, and those with triple bonds are alkynes.

25
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:43,849
So three words representing three different
groups of organic compounds:

26
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:47,959
alkanes for all single bonds, alkenes if they
contain double bonds,

27
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,069
and alkynes if they contain one or more triple
bonds.

28
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,289
How do you remember which is which?
Well, I have a trick that I use.

29
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,420
There's only one letter changing here: A in alkanes changes to E for alkenes and then to Y for alkynes.

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,939
In alphabetical order, A is first, E is second,
and Y is third.

31
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:06,439
Not too complicated, I hope.

32
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,719
And it's actually pretty nice that the words
are so similar,

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,970
because it means we can reuse all of those
old alkane rules.

34
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,250
The prefixes remain the same, but the suffixes
change in some fairly easy-to-predict ways.

35
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,620
Hydrocarbons that have one or more double
bonds end in -ene,

36
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,189
while the ones that have triple bonds use
the suffix -yne.

37
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:27,340
So a compound with 3 carbons and 1 double bond would be propene, 3 carbons and 1 triple bond: propyne.

38
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,479
All the other naming rules apply to alkenes
and alkynes too.

39
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,598
For instance, the main carbon chain, the longest one, is numbered in such a way that the various components,

40
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:37,979
including the double bond, have the lowest
numbers possible.

41
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:43,280
Now, the bonds in alkenes have a few tricks up their sleeves. It's not as simple as you might imagine.

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,180
Single bonds, also called sigma bonds, are
pretty simple,

43
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,480
and carbon atoms attached by them can rotate
around the bond freely.

44
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,959
That may not sound like a big deal at first, but alkenes and alkynes don't have that kind of freedom,

45
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,498
and that simple fact has a huge affect on
their properties.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,360
Double bonds consist of a sigma bond and a
pi bond.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,100
That pi bond bridges the sigma bond, locking
it in place.

48
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:09,340
So whatever's attached to the other sides of the carbon atoms can't change their orientation with respect to each other.

49
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,599
If all of those things attached to those carbons
are the same, it doesn't matter.

50
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,620
But if the parts are different, it's possible to have two totally different isomers of the same compound.

51
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,939
Let's build an example for ourselves.
2-butene should suffice.

52
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,949
So it starts with but-, so it has to be a
4 carbon chain.

53
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,739
It ends in -ene, so it needs to have a double
bond.

54
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,060
The 2 tells us that the double bond starts
on the second carbon.

55
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,000
So we've got our structure!
Or do we?

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,280
With the information we have, this 2-butene
could be one of two different isomers:

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,020
one with the methyl groups on the same side or one with the methyl groups on different sides.

58
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:46,100
They're not structural isomers like n-butane and i-butane, instead, they're what we call cis-trans isomers.

59
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:51,259
These have the atoms in the same position on the molecule, but the atoms are oriented differently in space.

60
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:56,459
Cis- comes from the Latin word that means on the same side and trans- is Latin based prefix that means across.

61
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,680
If the matching groups are on the same side
of the double bond like this, we call it cis-2-butene.

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,120
And if the two components are across from
each other, it's called trans-2-butene.

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,719
Note, by the way, that organic compounds cannot switch from cis- to trans- or the other way around.

64
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,859
You would have to break the pi bond, and thus,
the entire molecule to rotate between isomers.

65
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,099
The same rules apply no matter what's attached
to the double bond.

66
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:18,408
It might be a long hydrocarbon chain or a
halogen or an oxygen.

67
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:23,300
All that matters is that the matching components are next to each other or across from each other.

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,300
The triple bonds in alkynes, meanwhile, are composed of 1 sigma bond and 2 pi bonds for a total of 3 bonds.

69
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,520
The pi bonds prevent the triple bonds from
rotating here as well,

70
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,859
but triple bonded carbons can only bond to
one other atom, so even if it could rotate,

71
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,139
nothing would change.

72
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,959
Thus, no isomers with alkynes.
Phew.

73
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:45,069
OK I'm done describing for the moment.
Let's talk about some actual chemistry.

74
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:47,439
Pi bonds are significantly more unstable than
sigma bonds,

75
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,839
so double and triple bonds are pretty easy to break, opening the doors for some good chemistry.

76
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,038
Certain reactions open up a double or triple
bond to insert various atoms,

77
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:58,338
leaving only a single bond between the carbons.

78
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:03,519
These are called addition reactions because atoms are added to the carbons that were previously double bonded.

79
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,878
Probably the simplest addition reaction and
one that you've heard of is hydrogenation,

80
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,270
in which a molecule of hydrogen, H2, is added
across the bond.

81
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,299
To do this, a metal catalyst like platinum
is usually required to help break the H2 apart,

82
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,759
because that bond is very strong.

83
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,158
But once that's done, the hydrogen atoms readily
attach to the hydrocarbon molecule,

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,040
converting a double bond to a single bond.

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,860
Other molecules can break down a double bond
as well.

86
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,379
If a halogen, such as bromine, is added in the place of hydrogen, the reaction is called halogenation.

87
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,759
Water molecule: hydration. Oxygen gas: oxygenation.
You get the idea.

88
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,300
The point is that double or triple bonds can
be usually opened up fairly easily.

89
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,490
Alkenes can be made into alkanes and alkynes
can become either alkenes or alkanes

90
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,218
depending on how many atoms are added.

91
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,480
And those opened bonds can also provide connections
for carbon atoms to attach to each other, too,

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,060
opening the door for polymerization, which
we should talk about soon enough.

93
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,759
Now, using all these words we learned today, let's apply some to our society's ubiquitous fat lingo.

94
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,088
First, though, what is fat?

95
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:02,478
When three fatty acids, and we will talk about their structures more specifically in a later episode,

96
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,758
are bonded to a molecule of glycerol, that
is a triglyceride.

97
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,129
That's the stuff that we're generally talking
about when we say "fat."

98
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:14,379
The fatty acid chains, they have long hydrocarbon chains, are what we're mostly concerned with here.

99
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:18,189
They can be alkanes or alkenes, sometimes,
even rarely, alkynes.

100
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:22,399
So, we've heard of saturated fats. What does
that mean? It means no double bonds.

101
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,240
All of the carbon chains are alkanes and has
as many hydrogens as possible. It's saturated.

102
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,658
That means that there are no unstable pi bonds,
so they tend to have longer shelf lives.

103
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,200
They are also able to lay flat against each other, making them more likely to be solid at room temperature.

104
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,399
The bad news is that they're kind of hard for your body to do chemistry with since they're so stable,

105
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,120
so they often just stick around in your body,
clogging stuff up.

106
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,209
Now, what about hydrogenated oils?

107
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:46,988
Vegetable oils are generally poly-unsaturated
fats,

108
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:50,028
meaning that they have lots of double bonds,
or at least more than one.

109
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:54,329
They're much healthier for us than saturated
fats and they're also generally cheaper.

110
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:59,060
Since saturated fats are most likely made from animals, which are notoriously difficult to maintain.

111
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,920
But they're also less stable and are usually liquid at room temperature, and thus, harder to spread on your toast.

112
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,400
Food chemists use hydrogenation to saturate the unsaturated fat, making it spreadable and also stabilizing it.

113
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,560
And, since it's made from vegetable oil instead
of animal product, it is much cheaper to create.

114
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,019
Sometimes the oils are fully hydrogenated,
creating saturated alkanes.

115
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:20,348
And sometimes, they're just partially hydrogenated,

116
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:24,819
usually leaving just one double bond in the fatty acid chain, creating a mono-unsaturated fat.

117
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,088
Now it's not just whether or not there are
double bonds,

118
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:31,199
the location of the double bonds also has an effect on what your body can do with the molecules,

119
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,560
which leads me to omega-3s.

120
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,000
Omega-3 refers to a specific location of the
double bond.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,779
3 carbons from the end, or omega of the fatty
acid chain.

122
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:46,699
Your body is completely incapable of making this sort of fatty acid, and yet, it need them to survive.

123
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,610
So, you have to eat them.

124
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,699
A final question: what can you tell me about
the dreaded trans fats?

125
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,329
Well we know that they're unsaturated alkenes

126
00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:00,308
because saturated fats don't have double bonds,
and thus, can't have cis- and trans- isomers.

127
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:04,599
But we also know from every advertisement
about healthy food that probably isn't that

128
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:07,738
healthy ever, that trans fats are really bad!

129
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,220
So it's an unsaturated fat, but it's really bad for you, that doesn't really jive. What's going on?

130
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,700
Well, almost all natural, unsaturated fats are cis- fats, which our bodies are prepared for and know what to do with.

131
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,159
Trans fats are created by partially hydrogenating
vegetable oil on a cheap path to tasty fat,

132
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,280
without all the saturated fat on the dietary
label.

133
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,399
However, these trans fats pretty much act exactly like saturated fats, except that since they're naturally very rare,

134
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,740
our bodies don't have good systems to break
them down into healthy byproducts.

135
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:42,259
So, as you can see, unsaturated fats went from the best kind of fat to the worst kind of fat with 1 little isomeric change.

136
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:45,759
Your body can definitely tell the difference.
And now, so can you.

137
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,940
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

138
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,779
If you paid attention, you learned that hydrocarbons
with double bonds are called alkenes

139
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,899
and those with triple bonds are called alkynes and that the naming rules are the same as for alkanes.

140
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:02,340
You also learned a little bit about cis-trans isomerism and learned a few important reactions of alkenes and alkynes

141
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,659
such as hydrogenation, halogenation, and polymerization.

142
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:10,139
And finally, you learned what all of those names of the different kinds of fats really mean.

143
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,899
