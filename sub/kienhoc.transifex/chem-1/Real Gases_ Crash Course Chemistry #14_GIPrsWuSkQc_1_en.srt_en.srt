1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,459
One of the things that teachers who aren't
me tend to say is that,

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,269
you need to learn all this stuff because someday
you'll be out there in the "real world"

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:09,230
and you'll need to know how to do all the
things that adults do.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,260
First of all, I don't really believe this because I think you should be learning just 'cause learning is fun.

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,528
But I also remember when I was kid hearing
that

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:22,259
and thinking that this real world couldn't be that much tougher than high school, because it was pretty tough.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,800
But looking back, I can tell you that life indeed does get a bit more complicated after 12th grade,

8
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:29,309
with jobs, and bills, and raising kids, and
taxes,

9
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:32,589
and I haven't done any of the raising kids
but I've seen it and it looks really hard.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,490
And then there's always knowing that there's
always more work waiting to be done.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,560
But the truth is while it's more complicated,
it's not really that much harder than high school.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,540
Most adults rarely have to take pop quizzes, or final exams, or ask permission to go to the bathroom,

13
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,460
wear orthodontics, have a curfew, live on
an allowance, find a date for prom,

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,740
or shower in a room full of people that they don't like, all while trying to build your first real lasting relationships.

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,640
Yes, "real life" is tough but the ideal world
of teenagers: not ideal.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,700
Turns out that the biggest problem isn't so
much that the pressure increases in "real life",

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,420
you just have to learn a few new tricks to
deal with it.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,519
And the same goes for gases.

19
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:21,280
[Theme Music]

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,618
Last week we discussed how you can identify certain qualities of gas by using the Ideal Gas Law. PV = nRT.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,880
It states that the product of the pressure and the volume of a gas is equal to the number of moles of the gas,

22
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,879
which we call n times universal gas constant
called R times the temperature of the gas.

23
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,780
R is always the same and if we know three of the other four things we can calculate the fourth one.

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:50,019
But the problem with that equation is that true to its name, it only works under hypothetical ideal circumstances.

25
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,539
In chemistry, as in all things, there's the
best of all possible worlds,

26
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:58,748
which is usually easier and more fun to think
about and then there's real life.

27
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:03,248
To understand and describe how gases behave
in real life, we need a few new tricks.

28
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:08,240
And it was dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals who figured out those tricks for us.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,000
Van der Waals was born in 1837 in the Netherlands,
the first of 10 children.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,800
His father was a carpenter and working class kids weren't allowed to go to the fancy school that led to university.

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,420
Instead, he had to settle for advanced primary
education, which ended when he was 15.

32
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,619
He didn't let that define him though, and
instead of becoming a carpenter,

33
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:31,298
as most people would have in his position,
he became a teacher's apprentice.

34
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:34,510
He worked hard and in time, went from apprentice
to teacher,

35
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:36,789
and eventually became the director of the
whole school.

36
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,919
During those years, van der Waals continued
educating himself, as well as his pupils,

37
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,019
and he took advantage of every class he could
possibly take.

38
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,780
Over the course of many years he ended up taking more than enough courses in math and physics to earn a degree,

39
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:52,949
but as he hadn't gone through the proper channels
as a student, he wasn't allowed to have one.

40
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:56,489
So, why would he bother to study so hard with no obvious reward?

41
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,579
Well, first of all, he just really loved physics.

42
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,239
But, more importantly, he was trying to answer
a question.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,560
See, at that time, scientists only knew how to analyze the behavior of gases with the ideal gas law,

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,938
just like you, at this point.

45
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,549
Most of those calculations produced very little
error,

46
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,290
but some scientists had noticed that when
a gas was in a situation that crowds its particles,

47
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:21,048
high pressure, low temperature, just high density, it starts to deviate from what the ideal gas law predicts.

48
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,890
They couldn't figure out why sometimes they
got the wrong answer.

49
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:26,569
And van der Waals was determined to figure
it out.

50
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:30,789
Finally at the age of 36, after trying for
roughly two decades,

51
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:33,818
van der Waals was awarded a doctorate in theoretical
physics.

52
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:38,900
And even more exciting, by that time he had figured out the solution to the puzzle of real gas behavior.

53
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,680
In his doctoral thesis, he introduced his new gas law, which we now call the 'van der Waals Equation,'

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,400
and explained why gases don't behave quite
the way everyone thought they should.

55
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,239
And in 1910 when he was 73 years old, he was
awarded a Nobel Prize for his work,

56
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,908
and I'm glad they hurried it along because
you can't get a Nobel Prize after you die.

57
00:03:57,908 --> 00:04:01,378
So, what exactly is the problem with this
ideal gas law?

58
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,959
Well, if the two sides of the ideal gas law
were equal all the time and for all gases,

59
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,340
as we would expect for something called a
law,

60
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,080
then PV divided by nRT should equal 1, as any fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal.

61
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,300
This relationship can be shown graphically,

62
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,689
but when you work with real gases in a real
lab

63
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:24,850
it becomes apparent that the relationship
isn't constant at all, much less equal to one.

64
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:31,070
Instead, it changes with increasing pressure, and the amount that it changes is different for different gases.

65
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,939
So much for the whole constant thing.

66
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,879
OK, let's just start over with the ideal
gas law, and we'll work from there.

67
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,528
We create a closed system by sealing gas in
a container so the amount of gas is constant.

68
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:44,699
R is always constant, and for the purpose
of this discussion,

69
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,769
we'll assume that we're holding the temperature
constant.

70
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,180
So nothing here can change except for P and
V.

71
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,150
If the ideal gas law worked in all situations,

72
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,929
any increase in pressure would cause the volume
to decrease at an equal rate,

73
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,000
thus keeping the product of the two constant.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,819
But as we saw on our graph, that's not really
what happens.

75
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:02,839
So...what does happen? Well let's ask our
buddy, Johannes van der Waals.

76
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,409
Van der Waal's solution depends on the existence
and interaction of molecules.

77
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,310
Now, we take that for granted today,

78
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,079
but remember the existence of even atoms was
disputed until Einstein proved it in 1905.

79
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,919
Few scientists in 1873 were prepared to accept
the theory that required atoms not only to exist,

80
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,360
but also to form molecules that interacted
in complicated ways.

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,360
So the problems with the ideal gas law do
depend on interactions between molecules,

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,270
specifically, two simple facts:

83
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:32,490
First, real gases aren't some sort of massless,
mystical vapors.

84
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,418
They're made of real, physical particles that
take up real, physical space.

85
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:41,288
And the space that they take up deducts from
the amount of space that's actually available

86
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:42,829
inside the container they're in.

87
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:47,939
So when we talk about the volume in the ideal gas law, we need V not to be the volume of the container,

88
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,959
but the volume of the container minus the space that the particles themselves are taking up.

89
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,840
So we have to create a correction for volume,
and that correction is going to include n,

90
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,728
because it's proportional to the number of
molecules in the container,

91
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:04,269
but also b, an experimentally determined constant
that's different for every type of gas.

92
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:09,439
Obviously gases with large atoms or molecules would need more correction than those with small particles,

93
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,339
and with that V is reduced to a more accurate
value.

94
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:18,199
Second, even though some people didn't want to accept it, particles in real gases are attracted to each other.

95
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,259
Even more so when they're close together.

96
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,668
When they're crowded, they tend to stick closer
together,

97
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:26,848
and therefore hit the sides of the container
less often, decreasing the internal pressure.

98
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:28,839
So, when we're figuring out the number for
P,

99
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,388
we have to account for the decrease in pressure
that's caused by those intermolecular attractions.

100
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:36,460
To correct the pressure, we start out with
n and V

101
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:39,628
because the amount of attraction depends on
both of those factors.

102
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,729
In addition, they're both squared, for complicated
reasons, having to do with how particles interact.

103
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,918
Just trust me -- and van der Waals.

104
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,258
You should trust him because he's much more
trustworthy than I am.

105
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:55,579
The we include another experimentally determined constant that is again different for every gas.

106
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:59,680
Some types of atoms and molecules are more
attracted to each other than other kinds are,

107
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,560
and the degree of attraction determines the
value of a.

108
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,959
So, we add all of that to P and the formula
ends up looking like this.

109
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,519
That's the corrected pressure times the corrected
volume equals nRT.

110
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,799
And yeah, that is a long way to go to get
to a corrected equation!

111
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,879
I don't know about you, but I'm not gonna do all that work and then not use it, so let's try it out.

112
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,348
Suppose we had a balloon with a volume of
ten liters.

113
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:27,378
And, I know that that sounds like a lot, but
it's only about this much - big balloon.

114
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:31,598
How much pressure do you think the gas is
exerting on the insides of the wall of the balloon?

115
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:33,519
Well, let's try calculating it both ways.

116
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,750
We will try it first with the ideal gas law.

117
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:43,060
Our volume is 10.0 Liters, let's say I've put
exactly 0.500 mole of nitrogen gas in this,

118
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:51,819
R is always the same, and the temperature here is, let's just say, 21.50, which converts to 294.65 Kelvin.

119
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:58,060
If we do the calculation, round appropriately, we find that the answer is 122 kilopascals, OK?

120
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,288
But what does the van der Waals Equation tell
us?

121
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:03,620
We have to plug in all the same numbers, plus
the two correction factors.

122
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,759
The pressure correction factor a for nitrogen gas is 139 kilopascals per liter square, mole square,

123
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,110
and the volume correction factor b is 0.039
liters per mole.

124
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,080
Do the math, round correctly, and you have
122 kilopascals.

125
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,019
Well, that is disappointing.
No difference at all.

126
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,319
Stupid van der Waals!

127
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,439
No, wait a minute!
We talked about this.

128
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,259
The Van der Waals equation is most important and most relevant at low temperatures and high pressures.

129
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,580
So, how can we increase the pressure inside this balloon?

130
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,538
How can we get the gas particles closer together?

131
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,299
We know that pressure is caused by the gas molecules bumping against the inside of the container.

132
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,539
We can make them bump around more often by
increasing the temperature,

133
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:49,769
or by crowding the same molecules into a smaller
container.

134
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,159
It's hard to keep track of the temperature
inside this balloon,

135
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,699
so let's try increasing the pressure by using
a smaller balloon.

136
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,490
Or, into a ping-pong ball!

137
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,629
Now, this contains about 1.00 Liters of gas,
and obviously I probably can't squeeze this

138
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:09,450
much gas into a container this size cause
the ping-pong ball would explode...

139
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,450
Probably.
I'm not trying.

140
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:17,410
But we could certainly calculate how much pressure there would be if we did squeeze all of this gas into this container.

141
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:20,719
Starting with the ideal gas law, plug in all
the same numbers as before,

142
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,420
except change the volume to 0.100 liters.

143
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:28,199
Do the calculation and you'll find that it
gives us 12,200 kilopascals of pressure.

144
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,040
Okay, that's not too surprising.

145
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,799
We have the same amount of gas in a container
that's one hundredth the size of the first one.

146
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,319
So it makes sense that it would exert 100
times as much pressure.

147
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,778
Now we've got to try it out with the van der
Waals equation.

148
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,539
If we plug all the appropriate values and correction factors into the van der Waals equation and do the calculation,

149
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:52,529
we find that the gas in the small container
actually exerts a pressure of 11,800 kilopascals.

150
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,139
So it really does matter!

151
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:59,019
That's a difference of 3,000 kilopascals from
what we would expect using the ideal gas law alone!

152
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:02,639
And that kind of mistake isn't not a huge
problem when you're just blowing up balloons,

153
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,000
but it definitely would be a problem if you
were taking measurements in a lab,

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,708
or planning a mission to the bottom of the
Marianas Trench.

155
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,639
Pretty impressive stuff for a guy who wasn't allowed a normal education because society was like,

156
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,199
"Oh, your dad's a carpenter..."

157
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,250
I'm totally impressed by all that van der
Waals has taught us about real gases,

158
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,970
but I think it's also important to remember
the lesson we can learn from his life.

159
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,550
Don't give up on your dreams.
Seriously.

160
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:26,059
You never know where they're going to take
you.

161
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,750
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

162
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,059
If you were paying attention,

163
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:34,099
you learned that the constants in the gas law aren't really all that constant when stuff gets real,

164
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,060
that the ideal gas law has to be corrected for volume because atoms and molecules take up space

165
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,990
and for pressure because they're attracted
to each other.

166
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,180
And that Einstein was behind a lot more of
what we know today than most people realize.

167
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,549
You also learned that the correction factors
of the van der Waals equation really do matter,

168
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:54,838
but only under specific conditions and that
you should never give up just because things

169
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,269
are hard or people think your ideas are crazy.

170
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,269
Because, in the end, they may just turn out
to be right.

171
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:02,828
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi Gonzalez.

172
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,479
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino
and myself.

173
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,920
And our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko
Langner.

174
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,708
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

175
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,559
Our script supervisor and sound designer is
Michael Aranda.

176
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,359
And our graphics team is Thought Cafe.

177
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,200
That didn't go as far as I thought it was
going to.
