1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
The diamond in this ring will cut into any
substance on Earth.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,300
It's the hardest, natural material on the
planet.

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,960
But it's just carbon, the same element that
makes up the graphite in this pencil lead,

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,429
which is so soft, that it's intended purpose
is to rub off on stuff.

5
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:20,799
The atoms are all of the same element and
they're all bonded together with covalent bonds,

6
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:22,580
so what's the difference?

7
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:29,259
Well the atoms are arranged differently, they form different atomic networks and therefore, different network solids.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,739
In chemistry we place networks in various
categories

9
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,960
because each type of network has characteristics that make them useful for all sorts of handy applications.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,980
You can have a chain of identical molecules,
each molecule is connected on two sides.

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,859
So glycogen which is just a chain of glucose
molecules is bigger than glucose

12
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,289
but it's not super durable as substances go.

13
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:53,369
A sheet of particles like the proteins that make up silk is a more sophisticated kind of network

14
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,009
because the particles are connected on all
sides,

15
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,280
but its connections are still two-dimensional
so it's only stronger in those directions.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,519
Now, you can stack sheets on top of each other in order to build a network into the third dimension,

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,170
but then the sheets just slide around on each
other

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,079
and they're not much more useful or durable
than they were before.

19
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:13,618
A truly three-dimensional network branches
out in multiple directions,

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:20,359
forming covalent bonds in a structure that resist forces much better than a chain or a sheet of the same material.

21
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,400
So in the most basic sense, the way atoms and molecules bond to form network is what make many materials what they are.

22
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,909
It explains why diamond is so hard while graphite
is so soft

23
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,840
and how the main ingredient in sand can also be made into the silicon wafers that make our electronics.

24
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:38,439
It's also the key to how we can turn this,
into this.

25
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,478
Though before you send the kiss off email
to your student loan officer,

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,340
I should warn you that you won't be able to
do that at home.

27
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:54,060
[Theme Music]

28
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,240
Network solids are one of the three types
of atomic solid we've talked about,

29
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,019
materials that are made of individual atoms
rather than molecules or ions.

30
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:07,780
The cool and special thing about network solid is that the atoms exist in, you guessed it, a network structure,

31
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,659
that is each atoms is linked to several others
in various directions.

32
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:15,719
Like all networks, this makes the arrangement
both strong and stable.

33
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,240
It also provide some other properties that
may surprise you.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,280
If you've seen our episode on atomic orbitals you know the way the electron in a chemical bond orient themselves,

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
that is the way the orbitals hybridize, has
a big effect on the properties of a substance.

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,280
If water's orbitals hybridize differently for example, it might not be polar and life as we know it wouldn't be possible.

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,340
It's the same with network solids. Orbitals
and their hybridizations make a huge difference.

38
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,319
Thankfully though, orbitals can't be different. They are the way they are because of the laws of physics.

39
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,919
So first, let's look at carbon. Pure carbon
can bond with itself in two different ways.

40
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,699
In the first scenario, the outer electrons of each atom are arranged into SP2 hybridized orbitals

41
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:57,819
with two other atoms for a total of three
lobes in a flat trigonal arrangement.

42
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,180
This creates a sheet with a hexagonal structure and with one unhybridized P orbital left on each atom.

43
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:07,409
These orbitals form pi bonds that merge into
an extensive network on their own

44
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,840
and this gives the structure its real strength.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,229
You know this carbon network by its street
name, graphite.

46
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:18,679
The pi bonds within each sheet is really strong which allows graphite to withstand a lot of pressure.

47
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,379
But as with any sheet-like formation, only
in two dimensions.

48
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:26,639
The sheets are only held to other sheets with
really weak van der Waals forces.

49
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,639
They allow the sheets to slide on top of each other so they can easily be removed layer by layer.

50
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,019
That's why graphite is so fantastic for writing
with.

51
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,320
When you use a pencil, layer after layer of
graphite is being transferred to the paper.

52
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,709
That slipping sheet structure also makes graphite
an excellent lubricant.

53
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:49,000
It can break down into an extremely fine powder of slippery platelets that almost any substance can slide easily over.

54
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,179
Which is why it's great for things like sticky
locks.

55
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,620
And because the electrons that form the pi bonds in the graphite are able to move from one atom to another,

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,080
graphite also conducts electricity.

57
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,980
Most of the properties of graphite, you'll notice, don't apply to the other type of network that carbon can form, diamond.

58
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,399
Even though the graphite in the pencil is made of the exact same thing as diamond, pure carbon atoms,

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,039
they're different from each other in almost
every possible way.

60
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,129
And all of these differences are simply because
of the way their atoms are bonded.

61
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:22,829
In diamond, the bonding electrons in each
atom are arranged in SP3 orbitals.

62
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,729
Four lobes that are as far away from each
other as possible.

63
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,069
Again, information you should have in you
from the orbital episode.

64
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,459
Each lobe in that tetrahedral structure overlaps
and bonds with one on an adjacent carbon atom

65
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:39,269
creating a totally uniform, three dimensional
network of carbon in every direction.

66
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:44,209
So any stress on this network will be resisted
by multiple atoms and multiple bonds.

67
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:48,419
This stability is what makes diamonds so famously,
incredibly hard.

68
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,699
But the downside is that this rigid structure
also makes them quite brittle.

69
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,089
In other words, they break before they bend.

70
00:04:54,089 --> 00:05:00,049
And like any crystal and solid they tend to break along the seam between atoms called a cleavage plane.

71
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,560
And these are the places that the diamond
cutters attack first.

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,879
And here's another way that the diamond's network structure makes it totally different from graphite.

73
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,060
Diamonds are electrical insulators, not conductors.

74
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,089
This is because the carbon atoms in diamonds
share sigma bonds, not pi bonds,

75
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,789
which doesn't allow the electrons much freedom
of movement.

76
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,220
And if an electron can't move around, it can't be used to transfer energy in the form of electricity or anything else.

77
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,540
But even though diamond is terrible at conducting
electricity,

78
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,860
both graphite and diamond are good conductors
of heat.

79
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,699
That's because of the strength of their covalent
bonds.

80
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:35,089
These type bonds require that when one atom
vibrates, all the atoms around it vibrate

81
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,479
in exactly the same way.

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,900
So when thermal energy increases in one region, it spreads quickly throughout the diamond or graphite.

83
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,979
Even though there is some space between the
sheets of graphite,

84
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,460
the structure of the sheets is so rigid that the vibrations transfer through the whole mass.

85
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,960
And as you may have guessed, diamond conducts
heat even better than graphite

86
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,399
because each atom spreads that energy in three
directions rather than two.

87
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,759
Graphite has another interesting response
to heat.

88
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,680
When it's heated to very high temperatures, around 3000 degrees Celsius, and placed under extreme pressure,

89
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:08,540
about 15 million kPa, the atoms rearrange themselves from a two dimensional sheet network into a 3D network.

90
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,000
Now that's roughly the amount of pressure
of 15 metric tons on one square centimeter.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,699
Basically five elephants sitting on the heel
of a high-heeled shoe.

92
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,979
That tremendous heat provides energy for the
breaking and reforming of bonds,

93
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,030
which allows the atoms to reorganize themselves
to relieve all of that pressure.

94
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:28,939
And that my friends is how you can turn common
graphite into diamonds.

95
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,899
So no, you cannot do that at home.

96
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,519
But just like with you and me sometimes what
seems like an excessive amount of pressure

97
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:38,089
can end up forcing changes that stabilize
things in the long run.

98
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:43,899
Now it seems kinda odd but the opposite reaction, diamonds turning into graphite, is even more difficult.

99
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:49,319
So much so that it's functionally impossible for it to happen naturally. At least on this planet.

100
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,300
Even though it is possible under those incredibly
hot elephants on heel circumstances to break

101
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,990
the covalent bonds in graphite,

102
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,668
the activation energy required to break those
bonds in diamond is so high

103
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,379
that the rate of its breakdown is essentially
zero for all earthly purposes.

104
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:05,689
The similarities and especially the differences
between diamonds and graphite

105
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:08,430
are an amazing display of the power of chemistry.

106
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,519
Even though they're both made of the exact
same material,

107
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,579
the mere difference in the nature and arrangement of their chemical bonds completely changes their physical

108
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,539
and chemical and electrical characteristics.

109
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,580
Also, one is pretty and one is pencil lead.

110
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,959
They explain why diamond can be used to cut
through glass and drill through rock,

111
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,989
while graphite is soft enough to write and
lubricate with.

112
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,069
And yes, diamonds are more valuable,

113
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,949
but you could argue that graphite with its
easily erasable mass producible pencils

114
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,439
might have done more good for the world.

115
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,089
The pencil is maybe mightier than the diamond.

116
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,339
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry, by the way.

117
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:44,899
If you paid attention, you learned that networks lend strength and widely distributed stability to network solids.

118
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,159
You learned that both diamonds and graphite are network solids made up of pure carbon atoms

119
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,000
but that the arrangement of those atoms in 2 and 3 dimensions respectively give them completely different properties.

120
