1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:08,839
2640 lumens. 1 foot.
2.3 kilograms. 9 volts. Aaah!

2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,980
I just closed the circuit with my tongue and
I felt all 9 of the volts.

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,040
So what do all these things have in common?

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,059
They're units. Yes, but they're also absolutely,
completely arbitrary.

5
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:29,719
[Theme Music]

6
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,280
You know who decides how much a kilogram weighs?

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,399
A hunk of platinum and iridium known as the
International Prototype Kilogram or IPK.

8
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,259
The IPK isn't just how much a kilogram weighs.
In a very real sense the IPK is the kilogram.

9
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:48,599
Every other kilogram is exactly the same as
the IPK,

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,179
and the IPK is the lump of metal that decides
what that mass is.

11
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:58,439
A kilogram is defined as being the same mass
as the IPK.

12
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,818
We made kilograms up just like we made up
seconds and weeks and volts and newtons.

13
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,638
There's nothing about these things that makes
them them.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,218
Someone just decided one day that that was
a kilogram.

15
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,179
Now the fact that I find units fascinating probably says more about me then it does about units,

16
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,820
but I can talk about them all day.

17
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:20,199
For example, did you know that the International
System of Units only includes seven base units

18
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:23,949
and every other unit is derived from those
units?

19
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,829
Speed is length divided by time.

20
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:29,950
Acceleration is speed divided by time again,
so meters per second per second.

21
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,060
Force is that acceleration multiplied by mass,
cause F=ma remember?

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,320
Work done in joules is force multiplied by
distance.

23
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,578
And power is work divided by time, so how much work can be done per unit of time. Makes sense.

24
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:49,120
It goes pretty deep, and it's absolutely correct to say that there are an infinite number of possible derived units,

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,219
just most of them aren't useful enough to
name.

26
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:55,679
But here's a bit of trivia for you. When I say watts or hertz, those things are just regular words.

27
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:57,519
No special capitalization necessary.

28
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,899
But Hertz and Watt, they were real people
with like last names that were capitalized.

29
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,480
So what's up with that? Well, getting a unit
named after you is kind of the holy grail of science.

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,900
To quote Richard Hamming:

31
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:13,030
"True greatness is when your name - like hertz
and watt - is spelled with a lowercase letter."

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,919
Of course when these geniuses were first piecing
together how the world works

33
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,239
they had no idea that there were fundamental
basic units beneath it all.

34
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,909
They were basing all of their units on arbitrary
values because, well,

35
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:27,930
how could there possibly be a fundamental
amount of mass or distance.

36
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,560
Interestingly, one of the standard base units is derived from an actual value though not a universal one.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,879
The second is 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of the time it takes for the Earth to rotate a single time.

38
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:44,209
That's something, at least but it also illustrates
an interesting point.

39
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:49,420
As fundamental as that seems, when you get down to the dirty details things start to get kind of cloudy.

40
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,479
The Earth's rotation for example is slowing
down.

41
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,419
Does that mean that seconds should also slow
down?

42
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:58,269
No. That would mess up every calculation ever.

43
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,310
So seconds are slowly becoming less and less
based on reality.

44
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,780
Now don't worry. It's gonna take forever for
the Earth to slow down noticeably.

45
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,250
And when it does we'll just keep adding leap
seconds to keep things balanced.

46
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,590
But units are extremely important in chemistry
and in sciences in general,

47
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,360
as we learned when the Mars Climate Orbiter
crashed into Mars

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,340
because instructions were inputted in the
wrong units.

49
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,420
Next time you get a B instead of an A because
you didn't keep track of your units,

50
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,219
just remember at least you didn't destroy
a 300 million dollar mission to Mars.

51
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,060
But what do I mean when I say keep track of
your units?

52
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,979
Well. I mean watch them. Do not let them do anything you didn't tell them to do because they're sneaky.

53
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,780
And a lot of chemistry is just converting
between units.

54
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,180
So say you are in a car, and the car is going
60 miles per hour.

55
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,069
Now right now everyone who doesn't live in
America is like:

56
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,629
"Boo, miles are terrible. Convert to kilometers
Hank!"

57
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,189
Well I'll do you one better. From a scientific
perspective, kilometers are terrible too.

58
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,469
They're just as arbitrary. We should use something
more universal.

59
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:01,389
Like lightyears. The amount of distance light can travel in a year. And hours, hours is no fun.

60
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,689
So let's convert to lightyears per second.
60 miles per hour.

61
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:08,340
When you say it it sounds like a whole number
with a single unit.

62
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,549
But it's not. It's actually a fraction. 60
miles over 1 hour.

63
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,350
Let's start with the easy part. Getting to
the seconds.

64
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,930
So first we've got to get to minutes. So there's 60 minutes per hour. And also 1 hour per 60 minutes.

65
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,540
That fraction once we have it can flip either
way.

66
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,500
We want it with the hours on the top, on the
numerator. Why?

67
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,279
Because we want the units to cancel. We want
to destroy the hours.

68
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,580
We don't want them in our units when we're
done.

69
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:38,680
And then the same thing happens again with
1 minute per 60 seconds. Now we go to lightyears.

70
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,560
I asked Google, and there's 1 light-year in
every 5.9 * 10^12 miles.

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,780
Looking at this we see that the hours cancel
and the minutes cancel and the miles cancel.

72
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:51,819
Leaving us with lightyears per second. That's
really what matters.

73
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,620
We've come out with the correct units.

74
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,340
The rest is just hammering at the calculator
to discover that a car going 60 mph is also going

75
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:02,319
9.3 * 10^-12 lightyears per second.

76
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,839
Now we perform an important test. The "does
this make sense?" test.

77
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:11,619
And yes indeed it does because 9.3 * 10^-12
is a very, very, very, very small number.

78
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,459
Which makes sense because when you're traveling
in a car you're going

79
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:19,359
a very, very, very, very, very, very, very
tiny fraction of a light-year every second.

80
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,720
Now there are probably gonna be fifty to a
hundred thousand people that watch this video.

81
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,080
And I'm gonna guess that maybe a solid seven of you did the math along with me with your calculator out.

82
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:30,379
Now I'm not giving you a hard time. That's
just my guess.

83
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,060
If you want to follow along with your calculator
in the future that might be helpful.

84
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,839
It would at very least be very nerdy.

85
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,439
But if you have been following along with your calculator, you might maybe have noticed something interesting.

86
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,519
I said 9.3 * 10^-12. When your calculator...

87
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:53,019
Your calculator probably said something like
9.3487658140029 * 10^-12.

88
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:59,379
So why, when I had so many more numbers to give, did I only give two? Was I trying to save time?

89
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,980
Well obviously not, because now I appear to
be wasting time talking about it.

90
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,580
Do you think that it would be too hard for
me to remember all those numbers?

91
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,829
Well obviously not, because I just did it.
So I will tell you why.

92
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:13,599
When you're doing experimental calculations, there's two kinds of numbers. There's exact and measured.

93
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,960
Exact numbers are like the number of seconds
in a minute or the number of eggs in a dozen.

94
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:23,879
They're defined that way and thus we know them in effect all the way out to an infinite number of decimal places.

95
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:31,319
If I say that there are a dozen eggs you
know that that's 12. It's not 12.0000000001

96
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,219
or 11.9999999. It's 12.

97
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,640
But that's not true for the number of miles
per hour my car was going.

98
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,579
That car wasn't going 60.0000-out into infinity
mph.

99
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:47,219
I only know the speed of my car to two decimal
places because that's all I get from the speedometer.

100
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:57,080
So the car could have been going 59.87390039 mph or 60.49321289 mph; the speedometer would still say 60.

101
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,639
And no matter how well I measure the car's
speed,

102
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,019
I will never know it at the same level of precision that I know the number of eggs in a dozen.

103
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:06,639
So that's the second type of number, measured
numbers.

104
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,360
Now the cool thing about measured numbers,

105
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,280
because you never ever know them exactly,
is that they tell you two things at once.

106
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,959
First, they tell you the number that was measured.

107
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,959
And second, they tell you the precision at
which that number was measured.

108
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,918
People often get their heads all tangled up
about this,

109
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,738
but with a measured number you just have to remember that the actual number goes out to infinite decimal places,

110
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,350
you just never know all of them. You can't.
It's impossible,.

111
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:37,640
So when my scale says 175 lbs, that doesn't mean 175.000000 lbs. It means 175.something lbs.

112
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,399
And all those numbers after the five? We don't
know them.

113
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,639
And here's the thing, a measured number can
be pretty unhelpful if you don't have knowledge

114
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,560
of the precision of the measurement.

115
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,620
So you have to conserve the precision through
your calculations

116
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,069
or else you might end up killing someone with
an imprecise dose of insulin or something.

117
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,800
So we have a set of rules for what are called
significant figures:

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,210
these are the digits in your number that you
actually know.

119
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,259
With my speedometer there are two: 6 and 0.

120
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,939
But 0 is weird, because sometimes it's just
used as a placeholder.

121
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:09,680
Like if I said that the fastest plane can
go 13,000 mph, which it can by the way.

122
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
An unmanned military test glider did it in
2011.

123
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,780
That's not an exact number, those zeroes are
just placeholders.

124
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,859
So when a number ends in a zero, or two or three zeroes, it's hard to tell if those zeroes are significant.

125
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,800
But this all gets so much simpler when you use scientific notation, which since it's science we should.

126
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,060
So 60 mph would instead be 6.0 * 10^1. We
get that zero is significant because we wrote it.

127
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:39,879
Otherwise it would just be 6 * 10^1. We keep
that zero around because we actually know it.

128
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:42,558
Scientific notation is awesome by the way,
once you get the hang of it.

129
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:45,458
If you're having trouble you can always just
type it into Google or your calculator to

130
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,469
see exactly what number we're talking about,

131
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,410
but the number of the exponent just tells
you how many places to move the decimal point.

132
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,219
So to the 1st power you move it one to the
right and you get 60.

133
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,860
To the negative 1st power you move the decimal
point one place to the left and you get 0.60.

134
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,580
To the fifth power, one, two, three, four, five, and you get six with five zeroes or 600,000.

135
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:12,160
Of course your significant figures get preserved,
so 2.4590 * 10^-4 is 0.00024590 and you still

136
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,779
get the same five sig figs.

137
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:17,889
Now to the magic of figuring out how many
sig figs your answer should have.

138
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,578
There are two simple rules for this.

139
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,740
If it's addition or subtraction it's only the number of figures after the decimal point that matters.

140
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,749
The number with the fewest figures after the
decimal point

141
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:29,189
decides how many figures you can have after
the decimal in your answer.

142
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:34,168
So 1,495.2+1.9903 you do the math.

143
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:39,769
First you get 1,497.1903 and then you round
to the first decimal,

144
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:45,419
because that first number only had one figure
after the decimal. So you get 1,497.2.

145
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:50,319
And for multiplication just make sure the answer has the same sig figs as your least precise measurement.

146
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,640
So 60 x 5.0839 = 305.034,
but we only know two sig figs,

147
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,399
so everything after those
first two numbers is zeroes: 300.

148
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,339
Of course then we'd have to point out to everyone that the second zero but not the third is significant,

149
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,599
so we'd write it out with scientific notation:
3.0 * 10^2. Because science!

150
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,340
Now I know it feels counterintuitive not to show all of the numbers that you have at your fingertips,

151
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,500
but you've got to realize: all of those numbers beyond the number of sig figs you have? They're lies.

152
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,499
They're big lying numbers. You don't know
those numbers.

153
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:26,339
And if you write them down people will assume
that you do know those numbers.

154
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,019
And you will have lied to them. And do you know what we do with liars in chemistry? We kill them!

155
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,360
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

156
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:36,449
Today you learned some keys to understanding
the mathematics of chemistry,

157
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:40,208
and you want to remember this episode in case
you get caught up later down the road:

158
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:44,928
How to convert between units is a skill that
you'll use even when you're not doing chemistry.

159
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:49,100
Scientific notation will always make you look
like you know what you're talking about.

160
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,528
Being able to chastise people for using the
wrong number of significant digits is basically

161
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,808
math's equivalent of being a grammar Nazi.

162
00:10:54,808 --> 00:10:58,769
So enjoy these new powers I have bestowed
upon you, and we'll see you next time.

163
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:01,928
