1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
This may come as a bit of a shock to you,
but I'm not super into personal grooming.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,040
Like I understand soap and shampoo.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,940
But there's all this other stuff now, and
I keep seeing references to pH balance everywhere.

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:18,868
pH balanced soaps, and shampoos, and deodorant,
and makeup abound in supermarkets and drugstores.

5
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:21,539
And I've even seen pH balanced water?!

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,279
We've talked a lot about balance over the
last couple of weeks,

7
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:29,109
and pH balance is related to the equilibrium
state of a reversible reaction.

8
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,460
You're probably also familiar with the pH scale, and you know that it has to do with acids and bases.

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,719
But what is pH exactly?

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,149
And why is it weirdly written with a lowercase
'p' and a capital 'H'?

11
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,640
And also, what about pH's alter ego pOH?

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,600
The capitalization thing is probably the easiest
to answer, 'cause there is no answer.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,890
No one really knows what the 'p' means.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,660
The Danish chemist who came up with the term,

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,850
a guy with the absolutely amazing name, Søren
Sørensen, never explained his reasoning.

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,660
Some people think that it comes from some
form of the word power,

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,719
whether it's puissance in French, or maybe
Latin, pondus.

18
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,548
But it probably just came from a common habit
chemist have of differentiating a test solution,

19
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,649
labeled 'p', from a reference solution, called
'q'.

20
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:15,269
But thinking of the 'p' as standing for power,
does help us remember the meaning more easily.

21
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,129
The 'H' part is even easier, it stands for
hydrogen.

22
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:23,780
Because hydrogen ions, or protons, are pivotal to the behavior of acids and bases, which is what pH describes.

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,939
So you can think of pH as basically the power
of hydrogen in a solution.

24
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:31,148
The strength of the acid or base character
of a substance.

25
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:36,689
And it all revolves around one very important
point of focus, our old friend water.

26
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:46,000
[Theme Music]

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,179
If you've been watching Crash Course Chemistry
from the beginning you've gotten the message

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,740
that water is special in more ways than I
can list, and pH is just one more of those ways.

29
00:01:54,739 --> 00:02:00,060
We normally think of water as a perfectly neutral substance, neither acidic nor basic, and that's true.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,400
But, as I've mentioned before, water can also
function as an acid --

31
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,549
releasing hydrogen ions, also known as protons,
and as a base -- consuming them.

32
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,260
How on Earth is that possible?

33
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:15,949
In order to explain, we first have to understand
what the pH of a substance really tells us.

34
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:21,979
While chemically we say that pH represents the power of hydrogen in a solution, it's mathematically defined as:

35
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,939
"the negative of the base 10 logarithm of
the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution."

36
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,539
OK, so now that you're terrified, I'm here
to help.

37
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:34,419
So, yeah, logarithms can seem a little bit scary at first, but the ones that we're using here are super easy.

38
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:39,119
And bonus, once you get familiar with them here, it'll be that much easier to understand them in math class.

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,259
So now that we got the scary mathematical definition, let's do the simplest mathematical definition.

40
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:48,780
At any given moment, there will be a certain number of hydrogen ions in solution -- a very small number --

41
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,750
the concentration will be a number like one
times 10 to the negative fifty moles per liter.

42
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,509
That negative 5, is your base 10 logarithm.

43
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,969
Take the negative of that, and you get the
pH. 5.

44
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,699
Now let's get a bit more in to the weeds.

45
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:07,159
The logarithm, or log, of a number is the exponent to which another number, called the base,

46
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,020
must be raised to produce the target number.

47
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,969
So for base 10 logs, the base is 10.

48
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:16,259
They're what we use most in chemistry, and
they're really easy to understand,

49
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,479
and also what we base scientific notation
on.

50
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,069
So as an example, the base 10 logarithm of
one hundred is 2.

51
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,459
Because 10 raised to the power of 2, or 10
squared, equals one hundred.

52
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,710
Base 10 logs are so common that we often leave
the subscript 10 off when we write it.

53
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,349
Like if your calculator has a 'log' button,
that's just for base 10 logs.

54
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,849
So what in the name of Søren Sørensen does
this have to do with face melting acids?

55
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:44,489
Well I'm getting to that, and it all starts with waters crazy potential to act as both an acid and a base.

56
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,060
Random changes in the tiny electrical fields
around the atoms in water

57
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,329
occasionally cause the molecules to break
apart.

58
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,900
Specifically a hydrogen ion, or proton, will break off from one molecule and attach itself to another one,

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,780
forming a hydronium ion, H3O+, and a hydroxide
ion, OH-.

60
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,969
This is why water can act as both an acid
and a base.

61
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:08,979
It's molecules can both release and accept
protons.

62
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:11,509
In this case, it's only interacting with itself.

63
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:15,229
But water can interact in the same way with
other acids and bases.

64
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:19,608
Some times you'll see the hydronium ion written
as a simple hydrogen ion, H+,

65
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:22,719
allowing the reaction to be written with only
one water molecule.

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,200
It's not technically accurate, but it's close enough to reality that it can be used to simplify things.

67
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,500
So when we say that the pH is the negative
log of the hydrogen ion concentration...

68
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:35,480
yeah, we actually mean hydronium ion concentration.

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,389
Just another thing that early scientists got
a little wrong and now we have to live with.

70
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:43,069
Anyway, this dissociation of water is a reversible
reaction.

71
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:48,089
And in fact, the ions always reform in to
water within a tiny fraction of a second.

72
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,459
But it's happening all the time constantly.

73
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,049
In your bottled water, in the water inside
your cells, and in the ocean. Always.

74
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,280
However, at any given instant only a tiny
number of molecules are dissociated ions.

75
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,679
In fact, the exact number of these molecules
is well known to chemists.

76
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,910
It's the equilibrium constant for this reaction.

77
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,480
And because it's such a special reaction, it has it's own name -- the water dissociation constant, or Kw.

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,300
Kw is equal to one point zero times 10 to
the negative fourteenth.

79
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,589
The formula for Kw is set up like any equilibrium
constant,

80
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,429
concentrations of products over concentrations
of reactants,

81
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,610
all raised to the exponents based on the coefficients
of the balance reaction.

82
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,530
There is however one difference.

83
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:36,879
Because the ions represent such a tiny proportion of the total mass, the water itself is essentially pure.

84
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,019
And pure substances, because they don't have concentrations, aren't included in equilibrium calculations.

85
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:47,879
So the formula for Kw becomes simply the hydronium
ion concentration times the hydroxide concentration.

86
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,699
According to the balanced equation for the
dissociation of water,

87
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,060
hydronium and hydroxide are formed at a 1:1 ratio,

88
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:57,199
so their equilibrium concentrations must be
equal.

89
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,379
That means if we call the concentration of
H3O+, for example 'x',

90
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:04,000
then the concentration of OH- must equal 'x'
as well.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,720
So the formula for the dissociation constant 1.0 x 10^-14 simplifies even further to x times x, or x squared.

92
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,860
Suddenly, it's crazy easy.

93
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,280
The equilibrium concentration of each ion
is just the square root of 1.0 x 10^-14.

94
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,019
Touch one key on the 'ol calculator, and hello
both concentrations equal

95
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:27,060
1.0 x 10^-7 moles per liter in equilibrium.

96
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,879
The pH then, is simply the negative log of
that, which is 7.

97
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,050
This my friends, is the basis of the pH scale.

98
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,030
Water is neutral, so 7 is the center of the
scale.

99
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,409
And I can prove it too.

100
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,290
This is a strip of paper that's been infused
with a chemical called litmus.

101
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,530
Litmus is a pH indicator, a chemical that
turns different colors at different pHs.

102
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:51,459
There are many different indicators, with many different colors, but we'll talk more about those next week.

103
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:57,519
For now, just know that litmus paper turns pink in acids, blue in bases, and a sorta light purple when it's neutral.

104
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,060
But one thing you need to remember about the
pH scale,

105
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,769
because pH is calculated from a negative logarithm,
it turns everything backward.

106
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:08,539
When the hydrogen ion concentration goes up,
the pH gets lower.

107
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,660
For instance, if a little acid, such as vinegar,
were added to the water,

108
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,630
the concentration of hydronium ion might rise
to say, 1.0 x 10^-4 moles per liter.

109
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:20,418
Which is a thousand times more than before.

110
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:23,120
That concentration would push the pH down
to 4.

111
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,228
On the other hand, a base, such as ammonia,

112
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:28,500
would consume a lot of hydrogen ions if it
were added to the water.

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,889
If the hydrogen ion concentration drops to
1.0 x 10^-11,

114
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,879
a thousandth of the equilibrium concentration,
the pH would be eleven.

115
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,189
As you can see, the logs turn out to be a
mathematical shorthand,

116
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:43,939
that saves us from dealing with very huge
or very tiny numbers.

117
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,250
The pH scale then is normally written from
0 to 14.

118
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,220
With numbers below 7 representing acids, and
numbers above 7 representing bases.

119
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,300
It could also below zero or above 14, but
that only happens in super extreme cases,

120
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,460
that you are very unlikely to encounter.

121
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:00,419
At least I hope.

122
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,879
As with like hydrochloric or nitric acid,
which ionize strongly, sometimes even completely.

123
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,660
Thus releasing a lot of protons, are called
strong acids.

124
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,240
Because they raise the hydrogen concentration
a lot, they also generally have very low pHs.

125
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,710
Weak acids, like citric acid, dissociation
incompletely,

126
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:21,729
releasing much smaller amounts of hydrogen ions, and therefore they usually have higher pHs.

127
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,530
Generally considered in like the 4 to 6 range.

128
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,978
Strong bases meanwhile, like sodium hydroxide,

129
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,399
consume large amounts of hydrogen ions leaving the concentration very low, so they 10d to have very high pHs.

130
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,679
Weak bases, like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), consume much less, and generally have pHs in the 8-11 range.

131
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:45,439
Neutral pH is technically just 7.0, but in a more practical sense, it's usually considered to be between 6 and 8.

132
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,760
So if pH is based on the concentration of
hydrogen, that is hydronium ions,

133
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,149
what about the concentration of hydroxide
ions?

134
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:58,419
Just as we can calculate the pH of a substance from it's hydrogen ion concentration, we can calculate the pOH.

135
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,909
The negative log of the hydroxide concentration.

136
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,990
This is easy because Kw never changes.

137
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:10,240
Although the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide are only equal in pure water, or perfectly neutral solutions,

138
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:18,100
the product of the 2 concentrations always
equals 1.0 x 10^-14 in any aqueous solution.

139
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,519
So like orange juice, which is really just an aqueous solution of sugar and citric acid and a few other things,

140
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,519
say the hydrogen concentration in your OJ
is 3.2 x 10^-4 moles per liter.

141
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,340
Just for the fun of it, let's go ahead and calculate what the pH is at that point, which turns out to be 3.5.

142
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,940
But we can also use the Kw and the hydronium
ion concentration

143
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,080
to do a very simple division problem and find
the hydroxide concentration.

144
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,660
It works out to 3.1 x 10^-11 moles per liter.

145
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:45,909
Once we have the concentration we can take
another step,

146
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:51,350
we can find the pOH of the solution which is similar to the pH, simply the negative log of the OH concentration.

147
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,050
The pOH in this case is 10.5.

148
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:57,709
And now for a tip that's just more awesome
and cooler than an ice cream corn dog,

149
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,450
the sum of the pH and the pOH is always 14.

150
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:09,240
In the example we just did, the pH was 5.4 and the pOH was 8.6, and yeah you add those together: 14! Surprise!

151
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,459
OK, maybe that's only cool to me.

152
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,028
But that's never stopped me before, I love
this stuff!

153
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:18,500
And next week, I hope to really bend your mind by showing you how to make the pH of a solution hold steady,

154
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,220
even if you dump a strong acid or base in
it.

155
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,230
In the meantime, thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

156
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,639
If you paid attention, you learned

157
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,159
how pure water ionizes to form hydronium and
hydroxide ions in reversible reactions.

158
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,208
And you learned about the equilibrium constant
for that reaction,

159
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,359
which has a special name: the water dissociation
constant.

160
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,769
You learned some examples of acids and bases
and neutral substances,

161
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,329
as well as why some acids and bases are called
strong and others are called weak.

162
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,810
You learned about logarithms and how you can
use them to calculate the pH of a substance.

163
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:55,009
And a little bit about pOH, which can be calculated
with logarithms, also with subtraction.

164
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:58,740
And finally, you learned about some cool mathematical
connections between pH and pOH.

165
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,570
This episode was written by Edi González
and edited by Blake de Pastino.

166
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,750
The chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko Langner.

167
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,720
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas Jenkins. The script supervisor was Katherine Green.
