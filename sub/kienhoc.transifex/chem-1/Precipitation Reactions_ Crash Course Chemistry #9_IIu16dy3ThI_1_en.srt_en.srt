1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,099
You're at dinner with your best friend: fine conversation, fine wine, some barbecued beef cheeks.

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:08,730
You look outside to admire the full moon,
but when you glance back you realize that

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,389
your friend has turned into a werewolf.

4
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:13,769
Fortunately, the cutlery is made of silver,
and you know how to use it!

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,179
Or perhaps, you're in the bath one day, and as you reach for the soap you notice a wart on your big toe.

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:24,399
Well squeeze a little silver nitrate on that big boy and you'll be ready for sandals season in no time.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,539
Shiny, electrically conductive, and oh-so-useful,
silver has been valued since ancient times

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,439
and has a reputation for purity and warding off evil, whether in the form of werewolves or warts.

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,879
Silver was also a big driver of settlement in the western United States, including Montana, where I live.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,859
And, of course, all that silver got here because
of chemistry.

11
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,030
Specifically, it's here because of countless
chemical reactions that took place over the

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,939
eons called precipitation reactions:

13
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:53,460
when chemicals in a solution react to form
a solid.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,200
Precipitation reactions are what create geological deposits in the earth as well as rings around your bathtub.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,739
They're what we use to make our waste water
drinkable

16
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,368
and they've been used by folks for thousands
of years to get rich.

17
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:11,859
Because precipitation reactions happen to be one of the best ways to produce chemicals of the highest purity.

18
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:17,620
So they're not only the key to how silver was deposited in these mountains hundreds of millions of years ago.

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,040
They're also the key to getting that silver back out.
I can do it, right here on this desk.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,640
And all I need to get started is this.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:35,200
[Theme Music]

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,320
Precipitation. It's stuff falling out of other stuff: water falling out of the sky, solids falling out of solution.

23
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,778
And for us here it all comes down to a little
thing called solubility.

24
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,599
Water, as we've discussed here before, is pretty dang good at dissolving stuff, ionic compounds in particular.

25
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,578
A positively charged ion and a negatively
charged ion held together by their charges

26
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:59,199
might form a crystal when they're dry,
but add a bit of water

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,760
and those little polar molecules slide their way between the ions dissolving massive amounts of ionic compounds.

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,319
But some ionic compounds can overcome even
the dissolving power of water

29
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,890
and when they form through reactions in solution,
they fall out as a solid precipitate.

30
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,409
Yes, precipitate is both a noun and verb.
Get used to it.

31
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:22,639
When we talk about an ionic compound that's
fallen out of solution I say precipitate [pre-sip-uh-tit]

32
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,990
to distinguish it from from precipitate [pre-sip-eh-tate]
which is more the verb-y sound.

33
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,710
And this is purely my preference because that's
how my teacher said it when I was being taught.

34
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,530
So the rich silver veins in Montana formed

35
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,569
when water stuffed with ionic compounds ran
through cracks in paleozoic limestone.

36
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,780
Where conditions were right, silver ions in
the water reacted with ionic compounds,

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,030
or salts, in the limestone to make insoluble
silver compounds that fell out of solution.

38
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,360
And it looks, a little bit, like this. It
actually looks exactly like this.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,700
It's pretty cool because, uh, you can't feel this but, it is extremely heavy, because silver is a pretty heavy element.

40
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,659
And it wasn't just the silver salts in solution, all kinds of stuff: gold and potassium and copper salts,

41
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:07,299
and, most notably, sodium salts are dissolved
as water rushes across the landscape.

42
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,580
If these dissolved compounds stay in solution until they get to the ocean, they pretty much stay there forever.

43
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,460
The water evaporates, leaving the salts behind in the ocean where over the eons it has built up,

44
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,800
leaving the ocean super salty.
As we know it today.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,740
And while sodium chloride, what we call salt when not doing chemistry, is the most common salt,

46
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,000
there are also tons of other things dissolved
in the ocean, including quite a lot of gold.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,020
In fact, at today's market value the ocean contains about one hundred million trillion dollars of gold.

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,439
And that was not a stutter, a hundred million
trillion.

49
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,649
That's a hundred trillion with six more zeros
after it.

50
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,930
So you can see why it might be nice to master
some precipitation reactions.

51
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,469
There have been chemists that have driven
themselves crazy trying to figure out

52
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:54,990
how to economically extract gold from seawater,
but thus far none have done it.

53
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,340
This solution here of silver nitrate is similar
to that ion rich water

54
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,939
that steeped through the Montana limestone
millions of years ago.

55
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,318
And we can use it right here at this desk
to recreate

56
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,458
the ancient reactions that deposited silver
in veins across our landscape.

57
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,800
But instead of the types of salts found in
limestone,

58
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,280
we can use a very similar and substantially more familiar ion compound: table salt, good old NaCl.

59
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:20,748
Add some drops of sodium chloride, also known
as your salt water,

60
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:29,240
to the silver nitrate solution and there you
see your precipitate. Ooooo...gross.

61
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,800
Now the question that we immediately want
to ask is, "What is this white stuff down here?"

62
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,999
The key to understanding what just happened
here is that both of the compounds are ionic.

63
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,259
You remember there are two kinds of ions,
right?

64
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,340
Cations are positively charged and anions
are negatively charged.

65
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,579
Just like little bar magnets, they attract.

66
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,139
So cations only react with anions to form
new compounds.

67
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,460
And don't just think that there's one anion
and one cation.

68
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,370
The sodium ion in sodium chloride will have
chloride ions on all four sides,

69
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,728
which in turn are surrounded by four sodiums,
and this pattern repeats many, many, many times

70
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:04,300
until we end up with the salt crystals that
we dissolved in the water.

71
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,569
But how do we know which ions are cations
and which are anions?

72
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:10,408
Well sodium is positively charged so it's
a cation

73
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:15,480
and we know that it's positively charged because sodium is a metal from the left side of the periodic table

74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,500
and those are always cations when they're
alone.

75
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,839
Silver is also a metal and is also a cation.

76
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,819
We know that chlorine is a gas from the right
side of the periodic table, so that is an anion.

77
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,278
Now what about the nitrate? Also anion.

78
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:32,129
Nitrates, sulfates and phosphates are really
common and they're always anions.

79
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:37,300
Whenever you see an N, S, or P followed by a bunch of oxygens, you know you're looking at an anion.

80
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,780
With that in mind, look at the possible products
of this reaction.

81
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:45,649
What we're looking for is a product that doesn't dissolve in water, so we know it's not sodium chloride.

82
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:49,649
That was one of our reactants and it dissolves
readily in water, hence the oceans.

83
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,558
And it isn't silver nitrate, our other reactant,
or sodium nitrate,

84
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:58,689
because as a rule, nitrates dissolve really
easily in water, so we know that's dissolved.

85
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:02,419
So we're left with silver chloride.
Just process of elimination.

86
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:07,098
This makes sense because silver also makes
insoluble compounds with bromine and iodine,

87
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:09,968
which are in the same column of the periodic
table as chlorine.

88
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:12,668
Elements in the same column often behave in
similar ways.

89
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:16,399
And you'll notice of course that we don't end up with, like, a huge, nice chunk of pure silver here;

90
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,239
now it's bonded to chlorine.

91
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:21,588
Kinda like table salt, silver chloride is
a crystalline solid.

92
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:24,199
Unlike salt though it's not very soluble in
water.

93
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,699
Now getting the silver out of this compound will involve another kind of reaction, a redox reaction,

94
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,620
which we'll talk more about next week.

95
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,180
In the meantime, we still have to learn the
language of describing this sort of reaction.

96
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,759
Because of the neat and somewhat unique interactions
that are involved in precipitation reactions

97
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,158
-- dissolved substances producing solids,
ions dissociating and rebonding --

98
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:48,930
there are special ways to write and balance
them as equations.

99
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,319
One way is to include notations in parenthesis that tell you what state the chemicals are in:

100
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,759
Aq meaning aqueous, or in solution,

101
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,659
and s for solid, meaning that it's your precipitate,
this is called the molecular equation.

102
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,559
Another way which tends to give a clearer
picture of what actually happens during the

103
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,789
reaction is to write everything out as ions.

104
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:12,318
Here you list the compounds that dissolve
completely in solution as ions;

105
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,009
makes sense because as soon as the salts are
dissolved every ion is on it's own,

106
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:18,218
and it doesn't really matter where it originally
came from.

107
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:22,649
So the left side shows silver, and nitrate,
and sodium, and chloride ions all in one solution.

108
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,929
And the right side shows sodium and nitrate
still as separate ions in solution

109
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,528
with the silver chloride precipitated out
as solid.

110
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:32,259
Now if we don't care about the complete equation,

111
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,300
and only want to see the active participants,
we can write it in yet a third way.

112
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,918
We just leave out the so-called spectator ions: nitrate and sodium, which don't participate directly in the reaction,

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,838
and end up with a net ionic equation showing just silver and chloride ions reacting to form silver chloride.

114
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:50,069
This is nice, and short, and to the point,
which is what chemists love

115
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,979
because remember some of them have terrible writing skills and have to dictate their stuff to their mom.

116
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,460
Now as an aside remember when I first brought up the weirdness of using Ag to denote the word silver?

117
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,859
Well all that stems from the fact that the
Latin world for silver is argentum,

118
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:06,159
and the ancients were, as most people are
today,

119
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:10,438
obsessed with what silver represented, not
just wealth, but also health.

120
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:13,660
Ancient Indo-Europeans associated silver with
purity and goodness.

121
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,399
Hippocrates, the ancient Greek doctor, wrote
about silver's anti-disease properties.

122
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,939
And there's good science behind silver's medical
uses.

123
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:23,369
A lot of the metals are toxic to things like
fungi and microbes.

124
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,869
But unlike say, lead, silver isn't that toxic
to humans.

125
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:30,480
Silver nitrate and a compound called silver
sulfadiazine,

126
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,649
were used to disinfect wounds in World War
I, before antibiotics were discovered.

127
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,079
Silver sulfadiazine is still used to dress
burns.

128
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,519
And researchers are now looking at the antimicrobial
uses for silver nanoparticles.

129
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,679
Some people even take colloidal silver, basically
silver particles in a liquid suspension,

130
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,179
as a kind of general health booster, but there's
not actually any evidence that it boosts health.

131
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:53,309
It can turn you blue though. Now you want
that silver even more, don't you.

132
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,399
Now, as we always do, in order to make a reaction
practical,

133
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,819
you have to go through the final step of converting
the formula equation into a molar mass equation.

134
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,970
If we wanted to get the silver out of solution,
how much salt would we need?

135
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,580
Specifically, let's say that we want to get
one troy ounce of silver.

136
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,920
The troy ounce is part of the troy weight
system which is used to weigh precious metals.

137
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:19,500
It's derived from the way the Romans measured bronze and silver bars they used for currency 2,000 years ago.

138
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,539
And we are still stuck with it.

139
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:26,679
But let's be at least a little bit modern
about this, a troy ounce equals 31.1 grams.

140
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:32,469
So we want 31.1 grams of silver, the molar
mass of silver is 107.868 grams per mole.

141
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,269
Do the calculation and we find that 31.1 grams
equals 0.288 moles of silver.

142
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:41,419
From the molecular equation we can see that
in order for it to balance

143
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:45,199
we'll need one mole of sodium chloride for
every mole of silver.

144
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,990
So to get 0.288 moles of silver, how much
sodium chloride do we need?

145
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,399
We've made it easy for you; it's 0.288 moles.

146
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:59,049
So then we convert 0.288 moles of sodium chloride
into units of mass and grams.

147
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,959
Sodium chloride's molar mass is 58.45 grams
per mole.

148
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,320
Multiply 58.45 grams per mole by 0.288 and
we find:

149
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,400
we need 16.8 grams of sodium chloride to precipitate out 1 troy ounce of silver out of silver nitrate solution.

150
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,139
And look at that you get a nice pile of silver chloride in solution. Yes, it's not pure silver not yet.

00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,679
Just like real miners who dig ores out of the ground that contain just a few percent silver,

152
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,199
we need to do some refining.

153
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,500
In our case, there's another type of reaction
necessary called a redox reaction.

154
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,860
Redox is short for reduction-oxidation and
that is what we'll be talking about next time.

155
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,320
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

156
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,070
This week we discussed what defines precipitation
reactions

157
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,920
and how you can determine what precipitants
they form.

158
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,469
We also learned how to write precipitate reaction
equations

159
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,240
and finally we calculated a molar mass equation
to figure out how much of a reactant we need

160
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,549
to produce a desired amount of precipitant.

161
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:56,179
This episode of Crash Course was written by Kim Krieger and the script was edited by Blake de Pastino and myself.
