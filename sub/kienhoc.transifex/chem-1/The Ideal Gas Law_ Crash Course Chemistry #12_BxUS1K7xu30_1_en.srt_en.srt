1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,720
Gas! It's all around you.
It's in space. It's on Mars.

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,160
It's dissolved in your blood, and in your
soda.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,039
It's everywhere.

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,500
And it's easy to forget that we're submerged in an ocean of gas, but it's there all the time.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,899
You can feel it if you wave your arms around.

6
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:21,118
Can't look cool while you're feeling it but
you can feel it. It's there.

7
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,379
Those little molecules and atoms bumping around
against your hands as you wave them around.

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,998
Feel it? Are you doing this?

9
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:28,858
I've got good news and bad news about gases.

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,178
First the good news, when they're behaving
themselves

11
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:36,598
it is extremely easy to describe their behavior
theoretically, experimentally and mathematically.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,960
The bad news is, they almost never behave
themselves.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:50,820
[Theme Music]

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,439
The first mathematical description of a behavior
of a gas was a link between pressure and volume.

15
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:59,518
In a closed system like the inside of this
balloon,

16
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,850
when we decrease the volume of the balloon
the pressure inside goes up.

17
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,090
And if we could somehow expand the balloon,
then the pressure inside the balloon would go down.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,950
If I keep pushing on it the pressure inside
might go so high that it'll break.

19
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,340
I hope...I can't do it.
It's a very strong balloon!

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,520
The relationship here is a simple one.

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,989
When you multiply the pressure and volume
together, you get a constant.

22
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,739
As long as the temperature and amount of gas
stays the same, so does that constant.

23
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:30,728
It's called Boyle's Law, and it was a pretty
big deal back in the 1600s.

24
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:35,769
It's also, one of the greatest scientific
mis-attributions of all time.

25
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:40,118
Robert Boyle was a super rich Englishman,
raised in Ireland.

26
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:44,299
His father was so rich that he paid another
family to raise his children.

27
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,679
I guess because he was too busy administering
lands or something.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,620
Boyle had lots of great ideas about science
and chemistry.

29
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,408
His most important one, and this is arguably
even more important than Boyle's Law,

30
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:58,868
being that chemists should publish papers
not on what they feel is correct,

31
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,909
but rather on theories that have been backed
up by experimentation.

32
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:07,580
Richard Towneley a wealthy, but considerably less wealthy, Englishman struck up a relationship with Boyle.

33
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:12,579
Telling him about some of his work that would disprove one of those "But it feels right" kind of chemists.

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,020
Boyle published the paper mentioning that
work, which he called Towneley's Hypothesis.

35
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,360
But which ended up, because of Boyle's superior scientific standing and possibly his wealth, being called Boyle's Law.

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,860
But here's the really messed up thing:

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,780
the experiments that led to the creation of
this theory were actually done largely by

38
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,900
Towneley's family friend and physician, Henry Power, who's not a member of the aristocracy at all.

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,659
He was just a working class scientist.

40
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,219
Power was working on a publication that would
have snared him the position as discover of

41
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,919
the relationship between the pressure and
volume of a gas.

42
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,419
But Boyle, having discussed the ideas with
Towneley privately, published his first,

43
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:54,359
attributing Towneley as the sole researcher, ensuring that Power's contributions were all but lost to history.

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,400
Henry Power's Wikipedia page didn't even mention
Boyle's Law until a few weeks ago,

45
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:04,229
when I personally added a paragraph about
it, with proper citations of course.

46
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,318
But no matter who thought it up or who it
got named after, Boyle's Law is pretty cool.

47
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,000
For a given amount of gas at a constant temperature, pressure times volume always equals the same number.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,319
But where is that constant coming from,

49
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,040
and why is it different for different amounts
of gas at different temperatures?

50
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,128
Well it was more than a hundred years before
we'd figure out the answer to those questions,

51
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:30,239
with the help of a Frenchman Jacques Charles and our old, Italian house-elf friend Amedeo Avogadro.

52
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,438
Charles and Avogadro created equations much
like Boyle's law

53
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,239
with two features of a gas being linked directly
together by constants.

54
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,590
Charles discovered that volume divided by
temperature equals a constant,

55
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,400
as long as the pressure remains the same.

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,810
And then Avogadro figured out that volume
divided by the number of moles in the container

57
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,699
at a constant pressure and temperature gave
yet another constant.

58
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,238
But here's the crazy cool thing:

59
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,120
all of these scientists were basically dealing
with a different form of the same equation.

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,020
An equation that we must never forget, and is gonna be stuck in my head until I die, and here's how it works:

61
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,540
Pressure times volume is equal to the number of moles of substances times a constant times temperature.

62
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:14,560
P V equals n R T: The Ideal Gas Law, which works for all gases as long as they behave themselves.

63
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,930
Now here's the cool part,

64
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,259
using this equation we can show how all of these chemists were dealing with the same relationship.

65
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,750
They were just clumping various variables
together in different orders.

66
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,629
All of the chemists we just mentioned: Charles, Avogadro and Boyle (or more properly Towneley and Power),

67
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,680
figured out their contribution to the Ideal
Gas Law experimentally.

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
But more interesting to me, is that it can
be understood theoretically.

69
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,319
First, we have to understand what each of
these variables actually mean.

70
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,060
In that same way the atoms and molecules that
make up gases

71
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,209
are bouncing against things, applying pressure
to them.

72
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:48,389
This balloon is inflated because the molecules
are bouncing around inside of it,

73
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:53,329
bumping into the inside of the balloon harder than the molecules bouncing off the outside of the balloon.

74
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:56,539
Scientists generally measure pressure with
the S.I. unit of force:

75
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,350
Newtons per area, meters squared, which is
shortened to pascals.

76
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,970
But since pascals are so tiny we either use
kilopascals

77
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,610
or we use the pressure here on earth at sea
level, that we call one atmosphere or one atm.

78
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,949
Completely by chance, one atmosphere is equal
to 101325 pascals,

79
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:21,180
but that's so close that we often just say that one atmosphere is 100,000 pascals or 100 kilopascals.

80
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,480
Volume is the amount of space particles have
to exist inside of.

81
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,629
So yeah, that makes sense, when the volume
goes down, the pressure goes up,

82
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,519
because there are more particles in a smaller
space, and they'll each hit the walls more often.

83
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,839
N is simply the amount of gas, the number
of moles in the system.

84
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,439
Here I am decreasing the amount of gas in the system and in response the volume is decreasing. Obviously.

85
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,339
But so is the pressure inside the balloon.

86
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:46,539
R in the Ideal Gas Law is called the Universal
Gas Constant.

87
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,780
Even though, as we will see in a coming episode,
it is neither universal or constant.

88
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:54,269
It's 8.3145 liters kilopascal per kelvin mole.

89
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:59,740
Temperature, is experienced by you and me as hot or cold but at the atomic level it's kinetic energy.

90
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,500
Literally, how fast or slow the average particle
is moving.

91
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,519
So if temperature goes up, so will the pressure
as the particles are moving faster

92
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:10,149
and thus will run into the sides of the container
more often.

93
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:15,859
So now we know about all of the little bits of the Ideal Gas Law, so let's take a look at it in action.

94
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,500
We here at Crash Course generally like to be very safe. This is a little bit of overkill here.

95
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:23,860
I put a little bit of water into this soda
can and now I'm boiling it.

96
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,280
So instead of atmosphere gas in this can right
now there's water vapor,

97
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,909
and it's hot and all the molecules are zipping
around like crazy.

98
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:36,470
We pick it up and we plop it down inside of
that -- ooh! -- and it crushes itself.

99
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,100
So what just happened there?

100
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,180
Well, let's see what the gas law can tell
us.

101
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,240
So which of these things are changing?

102
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,160
Starting on the right hand side: R, is constant,
so that can't change.

103
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,600
The temperature of the gas though, that definitely
changed;

104
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,389
it drops like mad when it's exposed to the
ice water.

105
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:56,979
N is decreasing too as water vapor is condensing into liquid water, it thus disappears from the gas phase.

106
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,610
So the next result on the right hand side
is a decrease,

107
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,879
and that means that the left hand side has
to have a decrease too.

108
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,459
So on to the left hand side.

109
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:09,279
The pressure does indeed drop because the lower temperature makes the molecules move more slowly,

110
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,179
thus bumping into the sides of the can a lot
less than before.

111
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,939
And volume drops too, but not quite for the
reason you might think.

112
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:20,019
It's really that the pressure inside the can
goes so low, that the pressure outside the can,

113
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,819
the atmospheric pressure, literally crushes
the can.

114
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,029
Now I understand that you probably don't think
this is as cool as I do,

115
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,789
but understanding the physical reality of
atoms and molecules smacking into things is

116
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,930
a special kind of beautiful for me.

117
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,170
It's also pretty cool that if you know any 3 things about a gas, you can figure out the fourth using the ideal gas law.

118
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,629
Of course, not all gases behave ideally,

119
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,800
and all gases deviate from the law at low
temperatures or high pressures.

120
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,280
But we'll save that discussion for a later
episode.

121
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,819
Jargon fun time.

122
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,409
STP means standard temperature and pressure,

123
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,980
which according to the lords of chemistry is 0 degrees Celsius and 100,000 pascals or 100 kilopascals.

124
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:04,060
One mole of any ideal gas takes up 22.4 liters of space at STP, which is a fact that can simplify a lot of calculations.

125
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,000
Absolute zero is the temperature at which
all movement of all particles stops.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,500
It is zero kelvins or -273.15 degrees Celsius.

127
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,939
And that's all for this episode. Thank you
for watching Crash Course Chemistry.

128
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:17,639
If you were paying attention you learned about

129
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,879
how the work of some amazing thinkers combined
to produce the Ideal Gas Law;

130
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,069
how none of those people were Robert Boyle,

131
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:29,000
and how the Ideal Gas Equation allows you to find out pressure, volume, temperature or number of moles,

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,160
as long as you know three of those four things.

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,340
And you learned a few jargon-y phrases to help you sound like you know what you're talking about.

134
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,640
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by me.

Langner and Edi Gonzalez.

137
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,649
It was filmed, edited and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

138
