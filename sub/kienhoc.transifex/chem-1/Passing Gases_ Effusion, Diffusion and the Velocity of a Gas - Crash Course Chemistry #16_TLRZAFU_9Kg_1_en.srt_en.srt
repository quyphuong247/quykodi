00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,379
Welcome to another edition of Crash Course! Today -- what is that smell? Oh, thanks for the rotten eggs.

2
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:09,410
Who is this -- who -- why are we doing this?

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,219
I mean, are going to be using this to illustrate
some kind of scientific principle?

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,278
Because we probably could have, like, used some,
like, some lilacs or something that wasn't egg.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,320
So, like, we're saying, "I can smell it when I'm this close, but if I were farther away, I couldn't smell it."

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,699
Now, eggs produce hydrogen sulfide when they start to go bad, which smells like sulfur --

7
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,099
that's what we think of when we think of the
"sulfur smell."

8
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:35,359
It takes time for the molecules of hydrogen
sulfide to make their way to my nose,

9
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,600
'cause obviously gases don't travel from one
place to another instantly.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,480
It take some time since, as we've learned
over the past couple of weeks,

11
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,809
gases have real-life constraints on how they
move here in the non-ideal world.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,120
These are the rules that determine, say, how
fast a leaking tire goes flat;

13
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:55,280
or why helium balloons don't last forever;
and, of course, how, where, and when we smell stuff.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,219
One key to understanding the behavior of a gas is its velocity, that is, the speed and direction that it moves.

15
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,299
And THAT depends on a few important physical
factors.

16
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:06,009
You ready to learn more? Let's do it.

17
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,980
That smell IS coming from the eggs, isn't
it?

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:17,180
[Theme Music]

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,020
So. "Velocity of a gas": what does that even mean? I mean, it's easy to understand the velocity of a car.

20
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:27,158
You can find the velocity by dividing the distance that the thing traveled by the time it took to do it,

21
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,920
and then tell what direction it's going, and
then you're done.

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,719
But the velocity of gases is harder t describe, because they move in more than one direction at a time,

23
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,959
and the overall shape and volume of a gas
cloud can change constantly.

24
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,829
To understand gas velocity, we have to know
what factors affect it, and how.

25
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,890
As you might have guessed, there's math associated
with this.

26
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,599
There are two ways of studying and talking
about gases.

27
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,559
First, we can consider them as a collection of atoms or molecules that act together as a system.

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,090
When we do that, we often talk about the net
velocity,

29
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,130
or how fast a sample of gas moves from one
place to another,

30
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:01,399
like the rotten egg smell wafting its way
to my nose.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,260
At other times, we focus on the individual
atoms and molecules that make up the gas.

32
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,158
In that case, we use the average velocity
of each of the particles.

33
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,579
That's the statistical mean of the speeds of all the individual atoms or molecules in the system.

34
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,379
There are always faster ones and slower ones,
but it all evens out in the mean.

35
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,659
The net velocity of a gas in any one direction will always be lower than the average velocity of its molecules

36
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:29,469
because the overall motion of the gas is hindered
by collisions among the individual particles.

37
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:35,269
As with most things in chemistry, and also with life, how a gas moves is more complex than it at first appears.

38
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:40,278
The individual particles in a gas never move at exactly the same speed or direction for very long,

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,539
instead, they bounce around like crazy, bumping into the walls of the container and each other over and over.

40
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,278
It's sort of like a group of kids in a hallway,

41
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:51,188
they may be moving fast individually, but
they bounce around a lot and get sidetracked.

42
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:53,180
They always make it to the lunchroom eventually,

43
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,879
but the group's overall speed is lower than
the speed of any individual kid.

44
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,939
So. What makes a gas move faster or slower?

45
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:04,730
Well we already know that gas atoms and molecules
move faster when the temperature increases.

46
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:08,329
We can understand why that happens by remembering
what temperature actually is:

47
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,919
Temperature is a property of matter that is
proportional to the average

48
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,680
or mean kinetic energy of all the atoms or
molecules in the system.

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,340
We sometimes think of temperature merely in terms of measuring hotness -- not that kind of hotness!

50
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,229
The hotness or coldness of a material, and
it is related to that,

51
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:28,840
but when you get right down to it temperature is really just a way of expressing average kinetic energy.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,740
The reason a stove burns you, is that the
fast moving particles of the burner

53
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:37,748
make the particles in your hand move so fast
that they tear apart your cells and tissues.

54
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:39,840
It's just a transfer of kinetic energy.

55
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:43,840
And what does kinetic energy have to do with
velocity? Everything.

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,239
And, it also describes the relationship between
a particle's velocity and its mass.

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,520
So, a good understanding of kinetic energy
will help a lot as we study the motion of gases.

58
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:57,408
So first, the formula for kinetic energy is
one half m v squared.

59
00:03:57,408 --> 00:04:02,048
And as you can see, any changes in the kinetic
energy are directly linked to changes in velocity.

60
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:05,278
If we rearrange the formula, we find that
the velocity of a body equals

61
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:09,789
the square root of two times the kinetic energy,
divided by its mass.

62
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,400
This little math exercise highlights two important
points.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,959
One: because the mass is in the denominator, we can tell that it is inversely proportional to the velocity,

64
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,680
meaning that bigger masses move more slowly than smaller masses that have the same kinetic energy.

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,780
And two: the velocity is proportional to the
square root of the mass,

66
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:31,139
meaning that a fairly large change in mass is required to make a significant change in the velocity.

67
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,789
So, now we can show how the velocity of a
gas relates to both its temperature,

68
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,560
and therefore its average kinetic energy;
and also to the mass of its particles.

69
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,069
But, how do we put that all together?

70
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,899
This is where the Scottish chemist Thomas
Graham comes in.

71
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,639
In 1846, Graham published his research on
the motion of gas particles.

72
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,050
Which he did by passing gases, if you will,
through a porous barrier.

73
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,920
The process by which gases travel through
an orifice or opening is known as effusion.

74
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,800
Graham was interested in how fast the gases
pass through the barrier.

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,090
But this is called the rate of effusion, not
the velocity.

76
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:07,339
That's because here we're measuring the amount of gas that passes through at any given period of time,

77
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,729
not the distance that it moves in that time.

78
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,860
We might measure amount in terms of moles or in terms of volume, but the rate of effusion never uses distance.

79
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,100
One more thing before we move on, don't let
the symbols confuse you.

80
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:24,640
Notice that lower case v stand for velocity and capital V stands for volume - the perils of symbols.

81
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
Thomas Graham measured the rates of effusion
for various gases

82
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,550
and his results fit perfectly with what we
already know: the more massive a gas is, the

83
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,780
more slowly it moves.

84
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:37,259
From his observations, Graham developed a formula -- now known as Graham's Law of Effusion --

85
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:40,419
for comparing the rates of effusion of different
gases.

86
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,280
It states: Under identical conditions, the ratio of the rate of effusion of gas a to the rate of effusion of gas b

87
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:52,439
is equal to the ratio of the square root of the molar mass of gas b to the square root of the molar mass of gas a.

88
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:55,930
It is a mouthful, but it really just confirms
what we deduced earlier:

89
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,280
the rate of motion of a gas is inversely proportional
to the square root of its mass.

90
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,479
For example, if it takes 4.5 minutes for 1.0 liter of helium to effuse through a porous barrier,

91
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,240
how long will it take for 1.0 liter of chlorine
to effuse under identical conditions?

92
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,460
All we need to figure it out, is Graham's
Law.

93
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,479
Let's make the helium gas a, and chlorine
will be our gas b.

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,160
First, we have to find helium's rate of effusion -- in this case, we're using Volume with a capital V.

95
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,730
So for helium, 1.0 liter in 4.5 minutes gives
the rate of 0.22 liters per minute.

96
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:32,509
So, we plug that into the main formula -- chlorine gas has a molar mass of two times that of atomic chlorine --

97
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:38,370
35.5 times two equals 70.9,
and helium's molar mass is 4.00.

98
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,639
Put those numbers in too.

99
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,599
Careful calculation shows that Cl2's rate of effusion under these conditions would be 0.052 liters per minute,

100
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,680
significantly slower than helium.

101
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,129
This, of course, is reasonable, because Cl2
is much more massive than helium.

102
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:54,930
Graham mainly studied gases passing through
orifices in a barrier,

103
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,829
but gases aren't usually trapped with an orifice
in a barrier.

104
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:03,209
They are usually able to just move freely, so how do we study their motion under those conditions?

105
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,609
When gases are allowed to move freely,

106
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,569
they tend to move from regions of high concentration
to regions of low concentration.

107
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,199
In a sense, they move away from places where
they're crowded

108
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,750
and toward places where they have a little
bit more elbow room.

109
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,839
The difference in concentration between two
points is called a concentration gradient,

110
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,909
and it's kind of like a hill that matter rolls
down, always moving from high to low.

111
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,960
Gases spread out like that until they've dispersed
evenly throughout the available space.

112
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,759
This process is called diffusion.

113
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,819
Now, it's important to keep in mind that the particles in a gas don't work together somehow to move in a specific direction.

114
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,199
Remember those kids making their way down
the hall?

115
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,339
They all know where the lunchroom is, and
they're hungry,

116
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,560
so even though there are a lot of distractions,
they move purposely toward their destination.

117
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,079
Gases, on the other hand, only appear to move
in a specific direction.

118
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,859
It's really just random collisions pushing the molecules apart, thus making them spread out in every direction.

119
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,879
In other words, the gross eggy gas that I smelled earlier didn't travel just toward my nose;

120
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:00,829
its particles spread out in every direction
from the eggs,

121
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:04,449
and my nose simply noticed the ones that happened
to have spread in THAT direction.

122
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,149
Because diffusion is completely free movement,

123
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,829
calculating the motion of individual particles
becomes even more complicated.

124
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:13,418
Now, we're not gonna get into the super complex
mathematics of all these collisions,

125
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:16,859
but it is possible to make decent estimates
regarding the net velocity of gases

126
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,080
simply by disregarding the collisions and applying Graham's Law of Effusion to diffusion as well.

127
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:25,789
Here's how it works: This is a simple acrylic
tube -- nothing fancy.

128
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,460
On one side, we have a cotton ball that's
soaked with concentrated ammonia,

129
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,149
and on the other side, a cotton ball soaked
with concentrated hydrochloric acid,

130
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,490
which is why we're doing this in a lab, and
not at my desk.

131
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,198
Both of these substances are very smelly,
because they're giving off lots of fumes,

132
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:43,848
or in other words, a lot of the molecules
in the liquid are being released in gas form.

133
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:49,469
When we put the cotton balls in the glass tube and close off the ends, those gases continue to spread,

134
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,899
but they have no where to go except farther
into the tube.

135
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,699
Fun fact: ammonia and hydrochloric acid react together readily to form a solid -- ammonium chloride.

136
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,540
That's a precipitation reaction, but this time it's happening in a mixture of gases, not liquids.

137
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:06,000
Because the ammonium chloride is a solid at
room temperature,

138
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:09,519
it forms a superfine white powder where the
two gases meet in the tubes,

139
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,979
so we'll be able to tell exactly how far each
gas traveled before they met.

140
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,860
Let's try to figure out where that's going
to be.

141
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,730
First of all, remember that Graham's Law is
only an estimate when applied to diffusion,

142
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,499
but it's a good enough estimate to work for
our purposes, here.

143
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:29,198
The molar mass of ammonium, which we call "gas a," is 17 and the molar mass of hydrochloric acid, "gas b," is 36.

144
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:33,049
If we plug those into Graham's Law, and set
hydrochloric acid's rate of diffusion at 1.0,

145
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,838
since we are only looking for a ratio, here,

146
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,639
we'll find that ammonia's rate of diffusion will be about 1.5 times as fast as that of hydrochloric acid.

147
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,939
That means that the ammonium chloride should form about 3/5 of the way down the tube from the NH3

148
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:49,728
and about 2/5 of the way from the HCl.

149
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:55,229
And, there it is. See that white cloud? That's
the ammonium chloride powder forming.

150
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,740
It'll eventually settle in the glass,

151
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,360
but it's so fine that even the tiny currents that occur as the two gases mix are enough to toss it around a little.

152
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,519
The ammonia has indeed moved through about
three fifths of the tube.

153
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:08,220
Meanwhile the hydrochloric acid has only traveled
through about two fifths of the tube.

154
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,389
So, we've proven now that Graham's Law, as
an estimate at least, works.

155
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:16,700
The distances that the two gases traveled were indeed proportional to their molar masses. Makes sense.

156
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,300
That's one of the cool things about science: it always ends up making sense, once you know what you're looking for.

157
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:24,878
And that's it for this episode of Crash Course
Chemistry. Thank you for watching.

158
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,850
If you listened carefully, you learned the
difference between the net velocity of a gas

159
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,920
and the average velocity of its particles,

160
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,868
and that both things have a lot to do with
the mass and kinetic energy of the particles.

161
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:38,949
You learned about effusion and what Thomas
Graham's Law of Effusion tells us about it,

162
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:42,568
and how the law of effusion can also be applied
to diffusion, but not as reliably.

163
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:45,990
You also learned that the collisions that
occur among the particles of a gas

164
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,210
have a huge effect on both its motion and
our attempts to calculate it.

165
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,300
You learned what a concentration gradient
is,

166
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:56,028
and finally, you learned how to do a precipitation
reaction with gases.

167
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:58,328
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi González.

168
00:10:58,328 --> 00:11:02,149
Who I have to commend for only making one
fart joke in the whole script!

169
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,789
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino
and myself.

170
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,188
And our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko
Langner.

171
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:11,419
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas Jenkins. Our script supervisor was Caitlin Hofmeister.

172
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:15,079
Our sound designer is Michael Aranda.
