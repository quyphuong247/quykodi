1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,878
Imagine you wake up one morning, and you're
under a tree, and you don't recognize anything.

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,300
You're surrounded by low, grassy hills. It's raining a bit and smells like waffles and potatoes.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,800
As you rub the sleep from your eyes, you notice a woman, and she's like "Qu'est-ce que tu fais dans la pluie?"

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,640
and you're like "What? Where am I? Was that French? Did I fall asleep in my house and wake up in France?"

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,820
Then another guy walks up, and he's got a mustache that, frankly, not a lot of other guys could pull off,

6
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,500
and he's like "Wa zijde gij hier nu feitelijk aant doen in die regen?" And that was clearly not French.

7
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,289
And then a little kid comes up with an umbrella,
and says "Wat doe je hier buiten in de regen?"

8
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,329
Okay... Do you know where you are?
Give up? Belgium.

9
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,408
And you know what's an awful lot like unexpectedly
waking up in Belgium with a bunch of people

10
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:49,388
speaking several different languages you don't
understand? Chemistry.

11
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:59,009
[Theme Music]

12
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:03,149
Maybe more than any other scientific discipline,
chemistry has its own language.

13
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,868
Not jargon, though it has that too,

14
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:09,959
but a whole system of speaking and writing
that's unique to the study of chemicals,

15
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,559
a way of translating symbols and numbers of
chemical formulas into words that can be spoken.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,780
Chemistrian, if you want to call it that (and
I do), can be tough to learn at first,

17
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,140
but it can be done, once you know the rules.

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,469
And of course, as with all languages, fluency
really only comes with lots of use,

19
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:33,439
so I don't expect you to walk out of this
video spouting off about three-keto-two-carboxy-arabinitol,

20
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,379
but I do want to get you off on the right
foot.

21
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:39,420
So, talking about chemistry can sometimes
be like describing a rainy day in Belgium.

22
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,980
I mean, all three of those people in the beginning
of the video, they were saying the same thing.

23
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,000
They just used different sets of rules to
describe it.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,840
The woman using French, the kid, Dutch, and the guy with the 'stache, a Dutch dialect called Flemish.

25
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,269
So the trick is knowing which rules to apply
where,

26
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,129
and fortunately for Chemistrian, there's a
kind of phrasebook, the Periodic Table.

27
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,129
Just as there are parts of Belgium where different
dialects are spoken,

28
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,429
the rules for describing an element can change
depending on where in the table it is.

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,800
This is especially the case with the things that we're going to be talking about today: ions and acids.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,939
These rules apply not only to their formulas, that is, the chemical symbols that we use in equations,

31
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:20,180
but also to their names, how we write and
say them.

32
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,150
Let's start off with ions.

33
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,539
Atoms become ions by gaining or losing electrons,
giving them a positive or negative charge.

34
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:31,280
Ions that have lost electrons, and therefore
take on a positive charge, are cations.

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,039
Whereas ones that gain electrons to become
negative are anions.

36
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,280
You'll notice, despite the rules of English, that
these are pronounced "cat-ions" and "ann-ions",

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,459
not "cayshuns" and "aniuns"

38
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,598
The most basic ions, called monatomic ions,
are formed from single atoms.

39
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,388
To write one as a formula, you just use the
chemical symbol of its base element

40
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:53,200
and then add the charge as a superscript.
That's it.

41
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,799
If the charge is just of a single electron lost or gained, you don't need to write the one,

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,079
but any charge greater than that requires
a number.

43
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,109
So the sodium ion is written like this, while
the ion of chlorine looks like this.

44
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:08,609
But the names of these ions change somewhat
depending on whether they are cations or anions.

45
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,799
Cations, for some reason, the name is just
the element followed by the word "ion".

46
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,040
So, in this case, it's just a "sodium ion".

47
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,828
But with anions, you use a special suffix,
"ide".

48
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:21,748
So, the anion of chlorine is chloride, and
is written so.

49
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:26,508
Now, when we name ionic compounds, we just
say the cation first, and the anion second.

50
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:27,679
You've done this.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,200
You just maybe didn't know you were doing it.
"Sodium chloride", "hydrogen sulfide", easy peasy.

52
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,839
Now in order to figure out what's what, we have to rely on our handy phrasebook, the Periodic Table.

53
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:41,388
The first two columns on the left are your
alkali metals, and your alkaline earth metals.

54
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,409
They all form ions readily when they react
with non-metals,

55
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:48,509
and when they do, they always lose electrons,
forming cations.

56
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,699
On the other side of the table, you'll find most of the common anion-forming elements grouped together,

57
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,259
particularly your halogens, along with oxygen,
sulfur, and nitrogen.

58
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:02,000
These elements gain electrons to form those
negative ions ending with "ide".

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,580
And you've no doubt heard of most of them.

60
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,650
But here's a wrinkle. Many elements can form
more than one kind of ion.

61
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,959
Iron, for example, in the middle there, forms cations, but they can have a charge of either two or three.

62
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,939
This is the case for many of the transition
metals in these middle columns of the table.

63
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,639
They're grouped together precisely they have
these properties in common.

64
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,219
Everything's where it is for a reason people,
that's the beauty of it.

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,480
But it's in this middle region of your language map where really unique dialects start to crop up,

66
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,139
changing how ions are named and written.

67
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,668
The formulas for ions here are, thankfully,
as easy as anywhere else,

68
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:38,829
with the size and polarity of the ion's charge
written as a superscript.

69
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:42,168
But when naming these ions, we introduce a
whole new naming convention,

70
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:46,139
and by new, I mean really, really old.
Roman numerals.

71
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,879
Yeah, Roman numerals still have a practical application beyond telling you which Star Wars movie you're watching.

72
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,728
In this case, when saying or writing the name
of a transition metal ion,

73
00:04:54,728 --> 00:05:00,699
you use Roman numerals to denote the size
of the ion's charge, like Iron II or Iron III,

74
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:05,139
and you write it this way whether the ion's
in a compound or by itself.

75
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,680
Just be sure to put the numerals in parentheses with no space between the cation and the first parenthesis,

76
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,860
because trust me, teachers will mark off for
that.

77
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,139
OK, so I know what you're probably thinking
right now:

78
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,599
Why, in the name of Pliny the Elder, do we have to use Roman numerals like a bunch of Romans?

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,699
Well, check it out:

80
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,039
Arabic numerals are already being used to denote how many atoms of an element there are in a molecule,

81
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,520
the molecule's charge, its oxidation state,
the number of molecules reacting in an equation.

82
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,448
We didn't need more Arabic numerals!

83
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,259
So the chemistrians decided to trundle out
the Romans.

84
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,848
Now, acids are ionic compounds just like any
other,

85
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:42,688
but when they ionize, their hydrogen ions,
just lone protons, become the cation,

86
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,800
and any negatively charged leftover is the
anion.

87
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,780
So all acids are made up of one or more hydrogen
cations bound to an anion.

88
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:54,179
Writing the formula of an acid is easy if
you know what the anion is.

89
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:01,860
Because ClO3 is negative one charge, you can tell that it will bond with just one hydrogen ion to form HClO3. Simple.

90
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,680
Now, when we name these acids and anions,
we have to kind of watch our mouths,

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,019
because in the realm of chemistria, there's
a whole system of prefixes and suffixes that

92
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,448
you have to keep track of to make sure you're
addressing everyone by the proper title.

93
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:14,919
Y'know, you don't want to offend anyone.

94
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:16,519
Once you've acquired an ear for it, though,

95
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,039
you can tell just from the name of an acid
or it's anion what its composition is,

96
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,770
because these prefixes and suffixes practically
give you the formula.

97
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:27,500
Specifically, they tell you how many oxygen
atoms it has.

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,110
That's right, even though an acid is defined
by its ability to give up hydrogen ions,

99
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,670
it is identified by it's oxygen content.

100
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,300
Eh, when in chemistria.

101
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,620
Let's go back to that ClO3 minus. You might
know that as the chlorate ion.

102
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,470
That's chlorate, with an "-ate". Not a number
8. A-T-E.

103
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:51,170
Like we said, chlorate bonds with a hydrogen ion to form HClO3 which is called chloric acid.

104
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,500
That's chloric with an I-C.

105
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,420
As a rule, all anions that end in "-ate" form
acids that end with "-ic".

106
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,620
Phosphate ion has a three charge, so it bonds
with three hydrogen ions to form phosphoric acid.

107
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:08,439
Similarly, the sulfate ion needs just two hydrogen ions to form sulfuric acid. You get the idea.

108
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:13,229
These compounds, the "-ic" acids and their
"-ate" anions, are really common and familiar,

109
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:17,019
so much so that they form kind of a baseline
for the language of acids.

110
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,149
Chlorine, hydrogen, and oxygen can combine
to make chloric acid,

111
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:23,519
but they can form way more other similar acids.

112
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:29,859
And all these variations are named using a
special, super-explicit set of prefixes and suffixes

113
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,720
that tell you whether they have more oxygen atoms or less oxygen atoms than the baseline compounds.

114
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,400
And by how many.
Take HClO2.

115
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,560
Because we know that the cation is H plus,

116
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,079
we can immediately see that the anion is ClO2
minus, which we know as the chlorite ion.

117
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,688
In addition, we can see that HClO2 has one
less oxygen atom than HClO3.

118
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:57,930
The "-ous" suffix means "less than" and thus
gives us our name, chlorous acid for HClO2.

119
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,788
So the chlorite ion forms chlorous (with an
"-ous") acid.

120
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:07,418
And indeed, all atoms that end in "-ite" form
acids that end in "-ous". O-U-S.

121
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:11,139
But what if it has two fewer oxygen atoms
than it's "-ic" counterpart?

122
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:16,319
For both the acid and its anion, you simply
use the suffixes I just mentioned, "-ous" and "-ite",

123
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,599
but then additionally, you add a prefix.

124
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,780
It's from the Greek for "less than" or "under":
"hypo-".

125
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:29,038
So, HClO is hypochlorous acid, and likewise,
it's anion, ClO minus, is hypochlorite.

126
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,538
But there are still a couple of scenarios
that we haven't considered yet.

127
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:35,740
Like, what if an acid has one more oxygen
than the "-ic" version?

128
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,519
In that case, you use a different prefix,
using "per-", Latin for "very" or "thoroughly".

129
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,919
Sounds like it'd be fun to find some uses
for that "per-". Let's do it.

130
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:51,299
There's perplexed, like very plexed. Pervaded,
thoroughly invaded. Perfect, very... fect.

131
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,159
I had to look it up. It's from the Latin for
"to complete".

132
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,769
So "perfect" is to complete something thoroughly.
I like it.

133
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:03,940
So the "per-" prefix is just a way of saying
"thoroughly oxygenated", completely, in fact.

134
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,079
If you see the "per-" prefix, that's the highest
number of oxygens that can get on there.

135
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:14,059
So HClO4 is perchloric acid and it dissociates
into an anion called perchlorate.

136
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:18,309
And what if, brace yourself, the acid doesn't
contain any oxygen at all?

137
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:22,819
Remember, hydrogen is the key player in acids, so even though oxygen is common, it's by no means required.

138
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:29,160
When a hydrogen bonds with chlorine to form an acid, since there's no oxygen it's just called hydrochloric acid,

139
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,819
and it's anion follows the same rules for
anions we talked about at the very beginning,

140
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,110
ending in "-ide", in this case, chloride.

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,329
Now, considering what just happened to you
here,

142
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:42,368
there's a 99% chance that you're now more confused than you would be if you woke up in a drizzly Belgian meadow.

143
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:45,879
So, if that's the case, get a pencil and get
ready to pause the video.

144
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,240
Now, copy this table down. It's all you need
to know.

145
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,980
Be familiar with the "-ate" ions and the "-ic"
acids

146
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,200
and then simply cobble on the appropriate prefixes and suffixes based on the number of oxygen atoms present.

147
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,440
It might not be as fanciful as waking up in
a Belgian meadow, but it is enlightening.

148
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,140
Just look at all the stuff we learned, like how to determine the formulas and names of mono-atomic ions,

149
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,600
how to find cation and anion forming elements
on the Periodic Table,

150
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,289
how to write the formulas and name transition
metals, and how to name acids and their anions.

151
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:20,198
