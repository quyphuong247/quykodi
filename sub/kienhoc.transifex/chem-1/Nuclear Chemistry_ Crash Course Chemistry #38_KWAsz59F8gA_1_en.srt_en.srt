1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Apparently, it can turn you into a superhero
or into a mutant zombie.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,440
It's the plot device for probably half of
the sci-fi movies made in the last 60 years

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:15,599
and it's even the name of the song that welcomes you to the new age, to the new age, welcome to the new age.

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,579
Presumably this new age occurring after some
kind of apocalypse.

5
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:23,639
As principles of chemistry go, few figure more prominently in the popular imagination than radioactivity,

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,760
but at the same time few are as completely
misunderstood.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,200
Most people think of radioactivity as just some thing that mutates genes and melts faces off.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,700
And yes, some forms of radioactivity can do
those things.

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,660
But all the more reason to understand it,
right?

10
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:45,339
And also we can harness it to produce lots of electricity to fuel our rock and roll lifestyles without contributing to global warming,

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,500
though as Fukushima has taught us it comes
with some of its own problems,

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,170
which we'll explore more next episode.

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,520
Before we get into the nuts and bolts of nuclear
chemistry,

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,180
like nuclear fission and why it's so awesome as well as fusion and why it's so hard to do,

15
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,880
we'll first get to know radioactivity.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,590
What it is, what different kinds there are,
and why you don't really need to fear it.

17
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,890
At least, you know, not all the time.

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:17,439
[Theme Music]

19
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,899
So, radioactivity doesn't actually have a
lot to do with chemistry in the sense that

20
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,820
we've been talking about for most of this
course.

21
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,158
Chemical reactions happen when an atom's outermost
electrons do stuff,

22
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,780
and the protons and neutrons and even the inner electron shells are usually completely unaffected.

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,840
But the protons and neutrons are still part of the atom, of course, still part of the chemicals,

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,100
and their interactions are important.

25
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,129
When protons and neutrons get directly involved
in reactions and their numbers do change,

26
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:45,170
huge amounts of energy can be released.

27
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,728
Far more than by the transfer of electrons
that we've learnted about in other reactions.

28
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:53,959
When these changes happen to the nucleus of an atom we rather logically call their study: Nuclear Chemistry.

29
00:01:53,959 --> 00:02:00,179
Now it's probably occurred to you already that changing the nucleus of an atom can completely change it's nature.

30
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,660
Protons are the key to an atom's identity

31
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:08,479
so any change that affects the number of protons will turn one element into a completely different one.

32
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,000
An alchemist's dream, right? Lead to gold.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,319
So as you might expect, that's not something that usually happens in a typical chemical reaction.

34
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,879
The same can be said of that other component
of the nucleus, neutrons.

35
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,479
Atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons are isotopes.

36
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,959
So changes in the number of neutrons in an atom create different isotopes of the same element.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,659
Both of these kinds of changes, changing one
element to another,

38
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,848
or changing one isotope to another are known
as transmutation.

39
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:39,689
And it is, indeed, possible to transmute lead
to gold.

40
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:45,039
Its just so ridiculously expensive that the tiny amounts of gold produced could never pay for the process.

41
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:51,560
But the very fact that it is possible, should clue you in that nuclear chemistry is an entirely different flavor of chemistry sauce.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,000
Though, as with non nuclear chemistry, the
changes that take place in a nuclear reaction

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,939
all come down to the atom's desire to have
what we all want in life, stability.

44
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:06,859
Just as atoms are most stable when their outermost
electron orbitals are full of electrons,

45
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,450
certain combinations of protons and neutrons
make the nucleus more stable.

46
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:15,159
And just like when an atom gains or loses or shares electrons to stabilize it's outer shell,

47
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:17,679
when the numbers of protons or neutrons aren't
ideal,

48
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
the nucleus releases some of them to try to
reach a stable configuration.

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,120
When a nucleus decomposes in this way to form
a different nucleus that's radioactive decay.

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,709
And just like with other chemical reactions
we've talked about,

51
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,920
we need to know more about a nuclear reaction than just what's reacting and what's being produced.

52
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,339
Probably the most important thing to learn is how much of the product is being made and how fast.

53
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,599
Now you've heard of half life, it's the measurement
that tells us just that.

54
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,170
The time it takes for exactly one half of
the sample to decay.

55
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,219
Different nuclei have different half lives.

56
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,560
By knowing the half life, we can calculate how much of a sample will be gone in a given amount of time.

57
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,620
For example, the half life of phosphorus-32
is 14.3 days.

58
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,900
So if you start with a 100 gram sample, after
about 2 weeks you'll have 50 grams left.

59
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,300
After another 2 weeks, half of the remainder would decay leaving only 25 grams of undecayed phosphorus, and so on.

60
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,400
Now you might be asking, if radioactive elements are always decaying in to more and more stable isotopes

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,659
that are eventually no longer radioactive,
why are they still around at all?

62
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,139
Fascinating question, you seem to have brought
your clever pants today.

63
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,740
Well it's fairly simple, given enough time all radioactive elements would decay in to non radioactive forms.

64
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,319
Even ultra stable bismuth, with it's half
life longer than the age of the universe.

65
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:35,180
But elements with short half lives are around because they were decayed in to by elements that recently decayed in to them.

66
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,658
The chain of decay from the element originally
produced in whatever supernova created them,

67
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:44,360
to the elements that exist on Earth now last
billions and billions of years.

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,020
Also, I should note that some radioactive
isotopes like carbon-14 in the atmosphere

69
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,459
are constantly being renewed by cosmic rays.

70
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,779
Now radioactive decay occurs when a nucleus has a higher energy level than a potentially more stable version.

71
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:01,019
Typically this difference in energy is released
as what's called ionizing radiation.

72
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:03,209
Which you know as radioactivity.

73
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:09,379
It's ionizing because it has enough energy to knock electrons out or add electrons to other atoms.

74
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,159
Essentially creating ions.

75
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,380
There are three general types of radioactive
decay,

76
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,478
each named for exactly what is released from
the nucleus as it decays.

77
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:20,918
Let's take a look at what may be the most
famous radioactive element, uranium.

78
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:25,299
By far the most common naturally occurring
form of uranium is the isotope uranium-238.

79
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,680
More than 99% of the natural uranium in the
world is in this form.

80
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,620
U-238 spontaneously decays in to thorium-234, in a process that releases something called an alpha particle.

81
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,060
This is called alpha decay and the particle that it emits is basically the same as a helium nucleus:

82
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,160
two protons and two neutrons.

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,540
We even describe it that way when writing
it.

84
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,550
So right away you can see that the math checks
out when it comes to the protons and neutrons.

85
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,720
92 minus 2, is 90.
And 238 minus 4, leaves you with 234.

86
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,279
But you'll note, that we don't write the charges.

87
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,259
The helium nucleus obviously has a plus 2 charge, and the thorium atom would have a negative charge as well.

88
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,038
While its not incorrect to write them,

89
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,769
these charges are often omitted to emphasize
what's going on in the nucleus.

90
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:11,068
Now alpha particles have relatively low energy,
they're pretty heavy as particles go.

91
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,539
So while I try not to make a habit of walking
around with a hunk of uranium in my pocket,

92
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:18,248
alpha particles can be stopped by nothing
more than a sheet of paper or cloth.

93
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:22,539
The second type of radioactive decay is beta
decay, which simply emits electrons.

94
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:24,800
It has somewhat higher energy than alpha radiation,

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,889
but it can still be stopped by a sheet of
aluminum foil or the top layers of your skin.

96
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,649
So that thorium-234 that formed when uranium
underwent alpha decay?

97
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:37,249
It can continue to decay on its own, and when
it does it undergoes beta decay.

98
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:40,049
Releasing an electron and an atom of xenon.

99
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:43,528
Notice that again, the way we write this is
a little different.

100
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:48,420
Even though the thorium emits an electron
we don't use the usual symbol for electrons.

101
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,960
Instead we write it in nuclear notation form, with the mass number at top and the atomic number at the bottom.

102
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,319
Since its an electron, and not a proton, we
put a negative 1 for the atomic number.

103
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,219
That probably seems a little weird right now,

104
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,419
but next week when we talk about nuclear equations,
you will see why it's useful.

105
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:09,308
The third type of decay, is a little different,
because it only emits energy, not a particle.

106
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:13,789
Its called gamma decay, and it releases electromagnetic
radiation similar to visible light,

107
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:16,680
or UV radiation,
but higher on the energy scale.

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,879
Because it's just energy, gamma radiation has no mass and contains no protons, neutrons, or electrons.

109
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,829
So it's written with two zeros.

110
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:29,620
This form of radiation is often released when electrons transition from an unstable excited state,

111
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,598
to a more stable state that has a lower energy.
That's called the ground state.

112
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,640
Depending on how much energy the electron loses, the extra energy can be released in the form of visible,

113
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,139
or ultraviolet light, x-rays,
or gamma waves.

114
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,418
Let's take the example of nickle-60.

115
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,060
Imagine there's an atom of nickle-60 with one or more of its electrons in an excited state.

116
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,300
That's what the little asterisks designates.

117
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,259
Atoms can get to this state when they are
themselves the products of radioactive decay,

118
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,079
or if they get bombarded with radiation from other reactions pushing their electrons in to a higher energy level.

119
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,359
Now when all those electrons drop down to
the ground state,

120
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,718
that atom is going to release some gamma radiation.

121
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,740
This kind of transition can also take place where other kinds of nuclear reactions are going on.

122
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,538
So gamma decay often occurs along with some
other form of decay too.

123
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,498
So for example, if that uranium atom is at
an excited state when it decays in to thorium,

124
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:21,129
it can simultaneous release gamma waves as
well as the alpha particle I already mentioned.

125
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:23,649
Now you might have heard of gamma radiation
more than the other kinds I've mentioned

126
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,899
because it can actually do some serious harm.

127
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:28,519
Like potentially turning you in to a giant
green rage monster

128
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,498
that doesn't obey the laws of conservation
of matter.

129
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,538
Unlike the particles emitted by other kinds of radiation, gamma rays can penetrate your skin,

130
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:39,549
your cell membranes, and ultimately the organelles
within your cells.

131
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:42,978
So gamma radiation can not only cause skin
burns, nausea,

132
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,060
other symptoms we associate with radiation
poisoning,

133
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,359
it can also alter your DNA causing mutations
and cancer.

134
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,159
OK, but to turn the frown upside down.

135
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,750
There's one more type of radioactivity that
I'm happy to say is really simple.

136
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,179
It's called spontaneous fission and it occurs when an atom simply breaks in to 2 smaller atoms without any outside help.

137
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:04,519
This occurs at a ridiculously slow rate in
most cases.

138
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,240
In fact, the only substances that does it at a rate that sufficient to serve any purposes is Californium-254.

139
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,159
And that purpose is to produce neutrons for
use in other nuclear reactions.

140
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:17,059
But we'll talk more about that when we go
in to fission, fusion,

141
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:20,799
and how scientists use and control nuclear
reactions.

142
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,409
In the meantime, thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

143
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:26,799
If you listened carefully, you learned what
radioactivity really is.

144
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,059
And about transmutation among elements and
among isotopes.

145
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,199
And how to make calculations based on an elements
half life.

146
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,040
You also learned about different types of
radioactive decay: alpha, beta, and gamma.

147
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,000
And about spontaneous fission.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,328
