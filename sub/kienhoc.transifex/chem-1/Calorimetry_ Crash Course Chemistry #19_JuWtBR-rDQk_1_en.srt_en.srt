1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,099
Hydrochloric Acid: every chemist's frenemy,
as terribly dangerous as it is terribly useful.

2
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:10,699
It'll burn your skin, your eyes, even your mucus membranes if you breathe in its fumes for too long.

3
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:13,579
But HCL as an acid gives up its hydrogen
pretty easily,

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,280
which makes it good for making things like
fertilizers and dyes and even table salt.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,640
Then, there's sodium hydroxide, another substance
that I wouldn't wish to be on my worst foe,

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,060
although I'm glad we have it.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,410
You may know it as lye, an extremely caustic
substance that's used for

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,050
everything from clearing clogged pipes to
purifying drinking water.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,230
It's a base. It readily accept the protons
that acids release.

10
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:38,619
So what do you think will happen when I mix
solutions of these two things together?

11
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:43,439
Will they just cancel each other out and do nothing, or will they explode, or maybe they'll travel through time?

12
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,858
Well, if you've been paying attention, you
already know what's going to happen.

13
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:49,460
They're going to undergo a neutralization
reaction, which we've talked about before.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,530
These two potentially deadly substances will
form harmless salt and water.

15
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,129
But the reaction will also have an effect
that you can actually feel.

16
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:01,119
It will release heat, and not just a little
heat.

17
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,590
Mixing concentrated acids and bases releases
so much heat that it can result in an explosion.

18
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,640
But I will show you how to produce a safe,
but noticeable amount of heat with this reaction.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,189
To me, the coolest part of this is where the
heat actually comes from.

20
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,159
The energy used to exist as part of chemical
bonds in the acid and the base.

21
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,319
Just like a ball at the top of a hill, the molecules always move towards a lower energy state if they can,

22
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,279
and that's just what they'll do.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,460
High energy bonds will break and lower energy
bonds will form.

24
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:35,699
The change in energy between those states you can actually feel the effects of, and that's pretty dang cool.

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,640
And what's even more awesome, if you ask me,

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,760
is that we can actually figure out exactly
how much heat will be released by this reaction.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:52,260
[Theme Music]

28
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,980
Remember that measuring heat change is closely
related to enthalpy,

29
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:58,409
which we defined as the internal energy of
a system

30
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,399
plus the energy it uses to push the surroundings back and make room for its own pressure and volume.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,219
And in a constant pressure, like we have here
at the surface of the Earth,

32
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:11,530
that works out to be exactly the same as the
heat that's absorbed or released by a reaction.

33
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,318
Naturally, it can be very useful to know how
much heat a chemical reaction absorbs or releases.

34
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:17,419
In addition to the exothermic hand-warmers
that we have out there,

35
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,518
there are also endothermic chemical ice packs
for treating injuries.

36
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,680
The ability to calculate change in enthalpy
is also what tells pilots how far the fuel

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,040
in an airplane's tank will allow it to fly,

38
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,340
which I personally am very interested in making
sure they get right.

39
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,269
One of the ways we can calculate the change
in enthalpy of a system is with Hess's Law,

40
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:38,590
which you'll recall states that the total
enthalpy change for a chemical reaction doesn't

41
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,908
depend on the pathway it takes,

42
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:43,729
but only on its initial and final states.

43
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,649
It's often expressed in terms of Standard
Enthalpy of Formation,

44
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,998
that is, the amount of heat lost or gained when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements.

45
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:55,209
That's how we figured out exactly how much
heat my hand-warmers release.

46
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,420
But that's not the only way that Hess's Law
can be used.

47
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,479
The law itself says nothing about the standard
enthalpy of formation.

48
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,709
Any way that we can figure out the change
of heat between the products and the reactants

49
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,060
will work just as well, and that's where calorimetry
comes in.

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,039
Calorimetry is the science of measuring the change in heat associated with a chemical reaction.

51
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:17,459
And this may look like a plastic bottle inside
a koozie, but it's actually a calorimeter.

52
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,670
A calorimeter can be fancy and an expensive
piece of hardware, or it can be simple.

53
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:26,979
But no matter what it looks like, it's basically
an insulated container that contains a thermometer.

54
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,840
And it can be made out of stainless steel
or Styrofoam cups,

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,700
but there really are no fundamental differences
in how they work.

56
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,359
And you know the general setup by now:

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,140
the chemicals in the calorimeter make up the
thermodynamic system

58
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,739
and everything else is the surroundings.

59
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,639
The insulation minimizes the amount of heat
that leaks in or out of the system,

60
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,718
so that we can be fairly confident that any heat transfer is part of the system, not the surroundings.

61
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,819
The thermometer tracks the temperature change, which is part of the calculation we have to do.

62
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,418
And there's usually some way to stir the solution
to make sure that the reaction occurs fully.

63
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,650
Alright everybody, safety first, though I
really should be wearing gloves...

64
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:10,550
I'm gonna put 100 mL, also 100 grams, of HCL's one mole of HCL solution into my calorimeter here...

65
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,800
(mumbling)

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,100
And now I'm going to put the same amount of
sodium hydroxide solution.

67
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,228
Before I do the reaction, I have to know our
starting temperature,

68
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:24,180
so I'm going to stick my thermometer in there
and wait for a second to see what it does.

69
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,740
It should be room temperature, it's been in
the room for a long time.

70
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:35,449
So, we are currently at, like, 20.8 degrees
Celsius.

71
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:45,060
So that's like, 294 Kelvin, and now I shall
add my 100 mL of sodium hydroxide.

72
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,839
The temperature, unsurprisingly, is rising
very rapidly.

73
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,638
And I'm doing something right now that you should never ever do, which is stir with the thermometer,

74
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,439
because if this happens in schools across
the world,

75
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,639
then there will be a million billion broken thermometers and the stuff inside these thermometers is not good.

76
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,959
So never do what I'm doing.

77
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:08,080
All right, the temperature should be stable
by now, we have 28 point like 2 degrees Celsius.

78
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,050
Now there's a simple formula that allows us
to calculate the heat change of a reaction,

79
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,220
simply by measuring the change in temperature
that occurs in a calorimeter.

80
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,400
It says that the change in heat equals the
specific heat capacity of the substance

81
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,639
times its total mass times the change in temperature.

82
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,259
Let's examine the parts of this.

83
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:28,340
First of all, the heat change in the calorimeter
is normally represented by a lowercase "q,"

84
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:32,219
but it can also be represented by change in
enthalpy, or delta H,

85
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,940
because remember that constant pressure (delta
H) equals q,

86
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,759
and constant pressure is almost always a good
assumption for the duration of an experiment,

87
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,580
or at least as long as we stay at the surface
of the earth.

88
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:47,519
For reasons that will become clear later, we'll sure delta H to represent the heat change for this experiment.

89
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,579
Specific heat capacity, represented by
a lowercase "s",

90
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:56,109
is the amount of heat required tp raise the
temperature of one mass unit,

91
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,759
like a gram or kilogram, of a substance by
1 degree Celsius.

92
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,139
So it turns out that different amounts of
heat create different temperature changes,

93
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,038
like metals get hot really easily and cool
down really easily.

94
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,288
Others like water require a lot of thermal
energy to raise the temperature,

95
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,399
and therefore have to release a lot of heat
to cool down.

96
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,008
I'm always wondering though, like, what does
that really mean?

97
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,180
Like, physically in the molecules, shouldn't heat raise the temperature of all substances equally?

98
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,180
And why does water in particular have such
a high specific heat capacity?

99
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:30,780
Heat energy can do a lot of things besides
just increase temperatures.

100
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:33,568
Temperature, or the speed at which molecules
bounce around,

101
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:36,780
is just one way that atoms or molecules can
absorb energy.

102
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:41,758
Heat energy can also be absorbed by the breaking
and formation of bonds between molecules,

103
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,900
and as we'll learn in another episode, the
extremely high specific heat capacity of water

104
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,418
is due to the breaking and formation of hydrogen bonds that are associated with relatively small changes in temperature.

105
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,668
And how do we know the specific heat capacity?

106
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:57,529
Well, I am happy to report that some noble
chemists have worked hard to determine the

107
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:02,069
specific heat capacities of hundreds of substances
so that we don't have to.

108
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:04,098
We just have to look up the numbers in a table.

109
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:07,870
Okay, so specific heat capacity times mass
times the change in temperature.

110
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,949
The mass is important because the more mass of a substance we have, the more chemical bonds are present,

111
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,420
and because energy is contained in chemical
bonds,

112
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,030
they have a big effect on how much energy
we're able to absorb or release.

113
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:21,098
And finally, there's the change in temperature.

114
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:25,819
When doing calorimetry, we calculate a change
in heat by measuring a change in temperature,

115
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,419
but as we've said a billion times before,
heat and temperature are not the same thing.

116
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:34,968
But please do not think that this thing is
measuring heat because it's not!

117
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:40,668
It's just that luckily, in this specific case, they are related by our handy little calorimeter formula.

118
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:45,748
Now you might not have noticed, but we are right at the interface between chemistry and physics here.

119
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:48,259
Each science could claim ownership over this
phenomenon,

120
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:53,098
but the truth is humans made up the difference
between chemistry and physics anyway.

121
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:58,218
Thermodynamics, the study of heat, energy,
and work, doesn't care about our little rules.

122
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:02,569
Thermodynamics itself makes the rules of the
universe. It is the ultimate law.

123
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,229
So now you know, even though you might not
have cared, but you should!

124
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:09,378
Because it's good! It's all wiggly-wobbly
bondy-wondy.

125
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:12,919
All right! Enough talk, let's get out there,
actually do some math here.

126
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:15,359
Remember that the formula is delta H, s, m,
delta T.

127
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,520
The solutions we're using here are so dilute
that almost all of their mass consists of water.

128
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,279
Therefore, we can use the specific heat capacity
of water.

129
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,978
If we look that up on our table, we'll see
that it is 4.184 Joules per gram degrees Celsius;

130
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:31,658
I used 100 grams of each chemical for a total
mass of 200 grams.

131
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:33,610
And finally, we need the temperature change.

132
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,950
If you remember, the temperature rose from
294.0 Kelvin to 301.4 Kelvin;

133
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,969
the difference between these two is 7.4 Kelvin.

134
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:43,940
It's a positive value because the temperature
increased.

135
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,340
Cancel out all the appropriate units and then bang on the calculator to get a final release of 6192.32 J,

136
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,680
or 6.2 kiloJoules of heat from the reaction.

137
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,039
Because this formula is based on temperature
change,

138
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:00,259
and since the temperature increased, we end
up with a positive result.

139
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:04,740
But most importantly, it tells us the magnitude
of the change in heat energy.

140
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,769
So, I wonder how that compares to the amount
we would predict using Hess's Law

141
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,159
and the standard enthalpy of formation?

142
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,350
Remember that we can look up the standard
enthalpy of formation for all the products

143
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,259
and reactants in the back of a textbook or
online,

144
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:23,779
the chemical reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide produces liquid water and sodium chloride.

145
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:29,370
The standard enthalpy of formation for hydrochloric
acid is -167.2 kJ per mole;

146
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,330
for sodium hydroxide it's -469.15 kJ per mole;

147
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,360
for liquid water it's -285.8;
and for sodium chloride it's -407.27.

148
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,779
I'm not gonna do the mole calculations on-screen,

149
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:48,240
but trust me when I say that we used 0.100
mole of HCL and the amount of NaOH.

150
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,620
Because everything in the equation balances
out, it's just a 1:1:1:1 ratio,

151
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,000
we can assume that they all have the same
amount of each product as well.

152
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,200
If we plug these into Hess's Law and do the
calculation,

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,519
we found that the change in heat or enthalpy
of the reaction is -5.67 kJ.

154
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,149
The system is releasing or losing energy,
so the number is negative,

155
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,789
but again it's really the magnitude that we
wanna know.

156
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:15,429
So there you go, the calorimetry formula gave
an absolute enthalpy change of 6.2 kJ,

157
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:19,059
while Hess's Law gives a change of 5.67 kJ.

158
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,768
So, why the difference?

159
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:25,299
Well, the greatest factor is probably that we used the specific heat capacity of pure water

160
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:28,179
instead of the salt water that we actually
created.

161
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,660
We also didn't include the heat capacity of
our calorimeter itself.

162
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:34,679
The calorimeter walls and the thermometer
were heated too,

163
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,469
resulting in some of the produced heat not
being accounted for.

164
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,000
The insulation of the calorimeter is obviously
a bit light,

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,500
which allowed some heat to escape entirely
and that's another major factor.

166
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,559
Even so, I'd say we did pretty well, the important thing is that it showed us what we needed to see,

167
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,860
even though it was just a little plastic bottle
in a koozie.

168
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,250
For a quick simple method, the calorimeter
got us pretty close to the calculated value.

169
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,059
If we were calculating the amount of a particular
fuel we would need to travel to Mars,

170
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,759
or inventing a cold pack that won't give you
frostbite,

171
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,659
we'd wanna use a more sophisticated system and work more carefully, but this was pretty cool for our purposes.

172
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,939
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course.

173
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,649
If you paid attention, you learned that we
don't necessarily have to use standard enthalpies

174
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,519
of formation to solve Hess's Law,

175
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,828
you learned what a calorimeter is,

176
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:19,078
that calorimetry is another way to investigate
heat changes in chemical reactions,

177
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,919
and that specific heat capacity tells us

178
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,659
how much heat energy affects the molecules
in a substance without changing its temperature.

179
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:28,969
And finally, you learned some potential sources
of error related to calorimetry.

180
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,690
The episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi Gonzalez.

181
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,110
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino and our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko Langner.

182
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,699
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

183
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:43,549
Our script supervisor was Caitlin Hofmeister,
and our sound designer is Michael Aranda.

184
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:46,649
And, of course, our graphics team is
