1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
If they know it at all, most people know silicon from the valley in California that bares its name.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,240
The birthplace of modern computing where technological
dreams became reality.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,769
Where brilliant twenty-somethings became millionaires.

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,879
But we chemists know silicon first and foremost
as the most abundant element in the earth's crust.

5
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:18,899
Oxides of silicon, known as silicates, make
up sand,

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,509
which covers not only every desert and shoreline
on the earth, but also most of the ocean floor.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,040
Silicates also include quartz and most types
of clay and they're found in living things,

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,099
like little spikes and nettles.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,179
And as a polishing agent in toothpaste.
It's everywhere!

10
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:37,570
And, of course, because of their uniquely
wonderful chemical properties,

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,369
crystals of elemental silicon form the basis
of semiconductors.

12
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,959
These crystals can be combined to make diodes
and transistors acting essentially as

13
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,250
chemical on/off switches that make binary
code, and, therefore, computers possible.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,880
Fascinatingly enough, only a few minor differences
in atomic arrangement allow an element

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,219
found on the bottom of the ocean to make the
computer that you're watching me on possible.

16
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,780
As with carbon, everything comes down to the
network these atoms form.

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,500
Once you learned the chemistry of these networks, you'll come to understand why glass is glass and clay is clay.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,379
You'll understand what chemists mean when
they talk about "doping."

19
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:15,899
And you'll finally get why a valley in California is named for arguably one of the most intriguing element in the universe.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:25,780
[Theme Music]

21
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,340
This sand, and this glass, and this quartz
are basically the same thing,

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,880
just with the atoms arranged a little differently.

23
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,099
The chemical name of this substance is silica
made up of silicon and oxygen in a 1:2 ratio.

24
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,159
For that reason we say that the chemical formula
of silica is SiO2.

25
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,640
Even though it doesn't actually exist as separate
individual molecules.

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,200
Like graphite and diamond, the two forms of pure carbon, silicons and it's oxides are network solids.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,240
And also like graphite and diamond, the different forms that they take are all about bonding differences.

28
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,219
The form of the silica that makes sand, is exactly the same as the form that comprises quartz.

29
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,140
In fact the silica in sand is basically just
tiny bits of quartz.

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,780
Silica structure is based on a tetrahedral arrangement of a silica atom bonded to oxygen atoms.

31
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,699
That's right -- 4, not 2.

32
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,030
The trick is that each of the oxygen can form
two bonds,

33
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,490
so they also bond to another silicon atom
on the other side.

34
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,870
So each silicate is bonded to 4 oxygens, while
each oxygen is bonded to 2 silicons.

35
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,920
Si2O4 simplifies to SiO2, and that's where
we get the formula.

36
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:30,979
As the molecule continues to build on itself,
it can make various crystal structures

37
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,859
depending on the orientation of the little
tetrahedrons.

38
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,420
These are different forms of quartz, clays,
and other minerals.

39
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:41,079
They can make two dimensional forms as sheets,
or three dimensional crystals.

40
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,840
And each form has its own properties and behaviors.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,060
Ceramics, and other clays, get their strength
from the two dimensional types.

42
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,878
When the clay is wet, silica sheets move around
freely in the clay

43
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,509
and as it dries they move closer to each other
and bond to together forming a rigid framework.

44
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,689
This resulting composite is extremely hard
and heat resistant.

45
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:00,209
Both of these properties make ceramics useful
in tons of ways

46
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,989
that you've probably been exploring since you were a toddler and got your first box of modeling clay.

47
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,819
Three dimensional silicates can take lots
of shapes, too.

48
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:09,030
Although not all of them are true crystals.

49
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,318
Glass is an enormously important example of a three dimensional silica based amorphous solid.

50
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,429
It's worth mentioning here, even though its
not a crystal

51
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,300
because it's molecular structure is extremely similar to the structure of quartz, just not as orderly.

52
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,349
The arrangement of silicon and oxygen in quartz
is very regular and rigid.

53
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:26,359
The molecular structure of glass,
on the other hand,

54
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,400
looks like Mother Nature tried to build a quartz crystal while she was a little bit drunk.

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,020
The atoms are attached in random numbers and shapes, creating a gradual structure with no definite order.

56
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,110
This is why glass can be formed into almost
infinite shapes when it's heated,

57
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,580
while quartz keeps it's characteristic crystal
shape.

58
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,379
Because it's an amorphous solid with bonds of varying strength, glass doesn't have an exact melting point.

59
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:51,319
Instead, it softens as its heated and becomes honey-like, except extraordinarily hot and not sweet at all.

60
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,780
Quartz doesn't do that.

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,340
It's melting point is much higher but it melts at an exact temperature and has no pliable in-betweeny state.

62
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,080
Like all silica crystals, quartz, glass and
ceramics are electrical insulators,

63
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,360
because they have no free electrons to transfer
charges over a distance.

64
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,100
The atoms have 4 valence electrons and they form 4 bonds so all the electrons are perfectly well used.

65
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,079
For this reason, these materials are used
widely as insulators in electrical applications.

66
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,369
Ceramics, for example, are used to hold live
wires and power lines and to make capacitors,

67
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:24,539
which are basically layers of electrical conductors
separated by layers of insulators.

68
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,500
But all of these silica based network solids I talked about so far contain both silicon and oxygen atoms.

69
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,939
Crystals made up of silicon are insulators
too, in their peer state,

70
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,759
but they can be made to transfer electricity
by a process called doping.

71
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:39,408
And no, we're not gonna make a Lance Armstrong
joke.

72
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:40,680
We might make an analogy though --

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,360
it's like, much like a perfectly fit athlete injecting himself with all kinds of weird foreign stuff.

74
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,879
Silicon doping involves incorporating impurities
into a crystal that mess up its electron balance.

75
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,749
It can do that in one of two ways.

76
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:57,300
If the impurity is an element with more electrons
than silicon has, like Phosphorus or Arsenic,

77
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,540
the resulting crystal will contain excess
electrons.

78
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,560
But, if the impurity is an element with fewer
electrons, like Aluminum or Boron,

79
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,189
it leaves holes where electrons are missing
from the normal structure.

80
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:10,319
Doped silicon crystals are known as solid-state
semiconductors.

81
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,819
Those doped with elements that add electrons
are called N-type,

82
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:17,968
or negative semiconductors, because of the
resulting charge from the additional electrons.

83
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:20,879
With N-type semiconductors, the charges carried
by the excess electrons

84
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,060
and because there's no room for them to integrate into the structure, they move freely about the crystals.

85
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,459
Similarly, crystals dope with elements that
create an electron deficiency are called P-type,

86
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:34,579
or positive semiconductors, because they have a more positive charge than pure silicon would have on its own.

87
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:37,300
P-type semiconductors work a little differently.

88
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,579
Because they have empty spaces available here
and there,

89
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:45,139
the electrons that are normally part of specific silicon atoms are able to jump around from one atom to another.

90
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:50,459
Each jump fills a hole and creates a new one, allowing another electron to move in the same way.

91
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:56,459
So if both N-type and P-type crystals are both electrical conductors, why do we call them semiconductors?

92
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,978
Well, thank you for asking.

93
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:01,908
The reason semiconductors are so valuable
is that they have the amazing ability to conduct

94
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,449
electricity freely under some conditions,

95
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,569
but completely refuse to conduct it under
other conditions.

96
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,718
So yes, they are partial, or semi conductors.

97
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:15,118
So these properties become most useful when
a P-type and N-type semiconductor are placed

98
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,249
next to each other to form a diode.

99
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:18,669
Because their charges are opposite,

100
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:23,258
the free electrons in the N-type are attracted
to the P-type and tend to migrate to its holes.

101
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,189
And when an electrical field is applied to
this arrangement,

102
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,419
so that the N-type is attached to the positive
terminal, also called the anode,

103
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:32,258
and the P-type is attached to the negative
terminal, or the cathode,

104
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,110
all of the free electrons are pulled completely
into the N-type.

105
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,939
These free electrons are attracted away from
the holes, not into them,

106
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:44,039
so any further motion is blocked and no more
current passes through the diode.

107
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:46,399
This type of arrangement is called reverse
bias.

108
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,379
However, just by reversing the polarity of the electron flow, if you will, we can create a very different situation.

109
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,959
If the N-type side is attached to the negative terminal, and the P-type side attached to the positive terminal,

110
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,919
then the electrons are pulled in to the P-type
making this part an electrical conductor again.

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,160
This process called forward bias is self perpetuating, it allows the current to readily flow through the diode.

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,140
The fact that this conduction only works in
one direction is extremely useful!

113
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:14,889
You know AC and DC right?
Back in Black for those about to rock?

114
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:20,288
AC is alternating current, where the flow of electrons alternates in one direction to the other.

115
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:24,860
In DC, or direct current, is exactly what
it sounds like, the electrons go directly

116
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,899
where they're headed without backtracking.

117
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:32,539
And simple arrangements of diodes can be used to convert AC to DC like in this power supply for my laptop.

118
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,619
P and N-type semiconductors can also be combined
in sets of three.

119
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:39,379
These are called transistors and they've completely
revolutionized the field of electronics,

120
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,419
also the entire world since they were invented
in 1947.

121
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:46,218
One of the main functions of a transistor
is to switch an electrical signal on and off.

122
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,699
Basically when it allows a current to flow in the forward bias direction, the switch is turned on.

123
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,449
When the current drops below the minimum the
switch is turned off.

124
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,360
This switching is the basis of binary code.

125
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,199
Ones and zeroes representing the on and off
states of the transistor.

126
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,949
And that code is how we store and process
information using computer chips,

127
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,879
which are just collections of transistors
working together.

128
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:15,540
Such a tiny simple device made mostly from one single element, and yet revolutionizing our entire world.

129
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,560
That my friends is how Silicon Valley got
its name

130
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,019
and how network solids of silicon made this
conversation we are having today possible.

131
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,039
Thanks for taking advantage of all your tiny transistors today by watching this episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

132
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,770
If you paid attention you learned that sand,
and glass, and ceramics, and computer chips,

133
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:37,259
and must more are all really just different types of network solids that can be formed by silicon and its oxides.

134
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,799
You learned the differences in their arrangements
and bonding of atoms,

135
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,599
and you learned how those differences result
in wildly varying properties among the solids.

136
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,800
You also learned what a solid-state semiconductor
is, both P-type and N-type,

137
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,839
and you learned how they can be combined to
create diodes and transistors.

138
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,740
Finally you learned how transistors are combined
to make computer chips,

139
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,329
and how their switching mechanism tells computers
what to do.

140
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,989
I don't know about you, but it blows my mind!
