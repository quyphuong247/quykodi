1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Have you ever been to a demolition derby?

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,899
Basically it's a bunch of people driving cars
around a field,

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,240
doing their best to ram into each other while
protecting themselves as much as possible.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,048
The goal of course is to damage the other
cars so badly that they can't be driven anymore.

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,800
The driver of the last operational car wins.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,679
You know Crash Course chemistry well enough
to know that

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,710
I probably wouldn't have mentioned this if
it have some relation to chemistry.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,070
So yeah it does, chemical reactions basically
work just like this.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,429
Atoms and molecules move around their environment
occasionally ramming into each other.

10
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:36,049
If they do it right, a reaction happens between
them, and if enough of them do it,

11
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:42,539
the concentration of the reacting molecules will go down while the concentration of the products goes up. Win.

12
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:46,759
But it's not as simple as it sounds, for demolition
drivers, or for chemicals;

13
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:52,849
in both cases a lot of the collisions that
occur have very little effect on the end result.

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,969
One molecule hitting another doesn't mean
a reaction's going to take place.

15
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:00,679
In the same way that just randomly bumping into a guys car doesn't mean you're gonna ram him out of the derby.

16
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:06,840
So, what makes a collision effective? The hit has to be hard enough and it has to be aligned just right.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,359
The branch of chemistry that studies how these collisions effect the rate of reactions is Kinetics.

18
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:18,280
And if you ask me it's just as exciting and a heck of a lot more useful than demolition derbies.

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,960
If only they sold funnel cakes in chemistry
class.

20
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:31,539
[Theme Music]

21
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,140
So if chemical reactions only work when particles
bang into each other good and hard,

22
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,140
just how hard do they have to bang into each
other?

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,379
Every reaction has a minimum amount of energy
required to get it started.

24
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,759
This is known as the activation energy.

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,319
Molecules require this much energy to hit other molecules hard enough to break them apart

26
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,579
and reform them in different ways;
without it nothing will happen.

27
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,398
It's like a hill that molecules have to get
over before they can go any farther.

28
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,799
So where do they get this energy? Well it's
kinetic energy, the actual speed of the particles.

29
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,469
So just like the cars in a demolition derby,
all else being equal,

30
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:09,669
the faster the particles move, the harder
the collision will be.

31
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,908
But still no matter how hard they hit it won't do any good if they're not hitting the right way, in the right places.

32
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:19,298
Like, if you keep smashing into the back of some guy's trunk it's not going to stop his car, there's no engine back there.

33
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,100
You can bang Velcro together all day and night and if it's not turned the right way it'll never stick together.

34
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,219
Same thing with molecules.

35
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,969
As an example take nitric oxide, one of the
byproducts of gasoline combustion,

36
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:32,109
and something that you can smell quite clearly
at a demolition derby.

37
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,390
Under the right conditions it reacts with
hydrogen gas to produce nitrogen gas and water.

38
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,079
But the molecules have to hit each other just
the right way.

39
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,150
To make N2 two NO's have to collide in such
a way that the nitrogens are together,

40
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,489
and to get H2O, a molecule of H2 has to collide
with the oxygen side of an NO molecule.

41
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:53,730
Just like Velcro being turned the wrong way,

42
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:58,209
you can smack the N side against the H2 all
day and you'll never get any water from it.

43
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,489
Now let's say we're having a lot of solid,
effective collisions between the molecules.

44
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,170
The reaction should hum along with no further
hindrances, right? Well yes and no.

45
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:10,309
Once the energy requirements are met the reaction
will proceed,

46
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,539
but its speed, or reaction rate, will vary
wildly from super fast to super slow.

47
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:21,128
So the reaction rate, that's the rate at which
the concentrations of the reacts decrease

48
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:23,688
and this has to be determined experimentally.

49
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:28,019
It can't be calculated from the energy change
or any other thermodynamic factor.

50
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,810
One useful way to think about the rate is
a quantity called the reaction's rate law.

51
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,620
It describes the relationship between the
initial concentrations of the reactants

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,099
and the rate at which they react.

53
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:39,998
The rate law for a reaction is written like
this:

54
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:46,058
The rate equals a constant, k, times the concentrations
of each reactant, raised to some power.

55
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,560
Notice that only the reactants are used for
this not the products.

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,878
The rate law for our nitric oxide reaction then ends up as k times the nitric oxide concentration raised to some power,

57
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:58,929
times the hydrogen concentration also raised
to some power.

58
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,269
So you're probably wondering about all those
raised to some power.

59
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,349
Like, what power? And you should be wondering
that.

60
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:09,310
The exponents in rate laws are tricky even
for professional chemists and engineers

61
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,239
because like I said they can only be determined
experimentally.

62
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,079
It's kinda intense, but we can handle it,
check it out.

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,120
Suppose we did the reaction a few different
ways and calculated the rate for each instance.

64
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,819
Let's say that with the first reaction we
got a rate of 0.006 moles per liter per second.

65
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:26,800
Then we repeat the reaction with the same
amount of nitric oxide

66
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,569
but this time with twice as much hydrogen
as before.

67
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,849
And now we find that the rate of the reaction
is 0.012 moles per liter per second.

68
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,070
What does this tell us?

69
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,199
Well, doubling the hydrogen, doubled the rate;

70
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,420
meaning that the rate and the H2 concentration
change in exactly the same way.

71
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,439
So in the rate law this can be expressed be the concentration being raised to the power of 1.

72
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,240
Finally we do it one last night with the original
amount of hydrogen and twice as much NO.

73
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,460
This time we find that we get a rate of 0.048
moles per liter per second.

74
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:59,279
Doubling the nitric oxide caused the rate
to increase by 8 times,

75
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,069
and that can be expressed in mathematical
terms by cubing the concentration term.

76
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,459
This means that the final rate law for this
reaction is:

77
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,939
k times the concentration of hydrogen gas to the first power, you need to write out the 1 obviously,

78
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:12,439
times the concentration of nitric oxide cubed.

79
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,310
A rate law in this form is said to be of the
fourth order.

80
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,790
We get that by adding the exponents together: 3+1 (there is some math that isn't hard here) that equals 4

81
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,640
Fourth order reactions are actually quite rare, most reactions are of the zero, first, or second order,

82
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,339
but in all cases it's calculated exactly as
we have done here.

83
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:34,279
Now if you've watched our episode on equilibrium
this formula should look familiar to you.

84
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,259
Equilibrium expressions also use bracketed concentrations with exponents, and that's no accident.

85
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,980
Those formulas come from these ones.

86
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,660
A reaction is at equilibrium when its forward
and reverse rates are equal, right?

87
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52,400
So if we were to find the reverse rate law for a reaction it would take the same form as the forward one,

88
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,579
but using the initial concentrations for the
products rather than the reactants.

89
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:59,519
Think of like an imaginary reaction
A plus B yields C plus D.

90
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:03,250
The lower case letters represent the coefficients
of the reactants and products.

91
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,620
The forward rate law if k multiplied by the
concentration of A raised to some power

92
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,399
times the initial concentration of B raised
to some power.

93
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,929
And the reverse is it the same, except with
C and D in place of A and B.

94
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,810
Notice that these exponents are not however
the coefficients of the balanced equation.

95
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,120
If we write these two terms together to show that the forward and reverse rates are equal, like in equilibrium,

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,149
and solve for a single constant, we get something
that looks very much like an equilibrium expression.

97
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:33,399
For mathematical reasons the exponents don't
translate,

98
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,339
but, yeah basically this is where the equilibrium
equation's come from, pretty cool.

99
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:42,899
But if it's that simple why don't all reactions
just go to an equilibrium state and stay there?

100
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:47,159
Well sometimes the reverse reaction isn't as thermodynamic spontaneous for one reason or another.

101
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,040
Sometimes that forward reaction is so vigorous that any reactants that might reform are immediately pushed back into products.

102
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,800
Or the products might physically separate
and have little chance of colliding at all,

103
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,180
like when products separate into solids and
gases.

104
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,430
Often though it's just that the reverse reaction
has such a high activation energy

105
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,810
that the collisions are almost always ineffective.

106
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:12,329
Because, remember, most reactions don't happen instantly, boom, all at once; instead they happen in steps.

107
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:18,029
And as with any multi-step process the reaction can only happen as fast as the slowest step takes.

108
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:22,019
And sometimes that step is very slow indeed.

109
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,740
Since its what controls how fast everything else can go, we call it the rate limiting or rate determining step.

110
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,780
The slowest step, is the one that has the
highest activation energy.

111
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,420
If the particles have trouble getting over
that part of the energy hill,

112
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,620
then they'll have trouble making it to the finish line, not matter how fast the other steps are.

113
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,780
So in the case of the nitric oxide reaction we've been discussing, there are actually three steps.

114
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:47,079
First the nitric oxide and the H2 form water
and elemental nitrogen;

115
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:53,259
then the nitrogen combines with another molecule
of NO to form N2 and elemental oxygen;

116
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,539
finally that atom of oxygen combines with
another molecule of H2 to form water.

117
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,810
Here step two is the slow one and no matter
how fast you take the first step,

118
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,009
the water product can never be produced until
the nitrogen gas is.

119
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:10,990
The problem is we can't always afford to wait
around for reactions to happen on their own,

120
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,600
sometimes they need to be forced along.
And that's the job of catalysts.

121
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,399
A catalyst is a chemical that lowers the activation
energy of a reaction,

122
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,959
thereby speeding it up without actually being
changed by it.

123
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,039
Catalysts take many different forms, they can be just another chemical added to the reaction vessel,

124
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,400
a piece of metal that's in contact with the reacting chemicals, or even a gas that's added to the environment.

125
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:36,340
One of the most common and important classes
of catalysts are the enzymes in living things.

126
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,460
Without them, many other chemical processes that our bodies must do every day to keep us alive

127
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:45,370
would slow essentially to a stop, we literally
could not survive without them.

128
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,190
So there you go, in demolition derbies and in chemistry it all comes down to how hard you can hit,

129
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,470
and how well you can aim your punches.

130
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,300
Chemistry! Surprisingly exciting even without
funnel-cakes.

131
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,819
Thanks for hanging out for this episode of Crash Course chemistry, if you paid attention you learned that:

132
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,220
chemical reactions depend on collisions between
molecules and atoms,

133
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,639
that the particles have to be oriented correctly
when they collide,

134
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,889
and that they have to collide with enough
energy to meet the threshold for the reaction

135
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:11,449
known as the activation energy.

136
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,590
You also learned how to write rate laws and
figure out their exponents

137
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,320
and how to calculate the form or order of
a rate law;

138
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,710
you learned how rate laws are related to equilibrium
expressions,

139
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,060
and finally you learned that chemical reactions
actually happen in steps.

140
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,250
That the slowest step determines the overall
rate of the reaction

141
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,440
and that the reason for that come right back
around the activation energy.
