1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,419
Imagine, if you will, a state dinner at the White House. These are not small intimate affairs.

2
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:08,748
300 or so adults mingle in close quarters,

3
00:00:08,749 --> 00:00:13,028
yet somehow it's a quiet gathering where people
behave gently, move around slowly,

4
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:14,829
and almost never run into a wall.

5
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:21,480
However, as a group they do take up a lot of space, they give off a lot of heat, and lots of things get moved around.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,179
In these ways the room is changed by their
very presence.

7
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,820
Now picture a five-year old's birthday party;
a very different situation.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,579
You would not call that quiet or formal.

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:35,679
But that is not enough. Imagine the most popular
five-year old in the world.

10
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,969
His birthday party; 300 kindergartners in
one room for several hours,

11
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:43,780
shoving each other, running like crazy, and
definitely banging into walls.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,759
Their bodies are smaller but because of their
faster motion,

13
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:51,859
they collectively take up just as much of the room and give off just as much heat as the slow moving adults do.

14
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,339
And things get shoved around just as much.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,740
Now imagine we have a surprise for those 300 adults at the state dinner all very formal and tucked in.

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:06,340
There are 300 5-year-olds in the next room, bouncing off the walls and suddenly we drop the wall. Excellent.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,480
First of all those kids are going to run all around the room, squeezing in between the more sedate adults,

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,920
that will cause the adults to move apart a little, maybe even bumping in a wall now and again.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,840
But because the adults are moving more slowly, they'll get in the way of the kids running and slow them down some,

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,978
and that might even cause the kids to run
into the walls a little less often.

21
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,519
The most important thing here is that the
overall bouncing against walls,

22
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:32,340
will be equal to the bouncing of the adults plus the bouncing of the kids when they were in separate rooms.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,760
And you will not be shocked to find that we are currently in and amongst an elaborate analogy to do with gases.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:48,340
[Theme Music]

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,359
It shouldn't surprise you to learn that this
particular party was started by John Dalton,

26
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:56,019
the English teacher, the science teacher from
England.

27
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,149
He wasn't an English teacher, he was English,

28
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,368
who in 1803 was the first person to use real science to figure out what atoms are and how they behave.

29
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:08,580
His theory included a few misconceptions,
but it contained enough facts to be super useful.

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,480
Daltons's atomic theory began when he expanded French chemist's Joseph Louis Proust's Law of Definite Proportions,

31
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:18,199
to develop the Law of Multiple Proportions,

32
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,729
which says elements combine in simple, whole
number ratios of their masses.

33
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:27,609
But here's the cool part: That exact same
research also led to an important gas law.

34
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,780
Dalton studied gases basically by mixing them
together.

35
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,640
He was measuring how much of one element would
react with a given amount of another.

36
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,429
But as he mixed those gases he noticed something
else.

37
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,010
The total internal pressure of his container
was always equal to

38
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,679
the sum of the individual pressures of the
gases that he had added.

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,980
Upon recognizing that this happened every
single time no matter what gasses were used

40
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:54,340
or what amounts were added, Dalton stated
his discovery as the Law of Partial Pressures.

41
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,140
As long as the gases don't react chemically,
the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases

42
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,779
is equal to the sum of the pressures that the
individual gases would exert if they were alone.

43
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,759
Here's an example; scuba tanks often contain
a mixture of oxygen for breathing, obviously,

44
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,598
and helium which helps prevent decompression
sickness

45
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,238
because it's released from the blood more
readily than nitrogen in air.

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,140
That allows divers to return to the surface more quickly with less risk of gas bubbles forming in their blood.

47
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,699
We're going to use some approximations here so don't yell at me if you know exactly how big this tank is.

48
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:34,060
But we're gonna say that it's 10 liters, and we'll to say that it contains 4 moles of helium and 1.1 moles of oxygen gas.

49
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,860
The temperature in this room is about 22 degrees
Celsius or 295 Kelvin.

50
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,069
So what's the total pressure inside the tank?

51
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:45,619
In order to solve that we need to know the
pressure exerted by each gas individually,

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,780
and we can find that with the Ideal Gas Law.

53
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,860
Starting with the helium, we don't know the
pressure so we're solving for P.

54
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,900
The volume is 10 liters, and we have 4 moles
of helium.

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,159
R is always the same, and the temperature
is 295 K.

56
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:05,319
The calculations should show that the helium would have a pressure of 980 kilopascals, if it were alone.

57
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,019
Now for the oxygen, all the numbers are the same except for the moles which is 1.1 for the oxygen.

58
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,899
According to the calculations, the oxygen
alone would have a pressure of 270 kilopascals.

59
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,899
The Law of Partial Pressures says that the total pressure is equal to the sum of the individual pressures,

60
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:27,610
so in this case 980 plus 270 equals 1250 kilopascals,
or 1.25 megapascals.

61
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,240
Eaaasy peasy.

62
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,000
This additive property of pressures is closely related to the fact that mixing gases combines their particles,

63
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,430
thus increasing the total moles of gas present.

64
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,819
The ratio of moles of the individual gases in a mixture to the total number of moles is called the mole fraction.

65
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:47,120
And of course, mole fraction gets to have
its own little esoteric symbol to represent it,

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,379
the lower case Greek letter, chi.

67
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,558
Chi sub 1, the mole fraction of an individual gas
equals n sub 1, the number of moles of that gas,

68
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:58,789
divided by n sub total, the total number of
moles in the mixture.

69
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:03,098
And because the total number of moles is the
sum of the moles of all the gases,

70
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:06,668
we can also say that chi sub 1 equals the
moles of any one gas

71
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:10,348
divided by the sum of the moles of all the
individual gases.

72
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:14,608
You see how that last formula looks a lot
like the one for partial pressures?

73
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:17,219
That's because they're basically the same
thing.

74
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,120
Through the ideal gas law, the number of moles is directly related to the pressure of gas it exerts,

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,699
as long as the volume and temperature remain
constant.

76
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,418
So you may have figured this out already,

77
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,920
rather than having to calculate individual pressures first every time as we did with the scuba tank,

78
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,919
or calculate the individual moles in the opposite
situation,

79
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,438
we can often calculate what we need directly
from what we already know.

80
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:44,100
Let's give it a try. The air that we breathe is about 21% oxygen or 21 parts oxygen, and 100 parts air.

81
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,920
What is the partial pressure of O2 in air
at a total atmospheric pressure of 97.8 kPa?

82
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,740
We can substitute moles for parts and use
the mole fraction formula to solve this problem.

83
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,269
Plug in 21 moles of oxygen for the individual
gas and 100 moles for air for the total amount,

84
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:05,758
and then put in the total atmospheric pressure,
97.8 kPa and do the equation.

85
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,479
With correct rounding, that will give you
a partial pressure of 21 kilopascals for oxygen.

86
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,300
Sometimes however, gases mix together in ways
that aren't so predictable.

87
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:18,520
For instance, one way to collect a gas is
by bubbling it through a column of water to

88
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,799
trap the gas at the end of the column.

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,439
This is called collecting a gas over water.

90
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,270
The only problem is liquid water constantly
is giving off a small amount of water vapor.

91
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:32,949
That's why if you leave a glass on a desk for long enough, there will eventually be no water in it.

92
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,618
There's always going to be a few molecules
with enough kinetic energy to escape the liquid.

93
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:40,899
The amount of vapor that's released depends
on the temperature of the water.

94
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,838
The more heat energy it has, the more vapor
we get.

95
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:46,838
Like all gases, the water molecules move around
a lot,

96
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,219
sometimes bump into the sides of the container,
thus creating pressure.

97
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,179
This is called the water's vapor pressure.

98
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:56,079
The water molecules mix with the gas that
is being collected and when that happens,

99
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,168
as good ol' John Dalton taught us,

100
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:03,688
total pressure in the column equals the pressure of the collected gas plus the vapor pressure of the water.

101
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,599
So to know how much gas we really collected,

102
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,538
we have to subtract the vapor pressure of
the water from the total pressure.

103
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:16,240
This gives us the pressure exerted from the collected gas and from that, we can calculate the moles of gas present.

104
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,399
Here's how it's done.

105
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,879
Here I have a tub of water and a graduated cylinder that I have put into the water and then filled with water,

106
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,300
so now you can see, it's got no gas in it,
just water.

107
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,800
And we are going to capture gas in here and
see how much gas we can capture.

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Here I have a bottle and it's sealed with
this little tube.

109
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,759
This is the only way for gas to get out of
here and in here right now I have vinegar,

110
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,550
an aqueous solution of acetic acid.

111
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,420
This is baking soda; more properly sodium
hydrogen carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate.

112
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,080
I think we all know what will happen when
this comes in contact with vinegar.

113
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:56,479
Now to prevent that from happening before I want it to happen, I made it a little boat for it.

114
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,319
And the boat is theoretically, I hope, going
to sit on top of the level of the vinegar,

115
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:09,479
and float there without spilling.

116
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I did it.

117
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,859
Before the big action scene, let's talk about
what's actually happening chemically speaking

118
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,088
because as you know, I love to speak chemically.

119
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:25,279
The acetic acid and sodium bicarbonate combine to form sodium acetate, carbon dioxide and water.

120
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,579
The sodium acetate dissolves readily in water
and will stay that way.

121
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:32,219
The carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is
the source of all our fun.

122
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,659
It's a gas and it forms so many little bubbles
in the surrounding liquid

123
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:38,918
that it's almost a foam expanding quickly
and dramatically.

124
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,490
As the carbon dioxide escapes through the
foam,

125
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,589
it goes through the tubing and bubbles through the column of water so we get double the bubbles; double the fun.

126
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:52,109
And don't forget, at the end we will be able to calculate how many moles of CO2 are produced by this reaction.

127
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:53,100
Let's get to it.

128
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,100
It going to take more than two hands to do
this so I have a lab assistant with me today.

129
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,560
This is Michael Aranda.

130
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,839
All right Michael put the tube into the cylinder
there, and I get to do the fun part,

131
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,990
which is to shake this and make bubbles.

132
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:15,879
Bubbles!
Little more, little more.

133
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:30,000
So we have collected exactly, about 9, almost exactly 90 milliliters, like 90.5 milliliters of carbon dioxide.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,379
You can go away now.

135
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:38,179
We also know because I know that the atmospheric
pressure is 101.8 kilopascals.

136
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:42,919
Remember we also need to know what the vapor pressure of the water was that we have to subtract.

137
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,959
The amount of vapor pressure that the water
gives off depends on its temperature,

138
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,459
and there's a table we can look at.

139
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,559
The water is at 19 degrees Celsius.

140
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,909
According to the table, the vapor pressure
is 2.2 kilopascals.

141
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:56,838
So now finding the pressure of the carbon
dioxide alone is easy.

142
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:04,320
We simply subtract 2.2 kilopascals from 101.8 to give us a pressure of 99.6 kilopascals for the carbon dioxide.

143
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,720
Finally we have to make sure the pressure inside the graduated cylinder is the same as the atmospheric pressure

144
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,960
and to do that, we just have to make sure that the levels of both of the liquids are the same.

145
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,300
In doing that I can see that it is almost exactly 90 milliliters of carbon dioxide in the cylinder.

146
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:23,879
Now we plug everything into the Ideal Gas
Law.

147
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:30,389
P is 99.6 kilopascals, V is 0.090 liters,
n is what we are trying to find,

148
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:34,188
R is always the same, and the temperature
is 292 Kelvin.

149
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:40,259
One quick calculation and we find that we
have collected 0.0037 moles of CO2.

150
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:45,360
At a molar mass of 44 grams per mole that's
0.16 grams of carbon dioxide.

151
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,519
I am excited by our success here! That might
not sound like a lot,

152
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,419
but collecting a fairly substantial amount of gases and being able to make accurate measurements of them

153
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,809
with a simple apparatus like that is pretty
impressive.

154
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,929
For me, it sounds like time for party.

155
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:02,750
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

156
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,980
If you weren't late to the party, you learned
that John Dalton built both his theory of the atom

157
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,688
and his Law of Partial Pressures on the foundation
laid by Joseph Louis Proust

158
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:16,828
and that you can add up the pressures of mixed
gases just as you can do with their amounts.

159
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:20,219
You also learned that the chemical reaction
that occurs with vinegar and baking soda,

160
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,939
how to collect a gas over water,

161
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:26,078
and how to use that technique to figure out
exactly how much of the gas you have.

162
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:28,479
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi Gonzalez.

163
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,879
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino and
our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko Langner.

164
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:35,589
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

165
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:37,829
Our second camera operator was Henry Reich.

166
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:42,769
Our script supervisor and sound designer is
Michael Aranda. He was also our lab assistant.

167
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,849
