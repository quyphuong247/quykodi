1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,500
Molecules! So many of them in their infinite
and beautiful variety,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,108
but while that variety is great, it can also
be pretty dang overwhelming.

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:14,989
And so, in order to help this complicated chemical world make a little more sense, we classify and we categorize.

4
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:17,519
It's our nature as humans, and it's extremely
useful.

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,989
One of the most important of those classifications
is whether a molecule is polar or non-polar.

6
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,250
It's a kind of symmetry, not just of the molecule,
but of the charge.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,710
It's pretty easy to see when you're just lookin'
at 'em.

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,259
You got polar and non-polar, polar, non-polar,
polar, non-polar.

9
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:35,670
I'm gonna take sides right now.
I'm on team polar.

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,510
I think polar molecules are way more interesting,
despite their wonky, off-balance selves.

11
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:43,189
Non-polar molecules are useful, and their
symmetry has a kind of beauty,

12
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:45,989
but polar, in my humble opinion, is where
it's at.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:55,160
[Theme Music]

14
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,478
All right. Now here are two very different
types of chemicals.

15
00:00:58,478 --> 00:01:03,198
Right here I have a stick of butter, and then
in this bowl, that's just normal water.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,659
So I'm just gonna go ahead and squeeze this butter, which if you're wondering is both a terrible and wonderful feeling.

17
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:13,140
And then I'm going to [laughs] just drop that.

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,620
Now I'm going to attempt to wash that butter
off my hand.

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,200
But that is just not hap...
that's just, it's not going anywhere, ever.

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,900
Ever.
It's just beading up on me.

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,740
Why? Because water is a polar molecule, and the various chemicals that make up butter are non-polar,

22
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:33,439
and water wants nothing to do with that.

23
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,450
So. What makes a molecule polar?
Well, two things.

24
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,710
First, asymmetrical electron distribution
around the molecule.

25
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,029
You can't have a polar molecule made up entirely
of the same element

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,969
because those atoms will all have the same
electronegativity,

27
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:50,650
and thus the electron distribution will be
completely symmetrical.

28
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,910
Electronegativity is usually thought of as how much an element wants electrons around it,

29
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,810
but I think it's more about how much electrons
want to be near that element.

30
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,060
If electrons were 13-year-old girls, fluorine
would be Niall Horan.

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,670
They'll do anything just to be near it.
Why? Some simple periodic trends.

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,939
Electronegativity increases from left to right
because there are more protons in the atoms,

33
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,990
and more protons means more boys in the band.

34
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,050
Meanwhile, it decreases as you move from top
to bottom

35
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,180
because as the crowd of electrons gets bigger, they start to shield each other from the effects of the protons.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,719
What I'm trying to say is that electrons are
hipsters.

37
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,129
If a bunch of other electrons are into that
thing, they're less interested.

38
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:30,849
Now there are a number of other factors here,

39
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,039
but just like the relationship between tweens
and their latest boy band fixation,

40
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,049
it's complicated and weird and you probably
don't want to think too much about it.

41
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,380
But in this nice little map, you can see that
the trend is pretty clear.

42
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,740
The upper-right is where all the superstars
of electro-fame are.

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,240
Oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine are basically the One Direction of the periodic table.

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,719
So for polarity to occur in a molecule, you
have to have two different elements at a minimum,

45
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,699
and the difference between their electronegativities
has to be 0.5 or greater.

46
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:00,459
If that's the case, the outer electrons spend enough extra time around the element that's more electronegative

47
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,860
that chemists label the molecule polar.

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,400
The result is a partially negative charge
on the more electronegative part of the molecule

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,539
and a partially positive charge on the less
electronegative side.

50
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,598
Now in extreme cases, like if the electronegativity
is greater than 1.6,

51
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,019
then we end up with two ions in the same molecule.

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,159
This isn't what we're talking about here when
we talk about polar molecules.

53
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,409
We're talking about differences between 0.5
and 1.6.

54
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:26,129
Another requirement for polarity: you gotta
have geometrical asymmetry.

55
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:31,430
CO2 here has the charge asymmetry locked up,
but because the molecule is linear, in a straight

56
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,209
line, it's a kind of symmetrical asymmetry.

57
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,209
The same thing does for CH4 with its tetrahedron
of weakly electronegative hydrogens around

58
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,180
a more strongly electronegative carbon.

59
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,379
These molecules have polar bonds, but the
molecules themselves are not polar

60
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:49,318
because the symmetry of the bonds cancels
out the asymmetry of the charges.

61
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,549
In order for a molecule to be polar, there
has to be a dipole moment,

62
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,480
a separation of the charge around the molecule into a more positive area and a more negative area.

63
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,560
Lots of molecules are asymmetrical in both
electronegativity and geometry.

64
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:06,759
Those are our polar molecules, the asymmetrical
beauties of chemistry.

65
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,139
Look at 'em all! They're so quirky and weird!

66
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:12,878
We've also got a system for indicating where
their charges are.

67
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,939
We draw an arrow with a plus sign at the tail
pointing toward the negative side of the molecule.

68
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,500
A little lowercase delta plus (δ+) or delta
minus (δ–) by the individual atoms signify

69
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,120
a partial positive pr partial negative charge.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,530
Liquids made up of polar molecules are really
good at

71
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,709
dissolving solids that are composed of polar
or ionic compounds.

72
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,339
Ionic solids are basically just polarity taken
to the extreme,

73
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:38,060
so far that instead of having a partial positive
and partial negative dipole moment,

74
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,389
the electrons have completely transferred,
creating two charged ions.

75
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,180
Now I assume we've all heard that like dissolves
like,

76
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,620
so the easiest way to figure out if a liquid is polar or non-polar is just to dump it in some water.

77
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,959
But the why of this phenomenon is usually
just totally glossed over.

78
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,590
What's actually happening to those molecules?

79
00:04:55,589 --> 00:05:00,869
It seems like they're all just bigots, terrified
of anything a little bit different than themselves.

80
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,720
But this is chemistry, so there must be some
fundamental reason.

81
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,940
And if it's fundamental, it probably has something
to do with decreasing the energy of the system.

82
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,100
And indeed it does.

83
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,000
Those partial positive and partial negative
charges of water?

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,920
They're at their lowest energy state when
they're lining up together, positive to negative,

85
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,960
into a kind of liquid crystal.

86
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,120
There's an arrangement there.
It flows, of course,

87
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,840
but the oxygen sides are always doing their
best to orient themselves toward the hydrogen

88
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,029
sides of other molecules.

89
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,549
You can even see the effects of that attraction

90
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,639
as the surface tension that allows me to pour more than 100 milliliters of water into a 100 mil container.

91
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,919
The strength of that surface tension depends on the intermolecular forces that pull molecules of a liquid together.

92
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,759
These attractive, also called cohesive, forces
pull the surface molecules inward.

93
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:53,859
And what you see when you look at this pile
of water is the result of those cohesive forces,

94
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,460
minimized surface area in the water in this
beaker.

95
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,228
When you pit a bit of oil into that mix, the
water totally freaks out.

96
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:03,659
Oils have notoriously non-polar molecules,
so suddenly

97
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,560
there's this mass of uncharged gunk interfering with the nice, orderly arrangement of polar water molecules.

98
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,839
But if you take a closer look, the processes are very similar to those between water and air.

99
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:20,759
Water does everything it can to minimize its
surface area and kind of expels the oil droplets.

100
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,939
Rather than the water disliking the oil, it actually just likes itself much more, so it won't mix with the oil.

101
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,770
Now if you put polar stuff in, water is all
about that,

102
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:34,228
and those polar water molecules just go after
whatever other partial charges they can find.

103
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,629
Or, in the case of many ionic solids,

104
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,139
the partial negative charges on the oxygen
side all gang up on the positive ions,

105
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,910
while the partial positives on the hydrogen
side surround the negative ions,

106
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,080
breaking the crystals apart and dissolving
them into freely moving ions.

107
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,069
In some cases we can actually witness these
interactions in unexpected ways.

108
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:59,959
Mix 50 milliliters of water with 50 mils of alcohol and what the heck? There's less than 100 mils of liquid!

109
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,199
The arrangement of water mixed with alcohol is actually more structured, and thus more dense,

110
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,978
resulting in a smaller volume.

111
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:12,719
The polarity of water also results in a phenomenon
that makes life possible: hydrogen bonding.

112
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,160
The partially negative oxygen and positive
hydrogen atoms in a water molecule are not

113
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,479
100% faithful to each other.

114
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,020
They engage in additional kind of loose relationships with other neighboring hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

115
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,038
These loose, somewhat fleeting relationships
are called hydrogen bonds.

116
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,498
In ice, 100% of O and H atoms are involved
in hydrogen bonding.

117
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,220
The most energetically favorable spatial arrangement
of these bonds

118
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:40,758
actually pushes the water molecules apart
a bit,

119
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,550
resulting in the volume of ice being 10% larger
than the volume of water,

120
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,850
which is really weird for solids and liquids.

121
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,610
When ice melts, there are still about 80%
of Os and Hs engaged in hydrogen bonding,

122
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,288
creating ice-like clusters that keep the volume
of the cold water relatively high.

123
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:59,219
With rising temperatures, these clusters disappear,

124
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,700
while the volume of the truly liquid water rises resulting in a major characteristic of water:

125
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:07,759
having its highest density at 4 °C.

126
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,959
And yes, that's why ice floats on lakes in the winter and why the bottom of frozen lakes tends to be about 4 °C.

127
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,198
And also why hockey was invented. And why soda bottles explode when you leave them in the freezer.

128
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,978
But hydrogen bonds are also why taking a warm bath is so great, why steam engines changed the world,

129
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,020
and why temperatures on our planet are so constant when compared to other cosmic temperature fluctuations.

130
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:32,429
It takes a lot of energy to change the temperature
of water

131
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,979
because each little temperature change is associated with breaking or forming lots of hydrogen bonds,

132
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,599
and they absorb or give off a lot of heat.

133
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,800
In fact, the specific heat capacity of water
is about five times that of common rocks.

134
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,059
And amazingly, we haven't even finished talking about how powerfully useful these partial charges are.

135
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:54,119
They also allow water to dissolve pretty much
anything that's even partially non-polar,

136
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,570
which includes sugars, proteins, ions, and
tons of inorganic chemicals.

137
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:05,000
Water and its useful little dipole moment can dissolve more compounds than any other chemical on Earth.

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,100
Frankly, it's amazing that it doesn't dissolve
us from the inside out.

139
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,830
Which brings me to one last little polarity
tidbit, the hybrid molecule.

140
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,470
There are lots of different molecules, like
the surfactants in soap, for example, that

141
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,160
have both polar and non-polar areas.

142
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:25,319
Dish soap is thus able to dissolve the fatty parts of my butter catastrophe here, and then stick the polar sides out,

143
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,840
allowing the whole mess to get washed away
by Avogadro's numbers of polar water molecules

144
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,980
that I'm sticking on my hand right now.

145
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,230
Oh yeah.
That's better, but not...

146
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,360
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom to get
this all the way fixed up. So, be right back.

147
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,110
Likewise, the fatty acids that make up your
cell membranes have polar heads,

148
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,240
which keeps them interacting with the aqueous
environment of out bodies,

149
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,500
but non-polar tails, which prevent the cells from being just dissolved by the water around them.

150
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,240
Pretty dang elegant if you ask me.

151
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,259
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

152
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:58,139
If you were paying attention, you learned
that

153
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:03,129
a molecule needs to have both charge asymmetry
and geometric asymmetry to be non-polar,

154
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:08,439
that charge asymmetry is caused by a difference in electronegativities, and that I am totally team polar.
