1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,179
You and I began this journey a year ago when I introduced you to this spectacular method for understanding the world.

2
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:09,519
While physics explains the mechanics of the
universe,

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,660
and biology describes how life functions and
interacts with itself, chemistry lies between.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,759
In our next course we are excited to announce
that we're gonna to be exploring psychology,

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,720
the study of human mental functions and behavior.

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,059
Chemistry has brought us great insights into
even such complicated sciences as psychology,

7
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:30,329
like how neurotransmitters allow us to feel
anxiety, and hormones give us our desires.

8
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,420
But before we drill down into the level of
your brain and blood stream,

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,149
I want to close out this course with a talk
about chemistry on a global scale.

10
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:41,558
Certainly larger than your mind - though I'm
not sure it's more complicated!

11
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:44,518
It is complicated though.
And also terrifying.

12
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:46,850
Let's talk about a little thing called "Global
Warming"

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,109
and the spiking atmospheric CO2 concentrations
that are causing it.

14
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm sure you are aware.

15
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:53,699
But awareness isn't the same thing as understanding,

16
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,689
and if I had one final attempt to persuade
you that chemistry is important, which I do,

17
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:02,218
I'd tell you about the carbon cycle, which
is what I'm about to do.

18
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,939
Of all the chemistry that happens on this planet the carbon cycle is the thing that makes Earth "earthy",

19
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,438
unique among planets that we know and understand.

20
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,718
The early Earth's atmosphere was made up of
Ammonia, Methane, Nitrogen, and Carbon Dioxide

21
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:17,178
among some other things, but essentially there
was no free oxygen.

22
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,840
Many of these gasses, including CO2, are what
we call "Greenhouse Gases",

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,969
because they absorb heat energy thus increasing
the average temperature on earth.

24
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:27,569
When plants came along with their fancy photosynthesis,

25
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,449
they used up most of the carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere.

26
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,129
They used that carbon to make life, turning
carbon dioxide into a rare commodity,

27
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:39,718
while producing huge amounts of oxygen to
create a whole new atmosphere.

28
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:42,459
These changes served not only to open up the
earth's atmosphere,

29
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:45,839
allowing huge amounts of head to radiate back
into space,

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,820
they also created a huge reservoir of highly energetic organic forms of carbon that are used as fuel by living things.

31
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,159
Including us.

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,459
Organic carbon, or in the language of chemists "reduced carbon", is natures equivalent of a battery.

33
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,500
Organisms can draw power by feeding on organic
carbon compounds

34
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,989
and then oxidizing the reduced carbon back
to carbon dioxide.

35
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:12,379
Lots of organisms are good at this. No organisms are as good at this as we have become.

36
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,840
Carbon's role in the biology and physics of
our planet is unparalleled.

37
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,729
It's the main route for the transfer of energy
between organisms,

38
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:23,629
and it's the main way that we trap heat in
our atmosphere,

39
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,650
and that's why when we talk about global warming
we talk about carbon:

40
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,840
carbon footprints, carbon credits, carbon
loading.

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,920
So, let's wrap up our study of the chemical universe by going not all the way back to square 1, but square 6...

42
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,959
on the periodic table! That's right we have
a periodic table designed by Thought CafÃ©.

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,719
It's a beautiful Crash Course: Chemistry period
table, it's quite large, and you want it,

44
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,300
and it's available for $15 at dftba.com

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:54,800
[Theme Music]

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Since carbon is the stuff of life, one of the best ways of understanding the carbon cycle is

47
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,879
just a whole bunch of things living and dying,
and in the process swapping carbon.

48
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,199
Here's the 30 second version:

49
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,419
Plants use the carbon in the atmospheric CO2 to make sugars and other carbohydrates to grow and reproduce.

50
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:12,599
Lots of those plants end up being eaten by
other organisms supplying them with the building

51
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,410
blocks for other biological molecules and
fuel.

52
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:19,219
After being metabolized the carbon returns to the environment in one of several different ways,

53
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:21,739
ending up in the air, water, or the earth
itself.

54
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,129
From that point it's released naturally or
is extracted by humans;

55
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,859
in either case returning carbon dioxide to
the atmosphere and it starts all over again.

56
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,680
So let's talk about those green plants and
what is is exactly that they do.

57
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,510
Photosynthesis is an extremely complex process,

58
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:38,759
and it can happen in a couple of different
ways, depending on the organism.

59
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,819
But the main point is to take in carbon dioxide
from the environment

60
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,689
and use a process called carbon fixation to
convert it to organic compounds such as sugars.

61
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:51,079
It's called fixation because it takes carbon
in the form of a gas, carbon dioxide,

62
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,550
and solidifies it into solid carbon compounds.
A general reaction looks like this.

63
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,840
Note that CH2O isn't actually a thing, it's a reduced formula that stands for a simple carbohydrate;

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,520
a compound that's composed of carbon, and hydrogen, and oxygen at a ratio of 1 to 2 to 1.

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,280
In real life there are all kinds of carbohydrates
and they're usually a lot larger,

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,159
but chemists use this streamlined version
to illustrate the basic reaction.

67
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,219
And the reaction is basically the same with
any hydrocarbon,

68
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,519
but you've probably seen it written most often
with glucose.

69
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,979
In this form we say that 6 moles of carbon dioxide plus 6 moles of water plus some light energy

70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,780
yields a mole of glucose plus 6 moles of oxygen.

71
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,279
Either way you might have noticed something
important: this is a redox reaction!

72
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,319
Carbon is reduced, going from an oxidation
number of plus 4 to 0,

73
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,339
and oxygen goes from negative 2 to 0, meaning
that oxygen is oxidized. It can happen!

74
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:46,539
And the carbohydrates produced by these carbon fixation reactions are the most sought after currency among earths living things.

75
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,100
Because organisms can use them in 2 different
ways: as building material, and as fuel.

76
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,060
Some carbohydrates go through additional reactions
to become even more complex,

77
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,519
like starches, fats, proteins, nucleic acids,
and all the other stuff that makes up living things.

78
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,740
Meanwhile other carbohydrates, the ones that
are used to produce energy,

79
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,029
go through a process called cellular respiration.

80
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:09,339
Like carbon fixation, respiration is an extremely
complex cluster bomb of reactions,

81
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,810
so we typically condense it too down to a
fairly simple reaction.

82
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,339
The overall reaction for respiration is essentially
the reverse of carbon fixation.

83
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,899
A carbohydrate and some oxygen react to produce
carbon dioxide, water, and energy.

84
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:25,979
Again, this is most commonly written with
glucose, so we'll do that here too.

85
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,580
And like carbon fixation it's also a redox
reaction.

86
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:34,599
In this case the oxygen is reduced from an oxidation number of 0 to -2, and the carbon is oxidized from 0 to +4.

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,460
That's right, the cells of living things re-oxidize the reduced carbon and re-reduce the oxidized oxygen

88
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,370
to produce all the energy that keeps living
things alive.

89
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,649
But despite the fact that these two reactions
look like the exact opposites of each other,

90
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:50,959
even down to the changes in their oxidation numbers, it's important to remember that they're just summaries.

91
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,779
The overall processes actually include lots of steps that are completely different from each other.

92
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,939
Now after organisms metabolize carbohydrates the carbon can be re-released back into the world in several ways.

93
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,909
For one thing lots of carbon dioxide is released
as a direct product of cellular respiration:

94
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,830
for you and me that happens mostly when we
exhale,

95
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:11,079
and that carbon dioxide can be recycled immediately
by photosynthesizers.

96
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,939
For organisms that live in water the carbon that they release largely ends up dissolved in that water,

97
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:20,180
and oceans and other surface water can also dissolve carbon dioxide directly from the air.

98
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:24,399
No matter how it gets there, carbon dioxide
reacts with water to form carbonic acid;

99
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,000
a weak acid that dissociates into hydrogen
and bicarbonate ions.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,560
The hydrogen ions can react with various rocks and other substances in fairly typical neutralization reactions.

101
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,620
This results in weathering which, besides melting the faces off of statues, produces stuff that forms clays.

102
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,680
But the carbonate ions have a whole bunch
of functions,

103
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,699
especially in marine animals, which use them to build their shells and skeletons in the form of calcium carbonate.

104
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:52,399
The carbon remains trapped there until those
animals die and their structures break down,

105
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,448
which happens on huge, very slow, geologic
time scales.

106
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,960
And if the conditions are just right like in the super high pressures and temperatures in the earth's crust,

107
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,839
large deposits of calcium carbonate can eventually
form rocks like limestone.

108
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,349
And before you start thinking rock equals
boring,

109
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,430
you should know that about 80% of all the
carbon on the planet is locked up this way,

110
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,509
as inorganic carbonates in the earths crust
and mantle or lithosphere.

111
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,279
Most of the remaining 20% is spread throughout the lithosphere too, as organic carbon from buried organic matter.

112
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:26,739
So, those pools of carbonate everyone's so obsessed with, those fossil fuels that we use to power all the things?

113
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,699
They account for only 0.006% of all the carbon
on earth.

114
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,079
Those carbon deposits got there from the dead
bodies of other organisms,

115
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,399
like plants that managed not to be eaten or
have their carbon released some other way.

116
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:45,259
Hence the name fossil fuels - the dead things that you know today as coal, petroleum, and natural gas.

117
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:48,079
The general chemical reaction for the combustion
of those fuels is

118
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,899
just a hydrocarbon reacting with molecular
oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water vapour.

119
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:57,939
For example each mole of methane, the simplest hydrocarbon, reacts to form 1 mole of carbon dioxide.

120
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:04,279
And of course this too is a redox reaction, where carbon is oxidized all the way from -4 to +4,

121
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,819
and oxygen is reduced from 0 to -2.

122
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,000
Combustion is an extremely common reaction
type.

123
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,269
The only change that occurs from one example
to the next is the hydrocarbon,

124
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:16,930
and obviously as larger more complex hydrocarbons are used the CO2 production per mole of fuel increases.

125
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,500
What about gasoline for example?

126
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,839
The combustion of octane, a main ingredient of gasoline, produces 8 moles of carbon dioxide for every 1 mole of fuel used.

127
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,150
A mole of octane is only about 0.15 liters
or 0.041 gallons,

128
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:35,819
but those 8 moles of CO2 take up nearly 180
liters of space at standard pressure and temperature.

129
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,099
This carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere where it re-enters the carbon cycle.

130
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,779
The problem with all this is that the environment can only really re-absorb about 40% of the 30 million tons,

131
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:48,429
or giga-tons, that humans produce annually,

132
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:53,778
so we have a surplus of about 18 giga-tons
of CO2 every single year,

133
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:57,179
and that number goes up every single year.

134
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:02,399
The excess remains in the atmosphere trapping
the sun's heat causing temperatures to rise.

135
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,679
And yes, there are other greenhouse gases too; methane, ozone, even water vapor, to name a few,

136
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,500
but none of these are increasing in abundance
at nearly the rate that carbon dioxide is.

137
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,360
The good news is that now you understand the
problem better than you did 10 minutes ago,

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,639
and understanding about situations in the
first step to making it better.

139
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,519
That goes for all situations really, not
just chemistry ones,

140
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,480
so continue to pay attention to what's happening
in the world around you,

141
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,019
keep learning science,
and never stop caring.

142
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:29,699
And thank you for the difference you have made by watching this episode of Crash Course: Chemistry,

143
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,600
and this entire Crash Course: Chemistry course,
which I hope you watched.

144
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,089
In this episode you learned that the carbon
cycle includes carbon fixation,

145
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:42,860
both cellular and macroscopic respiration in living things, and deposition in limestone and fossil fuels,

146
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:47,249
and that many of the chemical reactions involved
in the carbon cycle are redox reactions.

147
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:49,860
And finally, you learned, from the chemistry
perspective,

148
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,199
exactly why the excessive burning of fossil
fuels harms the environment.

149
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:56,109
And I'd especially like to thank all of our
Subbable subscribers,

150
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,300
without whom we would literally not be able
to do this.

Would you like a personally signed giant Crash
Course periodic table?
