1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,928
Humans, like chemicals, are really all about
bonds.

2
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:04,580
Think about all the relationships in your
life.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,320
You're a casual acquaintance to some people,
a colleague or friend to others,

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,708
and maybe more to that someone special.

5
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,669
Maybe you're dating someone casually, or you're
in a committed relationship, or you're married.

6
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:16,240
There are all kinds of different combinations
of people out there.

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,559
And sometimes, you know, people fall for a
vampire or a werewolf. Who am I to judge?

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,099
Fact is, each type of relationship requires
different things from you and the other person,

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,800
but if you play your cards right, these relationships
allow you to relax

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,250
and escape the stresses that come with the
constant search for affection.

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,189
Distance is important in relationships too,
of course;

12
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,549
too much distance makes it hard to stay focused on each other and requires a lot of effort to keep things together,

13
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:44,289
and I may not have to tell you, too little
distance can be a problem as well.

14
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:45,979
Everyone needs their space, and when you don't
have any,

15
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,469
you just end up pushing away from whatever's
crowding you.

16
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,509
In this way, atoms are a lot like us.

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:54,789
We call their relationships bonds, just like
we do with our own relationships.

18
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,500
And there are many different types.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,469
Each kind of atomic relationship requires
a different type of energy,

20
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:04,000
but they all do best when they settle into
the lowest-stress situation possible.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,579
The nature of the bond between atoms is related
to the distance between them, and, like people

22
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,900
(and vampires and werewolves, I suppose),
it also depends on how positive or negative they are.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,020
The difference is that, unlike human relationships,

24
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,459
we can analyze exactly what makes different
kinds of chemical relationships work.

25
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,048
And that's what this episode is all about.

26
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:28,868
But, people, please remember that we here at Crash Course do not dispense relationship advice.

27
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:38,188
[Theme Music]

28
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:41,728
First things first, why do atoms do this at
all?

29
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:47,168
Well, like everything else in the universe, atoms do whatever they can to reduce their overall energy,

30
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:52,628
and they reach their lowest energy by achieving a balance between attractive and repulsive forces,

31
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,219
being neither too clingy nor too aloof.

32
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:00,620
So when two atoms approach each other, the electrons of each are attracted to the protons of the other.

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,118
This is the electrostatic force.

34
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,378
Like charges repel, opposites attract, like
in real life, or at least Paula Abdul songs.

35
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,879
I know, I'm old.

36
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,579
So when one atom is attracted to another,

37
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,450
just like Edward Cullen and Bella in chemistry
class, to use a slightly more timely reference,

38
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:21,359
it gets stressed out by the attractive force and tries to relieve the stress by getting closer.

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,640
We've all been there, right? That hot, nerdy
vampire girl in your chemistry class?

40
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,919
It's just, it's intense.

41
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:32,559
The pull is so strong that the stress level or energy rises when the two are separated, so they stay close.

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,598
But sometimes, they can get a little too close.

43
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:38,060
When that happens, the nuclei repel each other
because of their like charges,

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,860
and the energy between them rapidly increases
and they both back off,

45
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,930
just enough to find that perfect little distance
between them, and everyone relaxes.

46
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,069
This ideal, wonderful distance is the bond
length.

47
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,089
It's the distance between two nuclei at the
point of minimum energy.

48
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,140
In other words, where the attractive and repulsive
forces cancel each other out.

49
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,219
The distance at which these two atoms of chlorine
reach their minimum energy,

50
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,949
caught between the attraction of the electrons,
the nucleus,

51
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,829
and the protons repelling the nuclei, is the
bond length.

52
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,840
That energy minimum, which we know absolutely
is â€“239 kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol),

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,259
occurs when the distance between the atoms
is 0.00199 nanometers (nm).

54
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:19,000
That distance is the bond length of Cl2, chlorine
gas.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,348
Now because the electrons are attracted to
both nuclei in the molecule,

56
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:25,949
they actually spend the majority of their
time in the space between them.

57
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,549
This is often described as sharing electrons,
and we call this kind of bond a covalent bond.

58
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,629
But not all sharing is equal.
I should know: I have an older brother.

59
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:38,169
The strength with which an atom holds shared
electrons is called its electronegativity.

60
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:43,869
The electronegativities of various elements are all super well known and waiting for you in tables on the Internet.

61
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:50,050
If two atoms in a bond have very different
electronegativities, like, say,
hydrogen at 2.1 and oxygen at 3.5,

62
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,040
the electrons are more attracted to the atom
with the higher electronegativity.

63
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,239
The difference is so great that the electrons spend most of their time around the stronger atom

64
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,430
and much less time around the other one.

65
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,069
Like how all the neighborhood kids wanted
to hang out with John, my older brother,

66
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,609
because he was more charismatic.

67
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,750
When the electrons hang out closer to one
side of the bond,

68
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,830
it creates a slight negative charge in that area and a slight positive charge around the other atom.

69
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,139
This separation of charges is called polarity, and it's the polarity of the molecule that these atoms form, H2O,

70
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,769
that makes water the most important molecule
on Earth.

71
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:26,198
Covalent bonds like this, where electrons
are attracted to one atom more than the other,

72
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,169
causing a separation of charges, are called
polar covalent bonds.

73
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,859
But when a covalent bond forms between two
identical atoms,

74
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,218
like the two chlorine atoms in our graph earlier,
the electrons are distributed evenly.

75
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:39,248
We call this a non-polar covalent bond.

76
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:42,710
But you've also gotta consider the middle
option, where atoms aren't identical,

77
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:49,789
but have very similar electronegativities, like hydrogen, with an electronegativity of 2.1, and sulfur, at 2.5.

78
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,778
The difference here is so tiny that the electrons
are pretty much still evenly distributed,

79
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:57,430
and we call that a non-polar covalent bond
as well.

80
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,369
There's a huge world of important chemicals
that have these kinds of bonds.

81
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:03,860
So many, in fact, that we will dedicate a
couple of separate episodes to them.

82
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,830
Covalent bonds tend to form from non-metals
and sometimes metalloids,

83
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:09,968
those elements that have both metallic and
non-metallic characteristics.

84
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:12,689
That's because most of them hold their electrons
so tightly

85
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:17,099
that they're more likely to share them with
another atom than to gain or lose them altogether.

86
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:20,098
Metals, on the other hand, have loosely-held
outer electron shells,

87
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:23,430
so they're constantly dropping electrons and
becoming positive ions.

88
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,750
And when positive ions come across negative ions, like those formed from halogens, for instance,

89
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,240
you have to know what's gonna happen.

90
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,680
They are attracted to each other, which means
energy is required to keep them apart,

91
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,400
which means that they're gonna bond if they can, creating that oh-so-wonderful point of minimum energy.

92
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:43,239
This type of bond is unsurprisingly called an ionic bond, a bond formed between a positive ion and a negative ion.

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,639
Because the ions are formed when one atom
loses electrons and the other gains them,

94
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,300
we often say that an ionic bond is formed by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another.

95
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,399
And we can calculate the amount of energy
that exists in a bond between ions at a given

96
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,019
distance using a formula called Coulomb's
law.

97
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:03,339
Note that this only works for ionic bonds because the calculation requires the charges of the ions,

98
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,239
which covalent bonds don't have.

99
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:09,249
Coulomb's law says that the energy been two
ions equals the product of the two charges,

100
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:12,520
which are represented by capital Qs, because
why not,

101
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,769
divided by the distance, or radius, between
the two nuclei,

102
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:21,628
all multiplied by a constant, 2.31 Ã— 10â€“19
joules per nanometer (Jâ€¢nm).

103
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,060
Of course, the radius also has to be expressed in nanometers â€” you gotta make the units match.

104
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,559
Let's see how it works with something simple:
sodium chloride, or table salt.

105
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,680
We know that the normal charge on a sodium ion is +1 and the normal charge on chloride is -1.

106
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,519
These are Q1 and Q2.

107
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:41,248
The length of a stable NaCl bond is 0.276
nm, so we put that in for the radius,

108
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:47,800
and finally a quick calculation tells us that
the bond contains â€“8.37 Ã— 10â€“19 J of energy.

109
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,980
Remember, that negative number represents a decrease in the energy of the system due to an attractive force,

110
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,119
which certainly makes sense here.

111
00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:00,240
Sodium and chloride ions are strongly attracted
to each other due to their opposite charges.

112
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Of course, you may have noticed that â€“8.37
Ã— 10â€“19 J looks like a tiny, tiny number,

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,689
but keep in mind we're talking about one single
pair of ions.

114
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:14,490
The â€“239 kJ that we got for chlorine? That
was for a whole mole of molecules.

115
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,658
When multiplied by the 10^17 or so ions in
a single grain of table salt

116
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:23,718
and then by the thousands of grains of salt
in a mole, the energy becomes much more significant.

117
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:26,389
The NaCl bond is, in fact, quite strong.

118
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,038
And because they are formed by a positive
ion and a negative ion,

119
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,748
two charges completely separated between two
different particles,

120
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:37,459
ionic bonds are extremely polar, way more
polar than polar covalent bonds.

121
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:40,009
And so those are our three types of bonds:

122
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:44,939
non-polar covalent, formed by the equal or
nearly equal sharing of two electrons between

123
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,039
non-metal or metalloid atoms;

124
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,728
polar covalent, formed by the uneven sharing
of electrons between two non-metals or metalloids;

125
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:55,508
and ionic, formed by the transfer of electrons
from a metal to a non-metal.

126
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,800
It's important to remember, though, that there aren't only three designations for chemical bonds.

127
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Just like human relationships, bonds don't
always have really well-defined boundaries.

128
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,739
Everything is a continuum. Labels are useful,
but they can only take us so far.

129
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,220
There are, however, certain properties that each kind of bond tends to have that you should know.

130
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,800
For instance, ionic compounds are often crystalline
in their solid form because of the way the

131
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:20,029
ions pack together, like salt is.

132
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:24,019
They're generally soluble in water because
the two ions interact separately with the

133
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,109
positively and negatively charged areas on
a water molecule.

134
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,468
And once they're separated or dissolved, the
ions allow the solution to conduct electricity.

135
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:36,879
Covalent compounds, on the other hand, tend to be softer solids, liquids, or gases like Cl2 is at room temperature.

136
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,740
They're often not soluble in water, and even when they are, the solutions don't conduct electricity.

137
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,099
The differences in these properties stem mostly
from the differences in their polarities.

138
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,779
So yeah, polarity is crazy important. So important that we'll be doing a whole episode on it soon.

139
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,000
Until then, I want to thank you for the bond
that you have to Crash Course Chemistry,

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,669
whether it's casual observer, faithful viewer,
or committed subscriber.

141
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,360
Today, if you were paying attention,

142
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,080
you learned that chemical bonds form in order to minimize the energy between two atoms or ions.

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,120
You've also learned that the chemical bonds
may be covalent if the atoms share electrons,

144
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,110
and that covalent bonds can share those electrons
evenly or unevenly.

145
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,870
Bonds can also be ionic if the electrons are
transferred,

146
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,100
and you learned how to calculate the energy transferred in an ionic bond using Coulomb's law.

147
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,860
