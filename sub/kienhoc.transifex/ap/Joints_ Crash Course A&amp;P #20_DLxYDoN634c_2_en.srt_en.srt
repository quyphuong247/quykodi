1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,379
I am so glad that you guys are not five years
old!

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:06,679
If you were all in, like, kindergarten, the
only way I could teach you about your skeletal

3
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:09,009
system would be to sing you that stupid song.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,138
You know, “The toe bone’s connected to
the foot bone, the foot bone’s connected

5
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:16,018
to the ankle bone...the ankle bone’s connected
to the leg bone.”

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,980
Like apparently there’s one leg bone.

7
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:21,650
For the purposes of teaching college-level
anatomy and physiology, let’s just say that

8
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,269
that song is … reductive.

9
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:24,660
Insufficient.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,320
For that song to be at all useful for remembering
all 206 bones that make up your skeletal structure,

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,808
it would have to begin with something like:
“The distal phalanx is connected to the

12
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:38,500
middle phalanx …” and then end with something
like: “the frontal bone meets the parietal

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,049
bone along the coronal suture.”

14
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,589
And it would probably take like two and a
half hours to sing the whole thing.

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,770
But there is way more to know about your skeletal
system than just the names of the bones. In

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,380
addition to bones, there’s cartilage and fibrous
connective tissue that allows them to work together.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,540
And maybe more importantly, if you’re going
to gonna talk about the physiology of your

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,479
skeleton, you have to talk about joints.

19
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,959
Joints are the meeting places between two or
more bones -- and even though it might not

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,920
sound mathematically possible, you actually have
more joints in your body than you have bones.

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
In a lot of places -- like your hands and
feet -- each individual bone is part of more

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,620
than one or two joints.

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,439
And then there’s the matter of what all
that bone, cartilage, connective tissue -- and

24
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,018
the joints that they form -- actually work
together to do.

25
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,920
And that is … move.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,299
Body movements happen when muscles contract
across joints, moving one bone toward another.

27
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,079
And studying the different types of movements
your body is capable of, is not only pretty

28
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,539
fun, it’s also one of the best practical
ways to understand your bones and joints.

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,780
If you ask me, all of that is infinitely more
interesting than memorizing what goes where

30
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:37,569
and pretending like a “backbone” is really
an anatomical structure.

31
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:39,299
So. Aren’t you glad you’re a grown-up?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,640
Dont worry, it’s not anyone you knew. It’s plastic, and
it’s a little bit smaller than the average adult skeleton.

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,978
But -- other than having me stand in front
of a giant x-ray machine for 10 straight minutes

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,099
-- I can’t think of a better way to walk you through
the major anatomical structures of your skeleton.

35
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:06,899
Now, if you managed to retain our introduction
to human bones last week, you’ll recall

36
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,139
that anatomists typically divide the skeleton
into two major parts: the axial and the appendicular.

37
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:18,479
The axial structure includes all 80 midline bones that
form your skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage.

38
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,639
Starting at the top here, your skull’s eight
cranial and fourteen facial bones form your

39
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,729
body’s most complex bony structure, coming
together to do some pretty great things, like

40
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,829
protect your brain, help you see, smell, hear,
eat, and you know, have a face.

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,660
The 33 irregular bones in your vertebral column
start with your atlas vertebra -- the one that holds

42
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:40,680
up your skull, and is named for the Greek god Atlas,
who held the world on his shoulders as a punishment.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,520
I’m not saying you’ve got a huge head or anything.
I’m just saying that’s what it’s called.

44
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,939
The vertebrae run down from your skull to
your pelvis, providing the central support

45
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:50,869
for your upper body and completing the enormously
important job of protecting your spinal cord

46
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,569
-- the main communication line between nearly
all of your body, and your brain.

47
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,799
Most of your vital organs are protected by
the 12 pairs of ribs and dagger-like sternum

48
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,039
that together comprise your thoracic cage,
which also provides attachment points for

49
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,560
your back, chest, shoulder, and neck muscles.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,060
Now, the appendicular skeleton includes your
upper and lower limb appendages and pectoral

51
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,819
and pelvic girdles that attach to the axial
skeleton at the shoulder and the thigh.

52
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,650
And even though your arms and legs clearly
serve different functions -- unless you spend

53
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,599
a lot of time walking around on your hands
or picking stuff up with your feet -- both

54
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,250
sets of limbs share a similar set-up.

55
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,789
They’re each composed of three major segments
-- a common arrangement we see in loads of

56
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:30,719
animals all the way back to fish, which anatomists
refer to as “one bone, two bones, lots of

57
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,069
bones and digits.”

58
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,469
We can’t all be Dr. Seuss.

59
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:36,830
And that’s just about enough anatomy for
this plastic skeleton to pay for itself. I’d

60
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,700
rather focus on the physiology of the skeleton, and
in order to do that, we’ve got to talk about joints.

61
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,459
As is often the case in anatomy, we classify
joints both by what they’re made of, and by

62
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,219
what they do. Because form follows function, we can't
really talk about one without talking about the other.

63
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,930
So, the structural classification of your
bones is all about what kind of material binds

64
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,319
those bones together -- like, is it a fibrous tissue
or cartilage, or a special fluid-filled joint cavity.

65
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,049
But the functional classification focuses
on how much that joint can move.

66
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,930
So, for example, you have joints in your body
that don’t move at all. These include, say, the

67
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,620
joints between the bones that make up your cranium.
These non-moving joints are called synarthroses.

68
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,100
But you also have joints that move only slightly,
like the spot where your two pubic bones meet

69
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,529
to form your pelvis. That joint exists mainly
to absorb shock from walking and running,

70
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,709
but it also has proven very handy during things
like childbirth. These partly-moving joints

71
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:26,029
are called amphiarthroses.

72
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:30,149
Finally, there are the diarthroses, which
are fully movable, like your classic knee

73
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:32,750
and elbow joints. They’re mostly found in
your limbs.

74
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,149
But if you eventually find yourself in the
business of examining and treating people’s

75
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:39,739
joints -- and there are a lot of doctors who
do -- then it’ll be especially useful to

76
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,689
know the structural classifications.

77
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:45,990
Structurally speaking, you’ve got fibrous,
cartilaginous, and synovial joints.

78
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,379
Fibrous joints connect bones with dense fibrous
connective tissue, and are mostly immovable

79
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:52,600
-- like those sutures between your skull bones.

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,420
As you might guess, your cartilaginous joints
unite bones using cartilage, and are similar

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,530
to their fibrous brethren in that they don’t
move very much, and they lack a joint cavity.

82
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:04,379
But the family of joints that make all the
sports, and the entire art of breakdancing,

83
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,009
and yoga possible, are the freely movable
synovial joints.

84
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,709
Most joints in your body fall into this category.

85
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,989
Although they do make use of cartilage and
fibrous connective tissues like ligaments,

86
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,639
they’re different in that the bones they join
are separated by a fluid-filled joint cavity.

87
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,960
The cool thing about these cavities is that
they contain a bit of viscous, egg-white-like

88
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,180
synovial fluid that acts like grease on a
hinge.

89
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,418
Without that lubricant, just running down
the street could cause enough friction not

90
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:33,019
only to wear out your joint surfaces, but
actually overheat your joints enough to essentially

91
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:38,060
cook the surrounding tissue and leave your legs
smoking like a desperate Looney Tunes character.

92
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,079
These freely moveable synovial joints come
in six different configurations that together

93
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,839
allow pretty much any movement your body can make,
from a subtle head nod to a vigorous jumping jack.

94
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,668
All of which you will find in action at your
typical dance party.

95
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:54,399
Seriously, though, dance parties are an excellent
place to study skeletal physiology.

96
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,418
I mean let’s just take this from my perspective:
I’m at my high school prom. I’m wearing

97
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:02,798
a tux that is really uncomfortable and I’m feeling
kind of shy, standing on the edge of the crowd.

98
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,280
Maybe I want to test the waters out a little
bit with like a little hand dancing. Just

99
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:10,479
the hand going. Waving my hand from side to
side -- it’s a type of gliding movement,

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,980
one that occurs when one flat bone surface
glides over another.

101
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,120
All these motions use gliding, or plane joints,
like the one between the distal ends of your

102
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,399
radius and ulna, and the carpal bones of your
wrist.

103
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,019
But say after a while I feel like these gliding
movements just aren’t enough to fully express

104
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,740
myself. I have to enlist the more versatile
angular movements.

105
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,699
These are the types of motion that either
increase or decrease the angle between two

106
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,430
bones across any plane in the body, like if
I bob my head, or kick my leg up, or raise

107
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,668
the roof. If people still do that.

108
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:43,430
If that bending motion decreases the angle
of the joint and brings those bones together,

109
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,918
like when I bend my arm together, that movement
is called flexion.

110
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,089
When I bend it back, I’m increasing that
angle, and it’s called extension.

111
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:53,138
And if I continue that motion beyond my normal
anatomical positioning, and it’s somewhat

112
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,199
dangerous, that is called hyperextension.

113
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,090
These motions enlist the hinge joints. Similarly,
my oval-shaped condylar knuckle joints allow

114
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,698
my fingers to bend and ball up for a good
fist pump.

115
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,259
Now I’m getting super into it. I might like
raise my arms up over my head. Well, the act

116
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,300
of raising my arms away from my body is called
abduction, while moving them back down toward

117
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,060
the body is called adduction.

118
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,240
And this here, like, lasso movement? That’s
circumduction -- a combination of all five

119
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,360
of those movements that allow the forearm to move
in a circle while the elbow joint stays relatively stable.

120
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,379
Which really makes you wanna give credit to
those cowboys.

121
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,500
Now if you want to get really serious about
that lassoing and expand it enough to include

122
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,180
the entire arm, the move eventually will morph
from an angular movement to a rotational one

123
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,439
-- a motion that turns the bone around its
axis, in this case, the humerus.

124
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,579
Hip and shoulder joints use a ball-and-socket
design that allow rotational movement, but

125
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:44,000
the more flexible a joint is, the more unstable
and fragile it is -- which is one reason why

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,759
you see so many dislocated shoulders and hip
replacements.

127
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,719
And it’s worth pointing out that some movements
are just special and unique and weird, and

128
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:55,478
only occur in a few select joints -- especially
in your hands, feet, and jaw.

129
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:58,870
For example, your ability to touch your thumb
to your fingertips or give a thumbs up is

130
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,980
thanks to opposition movement, facilitated by your
saddle joint, which makes your thumbs opposable.

131
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,819
The pivot joint between your radius and ulna
allow you to rotate your palm forward or anteriorly

132
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:14,000
in a motion called supination, and turning
it backward or posteriorly is called pronation.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,480
So that’s what I like to think is the more grown-up
approach to teaching you about your skeleton.

134
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,120
It did not involve any singing, but yes, a
little dancing.

135
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,780
And it was worth it, because you learned about
the basic structure of your skeletal system,

136
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,919
including the arrangements of both the axial
and the appendicular skeleton. And we went

137
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,720
over the structural and functional classifications
of your joints, along with the major types

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,740
of movement that they make possible.
