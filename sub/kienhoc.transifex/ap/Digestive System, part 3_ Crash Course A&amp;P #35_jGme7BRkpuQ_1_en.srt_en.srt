1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,339
You know, we’ve been talking about a lot
of serious stuff here lately.

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:07,700
Heart failure. Respiratory gas exchange. People
with holes in their stomachs.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,720
Nachos.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,350
Some might say I’ve even been flaunting
my ability to eat, digest, and enjoy a plate

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,039
of chips and melted cheese.

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,698
And I wouldn't blame them if they did, because
sadly, nachos aren’t for everyone.

7
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:24,109
In fact, I can safely say nachos are really
only a good idea for about a third of humans.

8
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:29,599
For the rest, what may start as a party in
your mouth will surely end in gastric distress.

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,429
Such is the fate of the lactose intolerant.

10
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:37,070
Lactose is basically milk-sugar that can only
be digested with the help of a special intestinal

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,810
enzyme -- lactase -- which many adults do
not produce enough of.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,260
In fact, way back in the day, none of us did,
until about 7500 years ago, when a particularly

13
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,089
handy genetic mutation popped up in central
Europe.

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,980
This so-called lactase persistence trait probably
spread as Neolithic groups trekked north and

15
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:58,339
west through Europe. Today nearly 90 percent
of adult Britons and Scandinavians can chug

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,320
all the milk they want, whereas down toward
the Mediterranean, probably less than 40 percent

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,049
have lactase persistence, and fewer than ten
percent in Africa and Asia.

18
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,219
Now technically, a lactose intolerant person
can still consume dairy at their own risk,

19
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:14,089
but since their own bodies can’t break down
lactose, the job is left to the three-pound

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,889
bacteria farm living in their large intestines
-- bacteria that try their hardest to make

21
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:23,929
something of those milk sugars, the results
of which are gas, and bloating, and diarrhea.

22
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:28,179
So, it turns out, nachos aren’t just a good
way to talk about how the digestive system

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,660
works, they’re also a good way to talk about
when it doesn’t.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,359
Remember how the stomach is great at obliterating
matter, but not so hot when it comes to actually

25
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:50,718
chemically digesting stuff, or really absorbing
much of anything?

26
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:52,608
You might say the stomach lacks subtlety.

27
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:56,929
But luckily, it’s got friends in low places,
and the small intestine is more than happy

28
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:01,459
to pick up the slack and provide a cozy environment
where your food is at long last disassembled

29
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,209
and absorbed by your cells.

30
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,590
Now there’s a lot of mechanical action and
peristalsis going on here, but there’s also

31
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,379
a ton of chemical digesting too.

32
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:14,389
And while homebrewed intestinal juices help
digest the chyme that your stomach turns food

33
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:20,139
into, the real power actually comes from the outside
helpers -- the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.

34
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,549
Now, the small intestine is called “small”
not because it’s short but because it’s

35
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,710
about half the diameter of the large intestine
-- the thing is actually like 6 or 7 meters long.

36
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,939
Not only that, but whole deal is lined with epithelial 
tissue that has more folds than an origami octopus.

37
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:38,859
These folds are lined with tiny hair-like
villi and even tinier microvilli, which create

38
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,400
a truly impressive surface area -- large enough that,
if it were unfolded, it would cover a tennis court.

39
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:48,680
It’s this massive surface area, and the
countless capillaries just beneath it, that

40
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,500
make the small intestine such a champion absorber
of nutrients.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,060
It shares the same four tissue layers seen throughout
the GI tract, and has three main subdivisions:

42
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,340
Straight outta the stomach and snuggled around
the pancreas, you’ve got the relatively

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,349
short and mostly immovable duodenum, which
is where most of the chemical digestion occurs.

44
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,049
The middle section is the jejunum, where most
of the absorption takes place.

45
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,960
And finally at the end, running into the large
intestine is the ileum, where important vitamins

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,480
like A, B12, E, D, and K are absorbed.

47
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,199
But the duodenum is what you might call the
business end of the small intestine. It receives

48
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,689
chyme and gastric juices from the stomach
through the pyloric sphincter, but it also

49
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:29,579
imports bile from the liver and gallbladder,
enzymes from the pancreas, and creates its

50
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,700
own homegrown mix of enzymes.

51
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:36,049
Some of the imported enzymes eventually pass
through your system on the wave of gooey chyme.

52
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:41,210
But other enzymes are actually bound to cell
membranes in the intestinal mucosal layer,

53
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,830
and they’re reusable.

54
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,590
Enzymes are proteins, and proteins are expensive.
So these compounds -- known as brush border

55
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,509
enzymes -- can just sit around and process
food as it passes by, without your body having

56
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:53,439
to make new ones.

57
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,609
And the lactase that so many of us don’t
have, is one of these.

58
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,780
Now, the duodenum communicates with the stomach
in the last phase of gastric regulation that

59
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,289
we talked about in the last episode -- the
intestinal phase.

60
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:07,259
This is where the duodenum lets the stomach
know, with hormones and nerve signals, when

61
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,009
and how much chyme to release so it doesn’t
get overwhelmed all at once.

62
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,129
It’s also where stuff like bicarbonate from
the pancreas gets dumped, to help neutralize

63
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,459
the stomach acid before it burns a hole in
your guts.

64
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,780
And this brings me to your crucial accessory
organs -- the things apart from the alimentary

65
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,189
canal that never come in contact with ingested
material, but still play an essential role

66
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,240
in digestion.

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,280
First up: the liver.

68
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:33,039
The liver is a massive, fatty, four-lobed,
and very important organ. It lives directly

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,210
under your diaphragm and -- fun fact -- it
can actually fully regenerate itself after

70
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,699
an injury or surgery, with as little 25 percent
of its original tissue.

71
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,319
The liver serves tons of critical metabolic
and regulatory roles that we don’t have

72
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,939
time to get into right now, but its main role
in the digestive system is to make bile.

73
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:53,100
Bile is the missing ingredient your body needs
to attack fatty foods, which is a tricky business.

74
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,250
In part, that’s because fat isn’t water
soluble, and since your insides are mostly

75
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,759
water, fats will clump together, becoming
hard to digest.

76
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,810
To keep fat from clumping, you need an emulsifier,
so bile comes in to keep big, hydrophobic

77
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,149
fat molecules from sticking together, which
allows lipid-hungry enzymes to move in and

78
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:14,629
break them down into fatty acids and monoglycerides
that you can then digest and absorb.

79
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:18,589
But while your liver creates the bile, it
gets stored and concentrated in the neighboring

80
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:22,479
gallbladder, the thin, green sac cozied up
to the liver.

81
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,069
It gets the signal when chyme slides into
the duodenum, which activates the enteroendocrine

82
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,319
cells to release a pair of hormones. Those
hormones in turn tell the gallbladder to contract

83
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,500
and squirt bile through the cystic and bile
ducts into the duodenum.

84
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,250
Another crucial accessory organ is the pancreas,
a gland that looks like a fistful of cottage

85
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,310
cheese stuffed in a plastic bag.

86
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,689
The pancreas also does lots of important things
for your body, especially related to your

87
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:50,100
endocrine system, but for our purposes today,
just know that it brews up a powerful enzyme

88
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,439
cocktail that is also triggered by those same
two hormones.

89
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,889
Pancreatic juice is kinda like the Neapolitan
Ice Cream of bodily secretions -- it’s like

90
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:02,449
everybody’s favorite ingredients all put
together, and when you mix them, the result

91
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,829
is especially powerful.

92
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:07,599
You’ve got trypsin and peptidase in there,
which break proteins down into amino acids,

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,240
and you have lipases that turn triglycerides
into fatty acids and glycerol.

94
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,860
Amylase, meanwhile, reduces carbs to glucose
and fructose, and nuclease busts the nucleic

95
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,699
acids that are in DNA and RNA into nucleotides.

96
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,410
Once all of those macromolecules have been
dissembled into their monomers, the small

97
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,010
intestine’s epithelial cells can finally
absorb and transport them through your capillaries

98
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:30,949
and into the bloodstream, where they can travel
to pretty much to any cell in your body, and

99
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,620
be used to build collagen, or store fat, or
replace dying cells.

100
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,620
The true purpose behind all the eating that
you do.

101
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,780
So! Once the chyme has worked through your
small intestine, it passes through the ileocecal

102
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,009
valve and hits the cecum, the first part of
the large intestine, where, congratulations,

103
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:48,449
your food is now officially feces!

104
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,840
The large intestine -- consisting of the colon,
rectum, and anus -- is relatively short, at

105
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,549
about one and half meters, and it provides
a nice little frame for the small intestine,

106
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,280
here at the end of the alimentary canal.

107
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,329
By now, your body has sucked up almost all
of the nutrients it can, and is basically

108
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:06,829
just pushing indigestible goo around, so the
large intestine doesn’t have a lot of hard

109
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:07,519
work to do.

110
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,459
Its main functions are to absorb any remaining
water so you don’t have constant diarrhea,

111
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:14,180
and to store the rest until it’s ready to
exit the body.

112
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,889
It also plays host to hundreds of species
and trillions of individual gut bacteria,

113
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,699
which digest whatever chyme your body couldn’t,
releasing essential B and K vitamins, and

114
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,009
some short fatty acids, which the large intestine
can still absorb.

115
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,459
In doing so, they also produce gases like
carbon dioxide and methane, sulfurous compounds

116
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,239
called mercaptans, and hydrogen sulfide, which
eventually...pass.

117
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,610
OK, I know what you’re thinking now, you’re
like, “Hank, what’s up with the nachos?”

118
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,620
“Surely you’re not just gonna to bring
up nachos at the beginning of the episode

119
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,959
without explaining how they can turn on you?!”

120
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,859
Well, I’ve never disappointed you before,
have I?

121
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,020
Those of us who can’t produce the enzyme
lactase in our small intestine simply let

122
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:54,870
milk and cheese pass through the organ untouched,
leaving the digestion to these bacteria in

123
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,978
the large intestine.

124
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:00,959
And those bacteria possess about 1000 different
kinds of enzymes of their own, including lactase.

125
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,099
But their digestion process produces a whole
lotta extra gas, which is why nachos may leave

126
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,930
me feeling cheesy and satisfied, but leave
you bloated, and crampy, and malodorous.

127
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,410
But enough farting around, let’s wrap up
this fantastic journey.

128
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,520
Fecal matter keeps moving through in a couple
of different ways. Slow, segmenting haustral

129
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,008
contractions keep mixing and chopping it in
the large intestine, occurring every 30 minutes

130
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,540
or so and lasting about a minute.

131
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,460
But most people also experience a few mass
peristalsis movements a day -- big, intense

132
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,889
contractions that clear out a large swath
of intestine at once, pushing feces into the

133
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,149
rectum. These often occur just after eating.

134
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:41,059
Once in the rectum, your poop stimulates stretch
receptors that tap the parasympathetic defecation

135
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,879
reflex, which signals the colon and rectum
to contract, and the internal anal sphincter

136
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,539
to relax.

137
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,679
This forces the poop into the anal canal,
sending more messages to the brain that allow

138
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:55,929
us to decide whether to voluntarily open the
external anal sphincter, or just hold it for

139
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:57,179
a minute while we find a bathroom.

140
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,729
And when that moment arrives, what was once
food says farewell to the alimentary canal

141
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,500
that temporarily held it, and passes back
into the light of day.

142
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,919
And that, my friends, is the end of your digestive
system. Pretty cool, right?

143
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,379
And so it’s all over, but that doesn’t
mean you should forget about what we learned

144
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:18,259
today, which is that the small intestine performs
most of your chemical digestion in the duodenum,

145
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:22,250
while accessory organs including the liver,
gallbladder, and pancreas contribute enzymes

146
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,769
that all but finish the job. Then your large
intestine, which is actually shorter than

147
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,740
the small intestine, tries to extract the
last bit of nutrition, including the occasional

148
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,409
attempt to turn nachos into energy, which
for most humans, ends in gassy failure.
