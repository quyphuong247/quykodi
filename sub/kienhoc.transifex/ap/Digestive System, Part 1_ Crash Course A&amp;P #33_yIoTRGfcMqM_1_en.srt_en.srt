1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,439
We all have our reasons for eating nachos
at 3 in the afternoon.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,919
I happen to have my own. And don’t ask -- it’s
personal.

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:13,059
But more generally, we all eat any kind of food to
accomplish two simple things: to obtain the energy

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,039
we need to stay alive and to get the raw materials
required for building all of our tissues and stuff.

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,299
That’s because, when it comes down to it, both you
and the food you eat contain those two same things:

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,740
Both you and food are made of “stuff”
-- by which I mean, matter, made of certain

7
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:32,789
kinds of atoms -- and both you and food have
energy stored in the bonds between those atoms.

8
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:38,700
So all living things need to take in stuff and energy,
and convert it into slightly different stuff and energy.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,280
And you can get some of the things you need
pretty easily. Like, in order to get oxygen

10
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:48,009
for respiration, to unleash the chemical energy
in your food, you just have to inhale.

11
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:54,409
But you can’t just breathe in the stuff you need
to build DNA, or actin, or a phospholipid bilayer.

12
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:57,329
So, how does your body really acquire “stuff”?

13
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,859
That’s where the nachos come in.

14
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,299
This cheesy, crunchy dish is made of all different
kinds of biological matter -- like carbohydrates

15
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:09,000
and fat and protein -- and it contains a certain,
probably shocking, amount of calories, which

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,780
is how we measure energy stored in the chemical
bonds in food.

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,910
So if I take, like, a 100-calorie bite of
nachos -- which probably with this much cheese

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,359
wouldn’t even be a very big bite -- I can
convert the chemical energy stored in those

19
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,550
carbohydrates and proteins and fats to feed
my muscle and heart cells and maybe, like,

20
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,560
walk a mile -- an activity that happens to
use about 100 calories.

21
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:34,359
But I can’t just swallow the nachos and watch the
lump of them travel straight to my heart or leg muscles.

22
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:39,120
In order to actually use this food, I have
to convert the biological matter into something

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,960
my body can work with on the cellular level,
which as you know, is pretty darn tiny.

24
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:50,419
And, the work of converting the stuff in food, into the
stuff that’s in my body, is done by my digestive system.

25
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,460
Human digestion occurs in six main steps -- some of
which you are intimately familiar with. Others less so.

26
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,478
But every step of the way, your body is working
to reduce all the different kinds of molecules

27
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,638
in food into their tiniest and most basic
forms.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,480
The first step? Is, uh, probably everybody’s favorite.

29
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,900
When it comes to what your digestive system ultimately
does, just think of it as a sort of disassembly line.

30
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,700
You could have an order of nachos with The
Works -- I’m talking beef and onions and

31
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,239
sour cream and slices of jalapeño -- and
your digestive system will deconstruct it,

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,620
both mechanically and chemically, one step
at a time.

33
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,319
It’s gotta do this because your cells work best
with materials that are in their most basic form.

34
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,879
Your digestive system reduces food to that
level in two main ways: by physically smashing

35
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,549
it to smithereens, and by bathing them, as
much as it can, in enzymes.

36
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,099
Enzymes are proteins that living things use
as catalysts, to speed up chemical reactions.

37
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:57,959
When used in digestion, enzymes break down
the large molecules in your food into the

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,558
building blocks that your cells can actually
absorb.

39
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:04,378
Those large molecules are called biological
molecules -- also known as macromolecules

40
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:08,218
-- and everything that you eat, I hope, is
at least partially made of them.

41
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:13,680
And there are four main kinds: you got the lipids, the
carbohydrates, the proteins, and the nucleic acids.

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,060
Each possesses its own density of chemical
potential energy, or caloric value, like for

43
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,539
example, 1 gram of carbohydrate contains about 4
calories, while a gram of fat contains about 9 calories.

44
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:28,000
But many of these biological molecules are
polymers -- or sequences of smaller molecules

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,180
-- and your cells aren’t really equipped
to take them up whole.

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,439
What your body trafficks in are those polymers’
individual components -- called monomers -- and

47
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:40,118
there are four main kinds of those, too: fatty
acids, sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides.

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,719
The simple idea behind the whole digestive system
is to break down the polymers of macromolecules

49
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,429
in your food, into the smaller monomers that
your cells can use to build their own polymers,

50
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,310
while also getting the energy they need.

51
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,338
And, what your body needs to build at any
given moment is always changing.

52
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:58,468
Maybe you need new fat stores so you can have
energy to run a marathon, or new actin and

53
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:02,979
myosin to build bigger muscles, or more DNA
so you can replace the skin cells you scraped

54
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:08,179
off your knee when you fell, or more enzymes so you
can digest more food to get more building materials.

55
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,760
To meet your body’s constant, and constantly shifting
demands, your digestive system requires a lot of organs

56
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,879
that perform a lot of specific tasks to break down
and absorb the right nutrient at the right time.

57
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,719
Now, I’m quite sure that you’re familiar
with the key players here -- they’re the

58
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:27,688
hollow organs that form the continuous tube
that is your alimentary canal, aka the gastrointestinal

59
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:30,340
tract, which runs from your mouth to your
anus.

60
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:35,699
It’s worth pointing out that these organs are
hollow, because you are basically hollow, too.

61
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:42,159
Your digestive tract is really just one unbroken,
insulated tunnel of outside that just happens

62
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:47,308
to run through your body, and is open at both
ends. You’re a donut.

63
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:52,420
So the layer of stratified squamous and columnar
epithelial cells that line your tract is actually

64
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,098
a barrier between the outside world and your
inside world -- but it’s a barrier that

65
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,839
allows for the selective movement of materials
between them.

66
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,579
It’s these hollow organs that do the actual
moving, digesting, and absorbing of food,

67
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:08,300
and they include your mouth, pharynx, esophagus,
stomach, and small and large intestines.

68
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,930
In your mouth, in your esophagus, and at the
other end of things, at your anus, you have

69
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,870
stratified squamous epithelial tissue, just
like your epidermis, to help resist the abrasive

70
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,590
action of like, chewing, like corn chips, maybe.

71
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:24,139
From your stomach on down, though, the inner
GI tract is lined with simple columnar epithelial

72
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:28,810
cells, which secrete all sorts of stuff, and
which absorb and process various nutrients.

73
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,500
Most of those columnar cells secrete mucus,
which lubricates everything, and protects

74
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:35,620
your cells from being digested by your own
digestive enzymes.

75
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,098
So, the innermost epithelial layer of the
tube is known as the mucosal layer, and it

76
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:43,459
contains some connective tissue as well, which
supplies it with blood.

77
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:48,099
Surrounding the mucosal layer is the submucosal
layer, made of loose areolar connective tissue,

78
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,879
which helps provide the elasticity that the
tube needs when you eat a whole pizza in one

79
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,240
sitting, and it contains more blood vessels.

80
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,069
And outside that, you have the muscularis
externa layer, which as you might guess, is

81
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,780
where you find the muscles responsible for
moving food through your tube.

82
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,489
Beyond these layers, the GI tract gets tons
of support from the accessory digestive organs,

83
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,620
like your teeth, and your tongue, your gallbladder,
salivary glands, liver, and pancreas.

84
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,120
They’re kind of like a pit crew, and they
mostly help by secreting various enzymes that

85
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,370
help take apart food as it comes down the
tube.

86
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,788
Together, these two groups on the digestive
disassembly line work in six steps to destroy

87
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:24,769
your food and release and recycle its nutrients.

88
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:28,639
First, of course, you’ve got to introduce
the food to your digestive system. What you

89
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:33,418
know as eating, or ingestion, is basically
just creating a bulk flow of nutrients from

90
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:35,519
the outside world into your tissues.

91
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,339
This is where the work of disassembly begins:
In your face-hole, which scientists call your mouth.

92
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,119
Now, we’re going to get to the details of
what happens here another time, but remember

93
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,348
that food disassembly is both mechanical and
chemical: So your teeth pulverize the bite

94
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:53,829
of nacho or whatever, while your salivary glands
begin that food’s hours-long enzyme bath.

95
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:57,609
But the food, at this point, is not nearly
“micro” enough to be of any use to your

96
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,930
cells, so you have to move that mush further
down your tube.

97
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,100
This stage is called propulsion, and its initial
mechanism is swallowing -- which, as you know,

98
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,900
is a voluntary action -- but then it’s quickly turned
over to the involuntary process of peristalsis.

99
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,038
In peristalsis, the smooth muscles of the
walls of your digestive organs take turns

100
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,338
contracting and relaxing to squeeze food through
the lumen, or cavity, of your alimentary tract.

101
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,679
Waves of peristalsis continue through the
esophagus, stomach, and intestines, and they’re

102
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,439
so strong that even if you were hanging upside
down while eating your lunch and drinking

103
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:34,159
your tea, the food would still soldier on, fighting
gravity, and eventually make it to its final destination.

104
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:38,538
Don’t do that, though. There’s other reasons
why you shouldn’t be upside down.

105
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,600
Anyway, all of this shipping and handling
mechanically breaks down the food even more,

106
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,870
and even after it goes through the stomach
and its gastric acid, the mechanical work

107
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,598
still continues once it reaches your small
intestine, as more smooth muscle segments

108
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,449
push the food back and forth to keep crumbling
it up.

109
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,699
The goal of all this pulverization is to increase the
surface area of that bite of food by breaking it down

110
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:06,459
into increasingly tiny pieces, to prepare it to encounter
more enzymes in step four: chemical digestion.

111
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,799
Really, the actual process of digestion only
occurs when the main action becomes

112
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,699
more chemical than mechanical.

113
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:17,759
And here, the accessory digestive organs -- namely,
the liver, pancreas and gallbladder -- secrete

114
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,509
enzymes into the alimentary canal, where they
ambush the mush and break it down into its

115
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,449
most basic chemical building blocks.

116
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,709
Like I said before, our cells prefer to do
business in the really basic currency of monomers,

117
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:33,808
like amino acids, fatty acids, and simple sugars.
And digestion allows for the absorption of

118
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:39,569
those nutrients as they pass from the small intestine
into the blood, by both active and passive transport.

119
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,610
Once those nutrients are absorbed by your
cells, you can finally use the energy inside

120
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,930
of them or use them to build new tissues.

121
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:49,500
The absorption of the nutrients is the
goal of the entire process.

122
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,830
But, of course, it is not the end of it.

123
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,490
Once your body has sucked out all the nutrients
it wants, indigestible substances like fiber

124
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,240
are escorted out of your body.

125
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,759
Yeah, I’m talking about pooping, or defecation.

126
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,500
And that is the end of the digestive line
-- unless you are a capybara, or one of the

127
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,879
other animals who make sure that they get
the most out of their lunch, by giving the

128
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,629
whole process another round and practicing
coprophagia, aka eating their own poop.

129
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:18,899
Now, you should notice here that some of the
processes of digestion occur in just one place,

130
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,100
and are the job of a single organ -- like
hopefully you’re only ingesting through

131
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,019
your mouth and eliminating from the large
intestine.

132
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:29,689
But most of these six steps require cooperation
among multiple organs.

133
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,430
For example, both mechanical and chemical
digestion start in the mouth, and continue

134
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:37,209
through the stomach and small intestines.
And some chemical breakdown continues in the

135
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,269
large intestine, thanks to our little bacterial
farm there.

136
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,720
Over the next couple of weeks we’re going
to take you and your nachos on a stroll through

137
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,370
your digestive system and see who’s doing
what, where, how, and why.

138
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,269
But for now, I’ve got some nachos to finish,
so I gotta go.

139
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:55,870
And eating those nachos, as you learned today,
will provide me with energy and raw materials,

140
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,830
by first ingesting something nutritious, propelling
it through my alimentary canal where it will

141
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,560
be mechanically broken down, and chemically
digested by enzymes until my cells can absorb

142
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,519
their monomers and use them to make whatever
they need. And eventually, there will be pooping.

143
