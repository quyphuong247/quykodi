1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,529
So you’re sound asleep, when your smoke
alarm goes off. Before you even know what’s

2
00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:07,689
going on, you start to feel it. Those smoke
alarms are loud -- for a good reason. Your

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,699
heart starts to race, your breathing picks
up, you become sweaty all over your body.

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,269
You are stressed. And I’m not talking about
the my-iPhone-just-died kind of stress. I’m

5
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:19,390
talking about the I’m-afraid-I-might-die
kind of stress.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,649
Even though it’s often seen as a dirty word,
stress, like pain, isn’t all bad -- it’s

7
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,198
actually very useful if you’re, y’know,
trying to get out of a burning building.

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,980
Your sympathetic nervous system is the part
of your nervous system that responds to stress,

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,549
and it does its job exceedingly well by focusing
on what your body needs to do right now.

10
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:39,318
Like, when you’re facing a life-or-death
ordeal, you don’t need to be digesting that

11
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:43,579
cashew cluster in your intestines, or producing
reproductive cells, or fighting off an infection.

12
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,780
That’s all stuff that you can deal with
later, when you’re out of harm’s way.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,210
So your sympathetic nervous system sweeps
these suddenly trivial functions aside to

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,989
blast all of your energy to your brain and heart
and muscles to deal with the threat at hand.

15
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:59,678
So, this is where I tell you that you’re
lucky to have a sympathetic nervous system.

16
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,079
And that it keeps you alive. And that you would
probably die in X Period of Time if you didn’t have one.

17
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,259
All of which is true. But here’s the thing:
the problem is, nowadays our bodies’ stress

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,680
responses are triggered all the time, practically
every day, even when we are not in mortal danger.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,690
I mean, worrying about paying your wireless
bill or being late for an important meeting

20
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:19,060
-- those things are terrible, but they will
not kill you.

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,320
But, good luck explaining that to your nervous
system.

22
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,339
Because your physiological responses to 
non-immediate stresses are largely the 

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,600
same as when you’re fighting for survival.

24
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,949
So, if stress is, like, ruining your life,
that’s why. And that’s part of the reason

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,609
that should get to know how it works. Because
by learning about your sympathetic

26
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:39,208
nervous system, you come to understand one
of the key players in the physiology of stress.

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,660
You may recall from our tour of the anatomy
of your autonomic nervous system, that in

28
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,849
both your sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions,
almost every signal has to cross two synapses.

29
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:02,339
Each neuron travels from its root in the spinal
cord to a ganglion, where it synapses -- and

30
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:06,530
yes, that is a verb as well -- with another
nerve fiber. And that one, in turn, leads

31
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,990
to an effector organ, where it synapses again
to create whatever response was signaled -- like

32
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,520
sending more blood to your skeletal muscles,
or making your heart pump faster.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,960
But you gotta wonder -- or at least I gotta
wonder: how do these neurons and effectors

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,300
actually communicate with each other? And
how do all of those signals result in the

35
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,710
high-octane sensations that we know as “stress”?

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,159
By and large, the stress response includes two kinds
of chemicals, both of which I’m sure you've heard of.

37
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,319
The first, of course, are neurotransmitters. These
are made and released from neurons themselves,

38
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,790
and like we talked about in our lesson about
synapses, they are what neurons use to communicate

39
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:45,019
with each other -- or their effector organs
-- across a synapse.

40
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,610
The other chemicals involved in stress are
hormones, which are secreted by your glands.

41
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,230
There are at least 50 different hormones at
work in your body right now, and they do everything

42
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:57,000
from regulating your sleep cycles to making
your body retain water so you’re not dying

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,550
of dehydration all over the place.

44
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,810
I’m telling you all of this now, up front,
because hormones and neurotransmitters are

45
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,240
100% necessary for understanding how your
sympathetic division ultimately works.

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,680
BUT! When you trace a single sympathetic signal,
from the initial stimulus to the final response,

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,689
those chemicals can be kind of hard to keep
track of.

48
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:17,319
That’s because the very same substance can
have different effects -- actually, sometimes,

49
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,039
totally opposite effects -- depending on where
it’s received in your body.

50
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,620
And to make things even more fun, even though
neurotransmitters are part of your nervous

51
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,200
system, and hormones are products of your
endocrine system, a compound can be considered

52
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,750
either a neurotransmitter or a hormone -- even
though it hasn’t changed one iota -- depending

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,500
on where it happens to be operating in your
body.

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,759
So all of this can make understanding your
stress responses pretty confusing! You might

55
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,560
even say … stressful!

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,879
All right, we’re going in.

57
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,569
The smoke alarm wakes you up. You smell smoke.
It is time to move muscles. Fast.

58
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,659
Your brain sends action potentials down your
spinal cord and preganglionic neuronal axons.

59
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:56,020
Those signals flow all the way to their ganglia.

60
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,420
When the signals reach the synapses inside
the ganglia, the nerve fibers then release

61
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,439
a neurotransmitter -- called acetylcholine,
known to its friends as ACh.

62
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,340
If you haven’t heard of acetylcholine yet,
you’re gonna wanna remember that name.

63
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,170
In addition to working in sympathetic ganglia
like this, it’s also what the rest of your

64
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:15,500
peripheral nervous system and lots of your
central nervous system uses to communicate.

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,800
So when it comes to nervous communication, ACh
is really the coin of the realm. The premium currency.

66
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,879
So, that acetylcholine crosses the synapse
and, if there’s enough of it, it can stimulate

67
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,680
action potentials in several neurons on the
other end -- in the postganglionic fibers.

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,480
That’s all it does, but it’s important.
It’s basically a signal booster.

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,740
Those postganglionic neurons then carry the
action potential to the effector organs -- in

70
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,519
this case, let’s say your leg muscles, which
are going to need an influx of blood 

71
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,479
if they’re going to hustle you out of that house.

72
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,680
And at the end of that second, postganglionic
neuron, the fiber releases a different neurotransmitter.

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,530
This one’s called norepinephrine. And it
is always norepinephrine that’s released

74
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:55,149
from postganglionic fibers in the sympathetic
nervous system.

75
00:04:55,149 --> 00:05:00,469
It’s what crosses that final synapse and
creates a response in the effector, like opening

76
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,380
up blood vessels that lead to the leg muscles.

77
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:07,420
So, the preganglionic fiber releases ACh,
and the postganglionic releases norepinephrine.

78
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,080
Boom. Congrats. Your life is on its way to
being saved.

79
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,599
But, your body has more than one mechanism
for responding to things, especially things

80
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,689
like a burning house.

81
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,000
There’s another alternative for getting
the message out.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,490
I mentioned those hormones, remember?

83
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,990
In addition to nerve fibers that lead to ganglia
and then your effectors, there’s also a

84
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,949
set leaving the spinal cord that goes directly
to your adrenal glands.

85
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:31,930
Like all preganglionic fibers, these release
acetylcholine, too. But here, the signal doesn’t

86
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,550
end up in another neuron that triggers blood
vessels to open or whatever. Instead, it triggers

87
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,710
your adrenal medulla to release a flood of
epinephrine and norepinephrine -- hormones

88
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,189
that rush through your bloodstream toward
your heart, lungs, and other organs.

89
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:47,329
Now, hold up! Did you notice what I just said?

90
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,329
Yeah, I said the adrenal glands release norepinephrine
as a hormone.

91
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:54,729
Whereas in that first scenario I said that
norepinephrine was a neurotransmitter that

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,639
sent the final signal to control blood flow
to the leg muscle.

93
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,810
Now, how can I say both of those things?

94
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,780
Because they’re both true.

95
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:06,250
Norepinephrine is BOTH a neurotransmitter
and a hormone, and which one it is depends

96
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,329
on how it’s being used. If it’s being released
from a neuron and travelling across a synapse,

97
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:14,300
we refer to a messenger chemical -- no matter
what it is -- as a neurotransmitter. If it’s

98
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,180
being secreted by a gland into the bloodstream
for more widespread distribution, it’s a hormone.

99
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,470
Even if it’s the same chemical. And to an
effector, hormonal norepinephrine is just

100
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,190
as good as neurotransmitter norepinephrine.
But as scientists, we describe them differently,

101
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,819
because they’re functioning differently.

102
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:34,759
Now, the ways in which a neurotransmitter-slash-
hormone like norepinephrine works, is a good example

103
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,370
of another confusing aspect of your sympathetic
nervous system. Because it works by both stimulating

104
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,209
and inhibiting the same systems in your body
at the same time!

105
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,638
So, in our house-burning scenario, the norepinephrine
your system releases causes an increase of

106
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,110
blood flow in some parts of your body -- like
your leg muscles -- while restricting blood

107
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,740
flow in other places where it’s not urgently
needed -- like your guts.

108
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,439
How can the same chemical cause opposite
responses? Well, it all depends on the particular kind

109
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,399
of receptors that an effector has for receiving
that chemical.

110
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,739
In the case of norepinephrine, its effector
is smooth muscle -- the muscle that controls

111
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,079
all of your involuntary functions of hollow
organs, like the stomach, and bladder,

112
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,539
and also your blood vessels.

113
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,370
On the smooth muscle cells controlling some
blood vessels, there are receptors called

114
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,879
alpha receptors -- when norepinephrine, or
epinephrine, bind to those receptors, they

115
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,079
make those smooth muscle cells contract, 
thereby restricting blood flow.

116
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,229
But on smooth muscle cells that control other
blood vessels, there are lots of beta receptors

117
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,450
for epinephrine and norepinephrine, and when
they are activated, they make the muscles

118
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,759
relax, letting more blood flow through.

119
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,379
So it makes sense that the smooth muscle around
your blood vessels, which feed your skeletal

120
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,009
muscles -- which you’ll need to get out
of that smoky house -- are covered in beta

121
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,939
receptors. Because you want those blood vessels
to relax, and provide plenty of oxygen to

122
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,269
the muscles in your arms and legs.

123
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:56,799
And since running away is more important than
digesting your dinner, the blood vessels leading

124
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,660
to your stomach and intestines have lots of
alpha receptors, which reduce blood flow to

125
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,660
those areas, because that burrito can wait
until you’re out of the house.

126
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,240
So, there’s a lot going on in your sympathetic
responses. And much of it can seem complicated,

127
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,540
or even contradictory.

128
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,780
But the thing is, all of these functions work
together to create a full-body response, which

129
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,159
is exactly what you need in an emergency.

130
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,960
After all, it wouldn’t do you much good
to speed up your heart without sending that

131
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,880
blood to your muscles, where it’s needed.
It’s up to those neurotransmitters and hormones,

132
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,579
and the receptors on the corresponding effectors,
to make sure that everyone is on the same page.

133
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,439
So, the system works well. Really well. Sometimes,
too well.

134
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,740
Remember when I said at the beginning, how
your body doesn’t know life-threatening

135
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,158
stress from life-annoying stress?

136
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,110
Since your body’s reaction tends to be a
full-body response either way, it can become

137
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,680
pretty taxing over time.

138
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,198
I mean, we’re talking about throwing parts
of your body into overdrive, while depriving

139
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:49,688
others of blood and oxygen.

140
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:52,558
That’s not something you want happening
every morning.

141
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:56,899
So the irony here? The real kick in the head?
It’s that non-life-threatening stressors can

142
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:02,539
actually end up endangering your life in the long run,
because your body’s stress response is so effective.

143
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:06,099
The frequent activation of your sympathetic
nervous system, and the triggering the other

144
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,470
part of your stress response -- the part that’s
driven by hormones -- can have nasty consequences,

145
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,680
like high blood pressure, digestive problems,
and even the suppression of your immune system.

146
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,659
So what your body needs to do is figure out
how to relax. Rest and digest. Feed and breed.

147
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:27,139
That is where your sympathetic system’s more mellow
half-brother, the parasympathetic system comes in.

148
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,528
And yeah, that’s what we’re gonna be talking
about next time.

149
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:33,489
For now you learned that your sympathetic
nervous system controls your body’s stress

150
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:38,199
response and how the signals in your sympathetic
nervous system travel to an effector, using

151
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:42,519
the neurotransmitters acetylcholine in the
ganglion and norepinephrine at the effector.

152
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,819
And you learned that other signals can go
right to the adrenal glands, where norepinephrine

153
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:48,289
and epinephrine are secreted as hormones.

154
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:52,099
And you also learned that the same messenger
chemical can evoke different responses depending

155
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,379
on the receptors, with alpha receptors causing
smooth muscles to constrict, for example,

156
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,920
while beta receptors cause smooth muscle to
relax.
