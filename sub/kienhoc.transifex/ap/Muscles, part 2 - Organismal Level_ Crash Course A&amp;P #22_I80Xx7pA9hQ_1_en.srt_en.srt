1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,820
You’ve probably heard somebody refer to a
really difficult, onerous task as “the heavy lifting.”

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,060
Or maybe when someone else tells you that
you have to do hard work on your own, they’ll

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,480
say: “You can’t have somebody else do
your pushups for you.”

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,900
So, yeah, often when we’re talking about
hard work that we just don’t want to do,

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,660
we use metaphors that involve the skeletal
muscles.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,320
And yeah that’s their reputation. They're what you use to
perform all of the necessary-but-sometimes-unpleasant,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,800
brute-force exertions that life requires of us.

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,759
But they do a lot more than just heavy lifting.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,520
Your skeletal muscles, 640 in all, come in
all different shapes and sizes, from the longest

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,320
(the sartorius in your upper thigh) to the
biggest (the gluteus maximus in your butt),

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,899
to the tiniest (the stapedius in your middle
ear -- which I’ve been doing my best to

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,259
work out lately, but I just can’t get any
definition).

13
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:48,239
These organs are capable of a whole range of power
and duration, as well as surprising and delicate subtlety.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,280
The same muscles you might use to pluck an
eyebrow, or catch a firefly, or cuddle a kitten,

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,060
can, in other circumstances, crush cans, punch
holes in walls, or do a bunch of push-ups.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,320
Which, by the way, are not really a thing,
and she’s gonna prove it.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,799
That’s right -- I’m gonna have somebody
do my pushups for me.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,739
Now when you look at how the muscular system
moves, you gotta keep two things in mind:

19
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,559
First, muscles never push. They always pull.

20
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:26,039
Now, how can that be, since Claire here is
obviously pushing herself up?

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,090
Well, remember that most skeletal muscles
extend over joints to connect to at least

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,409
two different bones. That’s why they’re
skeletal.

23
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,439
When a muscle contracts, the bone that moves
is called the muscle’s insertion point.

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,019
And the muscle brings the insertion closer
to the bone that doesn’t move -- or at least

25
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,739
moves less -- and that’s called the muscle’s
origin.

26
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:48,479
And that movement is always a pull -- with the
insertion bone being drawn toward the origin bone.

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,439
And when you think about it, it has to be
this way. Muscles can’t, like, extend themselves

28
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,590
beyond their resting state to push a bone
away from it.

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,159
So even though Claire’s pushing herself up
off the ground in an exercise we call push ups,

30
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,158
her muscles are actually pulling their
insertions toward their origins.

31
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,950
When she pushes herself up, her pectoralis
major is contracting, pulling its insertion

32
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,159
point -- which in this case is the top of her humerus --
toward the immobile origin, which is her sternum.

33
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,979
Every single movement that your skeleton makes
uses the very same principle -- whether you’re

34
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:21,090
hammering on on anvil or lifting your pinky
to sip a cup of tea.

35
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,340
So that’s the first thing. The second big
thing to remember about skeletal muscles is

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,890
that whatever one muscle does, another muscle
can undo.

37
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:32,459
You can generally classify skeletal muscles into four
functional groups depending on the movement being

38
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,939
performed. For example, the muscles that are mainly
responsible for producing a certain movement are

39
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:40,699
called that motion’s prime movers, or agonist muscles.

40
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:44,689
So, when Claire does jumping jacks, she’s
using those pectorals in her chest and latissimus

41
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:48,479
dorsi on her back to adduct her arms back
down to her sides.

42
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,879
Put another way, those are her prime mover
muscles for adduction. At the same time,

43
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,099
there are antagonist muscles that are working in
reverse of that particular movement, by staying

44
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,879
relaxed, or stretching, or contracting just enough
to keep those prime movers from over-extending.

45
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,479
So, in this case, the antagonists of the jumping
jacks would include the deltoids on top of her

46
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,239
shoulders, which among other things help her slow her
down arms so that she doesn’t slap her thighs too hard.

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,000
But when it’s time to start abducting her
arms from her side to over her head, those

48
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:22,049
deltoids now become the primary movers, while
the pecs and lats switch to being antagonists.

49
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,909
The third functional muscle group is your
synergists, and they help the prime movers

50
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:30,818
usually by either lending them a little extra
oomph, or by stabilizing joints against dislocation.

51
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:34,208
With all these arm movements, most of the
rotator cuff muscles -- like the teres minor

52
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,908
or the infraspinatus -- are acting like synergists.

53
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:41,378
So this is how skeletal muscles are functionally
grouped. But what about their actual functions?

54
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:45,718
As individual organs, how do they contract
to create both quick and sustained movements,

55
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,280
and to regulate force?

56
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,840
How can Claire’s hands gently pet this corgi
in one moment, and then crush a can in another?

57
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:54,048
I’ve got two words for you: motor units.

58
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:59,520
A motor unit is a group of muscle fibers that all get
their signals from the same, single motor neuron.

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,860
Since all those fibers listen to only one
neuron, they act together as a unit.

60
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,640
In a big power-generating muscle like your
rectus femoris in your quad, each of a thousand

61
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,870
or so motor neurons may synapse with, and
innervate, a thousand muscle fibers.

62
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,800
Those thousand fibers together form a large motor unit.
And big units are typically found in muscles that

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,180
perform big, not-very-delicate movements,
like walking, and squatting, and drop-kicking.

64
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,369
But other muscles -- like the ones that control
your eyes and fingers, which exert fine motor

65
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:30,769
control -- may have just a handful of muscle
fibers connected to a single motor neuron.

66
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,168
Those relationships are small motor units.

67
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:38,128
And when a motor unit, no matter how large
or small, responds to a single action potential,

68
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,480
those fibers quickly contract and release,
in what we call a twitch. And every tiny twitch

69
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,360
has three distinct phases.

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,270
To understand which happens when, we gotta
go back to the sliding filament model.

71
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:52,668
Immediately after a muscle fiber is stimulated
by a nerve -- when calcium ions are flooding

72
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:57,299
into the sarcomeres to pull away those two
protein bodyguards of tropomyosin and troponin

73
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,999
from the actin -- that’s called the latent
period.

74
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:04,838
The stimulus has arrived, but no force is being
produced. That’s when the action is just starting.

75
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,419
Then comes a brief period of contraction,
when the myosin heads are binding, and pulling,

76
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,580
and releasing, over and over, and the muscle
fibers contract.

77
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,758
But soon the fiber slides back down into the
relaxation period, when the calcium gets pumped

78
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,278
back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and
the actin and myosin stop the binding cycle,

79
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,459
and the muscle relaxes.

80
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:25,848
Each phase consists of a lot of little steps,
and while you couldn’t tell by watching

81
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:29,209
my brother dance, the fact is that our muscular
movements are pretty smooth.

82
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:33,759
That’s because one muscle can produce a
variation of smooth forces, called graded muscle

83
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,219
responses. And they’re generally affected by both the
frequency and strength with which they’re stimulated.

84
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,760
So say Claire’s trying to lift something
heavy, like a paint can.

85
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,700
Just as the volume of a sound corresponds
to the frequency of action potentials from

86
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:50,239
your ear to your brain, her brain gets her
muscles to increase their force, by increasing

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,038
the frequency with which her motor neurons
are firing -- it’s like pushing a button

88
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,759
over and over again really fast.

89
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,710
Lift! You can do it! Feel the burn .. or whatever!

90
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:02,668
And the faster these nerve impulses fire,
the stronger each successive twitch gets,

91
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:04,998
since the muscle doesn’t get a chance to
relax in between.

92
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:08,360
Because, remember, the relaxation period of
a twitch is when all the calcium is being

93
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,669
pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

94
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:15,188
If another action potential travels down before
that can happen, even more calcium gets released,

95
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:20,120
which ends up exposing more actin for myosin
to bind to, and that means more force in that fiber.

96
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,879
In this way, twitches end up adding to each
other as they get closer together in time.

97
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,019
And that’s what we call that temporal summation.

98
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,599
At some point, though, almost all actin binding
sites are exposed, so all of the myosin heads

99
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,580
can work through their cycles of ATP and ADP,
and the muscle force can’t increase any

100
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,939
more, even with faster action potentials and
more calcium.

101
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:44,079
When all those little twitches blend together until they
feel like one gigantic contraction, that’s called tetanus.

102
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,118
At that point, any person on the planet will
hit a ceiling of maximum tension.

103
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:52,279
That tension means myosin and the calcium
pumps are burning up the muscle cells’ ATP,

104
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,279
and the finite supply of ATP is what makes it impossible
to maintain vigorous muscle activity indefinitely.

105
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,118
Prolonged contraction leads to muscle fatigue,
and when your muscles just can’t take it

106
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,860
anymore all that tension crashes to zero.

107
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,759
And remember, all of this twitching happens
in individual motor units.

108
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,348
Since twitches are driven by action potentials,
and action potentials only have one intensity,

109
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,610
frequency is the only way to create a grade
of force.

110
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,800
But when we zoom out to the complete muscle
of maybe a thousand motor units, we can increase

111
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,110
the strength of the stimulus by sending action
potentials to more motor units.

112
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,869
If amping up frequency is like hitting a button
again and again, then increasing the signal

113
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:31,610
strength is like smashing the whole keyboard
… with your forehead.

114
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,149
Since multiple action potentials don’t travel
down all the motor neurons at exactly the

115
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:41,028
same time, each motor unit twitches at slightly different
times, which helps smooth out the … twitchiness.

116
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:45,379
So, contractions intensify as your motor neurons
stimulate more and more muscle fibers. This

117
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:50,159
is a process called recruitment, or multiple
motor unit summation. And it’s where some

118
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,368
of your muscles’ more nuanced abilities
come in.

119
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:56,249
So let’s say Claire is holding Abby. She
wants to hold onto her tight, so that Abby

120
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:58,649
doesn’t fall, but you know not too tight,
right?

121
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:03,428
So to increase the contraction force and tighten
her grip, she can recruit another motor unit.

122
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:08,098
Recruiting one with 20 fibers will firm her
grasp, but calling on one with 1000 fibers

123
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,800
might … well, let’s not think about that
too much.

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,728
Lucky for our corgi friend, this recruitment
doesn’t escalate at random -- it follows

125
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,779
what’s known as a size principle. It starts

126
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:21,919
when the smallest motor units with the smallest
fibers are activated by your most excitable neurons.

127
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,840
Then some larger motor units with larger fibers
are enlisted, increasing the strength of contraction.

128
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,119
And finally, if you want to give it all you’ve
got -- which you don’t in Abby’s case

129
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,918
-- your largest motor units, with your biggest
muscle fibers will get involved.

130
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,168
These big guns are the last to join up, in
part because they’re controlled by your

131
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:42,078
largest and least excitable motor neurons.
But when they’re in, they are all in -- packing

132
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:44,899
fifty times the force of those smaller fibers.

133
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,818
So the basic rule is: the more motor units
recruited, the greater the force that’s generated.

134
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,460
Now that we know how muscle contractions happen,
let’s look at our two main flavors:

135
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,360
isotonic and isometric.

136
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,839
Say I want to pick up my Crash Course mug.
I can do this workout myself.

137
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,699
If the temporal and recruitment summation
triggers enough muscle tension in my arm to

138
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:06,649
overcome the weight of the load and lift the
mug, changing the length of the muscles involved

139
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,909
during contraction, than that is an isotonic
movement.

140
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:14,088
Now if I want to pick up a building, I could
contract my muscles all I wanted, and develop

141
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,360
a lot of tension without actually changing
the muscle’s length -- in which case, I’d

142
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,980
be experiencing isometric contractions.

143
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,420
And possibly a hernia.

144
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:26,278
Which is why I asked Claire to do all the
heavy lifting in this episode.

145
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,519
Today you learned how skeletal muscles work
together to create and reverse movements.

146
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,089
We also talked about the role size plays in
motor units, the three phase cycle of muscle

147
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,329
twitches, and how the strength and frequency
of an impulse affects the strength and duration

148
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:44,019
of a contraction. Finally, we discussed twitch
summation versus tetanus, and isotonic vs.

149
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:47,740
isometric movements. No corgis were harmed
in the making of this video.
