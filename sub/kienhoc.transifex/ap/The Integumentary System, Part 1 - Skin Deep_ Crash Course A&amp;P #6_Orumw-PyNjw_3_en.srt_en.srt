1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,738
When you hear about your “organs,” you
probably think of your heart, or your liver,

2
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:08,359
or your lungs. Maybe you picture Captain Nemo
playing the organ aboard the Nautilus. Why

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:11,919
do they have an organ on a submarine? That
is - that doesn’t make any sense.

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,280
But your first associations with that term
probably overlook your biggest organ.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,599
I’m talking about your skin.

6
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:22,518
The glorious fleshy shroud that keeps the
world out, and you in.

7
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:27,259
Your skin protects your body against infection
and extreme temperatures, maintains your balance

8
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:30,368
of fluids, and even synthesizes vitamin D
for your own personal use.

9
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:34,590
Its many nerve endings allow you to sense
the outside world, and its sweat glands and

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,100
blood vessels help you maintain a proper temperature
and communicate a whole range of stuff -- from

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,270
your health to your emotions -- through things
like blushing, and flushing, and sweating.

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,789
It also accounts for about 3 to 5 kilograms
of your body weight, and if you could spread

13
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,520
it out, it would measure up to two square
meters, enough to cover your bed -- the most

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,449
disgusting, paper-towel-thin, waterproof,
insulating, stretchy, self-repairing, lifetime-lasting

15
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:58,358
quilt on the planet!

16
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,019
It comes in lots of different colors, you
can cover it up, or show it off, or tattoo

17
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:06,349
the periodic table on it if you want. And
of course, without it, you would basically

18
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:07,969
shrivel up and die in no time.

19
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:13,719
Together with your hair, nails, and sweat and oil
glands, your skin forms your integumentary system.

20
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,750
And if you’ve ever been burned, or had surgery,
or stepped on a nail, you know how fast complications

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,140
arise when it gets damaged.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,219
But it also heals up quite quickly.

23
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:32,359
LAYERS.

24
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,000
Like an everlasting gobstopper, the key to
your integumentary system is layers.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
And although you can’t tell by looking at
it, your skin actually has three of them,

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,019
each with particular types of cells that have
their own skin jobs, to borrow a phrase from

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,609
Blade Runner or BSG… whichever you like!

28
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,509
The epidermis is the only layer you can actually
see, assuming that your skin is intact, which is

29
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,218
why it’s what you think of, when you think of “skin.”
It’s made of stratified squamous epithelial tissue.

30
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:00,629
But the dermis just below it is where most
of the work that skin does gets done, like

31
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,560
sweating, and circulating blood, and feeling
everything everywhere all the time. And at

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,360
the bottom there’s the subcutis, or hypodermis,
composed mostly of adipose or fatty tissue.

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,800
Each of these layers owes its properties -- and
its ability to do its “skin job” -- to

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,080
its unique combination of cells.

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,660
The bulk of your epidermis, for example, is
made up of cells called keratinocytes, which

36
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:25,159
are the building blocks of that tough, fibrous
protein keratin that gives structure, durability,

37
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,079
and waterproofing to your hair, nails, and
outer skin.

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,190
These cells are constantly dying and being
replaced -- you lose millions of them every

39
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:35,849
day, enough to completely replace your epidermis
every 4 to 6 weeks.

40
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:38,859
That’s why if you want to tell the world
you love your mom or commemorate your favorite

41
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,020
famous physiologist with a tattoo you gotta
make sure the ink gets below the epidermis.

42
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,140
If there’s a cell in the human body that’s
been responsible for causing the most pride

43
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:51,369
and the most prejudice in human history, it’s
another epidermal cell: the melanocyte, the

44
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,610
spider-shaped cell that synthesizes melanin,
the pigment that gives skin its color.

45
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,860
I’ll spend more time later talking about
why skin color differs around the world, but

46
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,830
one thing to keep in mind is that both the
very palest and the very darkest human skins

47
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,630
on the planet have about the same number of
melanocytes.

48
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,379
Your particular color isn’t about the number
of these cells that you have, but instead

49
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:14,199
about the breadth of their spidery cellular
extensions, which in turn affect the amount

50
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,689
of melanin that they contain.

51
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,870
But on a cellular level, we’re all the same.

52
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,000
Now, your skin, obviously, is also your first
line of defense when it comes to protecting

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,050
you from the outside world. So it may not
come as a surprise that you have lots of immune

54
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,760
system cells in your epidermis as well.

55
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,819
These are your dendritic, or Langerhans cells,
which are kinda star-shaped, and like white

56
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,090
blood cells and platelets, they actually originate
in your bone marrow. Once they migrate to

57
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,400
the epidermis, their long, skinny tendrils
run around the keratinocytes and spend much

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,629
of their time ingesting the unwanted invaders
that are trying to sneak around your skin.

59
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,030
Finally, rounding out the quartet of epidermal
cells, your tactile, or Merkel cells occur

60
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,789
deep down at the boundary between the epidermis
and the dermis, where they combine with nerve

61
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,439
endings to create a sensory receptor for touch.

62
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,629
What’s a little weird, though, is that all
these cells are all organized differently

63
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:04,900
in the skin that covers your body. In fact, in some
places, you have more layers of epidermis than others.

64
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,400
Your thick skin -- and yes, that’s what
it’s really called -- is the tougher stuff

65
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:13,090
on the palms of your hands and the soles your
feet, and it consists of five epidermal layers.

66
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,849
Your thin skin covers everything else, with
just four.

67
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:18,610
To get to know what’s going on with your
thick skin, let’s just imagine you’re

68
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,480
walking around barefoot in the yard, when
suddenly you feel a shooting pain.

69
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,020
You’ve just stepped on a big ol’ nail,
and it’s penetrated all of the layers of

70
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:28,680
your epidermis.
First it pierced your stratum corneum, which

71
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,750
means -- pardon my Latin -- “horny layer.”
This is the outermost layer and also the roughest,

72
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,439
made up of about 20 or 30 sheets of dead keratinocyte
cells. This is the layer that you’re always sloughing

73
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,740
off and feeding to dust mites, but while it’s in place
it offers basic protection from environmental threats.

74
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,910
From there, the nail drives through your stratum
lucidum, or “clear layer.” This holds

75
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,220
two or three rows of clear, flat, dead keratinocytes
that are only found in the thick skin of your

76
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,120
palms and foot soles. So, in places where you only
have thin skin, this layer is what’s missing.

77
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,680
Things start to get more serious in the “granular
layer” or stratum granulosum, because this

78
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:08,699
contains living keratinocytes that are forming
keratin like crazy. This layer looks kind

79
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,610
of grainy because those cells are getting
compressed and flattened as they move up through

80
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,120
the epidermal layers, maturing as they go.

81
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,819
The deeper you go through the layers of the
epidermis, the younger the cells get. Regeneration

82
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,550
happens in the lower layers, and new cells
move up toward the surface, maturing along

83
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,579
the way, where they eventually die and slough
off from the surface of your skin.

84
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:33,159
This whole process is due in part to the fact
that the epidermis is epithelial, so it’s

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,600
avascular. That means that all the oxygen
and nutrients that its cells need have to

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,820
come from the dermis below it. So, as epidermal
cells mature and get bumped up by younger

87
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:47,000
cells forming below them, they move further
and further from the blood supply, and end

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,379
up essentially suffocating.

89
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:52,620
When that nail cuts through the fourth layer
-- the stratum spinosum, or “spiny layer”

90
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,740
-- it’s getting closer to the point where
cell regeneration, or mitosis, is active.

91
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,530
These cells look prickly when they’re dehydrated
for microscope slide preparation -- hence

92
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,649
the name -- and that’s because they contain
filaments that help them hold to each other.

93
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:09,388
And finally, that dang nail touches down on
your deepest, thinnest epidermal level -- the

94
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:14,150
“basal layer” or stratum basale. It’s
just a single layer of columnar cells, but

95
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:19,029
it’s like a cell factory where most of that
new-cell production happens. This stratum

96
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,359
is also what connects the epidermis to the
layer of skin below it, the dermis.

97
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,379
Feelin’ a little overwhelmed by all the
layers? Just remember: “Come Let’s Get

98
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,240
Sun Burned” -- it’s a pneumonic.

99
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,620
I mean, though, who came up with that, because
if you own some skin you know you don’t

100
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,019
want to get sunburned!

101
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:39,089
The ultraviolet radiation in the sun can damage
the epidermis, causing elastic fibers to clump

102
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:43,739
up, leading to that tell-tale leather-face
condition. Plus, getting sunburned temporarily

103
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,960
depresses your immune system -- because, remember,
you have immune cells in your epidermis too

104
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,310
-- AND the radiation can actually alter your
skin cells’ DNA, leading to skin cancer.

105
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,889
We’re gonna go into your skin’s love-hate
relationship with sunlight more next week,

106
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,540
but in the meantime, seriously, wear your
sunscreen.

107
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,020
Now, skin damage of any kind can get serious
when it affects the dermis, because it’s

108
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:06,819
not only got loads of those collagen and elastin
fibers, which help make your skin strong and

109
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:10,379
elastic, it’s also full of capillaries and
blood vessels.

110
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:14,600
And it houses the nerve fibers that register
sensations like temperature, pressure, and

111
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,710
pain, as well as parts of your hair follicles
and oil and sweat glands with the ducts that

112
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,049
lead up to the surface of the skin.

113
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,560
So, the dermis is where most of the skin’s
work is done, and it does it in just three

114
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,649
layers.
The upper, papillary layer is composed of

115
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:35,419
a thin sheet of areolar connective tissue that’s riddled
with little peg-like projections called dermal papillae.

116
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,020
These papillae are pretty neat because in
the thick skin of your hands and feet, these

117
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:44,109
tiny protrusions form unique friction ridges
that press up through the epidermis to help

118
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,080
our fingers and feet grip surfaces.
Your fingerprints!

119
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,159
Just below that papillary layer is the deeper,
thicker reticular layer that makes up 80 percent

120
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:56,740
of your dermis, made up of dense irregular
connective tissue. All of the dynamic parts

121
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,610
contained within the dermis -- like the nerve
fibers and capillaries -- are distributed

122
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,139
between both its layers.

123
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,949
So any time you get cut enough to bleed or
feel pain, you know that you’ve broken through

124
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,850
the epidermis and lacerated the dermis. Which,
by the way, is the layer that tattoo needles

125
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,560
have to reach in order to work: It’s the
only way to make tattoos permanent, but also

126
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,470
it means getting tattoos hurts. And bleeds.

127
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,699
Finally, something of a footnote to your skin
is its third and most basal layer -- the subcutis,

128
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:28,169
or hypodermis. It consists of mostly adipose
connective tissue -- basically a seam of fat

129
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:33,788
-- and it provides insulation, energy storage,
shock absorption, and helps anchor the skin.

130
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:37,199
In short, your hypodermis is where most of
your body fat hangs out.

131
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,240
But there are more skin things to discuss,
so in our next lesson we will tackle big

132
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,960
questions, like -- does lotion really do anything?
How does deodorant work? And what will make

133
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,460
my hair soft and shiny and irresistible?

134
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,320
For now, though, you learned all about skin,
the main organ of your integumentary system.

135
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,420
We looked at the structure, mechanism, and
function of your three layers of skin -- the

136
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:02,659
epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis -- and their
various sub-layers. We talked about the roles

137
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:07,009
of melanin and keratin cells, what happens
when you step on a nail, how to ensure you

138
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:09,830
get a good tattoo, and why it pays to wear
sunscreen.
