1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,860
In March of 2015, American astronaut Scott
Kelly and his Russian colleague Mikhail Kornienko,

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,000
began an unprecedented mission in space.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,269
They began a one-year term of service aboard
the International Space Station, the longest

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,460
tour of duty ever served on the ISS.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,500
Now, I imagine there’s all sorts of stuff
to worry about when you’re packing for a

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,490
year-long space voyage, like, say, “How
many books should I bring? How many pairs

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:26,009
of underwear? Am I really okay with pooping
into a suctioned plastic bag every day for

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,470
a year? Will I come upon a derelict ship haunted
by some stranded and insane astronaut from

9
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:34,890
a forgotten mission, like in pretty much every
space horror movie ever? Will there be coffee?”

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,380
Reasonable questions, all, but in reality,
another one you might want to ask is: “Will

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,730
I be able to walk when I get back home?”

12
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:44,569
We know micro-gravity is hard on a body, and
this mission is largely about testing the

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,049
physical effects of being weightless for so long.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,240
Astronauts often experience things like trouble
sleeping, puffy faces, and loss of muscle

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,980
mass, but perhaps the most serious damage a
microgravity environment causes is to the bones.

16
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,259
And bones, well, they’re pretty clutch.

17
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,559
Though they may look all dried up and austere,
don’t be fooled -- your bones are alive.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,039
ALIVE I tell you!

19
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,998
They’re actually as dynamic as any of your
organs, and are made of active connective

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,260
tissue that’s constantly breaking down, regenerating,
and repairing itself throughout your lifetime.

21
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,759
In fact, you basically get a whole new skeleton
every 7 to 10 years!

22
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,228
In short, your bones do way more than just
providing your squishy sack of flesh with

23
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:22,929
support and scaffolding and the ability to
move around.

24
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:26,049
Your bones are basically how you store the
calcium, phosphate, and other minerals you

25
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,770
need to keep neurons firing and muscles contracting.

26
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,369
They’re also crucial to hematopoiesis, or
blood cell production. All of your new blood

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,590
-- and we’re talking like, a trillion blood
cells a day! -- is generated in your bone

28
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,829
marrow, which also helps store energy as fat.

29
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:43,269
Bones even help maintain homeostasis by regulating
blood calcium levels and producing the hormone

30
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,560
osteocalcin, which regulates bone formation
and protects against glucose intolerance and diabetes.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,149
So, the big buzzkill about life in space is
that, up there, a person suffers one to two

32
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,978
percent bone loss EVERY MONTH.

33
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,769
By comparison, your average elderly person
experiences 1-2 percent bone loss every YEAR.

34
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:02,108
So for Kelly and Kornienko, that could mean
losing up to 20 percent over a year in orbit.

35
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:04,908
Given everything your bones do for you, that’s
really serious.

36
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,478
And while most of that loss is reversible
once they’re back on earth, it’s not as

37
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:11,628
easy as chugging some of Madame Pomfrey’s
Skel-E-Gro potion.

38
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:16,009
Rehabilitation can take years of hard work,
and that’s just after a few months in orbit…

39
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,429
Which is why Kelly and Kornienko are heroes
of science, and not just for scholars of anatomy

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,650
and physiology everywhere, but for anybody
who has bones.

41
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,260
An average human body contains 206 bones,
ranging in shape and size from the tiny stapes

42
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,518
of the inner ear to the huge femur of the
thigh.

43
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,859
That’s a lot of bones to keep tabs on, so
anatomists often divide these structures first

44
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:48,370
by location, into either axial or appendicular
groups.

45
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,049
As you might guess, your axial bones are found
along your body’s vertical axis -- in your

46
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:54,109
skull, vertebral column, and rib cage.

47
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:57,439
They’re kind of like your foundation, the
stuff you can’t really live without -- they

48
00:02:57,438 --> 00:03:01,748
carry your other body parts, provide skeletal
support, and organ protection.

49
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,438
Your appendicular bones are pretty much everything
else, the bones that make up your limbs, and

50
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:09,098
the things that attach those limbs to your
axial skeleton, like your pelvis and shoulder

51
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,819
blades. These are the bones that help us move
around.

52
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,569
From there, bones are generally classified by their
shape, and luckily those names are pretty obvious.

53
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:21,590
Long bones are your classic-looking, dog-bone-shaped
bones -- the limb bones that are longer than

54
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,200
they are wide, like tibia and fibula of your lower legs,
but also the trio of bones that make up your fingers.

55
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,459
Follow some of those long bones to your foot
or hand, and you’ll hit a cube-shaped short

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,200
bone, like your foot’s talus and cuboid,
or your wrist’s lacunate or scaphoid.

57
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,329
Your flat bones are the thinner ones, like
your sternum and scapulae, and also the bones

58
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,769
that make up your brain case.

59
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,799
And your irregular bones are all the weirdly-shaped
things like your vertebrae and pelvis, which

60
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,409
tend to be more specialized and unique.

61
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:51,769
But despite their variations in size, shape,
and finer function, all bones have a similar

62
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:52,950
internal structure.

63
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:57,638
They all have a dense, smooth-looking external
layer of compact, or cortical bone around

64
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,840
a porous, honeycomb-looking area of spongy
bone.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,468
This spongy bone tissue is made up of tiny
cross-hatching supports called trabeculae

66
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:09,739
that help the bone resist stress. And it’s
also where you typically find your bone marrow,

67
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:12,248
which comes in two colors, red and yellow.

68
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:16,028
Red marrow is the stuff that makes blood cells,
so you should be glad that you have some of that.

69
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:20,219
And yellow marrow stores energy as fat -- if
you happen to be a predatory animal, yellow

70
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,280
bone marrow can be one of the best sources
of calories you can find.

71
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,739
The arrangement of these bone tissues, though, can be
slightly different, from one type of bone to the next.

72
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,970
In flat, short, and irregular bones, for example,
these tissues kinda look like a spongy bone

73
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,300
sandwich on compact-bone bread.

74
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,879
But in some of your classic long bones, like
the femur and humerus, the spongy bone and

75
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,300
its red marrow are concentrated at the tips.

76
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,000
These flared ends, or epiphyses bookend the
bone’s shaft, or diaphysis, which -- instead of

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,978
having spongy bone in the center -- surrounds a hollow
medullary cavity that’s full of that yellow marrow.

78
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,879
Now, although bone can look rock-solid, grab
a microscope and you’ll see that it’s actually

79
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,168
loaded with layered plates and laced with
little tunnels.

80
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:01,418
It’s intricate and kinda confusing in there,
but the more you zoom into the microanatomy

81
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,640
of bones, the better you can see how they’re built
and how they function, right down to the cellular level.

82
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,120
Let’s start with the basic structural units
of bone, called osteons.

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,340
These are cylindrical, weight-bearing structures
that run parallel to the bone’s axis. Look

84
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:19,388
inside one and you’ll see that they’re composed
of tubes inside of tubes, so that a cross-section

85
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,569
of an osteon looks like the rings of a tree
trunk.

86
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,640
Each one of these concentric tubes, or lamellae, is
filled with collagen fibers that run in the same direction

87
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,379
But if you inspect the fibers of a neighboring
lamella -- either on the inside or outside

88
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,929
of the first one -- you’ll see that they run in a
different direction, creating an alternating pattern.

89
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:39,138
This reinforced structure helps your bone resist
torsion stress, which is like twisting of

90
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,199
your bones, which they experience a lot, and
I encourage you not to imagine what a torsion

91
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,169
fracture of one of your bones might feel like.

92
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:49,788
Now, bone needs nourishment like any other
tissue, so running along the length of each

93
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:53,269
osteon are central canals, which hold nerves
and blood vessels.

94
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,668
And then, tucked away between the layers of
lamellae are tiny oblong spaces called lacunae.

95
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:02,788
As tiny as they are, these little gaps are
where the real work of your skeletal system

96
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:06,068
gets done, because they house your osteocytes.

97
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:10,259
These are mature bone cells that monitor and
maintain your bone matrix. They’re like

98
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,199
the construction foremen of your bones, passing
along commands to your skeleton’s two main

99
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,199
workhorses: the osteoblasts and the osteoclasts.

100
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,598
Osteoblasts -- from the Greek words for “bone”
and “germ” or “sprout” -- are the

101
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:25,610
bone-building cells, and they’re actually
what construct your bones in the first place.

102
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,580
In the embryonic phase, bone tissue generally
starts off as cartilage, which provides a

103
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,939
framework for your bones to grow on. When
osteoblasts come in, they secrete a glue-like

104
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:39,420
cocktail of collagen, as well as enzymes that absorb
calcium, phosphate, and other minerals from the blood.

105
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,720
These minerals form calcium phosphate, which
crystallize on the cartilage framework, ultimately

106
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:47,750
forming a bone matrix that’s about one-third
mineral, two-thirds protein.

107
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,720
From your time in the womb until you’re
about 25, your osteoblasts keep laying down

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,620
more collagen and more calcium phosphate, until
your bones are fully grown and completely hardened.

109
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,038
So while your osteoblasts are the bone-makers,
your osteoclasts are the bone-breakers -- which

110
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:05,618
is a kind of violent image. Maybe think of
them as like a bone-breaker-downer.

111
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,658
Although the two kinds of cells do exact
opposite jobs, they’re not mortal enemies.

112
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:13,649
In fact, I’m happy to report that they get
along fabulously, and create a perfect balance

113
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:15,388
that allows your bones to regenerate.

114
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,180
It’s like if you want to renovate your house,
you’ve gotta rip out all those busted cabinets

115
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,750
and the musty carpeting before you can bring
in the nice hardwood floors and custom countertops.

116
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,990
These cells work in a kinda similar way, in
a process that I’d argue is less stressful

117
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,509
than home improvement -- it’s called bone
remodeling.

118
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,139
The supervisors of this process are those
osteocytes, which kick things off when they

119
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,759
sense stress and strain, or respond to mechanical
stimuli, like the weightlessness of space,

120
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,340
or the impact of running on pavement.

121
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,008
So, say you’re out running and something
happens -- nothing to be alarmed about! -- but

122
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:48,139
suddenly the osteocytes in your femur detect
a tiny, microscopic fracture, and initiate

123
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,939
the remodeling process to fix it up.

124
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:53,909
First, the osteocytes release chemical signals
that direct osteoclasts to the site of the

125
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:58,728
damage. When they get there, they secrete
both a collagen-digesting enzyme, and an acidic

126
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:03,378
hydrogen-ion mixture that dissolves the calcium
phosphate, releasing its components back into

127
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:06,610
the blood. This tear-down process is called
resorption.

128
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,718
When the old bone tissue is cleaned out, the
osteoclasts then undergo apoptosis, where

129
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:14,399
they basically self-destruct before they can do any
more damage. But before they auto-terminate, they

130
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,339
use the hormone hotline to call over the osteoblasts,
who come in and begin rebuilding the bone.

131
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:23,718
The ratio of active osteoclasts to osteoblasts
can vary greatly, and if you stress your bones

132
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:28,560
a lot, through injury, by carrying extra weight,
or just normal exercise, those osteoclasts

133
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,919
are going to be swinging their little wrecking balls
non-stop, breaking down bone so it can be remade.

134
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,109
In this way, exercising stimulates bone remodeling
-- and ultimately bone strength -- so when

135
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,470
you’re working out, you’re building bone
as well as muscle.

136
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,389
Which brings us back to our two space-heroes-slash-
guinea-pigs, Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko.

137
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:49,799
Space crews generally need to exercise at
least 15 hours a week to slow down the process

138
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,929
of bone degradation, but even that can’t
fully stave loss of bone density.

139
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:59,059
In microgravity, osteocytes aren’t getting much 
loading stimuli, because less gravity means less weight.

140
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:03,099
But, for reasons that we don’t understand
yet, the osteoclasts actually increase their

141
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,040
rate of bone resorption in low gravity, while
the osteoblasts dial back on the bone formation.

142
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,799
Because there’s more bone breaking than
bone making going on, everything is out of

143
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:16,169
balance, and suddenly people start experiencing
1 to 2 percent monthly loss in bone mass.

144
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:20,149
So, in addition to providing astronauts with
oxygen and water and food and protection from

145
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,919
radiation and an environment that will keep
them mentally stable, it turns out that we

146
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,559
also have to figure out how to keep their
bodies from consuming their own skeletons.

147
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,269
But at least today we learned about the anatomy
of the skeletal system, including the flat,

148
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,850
short, and irregular bones, and their individual
arrangements of compact and spongy bone. We

149
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,940
also went over the microanatomy of bones,
particularly the osteons and their inner lamella.

150
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,460
And finally we got an introduction to the
process of bone remodeling, which is carried

151
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,560
out by crews of osteocytes, osteoblasts, and
osteoclasts.
