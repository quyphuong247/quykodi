00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,539
Let me introduce you to one of the bravest
pioneers in the history of life on planet Earth.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,000
An organism that blazed the trail for every
single vertebrate that lives on land today

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,359
-- and many that don’t.

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,480
It’s one of your most important ancestors.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,700
Meet…well, it doesn’t have a name.

6
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,919
And we don’t know exactly what it looked
like, either.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,850
But we do know that about 380 million years
ago, this fishy-looking thing with big, fleshy

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,070
fins achieved one of the animal kingdom’s
greatest milestones: breathing air.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,280
Sounds simple enough, but believe me it wasn’t.

10
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,939
Because, for billions of years before this
fishy ancestor came around, basically all

11
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:35,588
of life evolved in water.

12
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:39,600
From the very beginning, the earliest, simplest
forms of life -- like bacteria -- extracted

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,768
oxygen they needed right from the water, through
their membranes.

14
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:46,128
And they did it through simple diffusion -- when
a material automatically flows from where

15
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:49,789
it is concentrated, to where it is less concentrated,
so it balances out.

16
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,709
Diffusion works really well, and it requires zero
effort, but it wasn’t gonna cut it in the big leagues.

17
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:59,620
Anything larger than a small worm is simply too
big and needs too much oxygen for diffusion to work.

18
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:03,439
So in order to get bigger, early life forms
needed a circulatory system that could move

19
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,420
bulk amounts of oxygen around faster inside
their bodies, and a respiratory system to

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,480
bring more oxygen in contact with their wet
membranes.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,500
So their respiratory surfaces moved from their
outer surfaces to the insides of their bodies.

22
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,000
First, there were gills. But gills, of course,
still only work inside of water.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,030
And a little over 380 million years ago, this
was starting to lose some of its charm.

24
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,829
Earth was getting warmer, the seas were getting
shallower, and much of the planet’s surface

25
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:30,708
water had lower concentrations of oxygen than
it used to.

26
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:37,219
Finally, a humble little lobe-finned fish got fed up, swam
up to the water’s surface, and started breathing air.

27
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:41,558
It could do this because it had evolved a
fancy new interface to move gases between

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,320
the air and its cell membranes.

29
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,119
I’m talkin’ about lungs. Wet lungs.

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,939
With an efficient new way to take in nearly
limitless amounts of oxygen from air, animals

31
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,730
were eventually able to get bigger and more
diverse over the ages, and now all of us lung-having

32
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,079
vertebrates share that common ancestor.

33
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,579
For lots of animals, including humans, those
lungs come with a bunch of other equipment,

34
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:06,798
like protective ribs, a stiff trachea, and
in mammals a strong diaphragm. And together,

35
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,530
they form your respiratory system.

36
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,680
Which happens to be best friends and business
partners with your circulatory system.

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,969
It’s only by working together and using
both the bulk flow and simple diffusion of

38
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,509
oxygen that they can make possible the process
of cellular respiration.

39
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,469
In other words: life itself.

40
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:25,060
So, a lot of improvements have been made to
it over the eons, but the respiratory system

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,000
that you are using right now is your inheritance
from that ancient, ambitious fish -- leader

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,099
of one of the most important anatomical revolutions
of the past half-billion years.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,699
Pretend for a minute that you can’t breathe.
Like, you just don’t have lungs anymore.

44
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:53,419
You are some bizarre evolutionary oddity -- a
huge, human-shaped organism that doesn’t

45
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,899
have a respiratory system.

46
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,310
Instead, you get all of your oxygen the way
that your oldest, smallest evolutionary ancestors

47
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,740
did -- by simple diffusion.

48
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,480
Or at least, you try to get your oxygen that
way.

49
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,119
How would it work?
Well, poorly.

50
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,579
And that’s partly because one of the keys to
efficient diffusion of any material is distance.

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,260
If you want a molecule to diffuse across a
space quickly, you want it to be as close

52
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,429
to its destination as possible, with the fewest
obstacles in the way.

53
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,740
But, for a single molecule of oxygen to diffuse
from the air through, say, your scalp and

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,060
then go to a neuron deep inside your brain,
it would have to move through your skin, and

55
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,439
then your skull, and then your connective
tissue and all sorts of things.

56
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,710
It would eventually get there, like maybe
a month later, but at that point, the cell

57
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,340
that needed the oxygen in the first place
would have, you know, suffocated to death.

58
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,439
Basically, obtaining oxygen through diffusion
alone is like wanting to go to a party at

59
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,879
your friend’s place across town, and then
walking 20 miles to get there. You could do it,

60
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,759
but it would take forever, and by the time you arrived,
you’d be all haggard and the party would be over.

61
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:53,060
So, diffusion alone isn’t enough to get the job done.
We do use it, but only when a whole bunch of the

62
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,699
materials we need are right up against
the tissues that can absorb them.

63
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:59,219
So you know what else we need? Bulk flow.

64
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,620
Bulk flow is like public transportation -- it
moves large numbers of molecules, quickly.

65
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,759
Rather than walk the whole way across town,
you can hop on a bus with a bunch of other

66
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,129
people, and get there in twenty minutes.

67
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,819
Every time you take a deep breath, you’re
bringing a hundred quintillion oxygen molecules

68
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,459
into your lungs all at once -- they’re on
a bulk-flow bus ride.

69
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,199
And once those oxygen molecules filter down
into the cells in your lungs, they’re suddenly

70
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,060
very close to the blood they’re trying to
reach. All they have to do is diffuse across

71
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,810
four layers of cell membranes to get from
the lung cell into the blood.

72
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,910
It’s like just hopping off the bus, and then
walking half a block to your friend’s apartment.

73
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,900
That’s why your respiratory system is the
way it is: It’s set up to take full advantage

74
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,420
of both bulk flow and simple diffusion.

75
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,160
The bulk flow part of things is handled by some of
your system’s biggest and most obvious moving parts.

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,620
Starting with your lungs, which basically
operate like a pump, or a bellows.

77
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:49,219
They don’t have any contractible muscle
tissue, because they need to be able to expand,

78
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,560
so they require outside help in order to move.

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,220
Enter the diaphragm -- a big, thin set of muscles
that separates your thorax from your abdomen.

80
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,639
When your lungs empty, your diaphragm relaxes and
looks kinda like an arc pushing up to squish your lungs.

81
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,569
You also have the weight of your rib cage,
pushing on your lungs from the top and sides,

82
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:08,379
and together these forces decrease the volume
of your lungs.

83
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:12,879
When you breathe in, your diaphragm contracts,
pulling itself flat, and your external intercostal

84
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,639
muscles between your ribs contract. They lift the
ribs up and out, causing the chest cavity to expand.

85
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,719
This makes the pressure inside the lungs lower
than the air outside your body, and -- since

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,540
fluids like gases move from areas of high pressure
to low pressure -- the lungs fill up with outside air.

87
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,260
Then the diaphragm relaxes again, and the
weight of the ribs settles in, and the pressure

88
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,959
inside the lungs becomes higher than the outside
air, and the air rushes out.

89
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,239
And that, my friends, is breathing 101.

90
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Now, your respiratory system contains a lot
of parts besides your lungs -- some prominently

91
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,189
displayed on your face, others hidden deep
within your chest. And functionally, all of

92
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,310
these organs fall into one of two physiological
zones.

93
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,259
The upper parts that funnel the air in, make
up what’s known as the conducting zone,

94
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,079
and it starts with this thing.

95
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,550
Your nose is supported by bone and cartilage,
and the bristly hairs and mucus inside it

96
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,710
that help filter out dust and other particles.

97
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:05,339
But it, along with your sinuses, performs
another important function: It warms and moistens

98
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,959
incoming air, so it doesn’t dry out those
sensitive lung cells that must remain wet.

99
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,399
Remember, moisture is key. We evolved from
organisms that lived in water. So, just like

100
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,399
with our aquatic bacterial ancestors, we need
water for oxygen to dissolve into, before

101
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:22,739
it can diffuse across the phospholipid bilayer
membrane of our cells.

102
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,490
Now, if you’ve ever choked on a poorly timed
sip of water, you’ve noticed that you breathe

103
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,840
through the same tube that you also move foods
and liquids through.

104
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,899
This is yet another leftover from those first
fish lungs, which evolved as a branch off

105
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,739
the esophagus. Looking back, it was not
ideal. But we are stuck with it.

106
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,889
So, the stuff that you swallow soon encounters
the epiglottis -- a little trap door of tissue

107
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:46,528
-- which covers the larynx, and directs bites
of sandwich and sips of cola toward your esophagus

108
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:48,100
and keeps them out of your lungs.

109
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,800
And you’ll notice that the esophagus, which
heads to your stomach, is nice and flexible,

110
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,060
while your trachea, or windpipe, is rigid
and has prominent rings.

111
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,139
That’s because your trachea is basically built
like a vacuum hose -- since the lungs create

112
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:04,719
negative pressure with every breath, the trachea needs
those rings to keep it open. If it were soft and floppy,

113
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,200
it would collapse every time the pressure dropped,
and you wouldn’t be able to breathe.

114
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,519
From there, the trachea splits in two, forming
the right and left main bronchi. You can imagine

115
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,109
these inner lung parts as sort of an upside-down
tree.

116
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,270
Now we are in the lung tissue, and have entered
what we call the respiratory zone. This is

117
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:24,299
where the actual gas exchange occurs, and everything
you find here has a form to suit that function.

118
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,819
So the smaller branches of the upside-down
tree are bronchioles, which taper down into

119
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,918
progressively narrower tubes, until they empty
into the alveolar ducts and then dead end

120
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:36,839
into tiny alveolar sacs, where the bulk of
the gas exchange finally occurs.

121
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,668
Because that’s because each sac contains
a cluster of alveoli, these tiny cavities

122
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:46,120
lined with super thin, wet membranes made
of simple squamous epithelium tissue.

123
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,579
It’s here that oxygen molecules dissolve
in the wet mucous, diffuse across the epithelial

124
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,639
cells, and then cross the single layer of endothelial
cells lining the capillaries to enter the bloodstream.

125
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,199
And of course it’s also where carbon dioxide
diffuses out of the blood, and then follows

126
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,129
the same route back up to the nose and mouth,
where it’s exhaled.

127
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,800
So it’s your alveoli where diffusion meets bulk
flow. Because while you’re picking up oxygen

128
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,980
and dispensing with CO2 one molecule at a time, you're
doing it in enormous quantities at any given second.

129
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,340
Both of your lungs contain about 700 million
alveoli, which together provide an amazing

130
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:22,159
75 square meters of moist membrane surface
area.

131
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,928
So, the principles that make respiration possible
are relatively simple -- diffusion and bulk flow.

132
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,389
And so are the mechanisms in your body that
use them.

133
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,849
It just took us about 400 million years to
figure out how to make it all work.

134
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,169
But today you learned how it does work -- including
the mechanics of both simple diffusion and

135
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:41,549
bulk flow, and the physiology of breathing,
and the anatomy of the conducting zone, and

136
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,740
the respiratory zone, of your respiratory
system.
