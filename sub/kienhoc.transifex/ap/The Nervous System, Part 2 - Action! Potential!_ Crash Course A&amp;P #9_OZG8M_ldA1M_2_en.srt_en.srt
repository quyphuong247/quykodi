1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,919
What if everything you did, and thought, and
felt could be communicated by pushing a button?

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,310
It’d be like using the world’s simplest
app -- one that just sends out a little ping,

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,468
always at the same volume and length -- to
communicate everything from, “It sure is

4
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:17,009
cold in here,” to, “I love churros,” to, “Boy, I
sure would like to breathe sometime soon.”

5
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:22,940
Well, that is actually exactly how your neurons
send ALL the impulses responsible for every

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,040
one of your actions, thoughts, and emotions.

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,460
When a neuron is stimulated enough, it fires
an electrical impulse that zips down its axon

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,600
to its neighboring neurons.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,880
But they’ve only got one signal that they
can send, and it only transmits at one uniform

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,300
strength and speed.

11
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:43,259
What they can vary is the frequency or number
of pulses -- like this [buzz buzz buzz] is

12
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,640
distinct from this [buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz
buzz buzz].

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,700
And your brain can translate these signals,
reading them like binary code, organizing

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,100
them by location, sensation, magnitude, and
importance, so that you know the difference

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,179
between “turn up the thermostat” and “Oh
my gosh I’m on fire.”

16
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,840
That buzz, that nerve impulse, is called the
action potential.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,000
It’s one of the most fundamental aspects of anatomy
and physiology, and really life in general.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,170
It’s happening inside of you right now.
And we want to make sure that you understand

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,650
what all that buzz is about.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,140
Before we delve into how neurons communicate,
we’ve first got to understand a little bit

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,780
of our old friend electricity.

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,090
Basically, think of your body as a sack of
batteries.

23
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,530
NO, I mean, you don’t look like a sack of
batteries, I’m just saying that, your body

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,650
as a whole is electrically neutral, with equal
amounts of positive and negative charges floating

25
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,020
around. But certain areas are more positively
or negatively charged than others.

26
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:42,030
And because opposite charges attract, we need
barriers, or membranes, to keep positive and

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,549
negative charges separate until we’re ready
to use the energy that their attraction creates.

28
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,600
In other words, we keep ‘em separated to
build potential.

29
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,339
A battery just sitting on its own has both
a positive and negative end, and the potential

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,520
to release energy. But it doesn’t do anything
until it’s hooked up to a flashlight or

31
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,509
a phone or a kids’ toy that lets those charges
move toward each other, on the way converting

32
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,750
electricity into light, or sound, or children’s
laughter.

33
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,219
In much the same way, each neuron in your
body is like its own little battery with its

34
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:11,508
own separated charges.

35
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:15,848
It just needs an event to trigger the action
that brings those charges together.

36
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:18,560
If you’re thinking that this sounds more
like engineering than anatomy, that might

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,759
not be a bad thing. It might even help to
think of your neurons in the same terms an

38
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,039
electrician might use.

39
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:29,189
Voltage, for example, is the measure of potential
energy generated by separated charges. It’s

40
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,689
measured in volts, but in the case of your body, we
use millivolts because it’s a pretty small amount.

41
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,780
In a cell, we refer to this difference in
charge as the membrane potential. The bigger

42
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,539
the difference between the positive and negative areas,
the higher the voltage, and the larger the potential.

43
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,878
And just like there’s voltage in your body,
there’s also current -- the flow of electricity

44
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:52,478
from one point to another. The amount of charge in a
current is related both to its voltage and its resistance.

45
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,939
Resistance is just whatever’s getting in
the way of the current. Something with a high

46
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:01,120
resistance is an insulator, like plastic, and something
with a low resistance is a conductor, like metal.

47
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:05,120
Now, when we talk about these concepts in
terms of you, we’re typically talking about

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,430
how currents indicate the flow of positively
or negatively charged ions across the resistance

49
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,900
of your cells’ membranes.

50
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,719
And again, these membranes separate the charges,
so they’re what provide the potential to

51
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,019
convert the electricity into something useful.

52
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,319
K, now that we’ve got Electricity 101 down, let's
see how it works inside your nervous system.

53
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:28,518
A resting neuron is like a battery just sitting
in that sack that is you. When it’s just

54
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,370
sitting there, it’s more negative on the
inside of the cell, relative to the extracellular

55
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,378
space around it.

56
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:36,638
This difference is known as the neuron’s
resting membrane potential, and it sits at

57
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,339
around -70 millivolts.

58
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,039
Where do those charges come from?

59
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,739
Outside of a resting neuron, there’s a bunch
of positive sodium ions floating around, just

60
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,120
lingering outside the membrane.

61
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,019
Inside, the neuron holds potassium ions that
are positive as well, but they’re mingled

62
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:56,180
with bigger, negatively-charged proteins.
And since there are more sodium ions outside

63
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,900
than there are potassium ions inside, the
cell’s interior has an overall negative charge.

64
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,900
When a neuron has a negative membrane potential
like this, it is said to be polarized.

65
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,489
Now, these ions didn’t just show up in this
arrangement on their own. This is all orchestrated

66
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,769
by one of the most important bits of machinery in your
nervous system, the sodium-potassium pump.

67
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,528
This little protein straddles the membrane
of the neuron, and there are tons of them

68
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:23,368
all along the axon. For every two potassium
ions it pumps into the cell, it pumps out

69
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:24,699
three sodium ions.

70
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,478
This creates a difference in the concentration
of sodium and potassium, and a difference

71
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,808
in charges -- making it more positive outside
the neuron.

72
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:36,088
This difference is an electrochemical gradient,
and you probably know enough about biology

73
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:42,009
by now to know that NATURE HATES GRADIENTS!
It wants to even out all of those inequalities,

74
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,139
in concentration and in charge, to restore
balance.

75
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,269
But the only way to even out that gradient,
is for the ions to pass across the membrane.

76
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,680
Thankfully, the sodium-potassium pump isn’t
the only way in or out of the cell -- the

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,639
membrane is also riddled with ion channels,
large proteins that can provide safe passage

78
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,889
across the membrane, when their respective
gates are open.

79
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,809
And these gates open and close for different reasons,
depending on their structure and purpose.

80
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:10,320
Most are voltage-gated channels, which open
at certain membrane potentials, and close

81
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:15,158
at others. For example, sodium channels in
your neurons like to open around -55 mV.

82
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:20,079
But some others are ligand gated channels
-- they only open up when a specific neurotransmitter,

83
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,418
like serotonin, or a hormone latches on to
it.

84
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:25,878
And then we also have mechanically gated
channels, which open in response to

85
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,699
physically stretching the membrane.

86
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,300
In any case, when the gates do open, ions
quickly diffuse across that membrane down

87
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,360
their electrochemical gradient, evening out
the concentrations, and running away from

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,199
other positively charged ions.

89
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,038
This movement of ions is the key to all electrical
events in neurons, and thus is the force behind

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,680
every. single. thing. we think, do, and feel.

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,379
Of course, not all of your body’s electrical
responses are the same. And neither are the

92
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:51,330
flows of ions going in and out of your neurons.

93
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,838
If only a few channels open, and only a bit
of sodium enters the cell, that causes just

94
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:59,769
a little change in the membrane potential
in a localized part of the cell. This is called

95
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,058
a graded potential.

96
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:04,779
But in order to send long-distance signals
all the way along an axon, you need a bigger

97
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:08,338
change -- one big enough to trigger those
voltage-gated channels.

98
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,179
That is an action potential!

99
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,920
And your best bet for making that happen is
to depolarize that resting neuron -- I mean,

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,939
cause a big enough change in its membrane
potential that it’ll trigger the voltage-gated

101
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:19,879
channels to open.

102
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,028
It all starts with your neuron sitting there
at resting state. All of the ion channels

103
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:27,468
are closed, and the inner voltage is resting
at -70 mV.

104
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:32,060
And then something happens! Some environmental
stimulus occurs -- say like a spider brushes

105
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,429
up against a tiny hair on your knee -- triggering
those sodium channels to open, increasing

106
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,628
the charge inside the membrane.

107
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,960
Now, the stimulus -- and the resulting change
-- have to be strong enough to cross a threshold

108
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:47,438
for the true action potential to kick in and
that threshold is about -55 mV.

109
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,849
Remember that number. Because this is an all-or-
nothing phenomenon. If the stimulus is too weak, and

110
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:55,748
the change doesn’t hit that level, it’s
like a false alarm -- the neuron just returns

111
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,720
to its resting state.

112
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,520
But kind of like Doc Brown hitting 1.21 gigawatts
in the Delorean, once it hits that threshold

113
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,279
-- you’re not going to travel in time, but
you are going to see some serious action potential.

114
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,778
At that threshold, the voltage-gated sodium
channels open, and there are tons of these,

115
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:15,308
so all of the positive sodium ions rush in,
making the cell massively depolarized -- so

116
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,309
much so that it actually goes positive, up
to about positive 40 mV.

117
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:22,240
This is action potential in … action.

118
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,519
It’s really just a temporary reversal of
a membrane potential -- a brief depolarization

119
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,269
caused by changes in currents.

120
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:32,688
And unlike graded potentials, which are small
and localized, an action potential kicks off

121
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,679
a biological chain reaction, which sends that
electrical signal down the axon.

122
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:41,318
Because each of your neurons has lots of voltage-gated
sodium channels. So when a few in one area

123
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,689
open, that local current is strong enough
to change the voltage around them. And that

124
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:49,819
triggers their neighbors, which triggers the
voltage around them, and so on down the line.

125
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,408
As soon as all that’s underway, the process
of repolarization kicks in. This time the

126
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:59,149
voltage-gated potassium ion channels open
up, letting those potassium ions flow out,

127
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,069
in an attempt to rebalance the charges.

128
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:05,838
If anything, it goes too far at first, and
the membrane briefly goes through hyperpolarization:

129
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:11,769
Its voltage drops to -75 or so mV, before
all of the gates close and the sodium-potassium

130
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,579
pumps take over and bring things back to their
resting level.

131
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,998
Now when part of an axon is in the middle
of all this, and its ion channels are open,

132
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,879
it can’t respond to any other stimulus,
no matter how strong. This is called the refractory

133
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,979
period, and it’s there to help prevent signals
from traveling in both directions down the

134
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,059
axon at once.

135
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:34,639
So that is the surprisingly simple app that your
nervous system uses to let you experience the world.

136
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,359
And because the voltages in this process are
always pretty much the same -- the initial threshold

137
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,080
around -55 mV, and the peak at depolarization
at +40 mV -- your neurons only communicate

138
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,200
in a single, monotone buzz.

139
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,800
It doesn’t matter if it’s a spider on
your knee or an elephant, a paper cut or stab

140
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,539
wound, the strength of that action potential
is always the same.

141
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,289
What does change is the frequency of the buzz.

142
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:01,599
A weak stimulus tends to trigger less frequent
action potentials. And that includes if the

143
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,430
stimulus is coming from you, like your brain
telling your muscles to perform some task.

144
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:10,620
If I need to do something delicate, like pick
up an egg, the signal is low-frequency: [buzz...buzz...buzz...]

145
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,740
But a more intense signal -- like trying to
crush a can -- increases the frequency of

146
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,370
those action potentials to tell your muscles
to contract harder, and the message turns

147
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,830
into something that you can’t ignore -- [buzzbuzzbuzzbuzz]

148
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,620
Action potentials also vary by speed, or conduction
velocity.

149
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,860
They’re fastest in pathways that govern
things like reflexes, for example, but they’re

150
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,019
slower in places like your glands, guts, and
blood vessels.

151
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,039
And the factor that affects a neuron’s transmission
speed the most, is whether there’s a myelin

152
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,469
sheath on its axon.

153
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,240
Axons coated in insulating myelin conduct
impulses faster than non-myelinated ones,

154
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,339
partly because, instead of just triggering
one channel at a time in a chain reaction,

155
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,269
a current can effectively leap from one gap
in the myelin to the next.

156
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:54,110
These little gaps are the delightfully named
Nodes of Ranvier, and this kind of propagation

157
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,690
is known as saltatory conduction, from the
Latin word for “leaping.”

158
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,579
But what happens when an action potential
hits the end of its axon and is ready to do

159
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:04,958
more than leap … and jump all the way to
another neuron?

160
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,040
That you will find out next time!

161
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,349
Today you learned how your body is kinda like
a big bag o’ batteries, and how ion channels

162
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,000
in your neurons regulate this electrochemistry
to create an action potential, from resting

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,980
state to depolarization to repolarization
and a brief bout of hyperpolarization.

164
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,120
Thanks for watching, especially to all of
our Subbable subscribers, who make Crash Course

165
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,840
possible for themselves and for everyone else.
To find out how you can become a supporter,

166
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,320

167
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:33,138
This episode was written by Kathleen Yale.
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino,

168
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:37,209
and our consultant is Dr. Brandon Jackson.
It was directed by Nicholas Jenkins and Michael

169
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,799
Aranda, and our graphics team is Thought Café.

170
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,639
One more thing before you leave.

171
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,889
We like Crash Course a lot and we hope that
you like Crash Course a lot, but I kind of

172
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:48,560
feel like Crash Course is only useful for
a certain segment of the population. Like,

173
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,479
once you get to a certain age, then it's good
and then forever it can be helpful to people.

174
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,039
But younger people, not so much.

175
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,179
And so we are creating Crash Course Kids.
Hosted by Sabrina Cruz from NerdyAndQuirky,

176
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:02,669
Crash Course Kids will start out focusing
on fifth grade science, but will keep expanding

177
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,740
to other topics as the the channel grows.

178
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,980
Sabrina will be talking about food chains,
and gravity, and how the sun works, and how

179
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,300
plants eat, and why flamingos are pink, and
many other topics.

180
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:14,708
Oh, and another note: teachers, you can rest
assured that we've got you covered. There

181
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,208
will be info about the standards we've used
to make sure that we're doing our very best

182
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:22,948
to help you out. So, if you are a teacher
or you know a teacher or you know a child

183
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,728
or you know someone who has a child or you've
ever seen a child, you can tell them to go

184
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:31,639
to youtube.com/CrashCourseKids and subscribe
and you can go do that as well if you would

185
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,879
find that kind of content useful or interesting.
