1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Take a good long look at this --
we’re gonna mess with your brain.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,500
This is the first stage of an optical illusion.

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:10,620
Many illusions use patterns of light or perspective
to exploit the disconnect that exists between

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,269
sensation and perception -- between what your
eyes see and what your brain understands.

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,900
But not all illusions work that way. Some
produce ghost effects, or afterimages, that

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,180
take advantage of glitches in the physiology
of human vision.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,900
Like this flag.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,260
I’m not trying to make a political statement
here. And I’m not going ask you to swear

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,140
allegiance to the Republic of Hank or anything.
I mean, if I was gonna start my own country,

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,809
my flag would be way cooler than that -- not
that I’ve thought about that a lot.

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,339
And now, look at this white screen.

12
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:38,109
If you looked at that flag for at least 30
seconds without moving your eyes, you’ll

13
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:42,639
see something, even though this screen is
blank -- an afterimage of the flag. But instead

14
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:46,179
of being turquoise, and black, and yellow,
it’s red, white, and blue.

15
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,440
OK so that’s pretty cool, but I’m not
here just to entertain you. This kind of illusion

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,519
is actually a great way to explain your very
complex sense of vision.

17
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:58,350
And I do mean complex… nearly 70 percent
of all the sensory receptors in your whole

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,130
body are in the eyes!

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,899
Not only that, but in order for you to see,
perceive, and recognize something -- whether

20
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,530
it’s a flag or a handsome guy in glasses
and a sport coat sitting behind a desk -- nearly

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,850
half of your entire cerebral cortex has to
get involved.

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,970
Vision is considered the dominant sense of
humans and while we can get along without

23
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,830
it and it can be tricked, what you are about
to learn is NOT an illusion.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,220
When we talked about your sense of hearing,
we began with the mechanics of sound. So before

25
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,640
we get to how your eyeballs work, it makes
sense to talk about what they’re actually

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,420
seeing -- light bouncing off of stuff.

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,580
Light is electromagnetic radiation traveling
in waves.

28
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,049
Remember how the pitch and loudness of a sound is
determined by the frequency and amplitude of its wave?

29
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,619
Well, it’s kind of similar with light, except
that the frequency of a light wave determines

30
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,789
its hue, while the amplitude relates to its
brightness.

31
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:00,460
We register short waves at high frequencies
as bluish colors, while long, low frequencies

32
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,689
look reddish to us.

33
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,880
Meanwhile, that red might appear dull and
muted if the wave is moving at a lower amplitude,

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,408
but super bright if the wave has greater amplitude
and thus higher intensity.

35
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:14,000
But the visible light we’re able to see
is only a tiny chunk of the full electromagnetic

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,120
spectrum, which ranges from short gamma and
X rays all the way to long radio waves.

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,880
Just as the ear’s mechanoreceptors or the
tongue’s chemoreceptors convert sounds and

38
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,940
chemicals into action potentials, so too do
your eyes’ photoreceptors convert light

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,019
energy into nerve impulses that the brain
can understand.

40
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,979
To figure out how all this works, let’s
start with understanding some eye anatomy.

41
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,500
Some of the first things you’ll notice around
your average pair of eyes are all the outer

42
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,330
accessories -- like the eyebrows that help keep
the sweat away if you forgot your headband

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,640
at raquetball, and the super-sensitive eyelashes
that trigger reflexive blinking, like if you’re

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,239
on a sandy beach in a windstorm.

45
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,420
These features, along with the eyelids and
tear-producing lacrimal apparatus are there

46
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,110
to help protect your fragile eyeballs.

47
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,420
The eyeball itself is irregularly spherical,
with an adult diameter of about 2.5 centimeters.

48
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,680
It’s essentially hollow -- full of fluids
that help it keep its shape -- and you can

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,110
really only see about the anterior sixth of
the whole ball. The rest of it is tucked into

50
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,370
a pocket of protective fat, tethered down
by six straplike extrinsic eye muscles, and

51
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,910
jammed into the bony orbit of your skull.

52
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,480
While all this gear generally does a fantastic
job of keeping your eyeballs inside of your

53
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,040
head (which is good), on very rare occasions,
perhaps after head trauma or -- or even a

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,469
really intense sneeze! -- those suckers can
pop right out -- a condition called globe

55
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:31,329
luxation, which you really do not want to
google.

56
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:33,239
I’ll just sit here while you Google it.

57
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,299
Now, you don’t need to pop out an eyeball
in order to learn how it’s structured. I’ll

58
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,629
save you the trouble and tell you that its
wall is made up of three distinct layers -- the

59
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,719
fibrous, vascular, and inner layers.

60
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,659
The outermost fibrous layer is made of connective
tissue. Most of it is that white stuff called

61
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,670
the sclera, while the most anterior part is
the transparent cornea.

62
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,180
The cornea is like the window that lets light
into the eye, and if you’ve ever experienced

63
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,829
the excruciating pain of a scratched one,
you know how terrible it can be to damage

64
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:02,009
something so loaded with pain receptors.

65
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,380
Going down a little deeper, the wall’s middle
vascular layer contains the posterior choroid,

66
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,150
a membrane that supplies all of the layers
with blood.

67
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,680
In the anterior, there’s also the ciliary
body, a ring of muscle tissue that surrounds

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,170
the lens; but the most famous part of this
middle layer is the iris.

69
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,230
The iris is that distinctive colored part
of the eye that is uniquely yours. It’s

70
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,920
made up of smooth muscle tissue, shaped liked
a flattened donut, and sandwiched between

71
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,630
the cornea and the lens.

72
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,720
Those circular sphincter muscles -- yeah,
that’s right, you’ve got sphincters everywhere!

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,390
-- contract and expand, changing the size
of the dark dot of your pupil.

74
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,960
The pupil itself is just the opening in the
iris that allows light to travel into the

75
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,830
eye. You can see how an iris protects the
eye from taking too much light in if you shine

76
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,060
a flashlight in your friend’s eye in a dark
room. Their pupils will go from dilated to

77
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,860
pinpoints in a couple of seconds.

78
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,920
Light comes in through the cornea and pupil
and hits the lens -- the convex, transparent

79
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,590
disc that focuses that light and projects
it onto the retina, which makes up the inner

80
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,070
layer of the back of the eyeball.

81
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,860
Your retinas are loaded with millions of photoreceptors
which do the crucial work of converting light

82
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,510
energy into the electrical signals that your
brain will receive. These receptor cells come

83
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,210
in two flavors -- rods and cones -- which
I’ll come back to in a minute.

84
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,850
But the retina itself has two layers, the
outer pigmented layer that helps absorb light

85
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,960
so it doesn't scatter around the eyeball,
and the inner neural layer.

86
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,380
And this layer, as the name indicates, contains
neurons -- not only the photoreceptors but

87
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,560
also bipolar neurons and ganglion neurons.

88
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,870
These two kinds of nerve cells combine to
produce a sort of pathway for light, or at

89
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,690
least data about light.

90
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,460
Bipolar neurons have synapses at both ends,
forming a kind of bridge -- on one end it

91
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,750
synapses with a photoreceptor, and at the
other, it synapses with a ganglionic neuron,

92
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,570
which goes on to form the optic nerve.

93
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,220
So, say you’ve just been hit with a blinding
flashlight beam. That light hits your posterior

94
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,520
retina and spreads from the photoreceptors
to the bipolar cells just beneath them, to

95
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,120
the innermost ganglion cells, where they then
generate action potentials.

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,830
The axons of all those ganglion cells weave
together to create the thick, ropey optic

97
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,880
nerve -- your second cranial nerve -- which
leaves the back of your eyeball and carries

98
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,560
those impulses up to the thalamus and then
on to the brain’s visual cortex.

99
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,190
So that’s the basic anatomy and event sequencing
of human vision, but what I really want to

100
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,130
talk about are those two types of photoreceptors
-- your rods and your cones.

101
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,420
Cones sit near the retina’s center, and
detect fine detail and color. They can be

102
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,380
divided into red, green, and blue-sensitive types,
based on how they respond to different types of light.

103
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,440
But they’re not very sensitive, and they really only
hit their activation thresholds in bright conditions.

104
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,180
Rods, on the other hand, are more numerous
more light-sensitive. But they can’t pick

105
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,670
up real color. Instead they only register
a grayscale of black and white. They hang

106
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,000
out around the edges of your retinas, and
rule your peripheral vision.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,420
Since these receptors function so differently,
you might not be surprised to learn that your

108
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,150
rods and cones are also wired to your retinas
in different ways.

109
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,520
As many as 100 different rods may connect
to a single ganglion cell -- but because they

110
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,370
all send their information to the ganglion
at once, the brain can’t tell which individual

111
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,560
rods have been activated. That’s why they’re
not very good at providing detailed images

112
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,760
-- all they can really do is give you information about
objects general shape, or whether it’s light or dark.

113
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,030
Each cone, by contrast, gets its own personal
ganglion cell to hook up with, which allows

114
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,050
for very detailed color vision, at least if
conditions are bright enough.

115
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,420
And all this brings us back to that weird
flag.

116
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,950
Why does staring at this flag and then looking
at an empty white space make us see a phantom

117
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,520
flag of different colors? Well, it begins
with the fact that our photoreceptors can

118
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,060
make us see afterimages.

119
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,470
Some stimuli, like really brilliant colors
or really bright lights, are so strong that

120
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,140
our photoreceptors will continue firing action potentials
even after we close our eyes or look away.

121
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,510
The other part of the illusion has to do with
another bug in our visual programming: And

122
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,130
it’s just that our cones can just get tired.

123
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,540
If you stare long enough at a brightly colored
image, your cones will receive the same stimulus

124
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,920
for too long, and basically stop responding.

125
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,480
In the case of the flag, you looked at an
image with bright turquoise stripes. Because

126
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,540
your retinas contain red, green, and blue-sensitive
cones, the blue and green ones got tired after

127
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,310
a while, leaving only the red cones left to
fire.

128
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,590
Then, you looked at the white screen. That
white light included all of colors and wavelengths

129
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,410
of visible light. So, your eyes were still
receiving red, green, and blue light -- but

130
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,380
only the red cones were able to respond. As
a result, when the afterimage began to appear,

131
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,870
those stripes looked red.

132
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,600
The same thing happened to your rods. Except,
since they only register black and white,

133
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,300
the afterimage was like looking at a negative
of a photograph -- dark replaced with light.

134
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,190
That’s how those black stars and stripes
turned white.

135
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,920
So, yes, human vision is fallible, but those
mistakes that it makes can help us understand

136
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,698
that wonderfully complex system.

137
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:36,668
And that wonderfully complex system probably
helped you learn about the anatomy and physiology

138
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:41,559
of vision today, starting with the structure
of the eye and its three layers: the fibrous,

139
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,129
vascular, and inner layers. We spent most
of our time exploring the inner layer, which

140
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:50,209
consists of the retina and its three kinds
of neurons: photoreceptors, bipolar cells,

141
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:54,430
and ganglion neurons. And after learning how
to tell our rods from our cones, we then dissected

142
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,370
how the weird flag illusion works.
