1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,700
You’ve seen this before in a TV show or
a movie.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,320
A patient is on the table in the emergency
room, bleeding from a stab wound or having

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,640
ODed on drugs, when suddenly, an alarm goes off
and the beep beep beep on the heart monitor flatlines.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,580
It’s cardiac arrest, and you can tell just
by that sound that it’s terrible.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,000
Doctors swarm around, barking orders, and
McDreamy or Dr. Grey -- or whoever the latest

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,660
foxy doctor is on the TV show that you’re
addicted to -- grabs the paddles, pushes them

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,000
down on the patient’s chest, and is all
CLEAR! Then the

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,699
patient’s chest jumps up, and everyone stares at the
monitor waiting for those steady beeps to reappear.

9
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,399
That is a pretty classic scene.

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,780
When it comes to medical crises you see in
popular culture, it’s probably only rivaled

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,840
by the pool-side CPR scene, or someone shaking
an unconscious body, pounding on their chest

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,520
and saying “Don’t you die on me!”

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,620
Which hopefully you know is no way to keep
someone alive.

14
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,459
These are classic script tropes, but they
contribute to some misconceptions about how

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,250
defibrillators, CPR, and the electricity of
the heart work.

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,329
Because the truth is, CPR can help prolong
heart function during cardiac arrest, but

17
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,939
it usually can’t save a life without help
from a defibrillator.

18
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:06,108
And when McDreamy -- may he rest in peace
-- finally bursts out those paddles, that

19
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:10,949
high-voltage shock isn’t turning the heart
back on -- it’s actually stopping it.

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,370
Confused? Well, I’m here to get your head
to understand your heart.

21
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,780
We’ll get back to hot TV doctors in a coupla
minutes, I promise.

22
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:31,549
But in order to understand what’s actually
going on during cardiac arrest, we have to

23
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,700
understand some basics about your heart cells.

24
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:37,700
We’ve learned a lot about skeletal muscle
tissue -- how it’s striated, and contracts

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,179
using the actin-myosin sliding filament dance
you’ve heard so much about.

26
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:45,778
Your cardiac muscle is also striated, and
uses sliding filaments to contract, but

27
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,238
the similarities end there.

28
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,539
For one, their cells look pretty different.
Skeletal muscle tissue has long, multinucleate cells,

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,560
while cardiac cells are squat, branched out, and
interconnected, each one with one or two central nuclei.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,920
The cells are separated by a loose matrix
of connective tissue called the endomysium,

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,519
which is chock full of capillaries, to serve
up a constant supply of oxygen.

32
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,079
Cardiac cells are also loaded with energy-generating
mitochondria. In fact, mitochondria take up

33
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:15,310
as much as 25 to 35 percent of each cell,
making it resistant to fatigue, which is partly

34
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,610
why your heart can beat nearly 3 billion times
in a lifetime.

35
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,640
Not surprisingly, the differences between
skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues are key

36
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,828
to understanding their functions.

37
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:28,590
Skeletal muscle fibers are both structurally
and functionally separate from each other,

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,810
meaning that some cells can work while others don’t
-- that’s why you can grasp a delicate flower

39
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,349
with the same hand that you can use crush
a soda can.

40
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,718
Cardiac cells, on the other hand, are both
physically and electrically connected, all

41
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:43,250
of the time. It takes precise coordination
to create the high and low pressures required

42
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,370
to pump your blood after all, and cardiac cells need
to be linked in order to have that perfect timing.

43
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,730
And there’s one more thing you need
to know about your heart’s cells:

44
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:53,250
Some of them can generate their own electricity.

45
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,229
How in the name of Raymond de Vieussens can
that be?

46
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:00,909
Well, rewind your brain to when we explored
the electrical marvel that is the action potential,

47
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:05,919
and how it triggers both neurons and muscle
cells. That process started by depolarizing

48
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,018
the cell -- that is, pushing the cell’s
membrane potential from negative toward positive,

49
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,599
past a threshold that triggered voltage-gated
ion channels to open.

50
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,859
Most cells in your body only depolarize after
being triggered by an external stimulus, or

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,180
by a neighboring cell, in a long chain reaction of action
potentials that’s set off by the nervous system.

52
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,819
But that is not the case for a special group
of cells found only in your heart -- ones

53
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,790
that can trigger their own depolarization.

54
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:32,949
These are your pacemaker cells.

55
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,060
Pacemaker cells are what keep your heart beating
at the correct rhythm, and ensure that each

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,060
cardiac muscle cell contracts in coordination
with the others, because you don’t want

57
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,680
your brain to have to send a series of action
potentials every time you need your heart

58
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,269
to beat. Your brain has got other stuff to
do.

59
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,520
So pacemaker cells are, in a way, your heart’s very
own brain, generating the initial spark that sends a

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,480
current through your heart’s internal wiring system,
known as the intrinsic cardiac conduction system.

61
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,719
This system transmits electricity along a
precisely-timed pathway that ends with atrial

62
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:04,108
and ventricular contractions -- also known
as heart beats.

63
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,159
And it begins with pacemaker cells generating
their own action potentials.

64
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,828
In most cells, the action potential starts
with the resting potential, which the cell

65
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,048
maintains by pumping sodium ions out and potassium
ions in, Right?

66
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,519
Then, when some stimulus causes the sodium
channels open up, the sodium ions flood back

67
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,800
in, which raises the membrane potential until
it reaches its threshold. Pacemaker cells

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,470
operate the same way, except for that initial
stimulus. They don’t need it.

69
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,340
Their membranes are dotted with leaky sodium
and potassium channels that don’t require

70
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,299
any external triggers. Instead, as their channels
let sodium ions trickle in, they cause the

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,139
membrane potential to slowly and inevitably
drift toward its threshold.

72
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,778
Since the leaking happens at a steady rate,
the cells fire off action potentials like

73
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:49,139
clockwork. And the leakier the membrane gets,
the faster it keeps triggering action potentials.

74
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,399
The pacemaker cells at the start of the conduction
system have the leakiest membranes, and therefore

75
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,269
the fastest inherent rhythms, so they control
the rate of the entire heart.

76
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:02,508
And those fast, leaky cells are found in the sinoatrial 
node, or the SA node, up in the right atria.

77
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:05,869
They essentially turn the whole SA node into
your natural pacemaker.

78
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:10,180
After those pacemaker cells make themselves
fire, they spread their electrical impulses

79
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,449
to cardiac muscle cells throughout the atria.

80
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,978
The impulses leap across synapse-like connections
between the cells called gap junctions, and

81
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,579
continue down the conduction system until
they reach the atrioventricular node, or AV

82
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,818
node, located just above the tricuspid valve.

83
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:27,530
Now, when the signal hits the AV node, it
actually gets delayed for like, a tenth of

84
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:31,649
a second -- so the atria can finish contracting
before the ventricles contract.

85
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:36,120
Without that delay, all the chambers would
squeeze at once, and the blood would just

86
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:38,099
splash around and not go anywhere.

87
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:42,509
So instead, the atria contract and blood drops
down into the ventricles, and then a moment

88
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,329
later, the signal moves on and triggers the ventricles
to squeeze, making the blood flow out of the heart.

89
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,719
And there are two tricks to a good ventricular
contraction. One, the ventricles are so large

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,409
that the signal has to be distributed evenly
to ensure a coordinated contraction.

91
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:59,579
And two, the ventricles need to squeeze like
their squeezing a tube of toothpaste -- from

92
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,568
the bottom up -- to accelerate the blood through
the big arteries at the top of the heart.

93
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,989
So from the AV node, the signal travels straight
down to the inferior end of the heart and

94
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:09,930
gets distributed to both sides.

95
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,759
The path the electrical impulse takes to the bottom of
the heart is called the atrioventricular bundle, also

96
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,819
known by the more rad name, the bundle of His,
where it branches out to the left and right ventricles.

97
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:24,639
Finally, the signal disperses out into Purkinje
fibers, which trigger depolarization in all

98
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,299
surrounding cells, causing the ventricles
to contract from the bottom up like toothpaste

99
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,020
tubes, at which point the whole cycle starts
all over again.

100
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,680
And everything I just described to you -- from
when the SA node fires to when the last of

101
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,509
the ventricular cells contract -- takes about
220 milliseconds.

102
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,430
So that is how your heart beats. But I know
what you want -- you want to get back to talking

103
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,240
about TV shows and McDreamy and his paddles.
It’s totally understandable.

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,139
OK, so picture all your individual heart cells
as a bunch of musicians in an orchestra.

105
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:55,199
They all sound really great together, but
then the conductor suddenly needs to go to

106
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,930
the bathroom. And it sounds OK at first, but
then the tuba gets a little weird, and the

107
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,620
triangle is half a beat off, and soon everyone
is playing a different note at a different

108
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,470
time, jamming to their own personal rhythm.

109
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,009
In the heart, we call this out-of-sync behavior
fibrillation, and it can be caused by all

110
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:13,120
sorts of problems, especially ones that affect
the pacemaker cells in the SA node.

111
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,319
In an orchestra, this just sounds really terrible.
In a heart, there’s no coordinated contraction,

112
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,918
no lub-dub, no blood moving through the body.
Which means you will soon be dead.

113
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,798
But then the conductor comes back from the
bathroom break, taps her wand, and everybody stops.

114
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,579
It’s silent for a second before the wand comes up,
and then they all start playing again, this time in unison.

115
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,459
If your heart in fibrillation is an out-of-sync
orchestra, then a defibrillator is that conductor.

116
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,939
It stops the chaotic noise by overriding all
the individuals, and hits a sort of reset

117
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,419
button so everyone can start again on the
same page.

118
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:48,810
The paddles send so much electricity through
the heart that they trigger action potentials

119
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,759
in all of the cells at once. Then, the cells
repolarize, and start leaking again, and then

120
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,778
the most leaky cells, in the pacemaker SA
node, reach their threshold and fire first,

121
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,399
re-setting the rhythm that keeps everyone
in harmony so your heart functions properly.

122
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:07,829
And that is how hot doctors and their paddles
actually stop hearts to save lives.

123
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:12,599
Now the thing about CPR -- or cardiopulmonary
resuscitation -- is that it can’t correct fibrillation.

124
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,180
What those chest compressions can do is force
a fibrillating heart to keep circulating oxygenated

125
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,530
blood until help arrives. But if a person
is in cardiac arrest, just breathing into

126
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:25,468
their mouth and compressing their chest won’t
deliver the electricity needed to give the

127
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:27,608
pacemaking cells a chance to reset.

128
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:31,728
I think I just figured out why they call those
TV doctors heart throbs.

129
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,139
That’s a terrible joke.

130
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:37,399
Anyway, today you learned how your heart’s
pacemaker cells use leaky membranes to generate

131
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,860
their own action potentials, and how the resulting
electricity travels through the cardiac conduction

132
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,440
pathway from SA Node to Purkinje fibers, allowing
your heart to contract. And if you weren't too busy

133
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,340
daydreaming about TV doctors, you also learned how
defibrillators work to reset the rhythm of your heart.
