1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,639
We’ve been spending a lot of time lately talking
about eating, and digesting, and metabolizing food.

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,689
And those are some of my favorite things in
the world! It’s been a really great time.

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:13,240
But, as with all good parties, or brunch buffets,
in the end, we’re left with a mess.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,469
And I’m not talking about spilled beer and
Dorito crumbs, I’m talking about toxic levels

5
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:20,769
of garbage that need to be cleaned up before
they kill you.

6
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:24,949
In your body, a lot of the cleanup that comes
after metabolism is handled by the liver, which

7
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:30,980
plays a tremendous role in directing dead cells and
leftover chemicals to the digestive and urinary systems.

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,439
But your liver can’t actually escort waste
out of your person.

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,468
Your lungs can lend a hand, exhaling carbon
dioxide, and of course your colon will eventually

10
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:42,640
poop out unusable stuff and old cell-parts.
But much of your chemical waste still needs

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,619
to be sorted and disposed of, so one system
steps in to bat clean-up.

12
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,799
And that, is your urinary system.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,018
This system -- and specifically your kidneys
-- does all sorts of important homeostatic

14
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:58,158
stuff, like regulating your water volume,
ion salt concentrations, and pH levels, and

15
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,859
influencing your red blood cell production
and blood pressure.

16
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,769
But its main purpose -- what we’re going
to be focusing on for the next two lessons

17
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:08,109
-- is how it filters toxic leftovers from
your blood -- like the nitrogenous waste made

18
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,969
by metabolizing protein -- and ferries it
out of the body.

19
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:15,230
And — spoiler alert! — this all involves the
how, and the why, and the what of your pee.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,280
Now you probably know that kidneys are filters,
and you may imagine them as sieves that strain

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,790
out the bad stuff, leaving it sitting like
a hairball at the bottom of the bathtub.

22
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,570
But that is, in fact, kind of the opposite
of what you should be thinking.

23
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:42,309
Most of what’s in your blood is totally
removed by the kidneys. Then your body pulls

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,740
back what it wants to hold onto, before the
rest is sent on a one-way trip to the bladder.

25
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,459
It’s kinda like this: you don’t clean out your fridge
by just taking out the rotten fruit and fuzzy leftovers.

26
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:55,069
Instead, you’ve got to take everything out,
and put it on the counter, and then sort through

27
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,929
what goes back in the fridge and what goes
in the trash.

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,530
That’s how your urinary system cleans you
up. And it is really good at its job.

29
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,780
So this morning I decided to go the healthy
route and instead of eating my normal breakfast

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,579
of nothing, I had a big 32-ounce protein smoothie.

31
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:11,169
My digestive system did its thing, and all
the protein was hydrolyzed into amino acids,

32
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:15,218
which were absorbed by my blood, and sent
all over my body to build and repair cells.

33
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,120
It’s a beautiful thing, but not without
consequence.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,539
Because metabolizing nutrients -- especially
protein -- makes a mess.

35
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,359
You may remember that amino acids are unique,
in that they have nitrogen in their amine groups.

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,340
And because we can’t store amino acids,
extra ones get processed into storable carbs or fats.

37
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,319
But the amine group isn’t used in those
storage molecules, so it’s converted to

38
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,078
NH3, or ammonia, which happens to be toxic. So the

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,640
liver converts the ammonia into a less-toxic compound,
urea, which our kidneys filter out into our pee.

40
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,670
Once out of the body, urea can degrade back
into ammonia, which is why dirty, pee-soaked

41
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,018
toilets and cat litter boxes smell like ammonia.

42
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,579
Now this business of taking out the nitrogenous
trash is one of the urinary system’s biggest jobs.

43
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,740
Its other major duty is to regulate the balance
of salt and water in your blood, and both

44
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:03,079
of these tasks are processed in the whole
system of tubes that is your urinary system.

45
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:06,159
So let’s take a look at some basic pee-making
anatomy.

46
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,120
Your kidneys are a pair of dark red, fist-sized,
bean-shaped organs that sit on each side of

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,700
your spine against the posterior body wall.

48
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:18,689
Kidneys are retroperitoneal, which means they
lie between the dorsal wall and the peritoneum

49
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:23,419
-- the membrane that surrounds the abdominal
cavity -- rather than inside the cavity itself,

50
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,028
like your intestines and stomach do.

51
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:29,139
Each kidney has three distinct layers, beginning
with the outermost cortex.

52
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:31,919
Beneath that is the medulla,
a set of cone-shaped masses

53
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,979
of tissue that secrete urine into tiny sac-like tubules.

54
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:40,179
And finally, the innermost layer is the renal
pelvis, a funnel-shaped tube surrounded by

55
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:46,028
smooth muscle that uses peristalsis to move urine
out of the kidney, into the ureter, and into the bladder.

56
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:50,199
Because the kidneys’ main job is to filter
blood continuously, they end up seeing a lot of it.

57
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,268
In fact, at any given moment they hold over
20 percent of your total blood volume.

58
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:59,248
Oxygenated blood enters the kidneys through
the large renal arteries, which deliver nearly

59
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:03,090
a quarter of all blood pumped through the
heart every minute. That means your kidneys

60
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,669
filter about 120 to 140 liters of blood EVERY
DAY.

61
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:11,999
As they enter the kidneys, renal arteries branch many,
many times, ending in tons of little capillary groups.

62
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:16,139
So a kidney isn’t just one big filter; instead,
each one is made up of about a million twisty

63
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,959
microscopic filtering units called nephrons.

64
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,709
Structurally and functionally, nephrons are
where the real business of blood-processing

65
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:28,250
-- which, like, “pee-making” -- begins, in three steps:
filtration, reabsorption, and secretion.

66
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,759
Each nephron consists of a round renal corpuscle
that resides up in the cortex, followed by

67
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:37,740
a long and winding renal tubule that loops
around between the cortex and the medulla.

68
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,650
The outer part of the corpuscle is a cup-shaped
feature called the glomerular capsule, because

69
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,929
inside it there’s a whole tangle of capillaries
called the glomerulus -- that’s from the

70
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,060
Latin word for “ball of yarn,” which is
pretty much what it looks like.

71
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,000
And the endothelium of these capillaries is
very porous. So they allow lots of fluid,

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,889
waste products, ions, glucose, and amino acids
to pass from the blood into the capsule -- but

73
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,030
they block out bigger molecules like blood
cells and proteins, so they stay in the blood

74
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:05,758
and exit through the peritubular capillaries,
also known as the vasa recta.

75
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,389
Now, all the stuff that get squeezed out of
the blood into the glomerulus is called filtrate,

76
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:15,030
which is then sent along to the elaborately
twisting three-centimeter-long renal tubule.

77
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:18,649
Even though it looks like it’s just a tube,
it has three major parts, some of which are

78
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,899
permeable to certain substances, but not others.

79
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:26,008
First along is the proximal convoluted tubule,
or PCT, which is about as convoluted-looking

80
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:30,908
at its name suggests; then the tube drops
into a dramatic hairpin turn called the nephron

81
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:34,689
loop, or the loop of Henle -- I term I kinda
like better, personally -- and finally it

82
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:40,009
ends in the distal convoluted tubule or DCT,
which empties into a collecting duct.

83
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,680
All this twisting might make the tubule look,
like, super inefficient, but it actually serves

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
an important purpose, as you might expect.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,668
Just like with your small intestines, the
long, curly shape of the nephron provides

86
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:53,439
more time and space for it to re-absorb whatever
useable stuff it can.

87
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,610
And this meandering path also allows the parts
of the tubule that are toward the end, to

88
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,840
have an affect on processes that take place
closer to the beginning, as they pass each other.

89
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,799
Because a lot of the stuff that winds up in
the tube are valuable commodities -- like

90
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,009
ions and glucose and water -- and we don’t
want to just pee all of them out if we can help it.

91
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:15,240
So, let’s trace the whole process, starting at the
top, with the proximal convoluted tubule or PCT.

92
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,480
The walls here are made of cuboidal epithelial
cells, with big ol’ mitochondria that make

93
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,168
ATP, to power pumps that pull lots of sodium
ions from the filtrate, using active transport.

94
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:28,799
These cells also are covered in microvilli
that increase their surface area and help

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,879
re-absorb much of the good stuff from the
filtrate and back into the blood.

96
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,030
The remaining filtrate passes from the PCT
into the loop of Henle, which starts in the

97
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,698
cortex, then dips into the medulla before
coming back into the cortex.

98
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,590
And the form of this loop is key to its function,
because its primary task is to drive the re-absorption

99
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,598
of water, by creating a salt concentration
gradient in the tissue of the medulla.

100
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:52,658
It does this mainly by actively pumping out
salts in the ascending limb. This creates

101
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:56,879
some very salty interstitial fluid in the
medulla, so when new filtrate comes down the

102
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,199
descending loop in front of it, water passively
flows out, and into the super salty interstitial space.

103
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,360
Since most of this water is picked up by the
blood pretty quickly, the saltiness of the

104
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,399
interstitial space doesn’t get diluted.
So it can keep drawing water out of the next

105
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,158
batch of filtrate in the descending limb.

106
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:14,728
Needless to say, this is super important,
because if we peed out all the water that

107
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:18,029
went into our kidneys, we would die of dehydration
really quick.

108
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:21,609
But even after all that, we are still only
two thirds of the way through the process.

109
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,330
As we move out of the loop of Henle, into
the distal convoluted tubule, and on to the

110
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:29,218
collecting duct, the remaining filtrate is
now officially urine. But there’s one more

111
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:33,379
component that we have to squeeze the most
out of before we excrete the stuff. Urea.

112
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,830
Even though we think of urea as a waste product
-- just one more part of that protein shake

113
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:40,310
that has to be dumped -- the kidneys actually
need it.

114
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,459
They use it to ramp up the concentration gradient
earlier in the process, making the medulla

115
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,998
even saltier for the filtrate that’s back
there going through the ascending limb.

116
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:52,379
So in the final steps, after the filtrate
leaves the DCT, it enters the collecting duct,

117
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:57,099
which runs back into the medulla. And while
the salt passively draws even more water out

118
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:00,848
of the collecting duct, some urea passively
leaves the urine as well.

119
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:05,628
Making the medulla even more salty -- and,
in turn, more effective at drawing out water

120
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,590
from the ascending limb a few steps back.

121
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:11,478
So there’s essentially a traveling pool
of urea that escapes the urine, finds its

122
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:15,199
way back into the loop of Henle, and then
runs the whole course again back to the collecting

123
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,288
duct -- an ammonia-scented cycle called urea
recycling.

124
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:22,759
Now all that’s left is a kind of last call
to selectively sneak out any extra waste -- like

125
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,030
hydrogen, potassium, and certain organic acids
and bases -- using active transport.

126
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:31,388
This is called tubular secretion, and it transports
only select kinds of waste that have already

127
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,240
made their way into the blood that’s in the
peritubular capillaries, ready to leave the kidneys.

128
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,570
This step is kind of like emptying your pockets
of any last wads of tissue or crumpled receipts

129
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,510
as you’re walking a bag of trash to the
curb.

130
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,039
And that’s how your kidneys clean up the
mess left over from the giant party that is

131
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,539
you metabolizing food. So if you thought that
your kidneys were just a kinda fine mesh that

132
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:52,159
filtered out bad stuff? Now you know that’s
not true.

133
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,588
If you thought your urinary system was basically
a matter of: Water goes in, pee goes out?

134
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,120
That’s DEFINITELY not true.

135
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,730
And if you thought we were done talking about
your urine, that is also not true, either,

136
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,139
because next time, we’re going to learn
how your body regulates what’s absorbed

137
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:09,438
and what’s excreted, and we’ll find out 
can happen when that regulation goes awry.

138
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,200
But for now, you learned the anatomy of your
urinary system, and how your kidneys filter

139
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,440
metabolic waste and balance salt and water
concentrations in the blood. Specifically

140
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,500
you learned how nephrons use glomerular filtration,
tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion

141
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,708
to reabsorb water and nutrients back into
the blood, and make urine with the leftovers.
