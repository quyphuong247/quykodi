1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,759
You were once the size of the head of a pin.
Let’s just start out with that.

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:06,960
Two millimeters. At the most.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,179
And today -- I don’t know you, but I’m
assuming that you’re a lot larger than that.

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,759
Many, many pin-heads from head to toe.

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,250
Assuming the average human is about 1.7 meters,
it’s safe to say that you’re about 850

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,480
times taller than when you started out, as
a zygote.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,130
I think we all deserve a round of applause.
I’m very proud of us. But how did it happen?

8
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,820
How does a single cell eventually grow into
the fully-formed, several-trillion-celled

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,618
body we’ve spent all year discussing?

10
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:38,189
And for that matter, how the heck does a female
body nurture, protect, and generally tolerate

11
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:43,079
growing a whole new person inside of it -- with
all the mood swings, sore and swollen parts,

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,960
increased blood volume, constant pee breaks,
and general body weirdness?

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,399
On an emotional level, I have no idea how the mothers
-- or the zygotes, for that matter -- endure all of that.

14
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,899
But on a physiological level, like so many
aspects of our body’s functions,

15
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,519
pregnancy begins and ends with the same thing:
Hormones.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,060
Last week we left off with a sperm and an egg, against
all odds, finally getting together to make a zygote.

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,980
Now, how that tiny head of a pin gets to be
even a fraction of the size you are now -- a

18
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:24,309
newborn human that’s, say, 50 centimeters
long, is complex.

19
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,269
It involves a system of hormonal signals that
-- as sophisticated as they are -- get interpreted

20
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:31,810
by the very earliest human cells into three
simple instructions:

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,240
Divide. Differentiate. Develop.

22
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,149
The first step, dividing, begins in what’s
known as the cleavage phase, when cells cleave,

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,920
or split in two, over and over.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,420
It starts about 24 hours after fertilization,
when a little zygote turns from 1 cell into

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,700
16 cells -- called blastomeres.

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,000
The cells divide so quickly that they don’t
actually grow between divisions -- they just

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,938
create more smaller cells.

28
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:56,199
This allows each little cell to have more
surface area, which helps them take in the

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,478
oxygen and nutrients they need from their
environment.

30
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,658
And, of course, it also creates more raw
materials for building an even larger zygote,

31
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,560
and, eventually, an embryonic human.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,040
Like, you don’t make a car by carving it
from a single chunk of metal. You put together

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,980
lots of smaller components, each with its
own form and function. That’s what these

34
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,329
cells are during cleavage.

35
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,709
About three days after fertilization, these
divisions have formed a little berry-shaped

36
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,569
cluster of cells that looks different and
complex enough to get a whole new name -- a

37
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:22,289
morula, from the Latin for “mulberry.”

38
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,250
It’s one of the cuter terms you’ll come
across in human physiology, and it also marks

39
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,229
the end of the cleavage stage.

40
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:31,378
Because: The little cells that make up the
morula don’t stay together as a solid mass

41
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:35,719
-- instead, they start to form a hollow sphere
filled with fluid -- a blastocyst.

42
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:41,239
A blastocyst contains a single outer layer
of large, flat trophoblast cells, and inside

43
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,769
a cluster of smaller cells forms, called the
inner cell mass.

44
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,450
This mass is what’s going to turn into the
embryo, eventually, while the trophoblasts

45
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:51,759
will go on to form the placenta and blood
vessels that will nourish it.

46
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,039
But, keep in mind: During all of these early
divisions, the zygote, and then the morula,

47
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,590
are on the move -- they’re headed down the
fallopian tube toward the uterus.

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,530
So, in addition to manufacturing a ton of
tiny pieces and assembling them into something

49
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,009
that’s getting increasingly complex, the
whole operation is mobile. It’s kind of

50
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:08,590
like you’re building a car while you’re
driving it.

51
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,110
When the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it
just floats around for a few days, soaking

52
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,220
up secretions that are full of vitamins and
glycoproteins, looking for a place to call home.

53
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:20,139
But soon, it’s gonna need permanent nutritional
support. So, about a week after ovulation,

54
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,459
it snuggles up to the endometrial layer and
starts the process of implantation.

55
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,750
Now, up to this point, we’ve just been talking
about the zygote itself, and the changes it’s

56
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,568
been undergoing. And we’re all very proud
of it.

57
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:33,589
But from here on, the changes are best understood
not just in terms of the budding, soon-to-be

58
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,479
embryo, but in terms of the whole environment
where its changes are taking place.

59
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,238
That environment being: the mother’s body.

60
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,180
Implantation is only possible, after all,
thanks to surges of estrogen and progesterone

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,700
from the corpus luteum -- the ruptured follicle
that we talked about last time.

62
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:50,759
And together, they prepare the endometrium
to receive the blastocyst, allowing the uterine

63
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,599
lining to bind to little proteins on the trophoblasts,
holding onto them for the duration of the pregnancy.

64
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,539
If all goes according to plan, implantation
takes about five days and finishes up around

65
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,290
twelve days after ovulation, right around
when menstruation would otherwise kick in

66
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,590
and slough off the endometrium.

67
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,908
If that happened it would be bad, so the trophoblasts
secrete a luteinizing-like hormone called

68
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:11,579
human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG.

69
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,978
This hormone bypasses the whole hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian
axis -- if you remember that -- and talks

70
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,959
directly to the corpus luteum, telling it
to keep pumping out estrogen and progesterone.

71
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,389
So, the first thing to notice here is that,
from this point on, most of what happens to

72
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,449
this little clump of cells is happening because:
Hormones.

73
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,050
hCG is basically calling all the shots, triggering
the release of other hormones that are crucial

74
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,439
to the blastocyst’s development.

75
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,939
But while hormones are doing the grunt work,
you might also notice that the blastocyst

76
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:42,040
is really in charge now. Essentially, it has
taken over hormonal control of the whole uterus.

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,889
The release of hormones is that powerful.

78
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,379
In fact, a whole new -- albeit temporary -- organ
is forming at this point, too, which is going

79
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,300
to take over the hormone-controlling job -- that’s
the placenta.

80
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,918
The placenta is one of the defining and most
amazing structures in the mammalian class.

81
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,959
It’s an organ that only appears during pregnancy,
and is created by the melding of both maternal

82
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,310
and embryonic tissues.

83
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,459
Together with the umbilical cord, it provides
for the direct transfer of nutrients, hormones,

84
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,519
and wastes between mother and offspring.

85
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,269
These elements start to really take shape
after implantation is complete, and we enter

86
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:17,019
the embryonic stage. This is where the blastocyst
differentiates into various cell types and

87
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:21,849
develops into a legit embryo, surrounded by
an amniotic sac, and hooked up to the placenta.

88
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,410
And around the end of week eight, this tiny
thing is now officially a fetus.

89
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,689
Over the next several months, it rapidly develops
organ systems and bones, and grows into what

90
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,038
you see in the delivery room.

91
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,349
But rather than focus on those changes, I
want to look more at what profound, and frankly

92
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,370
sometimes bizarre, adaptations the mother
is going through.

93
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,310
The most obvious changes are of course the
anatomical changes.

94
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,629
Basically, everything’s getting huge.

95
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:47,219
Her breasts swell and engorge with blood,
and her baby bump gains dimension as the normally

96
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,289
fist-sized uterus expands, pushing organs
out of the way until it pretty much takes

97
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:54,349
up the entire abdominal cavity from the diaphragm
to the bladder.

98
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,120
The growing placenta is still secreting estrogen
and progesterone, but it’s also pumping

99
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,069
out relaxin, a hormone that loosens joints
and ligaments to increase flexibility, and

100
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,360
it also releases human placental lactogen,
or hPL.

101
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,210
This hormone cocktail does helpful stuff like
tell the fetus to grow, and get the breasts

102
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:14,939
ready to lactate, and it also causes the mother’s
body to start hoarding glucose for the fetus to use.

103
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,519
This increase in metabolism, combined with
the fact that the kidneys also have to process

104
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:23,259
waste from the fetus, leads to greater urine production,
which every expectant mother is familiar with.

105
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:27,918
It also has a huge effect on the cardiovascular
system, because a pregnant woman’s blood

106
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,399
volume can increase by as much as 40 percent.

107
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,779
40 PERCENT!

108
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,599
Imagine walking around with an extra 2 liter
bottle’s worth of blood in your body, and

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
how much harder your heart would have to work
to move it all around.

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,889
This increased blood flow and pressure can
actually make your gums swell and bleed, and

111
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:47,680
fluid retention can literally change the shape
of your corneas, potentially blurring your vision.

112
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,240
Not only that, but the expanded uterus compresses
pelvic blood vessels, affecting veins’ ability

113
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,810
to bring blood up from the lower limbs, resulting
in swelling, varicose veins, and if all that

114
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,399
weren’t bad enough, hemorrhoids.

115
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,579
Fortunately, every pregnancy eventually comes
to an end, usually about 38 to 40 weeks after

116
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:05,430
fertilization, if all goes as planned.

117
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,560
But unfortunately, the process of getting
the baby out is pretty much a painful mess.

118
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,629
Ask any mother -- giving birth is not for
the faint of heart.

119
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:18,519
The process of preparing the body for labor,
and then actually initiating it, begins -- AGAIN!

120
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,848
-- with a change in hormones.

121
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:23,310
Up until the last few weeks before birth,
the placenta has been kicking out equally

122
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,709
high amounts of both progesterone and estrogen.

123
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,930
One of progesterone’s main jobs has been
to keep the smooth muscles in the uterus relaxed,

124
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,759
so they can’t contract and stimulate labor
too early.

125
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,490
But as the due date nears, the mother undergoes
a sudden decline in progesterone.

126
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,310
Now, estrogen takes over. This is partially
because the fetus itself is ready to go, and

127
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,300
it starts releasing hormones like cortisol,
that tell the placenta to release even more

128
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,288
estrogen to get the uterus ready for birth.

129
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:51,348
Just like hCG calls the shots around the
time of implantation, here estrogen is

130
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:52,879
barking out all kinds of orders.

131
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,728
For one thing, it prepares the uterus to start
receiving new chemical signals, by triggering

132
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:00,709
its myometrial cells to start making receptors
for the hormone oxytocin.

133
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:05,310
It also triggers the formation of gap junctions
between smooth muscle cells in the uterus

134
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,389
-- this will let individual muscle cells contract
simultaneously when the time comes.

135
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,810
Then, as labor nears, special cells in the
fetus itself start secreting oxytocin, which

136
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,180
binds to all the newly-minted receptors and
tells the placenta to release prostaglandins.

137
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,319
Together, both of these hormones -- oxytocin
and prostaglandins -- stimulate the uterine

138
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,979
muscles to start contracting.

139
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:27,909
When the contractions get strong enough to
distend the cervix, it stimulates the release

140
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,169
of even more oxytocin and prostaglandins,
which keep the contractions rolling in one

141
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:35,299
big positive feedback loop, initiating labor.

142
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:39,019
The earliest stage of labor, dilation, is
the period from when the first contractions

143
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,950
begin, to when the cervix becomes fully dilated,
to about 10 centimeters.

144
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,589
During this time, each new contraction pushes
the infant’s head against the cervix, causing

145
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,339
the cervix to thin and dilate.

146
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:54,110
Once the cervix is fully dilated, the mother
should feel urge to push. The resulting expulsion

147
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,019
stage lasts from full dilation through crowning
and actual delivery, as the infant is pushed

148
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,490
head-first through the cervix and out the
vagina.

149
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,589
But even after the baby is out, the mother
still has a placenta to get out. Within about

150
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:10,690
30 minutes of delivery, strong contractions
carry out the placental stage of labor, dislodging

151
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,940
the placenta from the uterine wall to deliver
the so-called afterbirth.

152
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,160
Then, finally, the mother can rest, and marvel
at how her body just built another tiny body

153
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,459
inside it -- complete with all the complex
systems we’ve spent the last year talking about.

154
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,820
And maybe someday that little baby will grow
up and get a twinkle in its eye, and combine

155
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,269
alleles with somebody else, and start the
whole process over again.

156
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,480
And that is how the human race continues to
exist.

157
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,850
Today you learned about the stages of pregnancy,
beginning with how a zygote develops into

158
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,100
blastomeres to a morula to a blastocyst and
finally to an embryo and a fetus. You also

159
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,000
learned about the amazing anatomical changes
that take place in the mother, and the hormonal

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,089
sequence of events that lead to labor. After
that, all you have to worry about is how you’re

161
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:53,620
gonna put the little thing through college.

162
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,700
