1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,540
Why is everybody so worried about high blood
pressure?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,500
I mean, of all of the millions of things that could go
fatally wrong in your body at any given moment,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,559
it doesn’t seem like the biggest threat you face is
that your blood might be pumping a little too hard.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,280
A heartbeat that’s too strong? Isn’t that
like an awesome song that’s played too loud?

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,400
Or nachos with too much cheese?!

6
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,899
Well, no.
The fact is:

7
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:25,119
You’re more likely to die from diseases related to
your cardiovascular system than anything else.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,080
And probably you would like to know why.

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,089
Well, we know that blood pressure is the circulatory
system’s way of getting your five liters

10
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:36,320
of blood flowing throughout your body, so that your
tissues can get the oxygen and nutrients they need.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,020
But chronic high blood pressure, or hypertension,
can cause serious damage to both the heart

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,980
that creates the high pressure, and to the blood
vessels that have to withstand that extra pressure.

13
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,399
Over time, the increased force of blood against
the arterial walls can make them stiffen, leak,

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,519
or rupture, while the heart itself may simply wear out
from all the extra work it’s doing to keep blood moving.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,940
Luckily, your nervous and endocrine systems
have some tricks to try and balance blood

16
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:03,599
pressure when it gets too high or too low,
in an effort to create homeostatic balance.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,340
But, even with these defenses in place, if
your blood pressure stays out of balance long

18
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,169
enough, things will start going really, really
wrong.

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,079
One in three adults in the U.S. has high blood
pressure -- that’s two in six, that’s

20
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:17,978
three in nine -- and often there are often
no symptoms until it’s too late.

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,159
Just like your favorite song turned up to
11, or an unlimited supply of nacho cheese,

22
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,519
even your own life-giving blood can become…too
much of a good thing.

23
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,099
Part of what might seem confusing about high
blood pressure is the seemingly random list

24
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:44,688
of things that can contribute to it, some
of which are easier to control than others.

25
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,678
There’s emotional stress. Physical exertion.
Dehydration. Too much salt on your mashed

26
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:51,618
potatoes. Or too much butter on your bacon.
Why are we buttering bacon?

27
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,900
But all these things can in some way affect
how efficiently your blood flows. But in order

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,978
to understand why your heart hates french fries, you
first have to understand how blood flow works.

29
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:05,140
When we talk about blood flow, what we’re
talking about is the volume of blood flowing

30
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,710
through any given vessel, or through the circulatory
system as a whole, per minute.

31
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,050
This is also called cardiac output, and it’s
determined by the blood volume pumped during

32
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,980
one beat, and the number of beats per minute.

33
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:19,389
Now, if you’ve ever used a garden hose,
or fixed a leaky sink, or had any other hands-on

34
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,949
experience with fluids, then you know that
flow can change in response to a number of

35
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:26,289
factors, especially those that affect resistance.

36
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:29,439
Resistance is just anything that hinders flow
or creates friction.

37
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,859
In the case of your blood, resistance can
be the result of increased viscosity -- the

38
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,630
thicker your blood is, the harder it is to
move -- or it could be because of increased

39
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,060
vessel length, since longer vessels are more
resistant to flow in general.

40
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,099
But those factors tend to be pretty constant
in your body over time. Instead, for most

41
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,879
people, the biggest factor that affects resistance
has to do with vessel diameter.

42
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,219
Changes in diameter can be temporary, like
during vasoconstriction or vasodilation -- when

43
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,520
the diameter increases or decreases, allowing
more or less blood through.

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,800
But an excess of low-density lipoprotein,
or LDL, the so-called “bad” cholesterol,

45
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,710
in the blood can build up to form a fatty
plaque on the inside of your arteries, permanently

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,670
increasing the resistance, and hindering blood
flow.

47
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:11,319
So your blood pressure, blood flow, and resistance
are all tied together. In fact,

48
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,379
they’re so closely and predictably tied together that we
can even express their relationship mathematically.

49
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:19,750
Among the truths contained in this equation
is the fact that blood flow increases as the

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,340
difference in blood pressure between two points
increases.

51
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,479
Remember: The ventricles of the heart create
very high pressure, while the atria, or the

52
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,560
receiving chambers of the heart, have very
little pressure, at least while the body’s at rest.

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,569
So, the bigger the gap is between the high
pressure in your ventricles and aorta, and

54
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,599
the low pressure in your vena cava and atria, the
faster a liter of blood will flow through your system.

55
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,560
If you have to back up a few times to review
that, nobody’s gonna judge you.

56
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:45,989
Now, at the same time, blood flow decreases
as resistance increases.

57
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,360
So, with a little algebraic rearranging, you can
see that blood pressure equals blood flow,

58
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,900
or cardiac output, times resistance.

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,400
In theory, this means that any change in resistance
or cardiac output would also change blood pressure.

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,280
But when any one of these variables actually
does change, your body tries its best to compensate

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,439
for it, in its eternal quest to maintain homeostasis.

62
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:11,539
And it accomplishes this in a few different ways,
mainly using neurons, hormones, and the kidneys.

63
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:16,019
One major short-term fix to wonky blood pressure
comes from your brain, which targets both

64
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,230
cardiac output and resistance, by altering
the distribution of the blood flow around

65
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,170
the body, or by changing the diameter of certain
blood vessels.

66
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,980
This comes in handy when you’re walking
up fourteen flights of stairs in your apartment

67
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,230
building with three bags of groceries. The
vessels feeding your digestive organs constrict,

68
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,069
which increases resistance there, so more
blood goes to the skeletal muscles in your legs.

69
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:38,930
Most neural responses like this use baroreceptors,
special nerve endings found in the carotid

70
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,160
arteries, the aorta, and other larger arteries
in the neck.

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,460
When blood pressure stretches arterial walls,
that opens mechanically-gated sodium channels

72
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:50,149
in these little receptors. The higher the
blood pressure is, the more frequently they

73
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:54,659
send action potentials to the midbrain informing
it just how much pressure the artery is feeling.

74
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,780
When the brain learns what’s happening,
it can do any number of things to correct

75
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,189
the situation -- like dilate some arterioles
to reduce resistance, or reduce the heart

76
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:05,750
rate to lower cardiac output -- and these
things work pretty well for a while.

77
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,199
But baroreceptors are not effective for long-term
pressure changes, in part because they end

78
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:15,089
up adapting, essentially reprogramming themselves
to read a high blood pressure as the new normal.

79
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:18,349
Now, other short-term effects on your blood
pressure come from your hormones.

80
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,510
We’ve already talked about one classic example:
when your body actually needs a little high

81
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,430
blood pressure -- like when it has to get
ready to fight or flee -- the adrenal medulla

82
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,389
starts flooding your blood with epinephrine
and norepinephrine.

83
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:33,139
These hormones raise both the heart rate and the blood
volume, and therefore cardiac output, while also

84
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,240
constricting vessels in less essential regions, increasing
the overall resistance, and therefore pressure.

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,240
And again, just like with neural controls,
these hormonal controls work by changing vessel

86
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,350
resistance and cardiac output.

87
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,450
But the way to get more long-term control
of blood pressure is to alter the blood volume,

88
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,490
and for that, you need the kidneys.

89
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,160
Your kidneys cook up hormones like renin and
angiotensin which help regulate levels of

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,460
sodium and fluids in your body, and also help
expand and constrict blood vessels.

91
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,180
And when blood pressure gets too high, your
kidneys will try to reduce the volume of

92
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,840
blood, by getting rid of any extra water.
Basically, they make you pee.

93
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,310
Blood volume, by the way, is partly why sodium
is the root of all evil in blood pressure

94
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,790
treatments: The excess sodium used in processed
foods and salty snacks causes your body to

95
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,819
retain water, which creates higher blood volume
and leads to higher blood pressure, which,

96
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,329
you know, is a bummer.

97
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:25,839
So, those are some of your body’s automatic
solutions for high blood pressure.

98
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,029
But how it compensates for sustained high
blood pressure will almost certainly lead

99
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:34,089
to trouble -- either for the heart that has
to work harder to overcome the resistance,

100
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,729
or for the vessels that have to take that
extra pressure.

101
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,280
An increase in either blood flow or resistance
leaves the heart struggling to do its job, so it might

102
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,319
actually build more muscle around that left ventricle 
to help generate the force needed to move the blood.

103
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,180
Now, a more muscley heart may not sound like
a bad thing, but trust me, it is.

104
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,540
Why? Well, because more muscle needs more oxygen,
and your body just can’t create new blood

105
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,200
vessels to feed that super-sized ventricle.
So that big muscle is left starving.

106
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,819
It’s literally a hungry heart.

107
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,980
Plus, if you have cholesterol plaques in your
arteries, then you probably have them in your

108
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,730
coronary arteries, which carry oxygen and
nutrients to the heart muscle itself. That

109
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,629
increases the resistance, and therefore decreases
blood flow to the heart muscle. So you have

110
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:20,589
this bigger, hungrier heart muscle, but its
nutrient supply is diminished, and eventually

111
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:22,579
those heart muscle cells can slowly die.

112
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:25,379
When that happens, it’s known as heart failure.

113
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,480
Or, if you completely block one of those coronary
arteries with plaque, or maybe a blood clot,

114
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,270
a whole bunch of heart cells quickly starve
to death.

115
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:36,469
And that can lead to a myocardial infarction,
which is what we also call a heart attack.

116
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,060
And then we’ve got the problems on the blood
vessel end, under sustained hypertension,

117
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,939
you may see your otherwise elastic arteries
go from being flexible balloons to stiff,

118
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,980
hardened pipes, in what’s called arteriosclerosis.

119
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,220
Or… the high pressure may make them weak
and bulgy in spots, until they’re stretched

120
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,340
too thin and leak or burst.

121
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,419
And that is an aneurysm.

122
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,560
And if the weak spot ruptures in a smaller
arteriole blood vessel -- say, one that leads

123
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,280
to an organ like a kidney or eye, it can lead
to organ damage or failure.

124
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,859
So although having a huge, strong flow of
blood coursing through your body might sound

125
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,740
like some kind of comic book-caliber superpower,
it is not.

126
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,040
It’s just too much of a good thing.

127
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,670
That’s why you just learned, first and foremost
that you should not butter your bacon -- and

128
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,040
also what blood flow and resistance are, and
how they relate, in direct proportion, to

129
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,389
blood pressure. We also looked at your body’s
short term responses to high blood pressure

130
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:32,379
-- including neural, hormonal, and kidney
response -- and wrapped up by describing all

131
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,938
of the ways that chronic high blood pressure
can kill you.
