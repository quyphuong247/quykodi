1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,339
Here’s a couple of words you might find
useful in the study of human metabolism.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,259
They also happen to be two words that I enjoy
in general.

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,400
Brunch. Buffet.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,620
I’d throw in “all you can eat,” but
that’s kind of implied, and then it would

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,200
be six words, unless you hyphenate them. But
still, brunch buffet!

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,338
You’ve got eggs and bacon and french toast
and biscuits and fruit and some kind of weird

7
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:23,118
sort of jello thing in there. And once you’ve
paid your twelve-ninety-nine, you know there’s

8
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:24,969
a pretty good chance that it’s all gonna
get eaten.

9
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:25,969
But here’s the thing.

10
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,818
Not everything that you fit into your face
during brunch-time is going to be handled

11
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:31,149
the same way by your body.

12
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,219
After you’re done digesting, some nutrients
will go straight to your body’s pile of

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,339
stuff to burn right away. But others will
have to be converted into something else.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,290
For example, the carbs and fats in your buttered
toast can be directly oxidized into useable

15
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,500
energy, but the amino acids in the bacon have
to converted to molecules that get broken

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,799
down like carbs, if you want to get energy
out of them.

17
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,759
And while excess carbs and fat can be stored
in larger, polymer versions of their original

18
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:59,559
forms, any extra amino acids can’t be -- they have to
be converted and then stored as fat or glycogen.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,759
So, as I’ve mentioned before, the molecules
in your body are constantly changing shape,

20
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,379
and renewing and rearranging themselves to
either build things or to use energy.

21
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:12,509
And eating food replenishes these nutrients
-- especially glucose. Then, depending on

22
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:16,819
what your body needs, and when you last ate,
certain hormones like insulin will help decide

23
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,899
what to burn, and what to store for later.

24
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:23,379
This, of course, is an important function.
Which is why things can go badly if this process

25
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,349
doesn’t work properly because of a metabolic
disorder, like diabetes.

26
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:30,298
In that case, your body can’t properly use
and store nutritional energy, which makes

27
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,749
the very acts of eating and metabolizing more
difficult, and possibly dangerous.

28
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:39,468
Exactly how glucose levels can spike or plummet,
how we convert nutrients into energy, and

29
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:42,888
how all of that that relates to eating, and
hunger, and weight, metabolism, and your health

30
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:45,039
in general is -- guess what? -- complicated.

31
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:49,218
But as you are a living thing that must eat
in order to stay alive, I’d say it’s worth

32
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,599
learning how it works.

33
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,839
And brunch is as good a place to start as
any.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,219
Waiting in line for the all-you-can-eat brunch
buffet is a good time to recall the law of

35
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:08,478
conservation of energy.

36
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:13,258
The law simply states that energy can never
be created or destroyed; it can only change forms.

37
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,189
And the processes of metabolism involves conversions
of energy -- either through catabolizing reactions

38
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:23,419
that release the energy stored in your food,
or anabolizing ones that use or store that energy.

39
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:28,280
So, you can enjoy your short-stack of flapjacks
and biscuits and gravy, but remember: That

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,890
energy has to either get released, or stored,
somewhere inside you.

41
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:35,569
Now, the conversion of food energy is part
of the great balancing act that is maintaining

42
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:39,449
homeostasis, and one of its greatest tricks
is cellular respiration.

43
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:43,659
Cellular respiration is how we derive energy
from the food we eat, specifically glucose,

44
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:45,199
which is where most of our food ends up.

45
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,039
In order for glucose to become energy we can
use, we have to to give it some oxygen, and

46
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,090
convert each sugar molecule into six molecules
of CO2, and six molecules of water, which

47
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,140
usually produces about 32 molecules of ATP.

48
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,859
Cellular respiration occurs in three simultaneous
phases, where glucose is broken down by glycolysis

49
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,980
and other catabolic reactions; and then turned
into pyruvic acid and acetyl CoA; and finally

50
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,709
ushered into the Kreb’s cycle.

51
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,290
It’s all pretty complicated, but we covered
it extensively in Crash Course Biology, so

52
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,650
rather than getting into the blow-by-blow here, I
recommend you check out that video for a refresher.

53
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,590
For now, just remember that cellular respiration
breaks down nutrient molecules to generate

54
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,830
ATP. And in doing so, it captures some of
the chemical energy that was in those bonds

55
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,020
for use in your body.

56
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,740
Now, when it comes to how that energy is converted
and where, that depends largely on when you

57
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,939
ate your last meal.

58
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,750
We all switch back and forth between two nutritional
states -- the absorptive, or fed state -- which

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,759
is during or after eating -- and the postabsorptive,
or fasting state, when the GI tract is empty

60
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,620
and the body is running off of stored supplies.

61
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,659
So, say you’re just post brunch-buffet,
and you’re still in the absorptive state,

62
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,750
unbuckling your belt as your digestive system
breaks up the eggs and bacon and French toast

63
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,060
and syrup into a bunch of mostly-glucose molecules
that pass into your bloodstream.

64
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,030
The first bit of glucose gets delivered throughout
the body and is tapped to generate ATP on

65
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,240
the spot, through cellular respiration.

66
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,830
But since the meal was big and rich, there’s
more glucose floating around than your cells

67
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,000
need at the moment.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,650
And remember, ATP is too unstable to be used
for storage, which means all the extra glucose

69
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,039
is gonna get stored as fat or glycogen.

70
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,680
And that storage is part of how you can end
up gaining weight!.

71
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,740
Because: How much energy gets stored depends
partly on your basal metabolic rate -- that’s

72
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,009
the number of daily calories your body needs
to do business as usual.

73
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,750
And that rate can be influenced by your age,
your sex, and body size or composition. A

74
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,420
young bodybuilder is gonna burn way more calories
than that tiny grandma, but generally, if

75
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,379
you’re absorbing more nutrients than you’re
burning, you will gain weight.

76
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,769
So yeah, for that you can blame the law of
conservation of energy.

77
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:44,769
Now, of course all nutrients are important.
I mean, your body is basically made of protein,

78
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,240
so that’s kinda key.

79
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,720
But in terms of immediate fuel, glucose is
the easiest source of food for cells like

80
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,630
your neurons. And it is always good policy
to keep your brain well-fed, so it doesn’t

81
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,209
get hangry, or dead.

82
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:01,529
So, your body likes to maintain a blood glucose
level of 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter.

83
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:05,750
But let’s say that, thanks to the buffet,
you’ve now got 140 milligrams per deciliter.

84
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,740
This means too much sugar is swimming around
in your blood, and your body isn’t happy about it.

85
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,560
If your blood sugar levels get too high, it
can damage blood vessels, especially those

86
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:16,779
in the nervous system, heart, kidneys, eyes,
and extremities.

87
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:21,019
That’s why diabetes is often associated
with a higher risk of heart and kidney disease,

88
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,370
loss of vision, and foot amputation.

89
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,810
But typically, rising blood sugar levels sets
off a series of events that trim them back down.

90
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,000
Specifically, they trigger special beta cells
in the pancreas to start secreting more of

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,439
the hormone that regulates everything that
happens when you’re in the absorptive state.

92
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,600
And this hormone is the all-powerful insulin.

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,310
Insulin’s job in this instance is to move
glucose out of the blood and into storage.

94
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,410
And to do that, it triggers a shift from catabolic
reactions to anabolic ones.

95
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,439
For example, it puts a stop to glycogenolysis,
or breaking down glycogen in your liver and

96
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,990
muscles to release glucose for energy, and
instead ramps up the process of glycogenesis,

97
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,949
where extra glucose is linked together to
form glycogen.

98
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,910
It also activates lipogenesis, where very
cool chemical reactions in the liver convert

99
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,939
glucose to triglycerides and then ship them
off to your adipose tissue for storage.

100
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,839
A similar thing happens with the extra fatty
acids that you got from the eggs and bacon

101
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,489
that aren’t immediately needed for energy.

102
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,340
They get processed through lipogenesis, too,
and are rebuilt back into triglycerides, and

103
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:17,918
then tucked away for a rainy day.

104
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,660
The thing is, if you’re thinking about this, all these
lipids hate water, right? Fat and water don’t mix.

105
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,360
So you should be asking yourself, how can they be
transported in the blood, when they’re so hydrophobic?

106
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,680
The answer is lipoproteins, four specialized
proteins made by the liver that surround fats

107
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,250
and allow them to move in the bloodstream
as an emulsion.

108
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,000
You’ve probably heard of some of these.
One is low density lipoprotein -- also known as

109
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:44,859
LDL cholesterol. It’s what delivers some of the glucose
and fat that you just ate to your body’s fat deposits.

110
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,280
Another is high density lipoprotein -- or
HDL cholesterol, which is the “good” cholesterol.

111
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,219
It starts out as an empty protein packet sent
out by the liver to gather up other cholesterols

112
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,860
from the blood, and artery walls, and other
cells.

113
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,650
HDL then delivers the cholesterol back to
the liver, or to places like the ovaries,

114
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:04,879
testes, and adrenal glands, which use it to
make steroid hormones.

115
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,219
Alright, so now your body has put all the
glucose and lipids and proteins where they

116
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,970
need to go, and you can just coast into the
postabsorptive state.

117
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,389
But several hours later, even though your
small intestine is still working on what’s

118
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:20,210
left of the buffet, your cells have been helping
themselves to the remaining glucose in theblood,

119
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,719
and eventually your blood sugar level will
start to drop.

120
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,510
Remember, your neurons are on an exclusive
glucose meal plan, so they need sugar at the

121
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,740
ready. And if your body senses an imbalance
in blood sugar levels, it sounds the alarm.

122
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,500
A decrease in glucose stimulates alpha cells
in the pancreas to release insulin’s nemesis,

123
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,920
the hormone glucagon.

124
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,168
It starts raising the blood sugar level, by
triggering the liver and adipose tissues to

125
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:47,428
metabolize their fat and glycogen stores,
thereby releasing fatty acids, glycerol, and

126
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:48,939
glucose back into the blood.

127
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,829
But if it’s been a day or two since you’ve eaten --
for some reason -- and you’ve burned through

128
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:57,379
both your blood glucose and your glycogen stores,
and you don’t have any sugars left to feed your brain?

129
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:03,610
In that case, your body will launch into gluconeogenesis,
and convert fats and amino acids into glucose,

130
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,310
so ATP synthesis can continue in your brain
cells.

131
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,459
This process is a sort of last-ditch effort
by the body to protect the nervous system

132
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,439
from the damaging effects of low blood sugar.

133
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,290
Now, of course, this whole system has flaws.
And one of them is that the whole setup is

134
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,449
almost entirely dependent on the proper release
and reception of insulin.

135
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,389
People with diabetes either don’t produce
enough insulin, or have abnormal receptors

136
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:27,800
for it, which is why they often have to inject a
pharmaceutical version of the chemical after eating.

137
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,879
Otherwise, their blood sugar levels will remain
too high after eating, and they’ll start

138
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,460
peeing out large amounts of glucose to try
and balance the levels in their blood.

139
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,750
The problem is, because glucose is being excreted
and not stored, it’s not available when

140
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,099
the blood sugar starts to drop, so the body
has to draw on fat and protein tissues for

141
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,070
energy -- which is one reason why sudden weight
loss can be an early sign of diabetes.

142
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,610
Whether you’re diabetic or not, I think
we can all agree it is important to respect

143
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,100
your blood sugar levels, and remember to continue
feeding the beast.

144
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,950
But, at brunch, just -- you know -- use small
plates, and try to keep the trips to the buffet

145
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,830
to under five or so.

146
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,940
Today, you learned how your body uses energy
from food -- including through cellular respiration,

147
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,290
which converts glucose into ATP; glycogenesis,
which converts it to glycogen; and lipogenesis,

148
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:15,699
which converts it to triglycerides. And you
also learned how insulin regulates your sugar

149
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,050
levels.
