1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,359
Case study of the day: Olivia, she was a healthy
35-year-old woman.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,250
Until one spring day, when she got into a
bad bike accident, and suffered serious head

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,970
trauma. The doctors patched her up, but after
a couple of days in the hospital, she noticed

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,480
something strange was happening.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,190
Or, rather, something wasn’t happening - she
could no longer smell.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,650
Not the flowers in her room, not the nurse’s
rubber gloves, not even the horrible hospital food.

7
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:25,899
In the weeks that followed, she blackened
a batch of cookies because she couldn’t

8
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,709
smell them burning. She couldn’t smell the
lilacs blooming, or her husband’s aftershave,

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,588
or her car overheating. She drank expired milk
because she couldn’t taste that it had gone sour.

10
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:38,219
The world got a lot less interesting: eating
wasn’t very exciting, and Olivia started

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,599
getting depressed. Life felt sterile and unfamiliar.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
Olivia had anosmia -- a partial or complete
loss of the sense of smell (and with it, most

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,619
of her ability to taste).

14
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:52,439
This unfortunate condition is caused by things
as diverse as head trauma, respiratory infections,

15
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:53,928
even plain old aging.

16
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,120
And I say “unfortunate” because, what
we sense informs who we are.

17
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,908
But how we experience our six major special
senses all boils down to one thing: sensory

18
00:01:02,908 --> 00:01:07,868
cells translating chemical, electromagnetic,
and mechanical stimuli into action potentials

19
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,129
that our nervous system can make sense of.

20
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:13,849
This process is called transduction, and each
sense works in its own way.

21
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:18,309
Our vision functions with the help of photoreceptors,
cells that detect light waves, while our senses

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,000
of touch, hearing, and balance use mechanoreceptors
that detect sound waves and pressure on the

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,599
skin and in the inner ear.

24
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,618
But our sense of taste, or gustation, and
smell, or olfaction, are chemical senses.

25
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:34,250
They call on chemoreceptors in our taste buds
and nasal passages to detect molecules in

26
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,299
our food and the air around us.

27
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,439
These chemical senses are our most primitive,
and our most fundamental. They’re actually

28
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,978
sharpest right at birth, and they’re so
innate that newborns orient themselves chiefly

29
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:48,899
by scent. They can not only taste the difference
between their mother’s milk and another

30
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,759
mom’s, but they can even smell her
breasts from clear across the room!

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,999
Tastes and smells are powerful at activating memories,
triggering emotions, and alerting us to danger.

32
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:03,098
They also help us enjoy the small things that
make life worth living…like pizza.

33
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,860
All right, I’m about to perform a superhuman
feat and sit here with this amazing slice

34
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,710
of Hawaiian pizza WITHOUT EATING IT, so that
I can describe it to you how we smell things.

35
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,950
So if it sounds like I’m going faster during
this episode, it’s not like I don’t enjoy

36
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,399
our time together; I just want to get to the
part where I actually get to eat the pizza.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,760
Now, the process starts as I sniff molecules
up into my nose. This means that for you to

38
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,069
be able to smell something, the odorant must
be volatile, or in a gaseous state to get

39
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,379
sucked up into your nostrils.

40
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,780
And yes, that means when you smell poop there
are actual poo particles up in your nose.

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,180
The harder and deeper you sniff, the more
molecules you vacuum up, and the more you

42
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,280
can smell it.

43
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:49,979
Most of these molecules are filtered out on
the way up your nasal cavity, as they get

44
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,979
caught by your protective nose hairs, but
a few make it all the way to the back of the

45
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,369
nose and hit your olfactory epithelium.

46
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,120
This is your olfactory system’s main organ
-- a small yellowish patch of tissue on the

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,870
roof of the nasal cavity. The olfactory epithelium
contains millions of bowling pin-shaped olfactory

48
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,230
sensory neurons surrounded by insulating columnar
supporting cells.

49
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,819
So these airborne pizza molecules -- many
of which are just broken-off parts of fats

50
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,500
and proteins -- land on your olfactory epithelium
and dissolve in the mucus that coats it.

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,620
Once in the mucus, they’re able to bind
to receptors on your olfactory sensory neurons,

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,420
which, assuming they hit their necessary threshold,
fire action potentials up their long axons

53
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:32,159
and through your ethmoid bone into the olfactory
bulb in the brain.

54
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:36,369
But here’s the wonder of specialization
for you: Each olfactory neuron has receptors

55
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,039
for just one kind of smell.

56
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,340
And any given odorant, like this pizza, is
made up of hundreds of different chemicals

57
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,039
that you can smell, like the thymol of the
oregano, the butyric acid of the cheese, and

58
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,659
the acetylpyrazine of the crust.

59
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:51,680
So, after each smell-specific neuron is triggered,
the signal travels down its axon where it

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,280
converges with other cells in a structure
called a glomerulus.

61
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,870
This takes its name from the Latin word glomus,
meaning “ball of yarn” -- which is what

62
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,180
it looks like, a tangle of fibers that serves
as a kind of a transfer station, where the

63
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,150
nose information turns into brain information.

64
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,539
Inside the glomerulus, the olfactory axons
meet up with the dendrites of another kind

65
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,139
of nerve cell, called a mitral cell, which
relays the signal to the brain.

66
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,589
So for each mitral cell, there are any number
of olfactory axons synapsing with it, each

67
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,969
representing and identifying a single volatile
chemical.

68
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,930
As a result, every combination of an olfactory
neuron and a mitral cell is like a single

69
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,759
note, and the smell coming off of this pizza
triggers countless of those combinations,

70
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,399
forming a delicious musical chord of smells.

71
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:38,419
Now just imagine a piano with thousands of
keys able to produce millions of unique chords,

72
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,759
and you’ll get an idea of how amazing our
noses are.

73
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,649
Scientists estimate that our 40 million different
olfactory receptor neurons help us identify

74
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:48,810
about 10,000 different smells, maybe even
more.

75
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,649
So, once a mitral cell picks up its signal
from an olfactory neuron, it sends it along

76
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:57,149
the olfactory tract to the olfactory cortex
of the brain. From there the pizza-smell hits

77
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:59,120
the brain through two avenues:

78
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,209
One brings the data to the frontal lobe where
they can be consciously identified, like oh,

79
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:07,739
melted mozzarella; while the other pathway
heads straight for your emotional ground control

80
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,259
-- the hypothalamus, amygdala, and other parts
of the limbic system.

81
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:17,019
This emotional pathway is fast, intense, and
quick to trigger memories. If the odor is associated

82
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:21,859
with danger, like the smell of smoke, it quickly activates
your sympathetic system’s fight or flight response.

83
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,280
That’s a big reason that Olivia’s anosmia
was so problematic -- without being able to

84
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,729
smell, she couldn’t access emotional memories
wrapped up in particular scents, or sniff

85
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,450
out dangers in her environment.

86
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,959
And these same intellectual and emotional
dynamics apply to taste, as well. Because

87
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,359
after all, taste is 80 percent smell.

88
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,110
As you chew your food, air is forced up your
nasal passages, so your olfactory receptor

89
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,550
cells are registering information at the same
time as your taste receptors are, so you’re

90
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,780
both smelling and tasting simultaneously.

91
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:52,759
So, it’s true that if you have a bad cold,
or if you just hold your nose, your sense

92
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,759
of taste is impaired. But it’s not like
you can’t taste anything -- it’s just that

93
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,240
more subtle flavors involve more volatile compounds
that are picked up by your olfactory receptors.

94
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,460
So you can hold your nose and taste that something
is sweet, but you wouldn’t be able to pinpoint

95
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,089
it as being carmelized sugar. Likewise, you
can taste that something’s generally sour,

96
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,418
but you can’t tell the difference between
a lemon and a lime.

97
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:15,180
When I read this script I didn’t think it
was going to be so difficult to do this, but

98
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,639
it is very hard and I am getting very hungry
and I would like to get to the part where

99
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,479
I get to eat the pizza!

100
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,980
We are at the point, everyone where I get
to--

101
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,920
So, as soon as I take a bite, all of the sensory
information in there is quickly sorted by

102
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,500
the ten thousand or so taste buds covering
my tongue, mouth, and upper throat.

103
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,699
Most taste buds are packed deep down between
your fungiform papillae -- those little projections

104
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,189
that make your tongue kinda rough. You can
actually see them if you look in the mirror.

105
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,389
Those papillae are not your taste buds.

106
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,408
Speaking of what and where your taste buds really
are, you know what I could go for right about now?

107
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:46,300
A DEBUNKING!

108
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,120
You’re probably familiar with those taste
maps of your tongue from elementary school?

109
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,939
Well un-familiarize yourself, because they
are bogus.

110
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:57,639
Those tongue diagrams date back to the early
1900s, when German scientist D.P. Hanig tried

111
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:02,750
to measure the sensitivity of different areas
for salty, sweet, sour, and bitter. The resulting

112
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,480
map was very subjective -- pretty much just relfecting
what his volunteers felt like they were sensing.

113
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,520
While it’s true that our taste sensations
can be grouped into sweet, salty, sour, bitter,

114
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,819
and the more recently recognized umami, the
notion that our tongues detect these tastes

115
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,979
only in certain areas is just wrong.

116
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,290
By the 1970s research showed that any variations
in sensitivity around the tongue were insignificant,

117
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,699
and that all tastes register in all parts.

118
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,939
You can test this for yourself: put salt on
the tip of your tongue and you can still taste

119
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:31,120
it, even though Hanig’s map says you shouldn’t
be able to.

120
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,319
Now, back to your taste buds.

121
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
They’re actually tucked into tiny pockets
hidden behind the stratified squamous epithelial

122
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
cells on your tongue.

123
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,250
Each bud has 50 to 100 taste receptor epithelial
cells which register and respond to different

124
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,720
molecules in your food.

125
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,840
Notice that these are specialized epithelial
cells, not nervous tissue, so they still have

126
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,159
to synapse to sensory neurons that carry information
about the type and amount of taste back to your brain.

127
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
These epithelial receptor cells come in two
major types -- gustatory -- or the kind that

128
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,379
actually do the tasting, and basal -- the
stem cells that replace the gustatory cells

129
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,929
after you burn them on a lava-hot melty cheesy
Hot Pocket.

130
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:09,299
Basal epithelial cells are extremely dynamic
and replace the gustatory cells every week

131
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,800
or so, which is why even a terribly burned
tongue will feel better in a couple of days.

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,259
Every gustatory cell projects a thread-like
protrusion of the cellular membrane called

133
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:23,978
a gustatory hair, which runs down to a taste
pore, a small hole in the stratified squamous

134
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:26,620
epithelium covering the taste bud and the
rest of the tongue.

135
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,120
In order to taste a bite of pizza, those food
chemicals, or tastants, must dissolve in saliva

136
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,460
so they can diffuse through those taste pores,
and bind to receptors on those gustatory cells,

137
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,080
and then trigger an action potential.

138
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,459
And each tastant is sensed differently.

139
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,868
For example, salty things are full of positively-charged
sodium ions that cause sodium channels in

140
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:49,329
the gustatory cells to open, which generate
a graded potential, and spark an action potential.

141
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:53,599
Meanwhile, sour-tasting acidic foods are high
in hydrogen ions and take a different route

142
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,110
by activating proton channels.

143
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,389
So taste, like all our senses, is all about
how action potentials get triggered.

144
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:03,840
Once an action potential is activated, that
taste message is relayed through neurons via

145
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,209
the seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves
to the taste area of the cerebral cortex,

146
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:12,409
at which point your brain makes sense of it
all, and begins releasing digestive enzymes

147
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:17,689
in your saliva and gastric juices in your stomach to
help you break that food down so you can use it.

148
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,140
So. You know what I learned today?

149
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,039
I learned that it is incredibly hard to spend
ten minutes with a piece of pizza in your

150
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,399
hand, and only be able to take one bite because
you’re talking all the time.

151
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,539
Incredibly hard. So I earned this.

152
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,779
But you learned the anatomy and physiology
of smell, starting with the olfactory sensory

neurons, each of which contains a receptor
for a particular scent signal. After leading

154
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,940
to a glomerulus, these neurons synapse with mitral
cells, which go on to send signals to the brain.

155
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,279
Taste begins with taste receptor epithelial
cells, rather than nervous cells, where tastants

156
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,079
bind to receptors that trigger action potentials to
four different cranial nerves that tell you: PIZZA.
