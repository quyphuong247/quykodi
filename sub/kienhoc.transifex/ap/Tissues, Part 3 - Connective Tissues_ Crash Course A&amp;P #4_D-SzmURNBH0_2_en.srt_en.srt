1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,680
Flo Hyman had always been a tall girl.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,240
I mean... really tall.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,160
By her 12th birthday, she was already six feet,
and by 17 she’d topped out at just over 6’5’’.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,780
Initially self-conscious about her stature,
she learned to use it to her advantage when

5
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:15,158
she started playing volleyball.

6
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:19,260
She attended the University of Houston as
the school’s first female scholarship athlete,

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,800
and at the age of 21, she was competing in
World Championships. Nine years later she

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,320
made it to the 1984 Olympics and helped her
team win the silver medal.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,699
After the Olympics, Hyman moved to Japan where
she gained fame playing professional volleyball.

10
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:36,320
But all of that ended in 1986 when out of
nowhere, she collapsed and died during a game.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,840
She was 31 years old.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
Hyman’s initial cause of death was thought
to be a heart attack, but an autopsy revealed

13
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,280
that she died from a tear in her aorta, caused by an
undiagnosed condition known as Marfan Syndrome.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,060
Marfan Syndrome is a genetic disorder of the
connective tissue. People suffering from it

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,969
have a defect in their connective tissue that
substantially weakens it over time.

16
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:58,689
And you’ve got connective tissue pretty much
everywhere in your body, so it can cause big problems.

17
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:02,769
Outwardly, those with Marfan’s tend to to
be especially tall and thin, like Flo Hyman,

18
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,780
with loose, flexible joints and noticeably
longer limbs and fingers.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,530
Those long fingers and bendy joints have actually
helped some athletes and musicians do things

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,879
that the rest of us can’t -- famous blues guitarist
Robert Johnson, piano virtuoso Sergei Rachmaninov,

21
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:21,099
and Italian violinist Niccolo Paganini are
all believed to have had Marfan Syndrome.

22
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:25,039
But these abilities come at a great cost -- as people
with Marfan’s get older, their weakening

23
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,140
tissue can cause serious problems in the joints,
eyes, lungs, and heart.

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,689
The fact that a single genetic mutation can
affect your bones, cartilage, tendons, blood

25
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,149
vessel walls, and more, shows that all of
those structures are closely related, no matter

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,600
how different they may seem.

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,359
We’ve covered the basic properties of nervous,
muscle, and epithelial tissue, but we haven’t

28
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,599
gotten to the most abundant and diverse of
the four tissue types -- our connective tissue.

29
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,759
This is the stuff that keeps you looking young,
makes up your skeleton, and delivers oxygen

30
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:58,729
and nutrients throughout your body. It’s what
holds you together, in more ways than one.

31
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,400
And if something goes wrong with it, you’re
in for some havoc.

32
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,669
And that means we’re gonna
be talkin’ about Jello today.

33
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:05,149
Uh…we’ll get to that in a minute.

34
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,379
The springiness here? That’s connective
tissue. So is the structure in here, and the

35
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,000
stuff inside here, and the tendons popping
out here

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,199
Connective tissue is pretty much everywhere
in your body, although how much of it shows

37
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,539
up where, varies from organ to organ. For
instance, your skin is mostly connective tissue,

38
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:35,079
while your brain has very little, since it’s
almost all nervous tissue.

39
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,229
You’ve got four main classes of connective
tissue -- proper, or the kind you’d find

40
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:43,869
in your ligaments and supporting your skin,
along with cartilage, bone, and blood.

41
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,650
Whaaaa?

42
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,480
Sounds a little weird, but your bones and
your blood are just types of connective tissue!

43
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,699
So, despite the name, your connective tissues do way
more than just connect your muscles to your bones.

44
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,759
Your fat -- which is a type of proper connective
tissue -- provides insulation and fuel storage

45
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,849
-- whether you like it or not -- but it also
serves structural purposes, like holding your

46
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,259
kidneys in place, and keeping your eyeballs
from popping out of your skull.

47
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:10,979
Your bones, tendons, and cartilage bind, support,
and protect your organs and give you a skeleton

48
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,628
so that you can move with a purpose, instead
of blobbing around like an amoeba.

49
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:18,888
And your blood transports your hormones, nutrients,
and other material all over your body. There’s

50
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,659
no other substance in you that can boast this
kind of diversity.

51
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,780
But if they’re so different, how do we know
that anything is a connective tissue? Well,

52
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,280
all connective tissues have three factors in common
that set them apart from other tissue types.

53
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:35,068
First, they share a common origin: They all
develop from mesenchyme, a loose and fluid

54
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:39,628
type of embryonic tissue. Unlike the cells
that go on to form, say, your epithelium,

55
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:44,929
which are fixed and neatly arranged in sheets,
mesenchymal cells can be situated any-which-way,

56
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:46,709
and can move from place to place.

57
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,560
Connective tissues also have different degrees
of vascularity, or blood flow. Most cartilage

58
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:56,039
is avascular, for example, meaning it has
no blood vessels; while other types of connective

59
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,408
tissue, like the dense irregular tissue in
your skin, is brimming with blood vessels.

60
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:04,840
Finally -- and as strange as it may sound
-- all connective tissues are mostly composed

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,689
of nonliving material, called the extracellular
matrix. While other tissue types are mainly

62
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:14,530
made of living cells packed together, the
inert matrix between connective-tissue cells

63
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,798
is actually more important than what’s inside
the cells.

64
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,238
Basically, your connective tissue, when you
see it up close, looks and acts a lot like this.

65
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,960
Yeah. The most abundant and diverse tissue
in your body, that makes all of your movements

66
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:32,079
and functions possible? Turns out it’s not
that different from the dessert that Aunt

67
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,079
Frances brings to every holiday party.

68
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,279
The jello that gives this confection its structure
is like that extracellular matrix in your

69
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:44,418
connective tissue. The actual cells are just
intermittent little goodies floating around

70
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,579
inside the matrix -- like the little marshmallows.

71
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,128
And although it may not look like it in this
particular edible model, the extracellular

72
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:56,189
matrix is mostly made of two components. The
main part is the ground substance -- a watery,

73
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:01,009
rubbery, unstructured material that fills
in the spaces between cells, and -- like the

74
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,830
gelatin in this dessert -- protects the delicate,
delicious cells from their surroundings.

75
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:09,878
The ground substance is flexible, because
it’s mostly made of big ol’ starch and

76
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,800
protein molecules mixed with water.

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,860
The anchors of this framework are proteins
called proteoglycans. And from each one sprouts

78
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,999
lots and lots of long, starchy strands called
glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs, radiating out

79
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:24,770
from those proteins like brush bristles.

80
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:29,278
These molecules then clump together to form
big tangles that trap water, and if you’ve

81
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:34,158
ever made glue out of flour, you know that
starch, protein and water can make a strong

82
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:35,379
and gooey glue.

83
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:39,059
But running throughout the ground substance
is another important component: fibers, which

84
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:44,279
provide support and structure to the otherwise
shapeless ground substance. And here, too,

85
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,159
are lots of different types.

86
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,219
Collagen is by far the strongest and most
abundant type of fiber. Tough and flexible,

87
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:54,899
it’s essentially a strand of protein, and
stress tests show that it’s actually stronger

88
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,379
than a steel fiber of the same size. It’s
part of what makes your skin look young and

89
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,830
plump, which is why sometimes we inject it
into our faces.

90
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:06,178
In addition, you’ve also got elastic fibers
-- which are longer and thinner, and form

91
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:10,788
a branching framework within the matrix. They’re
made out of the protein elastin which allows

92
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,908
them to stretch and recoil like rubber bands;
they’re found in places like your skin,

93
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,528
lungs, and blood vessel walls.

94
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:22,058
Finally, there are reticular fibers -- short,
finer collagen fibers with an extra coating

95
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:27,059
of glycoprotein. These fibers form delicate,
sponge-like networks that cradle and support

96
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,879
your organs like fuzzy nets.

97
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,689
So, there’s ground substance and fibers
in all connective tissue, but let’s not

98
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,749
forget about the cells themselves.

99
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:39,309
With a tissue as diverse as this, naturally
there are all kinds of connective tissue cells,

100
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:44,349
each with its unique and vital task -- from
building bone to storing energy to keeping

101
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:46,308
you from bleeding to death every time you
get a paper cut.

102
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:51,159
But each of these signature cell types manifests
itself in two different phases: immature and

103
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:56,118
mature. You can recognize the immature cells by
the suffix they all share in their names: -blast.

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,598
“Blast” sounds kinda destructive, but
literally it means “forming” -- these

105
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:05,098
are the stem cells that are still in the process
of dividing to replicate themselves. But each

106
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:10,798
kind of blast cell has a specialized function:
namely, to secrete the ground substances and

107
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,879
fiber that form its unique matrix.

108
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,468
So chondroblasts, for example, are the blast
cells of cartilage. When they build their

109
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:22,480
matrix around them, they’re making the spongy tissue
that forms your nose and ears and cushions your joints.

110
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,240
Likewise, osteoblasts are the blast cells
of bone tissue, and the matrix they lay down

111
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:31,528
is the nexus of calcium carbonate that forms
your bone. Once they’re done forming their

112
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:36,588
matrix, these blast cells transition into
a less active, mature phase. At that point,

113
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:42,399
they trade in -blast for the suffix -cyte.
So an osteoblast in your bone becomes an osteocyte

114
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,839
-- ditto for chondroblasts becoming chondrocytes.

115
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,118
These cyte cells maintain the health of the
matrix built by the blasts, but they can sometimes

116
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:53,649
revert back to their blast state if they need
to repair or generate a new matrix.

117
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:58,119
So, the matrices that these cells create are
pretty much what build you -- they assemble

118
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:02,819
your bone and your cartilage and your tendons
and everything that holds the rest together.

119
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,360
Not bad for a bunch of marshmallows floating
in jello.

120
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,340
BUT! There is another class of connective
tissue cells that are responsible for an equally

121
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:13,968
important role. And that is: protecting you,
from pretty much everything.

122
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,920
These are cells that carry out many of your
body’s immune functions.

123
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,939
I’m talking about macrophages, the big,
hungry guard cells that patrol your connective

124
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:26,100
tissues and eat bacteria, foreign materials,
and even your own dead cells.

125
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,860
And your white blood cells, or leukocytes
that scour your circulatory system fighting

126
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,318
off infection, they’re connective tissue
cells, too.

127
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:36,959
You can see how pervasive and important connective
tissue is in your body. So a condition that

128
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,180
affects this tissue, like Marfan Syndrome,
can really wreak havoc.

129
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,180
One of the best ways of understanding your
body’s structures, after all, is studying

130
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,059
what happens when something goes wrong with
them. In the case of your connective tissue,

131
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,339
Marfan Syndrome affects those fibers we talked
about, that lend structure and support to

132
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,920
the extracellular matrix.

133
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:56,559
Most often, it targets the elastic fibers,
causing weakness in the matrix that’s the

134
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,359
root of many of the condition’s most serious
symptoms.

135
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,039
About 90 percent of the people with the disease
experience problems with the heart and the

136
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,789
aorta -- the biggest and most important artery
in the body. When the elastic fibers around

137
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:12,299
the aorta weaken, they can’t provide the
artery with enough support. So, over time,

138
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,799
the aorta begins to enlarge -- so much so
that it can rupture.

139
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,818
This is probably what happened to Flo Hyman.
She was physically exerting herself, and her

140
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:24,418
artery -- without the support of its connective
tissue -- couldn’t take the stress, and it tore.

141
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:29,259
There's SO MUCH going on with your connective
tissue -- so many variations within their

142
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:33,990
weird diversity -- that we’re going to spend
one last lesson on them next week, exploring

143
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,840
the subtypes that come together to make you
possible.

144
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,060
But you did learn a lot today! You learned
that there are four types of connective tissue

145
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,099
-- proper, cartilage, bone, and blood -- and
that they all develop from mesenchyme, have

146
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,019
different degrees of blood flow, and are mostly
made of extracellular matrix full of ground

147
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:56,278
substance and fibers. We touched on different
blasts, and cyte, and immune cell types, and

148
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:59,458
discussed how Marfan Syndrome can affect connective
tissue.
