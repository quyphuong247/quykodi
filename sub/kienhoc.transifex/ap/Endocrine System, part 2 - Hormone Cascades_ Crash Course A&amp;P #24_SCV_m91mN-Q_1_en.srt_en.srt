1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,100
Got a case study for you - let me tell you
about Marie.

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:06,910
She was a healthy woman in her late 30s. She’d
always been an active person, but at some

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,400
point her energy level just seemed limitless.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,919
She was walking the dog four times a day.
Up at five in the morning emailing her co-workers,

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,320
and at midnight, she was still awake, like
dusting the ceiling fans.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,839
At first she felt great -- she was super productive!

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,349
But soon she started having trouble sleeping.
She felt anxious all the time. She lost a

8
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:25,768
lot of weight and noticed that she felt
hot and sweaty when no one around her

9
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:28,509
did. She started experiencing heart palpitations.

10
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:32,880
Then one day her vision seemed blurry and
when she looked in the mirror, she was kind

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,619
of surprised to find that her eyes were actually
bulging out of their sockets.

12
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,229
So yeah, she finally called a doctor, because,
you know bulging eyeballs.

13
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,659
Marie’s doctor referred her to an endocrinologist,
who, after running some tests, determined

14
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:47,439
that the root of her problems was in her thyroid
gland.

15
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,829
The thyroid is one of the stars of your endocrine
system -- it’s the little butterfly-shaped

16
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,750
structure located anterior to your trachea
and inferior to the larynx, or voicebox.

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,679
It may look cute and unassuming, but don’t
be fooled -- the powerful hormones that it

18
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,680
produces influence some of your most important
physiological processes.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,100
These hormones, and many others, help maintain
your chemical homeostasis -- the balance in

20
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:14,409
concentrations of substances like calcium,
sodium, even water, within very narrow ranges,

21
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,689
so that your body can provide a consistent
internal environment for your cells.

22
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,569
Your cells and the proteins in them need that
stable environment to function, so if your

23
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:27,669
body loses its homeostasis too dramatically,
cellular function will stop, and -- as we

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,370
say here on Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology
-- you will stop being alive.

25
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,630
So your thyroid helps you avoid such a fate,
by secreting hormones that regulate many aspects

26
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:39,629
of your body’s homeostasis -- like body
temperature, skin moisture, and your blood’s

27
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,819
levels of oxygen, calcium, and cholesterol.

28
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,939
It should come as no surprise that, if the
thyroid malfunctions, and produces too much

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,460
or too little of a hormone, it can lead to all
sorts of weird and serious symptoms. And yet,

30
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,519
thyroid disorders -- and the hormonal imbalances
that accompany them -- are pretty common.

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,200
It’s pretty likely that you know at least one person,
most likely a woman, who has experienced

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,350
an issue with a dysfunctional thyroid, and
many more of us are walking around with thyroid

33
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,349
disorders and haven’t even been diagnosed
yet.

34
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,199
In Marie’s case, it turns out that she had
Graves’ disease -- an immune system disorder

35
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,199
that results in the overproduction of thyroid
hormones, or hyperthyroidism.

36
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,079
Although it’s just one type of hormone disorder,
looking at her symptoms can help us understand

37
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,729
just how important, influential, and interconnected
hormones are, and why they need to be properly

38
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,179
balanced to maintain healthy homeostasis.

39
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,480
And I cannot say this enough -- homeostasis
is life.

40
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,520
Last time, we talked about hormone cascades,
and how a lot of the hormone activity that’s

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,350
bubbling along inside of you is the result
of one kind of hormone bossing around the

42
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:47,569
cells that produce another kind of hormone.

43
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,590
These pathways typically start with an internal
stimulus -- often coming from the hypothalamus

44
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,150
or pituitary gland -- and end in the target
glands that release hormones into the blood,

45
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,680
to get the real work of living done.

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,210
We’ve seen how this kind of cascade controls
your body’s stress response, through the

47
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,760
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or HPA
axis: Basically, your brain tells your hypothalamus

48
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,659
to tell your pituitary to light a fire in
your adrenal cortex, and in no time they’ve

49
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:15,280
shut down digestion, released a bunch of energy,
increased your blood pressure, and everything

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,870
else you need to either fight or flee.

51
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,920
And that’s great! Your HPA axis is super-useful
when you’re under stress and need to take action.

52
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,479
But you do not need your adrenal cortex spouting
off all the time.

53
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,040
The truth is, much of the more basic, and
more fundamental, business of everyday life

54
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,349
is carried about by a different kind of cascade.

55
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:37,539
It’s the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid
axis, or HPT axis. And it’s what sets the

56
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:42,539
thyroid gland into motion, so it can regulate
just about everything related to your homeostasis.

57
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:45,979
For example, let’s say you’re caught outside
on a cool day and you’re under-dressed.

58
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:50,269
So let’s say you were on a bus, busily texting
your bestie, and you got off at a stop

59
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,150
while searching for the emoji that most accurately
depicted your reaction to the new Avengers

60
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,480
movie when you realized that you left your
jacket on the seat.

61
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,479
There’s nothing you can do to get your jacket back, but
your hormones can do something about your coldness.

62
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,020
Now, your nervous system of course has its
own ways of detecting and signaling a change

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,790
in temperature, but your endocrine system
gets involved as soon as it senses that the

64
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,769
temperature of your blood has changed.

65
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,400
Your cooler-than-normal blood flows into your
brain’s hypothalamus, where it bumps up

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,970
against temperature-sensitive sensory neurons,
which act like a kind of thermostat.

67
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,730
Once they detect that the temperature is
below target levels, those neurons secrete

68
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,240
thyrotropin-releasinghormone, or TRH into the bloodstream.

69
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,900
TRH is a tropic hormone, which means that
it gets the hormone cascade started by triggering

70
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,489
the release of other hormones.

71
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,970
The cascade starts off with just a trickle,
as TRH goes just a few millimeters to the

72
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,350
anterior pituitary, where it hits receptors
on cells there, causing it to release thyroid-stimulating

73
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,689
hormone, or TSH, into the bloodstream.

74
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:50,180
That then travels down to the thyroid, finds
its receptors, and slaps the gland to attention

75
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,469
so it releases its own special thyroid hormone
into the blood, where it can affect virtually

76
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,090
every cell in your body.

77
00:04:56,089 --> 00:05:00,500
Like steroids, thyroid hormone is lipid-soluble,
so it crosses the membrane of its target cell

78
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,930
to bind inside the nucleus. There, it can
make the cell either increase, decrease, or

79
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,500
maintain its primary function.

80
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,459
In this case, since you’re feeling chilly,
your body needs to stoke the fire a bit. And

81
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,259
it does that by burning glucose.

82
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,240
In your cells, “burning” glucose really
means breaking it down so its component parts

83
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,810
can be used to produce ATP.

84
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,269
Thyroid hormone comes into play when it binds
to receptors inside the nuclei of your muscle

85
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:26,779
cells, triggering the transcription of DNA that
makes the enzymes to break down that glucose.

86
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:30,539
With more of these enzymes flowing around,
more glucose is being broken up, and more

87
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,689
ATP is being produced -- which is all a long way
of describing the process that we call metabolism.

88
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:39,699
But since the thyroid has increased the amount
of chemical reactions going on, it also increased

89
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:44,838
the amount of waste heat that’s being generated.
So this process has a calorigenic, or heat

90
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,000
producing, effect that helps warm you up.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,139
Now, whether or not you’ve happened to forget
your jacket on the bus and found yourself

92
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:54,300
shivering on the way to work, your thyroid
hormone produces all kinds of other effects

93
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,620
as well -- like maintaining your blood pressure,
promoting the growth of tissues, and triggering

94
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,740
the secretion of digestive juices to keep food moving
through your digestive tract, just to name a few.

95
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,000
So, thyroid hormone for the win, right? What’s
not to love?

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Well, what’s important about the whole HTP
axis is not just how it works -- but also

97
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,949
how it knows to turn off.

98
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,500
Your glands need negative feedback in order
to know when their job is done, so they can

99
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,360
stop secreting certain hormones.

100
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,770
That’s where your pituitary and hypothalamus
come in. Remember: They’re always monitoring

101
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:26,709
hormone levels in your blood. If there’s
too much thyroid hormone, they both decrease

102
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:31,529
their own hormone production, to stop stimulating
the thyroid. That in turn reduces thyroid

103
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:35,149
hormone levels in the blood, and slows down
your metabolism again, before you get over-heated.

104
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:37,459
At least, that’s what happens if everything’s
working the way it should.

105
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,889
But there are millions of Maries out there,
plenty of people -- maybe even including you

106
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:47,860
-- who know full well that hormonal imbalances
-- thyroid-related or otherwise -- happen all the time.

107
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,500
Why? Well, thyroid disorders can be caused by
lots of things, but in the case of our Marie,

108
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,060
it’s autoimmune dysfunction.

109
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,800
Normally, when you get sick with a virus or
bacteria or whathaveyou, your immune system

110
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,600
responds by sending out antibodies that target
those invaders.

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,229
Now, we don’t fully understand why yet,
but if you have something like Graves’ disease,

112
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:09,199
your body produces abnormal antibodies that
target the cells of your thyroid gland itself.

113
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,710
And instead of marking those cells for destruction
like antibodies normally do, they do something

114
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:17,680
even more bizarre -- they mimic the hormones
that the pituitary gland sends out, which

115
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,418
bind to the thyroid’s receptors.

116
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:23,430
So, even though the pituitary dials down its
hormone production, in an effort to get the

117
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,759
thyroid to stop, the thyroid does not get the message,
because the receptors are still being activated.

118
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,240
Basically, the gland never receives any negative
feedback, so it just won’t quit.

119
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,350
And if your thyroid doesn’t stop, it’s
hard for you to stop.

120
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,229
So, that’s why Marie was always hot and
sweaty. Her hypothalamus was screaming that

121
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:44,649
she was warm enough, but those antibodies
were hijacking the hormone cascade. And she

122
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,149
was losing weight even though she was eating
all the time, because the thyroid hormone

123
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:50,310
was no longer regulating her metabolism properly.

124
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,490
But what about those big bulging eyes? Remember
those? That was weird.

125
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,650
Well, because they’re part of the immune
response, those disruptive antibodies often

126
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:01,288
cause inflammation, particularly in the tissues
around the eyes. In some cases the swelling

127
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:05,009
can be so severe that the eyes are no longer
able close.

128
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,720
Treatment for Graves’ disease involves either
inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones

129
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:12,649
or blocking their effects -- basically getting
your body chemistry back in order.

130
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:17,048
The moral of this story is that hormones mean
business. And by “business” I mean “living.”

131
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:22,099
And by “living,” what I really mean is
- and everybody say it together now - homeostasis.

132
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,740
In addition to learning to respect your hormones
and thanking them for helping you live, hopefully

133
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,769
today you learned something today about chemical
homeostasis, and took away a greater understanding

134
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:36,819
of hormone cascades. Specifically, we looked at the
hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis, or HPT axis,

135
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,499
and all the ways your body can suffer when that
system, or your hormones in general, get out of whack.
