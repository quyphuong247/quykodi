1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,160
Picture this: You’re getting ready to give
a big presentation in front of, like, a lot

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:07,599
of important people. You’re practicing in
front of your mirror, and then just for a

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,050
second you forget how to speak.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,080
Suddenly, you feel that familiar sting of anxiety,
like an icy hand on the back of your neck.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,839
You look at yourself in that mirror and you
start imagining some of the worst, worst-case

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,140
scenarios. Like, what if you totally lose
your train of thought up there? What if you

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,939
barf? What if everybody gets up and leaves?
Now you’re really nervous. I’m getting

8
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:27,599
freaked out just talking about it.

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,838
So ou start taking quick, shallow breaths,
and you’re feeling light-headed, and seeing

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,780
stars, and now you, my friend, are hyperventilating.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,020
When we talk about respiration, we tend to
focus on oxygen -- and who could blame us?

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,100
It’s easy to forget the equally important
role that carbon dioxide plays in maintaining

13
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,420
homeostasis. Your internal balance between
oxygen and carbon dioxide factors heavily

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,380
into all sorts of stuff -- especially in your
blood, where it can affect your blood’s

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,740
pressure, its pH level, even its temperature.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,500
And now -- at, like, T-minus 5 minutes to
your presentation -- all of those things are

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,100
out of whack, because you’re exhaling more
CO2 than you should.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,340
You’re just about to faint, when a friend
suddenly hands you a paper bag to breathe

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,840
into. And you’ve never been so grateful
for a lunch bag in your life, because, somehow,

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,980
it does the trick.

21
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,839
Within seconds, you’re back to normal.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,299
The drop in CO2 that occurs in your blood
when you hyperventilate is called hypocapnia,

23
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,049
and it signals a breakdown in one of the most
complex and important functions that your

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,920
respiratory system performs.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,899
That is: the exchange of gases inside your
blood cells, where the stuff your body doesn’t

26
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,649
want is swapped out for what it desperately
needs.

27
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,799
This exchange -- between carbon dioxide and
oxygen -- is regulated by a whole series of

28
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,789
biological signals that your blood cells use
to communicate with your tissues, about what

29
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,478
they have, what they want, and what they need
to get rid of.

30
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,358
It’s almost like a code, one that’s written
into your blood’s chemistry, in the folding

31
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:49,118
of its proteins -- even in its temperature
and acidity.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,180
It’s what allows you to perform strenuous
physical tasks, like climbing a mountain.

33
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,180
It’s also what lets you reboot your whole respiratory
system, with nothing more than a paper bag.

34
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,500
I’ll admit it: when we’ve talked about the 
chemistry of your blood so far, we’ve

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,259
tended to keep things pretty simple.

36
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,130
Like, hemoglobin contains four protein chains,
each of which contains an iron atom; since

37
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:22,430
iron binds readily with oxygen, that’s how
hemoglobin transports oxygen around your body.

38
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,260
Ba-da-bing.

39
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:27,439
But the fact is, hemoglobin’s affinity for
oxygen isn’t always the same.

40
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,180
In some places, we want our hemoglobin to
have a high affinity for oxygen, so it can

41
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,659
easily grab it out of the air.
And in others, we want it to have

42
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,599
a low affinity for oxygen oxygen, so it can
dump those molecules to feed our cells.

43
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,359
So how does your hemoglobin know when to collect
its precious cargo and when to let it go?

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,280
Well, a lot of it has to do with a principle
of chemistry known as partial pressure.

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,390
One of the things that fluids always do is
move from areas of high pressure to low pressure.

46
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,659
And molecules also diffuse from areas of high
concentration to areas of low concentration.

47
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:00,560
But when we talk about gases in a mixture, we need
to combine the ideas of pressure and concentration.

48
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,599
See, air is a mixture of molecules. And when
you’re studying the respiratory system,

49
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,639
you often need to focus on the oxygen, which
makes up about 21% of it.

50
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,599
But that doesn’t tell us how many oxygen
molecules there are. For that, we need to

51
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,359
know the overall air pressure, since more
molecules in a certain volume means more pressure.

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,080
So, partial pressure gives us a way of
understanding how much oxygen there is,

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,160
based on the pressure that it’s creating.

54
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,379
Example: The pressure of air at sea level
is about 760 millimeters of mercury. But since

55
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,599
only about 21 percent of that air is oxygen,
oxygen’s part of that pressure -- or partial

56
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,259
pressure of oxygen -- is 21% of 760, or about
160 millimeters of mercury.

57
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,019
Now, that’s just outside, at sea level.

58
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,140
When that air mixes with the air deep in your
lungs -- including a lot of air that you haven’t

59
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,199
exhaled yet -- the partial pressure of oxygen
drops to about 104 millimeters of mercury.

60
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,909
And in the blood that’s entering your lungs
-- after most of its oxygen has been stripped

61
00:03:54,909 --> 00:04:00,229
away by your hungry muscles and neurons -- the
oxygen partial pressure is only about 40 millimeters.

62
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:06,019
This big differences in pressure make it easy for
oxygen molecules to travel from the outside air into

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:12,120
your blood plasma, because, as a rule dissolved gases
always diffuse down their partial pressure gradients.

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,680
This is why it’s so much harder to breathe
at higher altitudes. When you climb a mountain,

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,180
the concentration of oxygen stays at about 21%.
But the pressure gets lower, which means the

66
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,680
partial pressure of oxygen also decreases to about
45 millimeters of mercury at the top of Mt. Everest.

67
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,459
So the partial pressure of oxygen at the top
of the highest peak in the world, is almost

68
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,910
the same as the de-oxygenated blood that’s
entering your lungs.

69
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,850
So basically there is no partial pressure
gradient, which makes it really hard to get

70
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,939
oxygen into your blood. But, let’s get back
to the red blood cells.

71
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:45,360
Remember that the globin in your hemoglobin
is a protein -- and when proteins bind to

72
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,769
stuff, they tend to change shape. And that
shape-change can make the protein more or

73
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,139
less likely to bind to other stuff.

74
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,060
When an empty hemoglobin runs into an oxygen
molecule, things are a little awkward.

75
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:58,689
It’s like a first date -- bonding isn’t
so easy.

76
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:03,370
But once they finally bind, hemoglobin suddenly
changes shape, which makes it easier for other

77
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,090
oxygen molecules to attach, like friends gathering
around the lunch table.

78
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:12,149
That affinity for joining in -- or cooperativity,
as it’s known -- continues until all four

79
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:15,250
binding sites are taken, and the molecule
is fully saturated.

80
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:21,649
Now your hemoglobin is known as oxyhemoglobin,
or HbO2. It is not...not why the cable network

81
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:24,659
is called that. That’s the “Home Box Office.”
Anyway.

82
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,920
By the time the blood leaves the lungs, each
hemoglobin is fully saturated, the oxygen

83
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,290
partial pressure in your plasma is about 100
millimeters, and now it is ready to be delivered

84
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,990
to where it is needed most.

85
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,160
Active tissues, like the brain, heart, and
muscles, are always hungry for oxygen. They

86
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:43,918
burn through it quickly, lowering the oxygen
partial pressure around them to about 40 millimeters.

87
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,649
So when the blood arrives on the scene, oxygen
moves down the gradient from the plasma to

88
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,709
the tissues, to feed those hungry cells.

89
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:53,659
That makes the oxygen partial pressure in
your plasma drop, so your hemoglobin starts

90
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,060
to give up more of its oxygen to the plasma.

91
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,040
BUT! Partial pressures are only part of what’s
prodding your hemoglobin to give up the goods.

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,200
All of that metabolic activity going on in
your tissues is also producing other triggers,

93
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,659
in the form of waste products -- specifically
heat and CO2.

94
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,400
Both of those things activate the release of more
oxygen, by lowering hemoglobin’s affinity for it.

95
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,859
Say you’re climbing that mountain again,
and your thighs are feeling the burn. Red

96
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,160
blood cells saturated with oxygen are going
to the muscle tissue in your quads, where

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,160
the hemoglobin can dump a bunch of O2, because of
the lower partial pressures of oxygen in your muscles.

98
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:31,560
But a hard-working quad will also heat up
the surrounding tissues, and that rise in

99
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,500
temperature changes the shape of hemoglobin -- and
it does it in such a way that lowers its affinity for O2.

100
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,759
So when those red blood cells hit that warm
active tissue, they release even more oxygen

101
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,480
-- like 20 percent more -- beyond what partial
pressures would trigger.

102
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,340
But wait! There’s more!

103
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,039
Carbon dioxide triggers the release of oxygen,
too, because it also binds to the hemoglobin,

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,819
changing its shape again, lowering its affinity
for oxygen still more. And as oxygen jumps

105
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,379
ship, the hemoglobin can pick up more CO2.

106
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:02,740
Finally, JUST IN CASE the hemoglobin isn’t
getting the message at this point, there’s

107
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,180
one more trigger that your respiratory system
has up its sleeve. The spike in CO2 that’s

108
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,500
released by your active muscle tissues
actually makes your blood more acidic.

109
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,050
Since your blood is mostly water, when CO2
dissolves in it, it forms carbonic acid, which

110
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,290
breaks down into bicarbonate and hydrogen
ions. Those ions bind to the hemoglobin, changing

111
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,169
its shape yet again, further lowering its
affinity for oxygen.

112
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:28,478
So now, at last, your tissues have the oxygen
they need, and your red blood cells are stuck

113
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:30,909
with all this CO2 that they need to get rid of.

114
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,280
Your red blood cells ride the vein-train
back to the lungs,

115
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,299
where they encounter a new wave
of freshly inhaled oxygen.

116
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,120
And when that O2 binds to the hemoglobin -- which,
again, is hard at first -- it eventually changes

117
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,019
its shape back to the way it was when we started,
which decreases its affinity for CO2.

118
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,560
So the hemoglobin drops its carbon dioxide,
which moves down its partial pressure gradient

119
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,480
into the air of your lungs, so you can exhale it,
and the whole thing can start all over again.

120
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,600
Now if that isn’t enough to make you hyperventilate,
I’m not sure what is.

121
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,860
But this brings us back to that unfortunate
episode you had before your big presentation.

122
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,040
This whole complex code of chemical signals
that I just described? Well, it assumes that

123
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,860
what your cells and tissues are telling each
other is actually true.

124
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,100
But as we all know, sometimes our bodies don’t
mean what they say. Thanks, body.

125
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,900
Like, when you’re freaking out about your
presentation, your sympathetic nervous system

126
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,000
makes your heart race and your breathing increase,
to prepare you to fight or flee.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,319
The problem is: there’s nothing to actually
fight or flee from, so your muscles aren’t

128
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,349
actually doing anything, so they’re not using
all the extra oxygen you’re breathing  in.

129
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,269
And they also aren't producing the extra CO2 that
you're suddenly exhaling all over the place.

130
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:39,240
So when you start to exhale CO2 faster than
your cells release it, its concentration in

131
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,889
your blood drops. And with less carbonic acid
around, your blood’s pH starts to rise.

132
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,769
And you know what else? While low blood pH
does things like change the shape of your

133
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,980
hemoglobin to deliver oxygen, high pH causes
vasoconstriction.

134
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,320
Normally, this is supposed to divert blood
from the parts you’re not using during times

135
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,460
of stress, like your digestive organs, to
the parts that you are using.

136
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,399
But when you hyperventilate, this constriction
happens everywhere, which means less blood

137
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,070
is delivered to your brain, which makes you
light-headed.

138
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,320
Luckily, that trick with the breathing into
the paper bag -- it really does work.

139
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,680
It works because it lets you breathe back
in all of the CO2 you just breathed out. So

140
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:17,000
the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in
the bag is higher, which forces that CO2 into

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,350
your blood, which lowers its pH, and you get
back to homeostasis.

142
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:26,279
And of course, homeostasis is the key to life...and
you know, also to a successful presentation.

143
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,839
If you were able to remain calm today, you
learned how your blood cells exchange oxygen

144
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,509
and CO2 to maintain homeostasis. We talked
about partial pressure gradients, and how

145
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:40,120
they, along with changes in blood temperature,
acidity, and CO2 concentrations, change how

146
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,639
hemoglobin binds to gases in your blood. And
you learned how the thing with the bag works.

147
